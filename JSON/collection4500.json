The availability of genomes in the public domain following the epidemic provides a unique opportunity to understand the evolution and spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus across the globe. The availability of whole genomes from multiple states in India prompted us to analyse the phylogenetic clusters of genomes in India. We performed whole-genome sequencing for 64 genomes making a total of 361 genomes from India, followed by phylogenetic clustering, substitution analysis, and dating of the different phylogenetic clusters of viral genomes. We describe a distinct phylogenetic cluster (Clade I \/ A3i) of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from India, which encompasses 41% of all genomes sequenced and deposited in the public domain from multiple states in India. Globally 3.5% of genomes, which till date could not be mapped to any distinct known cluster fall in this newly defined clade. The cluster is characterized by a core set of shared genetic variants - C6312A (T2016K), C13730T (A88V\/A97V), C23929T, and C28311T (P13L). Further, the cluster is also characterized by a nucleotide substitution rate of 1.4 x 10-3 variants per site per year, lower than the prevalent A2a cluster, and predominantly driven by variants in the E and N genes and relative sparing of the S gene. Epidemiological assessments suggest that the common ancestor emerged in the month of February 2020 and possibly resulted in an outbreak followed by countrywide spread, as evidenced by the low divergence of the genomes from across the country. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study characterizing the distinct and predominant cluster of SARS-CoV-2 in India.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sofia Banu","author_inst":"CSIR Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Bani Jolly","author_inst":"CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology"},{"author_name":"Payel Mukherjee","author_inst":"CSIR Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Priya Singh","author_inst":"CSIR Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Shagufta Khan","author_inst":"CSIR Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Lamuk Zaveri","author_inst":"CSIR Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Sakshi Shambhavi","author_inst":"CSIR Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Namami Gaur","author_inst":"CSIR Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Rakesh K Mishra","author_inst":"CSIR Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Vinod Scaria","author_inst":"CSIR Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology"},{"author_name":"Divya Tej Sowpati","author_inst":"CSIR Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.30.125856","rel_title":"Sofosbuvir protects human brain organoids against SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-05-31","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.30.125856","rel_abs":"COVID-19 was rapidly declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, only three months after the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China.

We used routine surveillance data from Portugal to identify risk factors for COVID-19 outcomes, in order to support risk stratification, clinical and public health interventions, and to improve scenarios to plan health care resources. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study including 20,293 laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Portugal to 28 April 2020, electronically through the National Epidemic Surveillance System of the Directorate-General of Health(DGS). We calculated absolute risks, relative risks (RR) and adjusted relative risks (aRR) to identify demographic and clinical factors associated with hospitalization, admission to ICU and death using Poisson regressions. Results Increasing age after 60 years was the greatest determinant for all outcomes. Assuming 0-50 years as reference, being aged 80-89 years was the strongest determinant of hospital admission (aRR-5.7), 70-79 years for ICU(aRR-10.4) and >90 years for death(aRR-226.8) with an aRR of 112.7 in those 70-79 . Among comorbidites, Immunodeficiency, cardiac disease, kidney disease, and neurologic disease were independent risk factors for hospitalization (aRR 1.83, 1.79, 1.56, 1.82), for ICU these were cardiac, Immunodeficiency, kidney and lung disease (aRR 4.33, 2.76, 2.43, 2.04), and for death they were kidney, cardiac and chronic neurological disease (aRR: 2.9, 2.6, 2.0) Male gender was a risk factor for all outcomes. There were statistically significant differences for the 3 outcomes between regions. Discussion and Conclusions Older age stands out as the strongest risk factor for all outcomes specially for death as absolute is risk was small for those younger than 50. These findings have implications in terms of risk stratified public health measures that should prioritize protecting older people. Epidemiologic scenarios and clinical guidelines may consider the estimated risks, even though under-ascertainment of mild and asymptomatic cases should be considered in different age groups.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vasco Ricoca Peixoto","author_inst":"National School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Andre Vieira","author_inst":"NOVA National School of Public Health, Public Health Research Centre, Universidade NOVA de Lisboa, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Pedro Aguiar","author_inst":"NOVA National School of Public Health, Public Health Research Centre, Universidade NOVA de Lisboa, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Paulo Sousa","author_inst":"NOVA National School of Public Health, Public Health Research Centre, Universidade NOVA de Lisboa, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Carlos Carvalho","author_inst":"NOVA National School of Public Health, Public Health Research Centre, Universidade NOVA de Lisboa, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Daniel Rhys Thomas","author_inst":"Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre, Public Health Wales, Cardiff, UK"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Abrantes","author_inst":"NOVA National School of Public Health, Public Health Research Centre, Universidade NOVA de Lisboa, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Carla Nunes","author_inst":"NOVA National School of Public Health, Public Health Research Centre, Universidade NOVA de Lisboa, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Alysson Muotri","author_inst":"UCSD"},{"author_name":"Vinod Scaria","author_inst":"CSIR Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology"},{"author_name":"Divya Tej Sowpati","author_inst":"CSIR Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.28.20115899","rel_title":"Disparities in Vulnerability to Severe Complications from COVID-19 in the United States","rel_date":"2020-05-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.28.20115899","rel_abs":"This paper provides the first nationally representative estimates of vulnerability to severe complications from COVID-19 overall and across race-ethnicity and socioeconomic status. We use the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) to examine the prevalence of specific health conditions associated with complications from COVID-19 and to calculate, for each individual, an index of the risk of severe complications from respiratory infections developed by DeCaprio et al. (2020). We show large disparities across race-ethnicity and socioeconomic status in the prevalence of conditions which are associated with the risk of severe complications from COVID-19. Moreover, we show that these disparities emerge early in life, prior to age 65, leading to higher vulnerability to such complications. While vulnerability is highest among older adults regardless of their race-ethnicity or socioeconomic status, our results suggest particular attention should also be given to the risk of adverse outcomes in midlife for non-Hispanic Blacks, adults with a high school degree or less, and low-income Americans.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emily E.

Frequently, NPIs are implemented with an intensity quantified in an ad hoc manner. Control theory offers a worthwhile tool for determining the optimal intensity of the NPIs in order to avoid the collapse of the healthcare system while keeping them as low as possible, yielding in a policymakers concrete guidance.

However, such models leave a scale-gap between the spatial resolution of actionable information (i.e. the county or city level) and that of modeled viral spread. States and nations are not spatially homogeneous and different areas may vary in disease risk and severity. For example, COVID-19 has age-stratified risk. Similarly, ICU units, PPE and other vital equipment are not equally distributed within states. Here, we implement a county-level epidemiological framework to assess and forecast COVID-19 spread through Georgia, where 1,933 people have died from COVID-19 and 44,638 cases have been documented as of May 27, 2020. We find that county-level forecasts trained on heterogeneity due to clustered events can continue to predict epidemic spread over multi-week periods, potentially serving efforts to prepare medical resources, manage supply chains, and develop targeted public health interventions. We find that the premature removal of physical (social) distancing could lead to rapid increases in cases or the emergence of sustained plateaus of elevated fatalities.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stephen J Beckett","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Marian Dominguez-Mirazo","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Seolha Lee","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Clio Andris","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Joshua S Weitz","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Judith A.

Here we investigate the spatial distribution and spreading patterns of COVID-19 in the SSP by mapping the spatial autocorrelation and the clustering patterns of the virus in relation to the population density and the number of hospital beds. Moran's I and LISA clustering analysis indicated that Sao Paulo City is a significant hotspot for both the confirmed cases and deaths, whereas other cities across the State could be considered colder spots. Bivariate Moran's I also showed that the population density is a key indicator for the number of deaths, whereas the number of hospital beds is less related, implying that the fatality depends substantially on the actual patient's condition. Social isolation measures throughout the SSP have been gradually increasing since early March, an action that helped to slow down the emergence of the new confirmed cases, highlighting the importance of the safe-distancing measures in mitigating the local transmission within and between cities in the SSP.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Enner Alcantara","author_inst":"Sao Paulo State University"},{"author_name":"Jose Mantovani","author_inst":"Sao Paulo State University"},{"author_name":"Luiz Rotta","author_inst":"Sao Paulo State University"},{"author_name":"Edward Park","author_inst":"Nanyang Technological University"},{"author_name":"Thanan Rodrigues","author_inst":"Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Para State"},{"author_name":"Fernando Carvalho","author_inst":"Sao Paulo State University"},{"author_name":"Carlos Souza Filho","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Carla Nunes","author_inst":"NOVA National School of Public Health, Public Health Research Centre, Universidade NOVA de Lisboa, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Alysson Muotri","author_inst":"UCSD"},{"author_name":"Vinod Scaria","author_inst":"CSIR Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology"},{"author_name":"Divya Tej Sowpati","author_inst":"CSIR Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.28.20115790","rel_title":"CoViD-19 in Italy: a mathematical model to analyze the epidemic containment strategy and the economic impacts","rel_date":"2020-05-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.28.20115790","rel_abs":"The objective of this paper is to evaluate the potential costs deriving from the adoption of the CoViD-19 epidemic management strategy.

Interest exits concerning the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) in patients with Covid-19 disease. Objectives. To perform a systematic review on mortality associated to the use of ACEi in patients with Covid 19 disease. Methods. Search in Medline (PubMed), in ISI Web of Knowledge and in medRxiv database; use of other sources. Results. A total of 33 articles were evaluated. Concerning the papers used to produce the meta-analyses, seven studies were selected, five of which were used. These five studies involved a total number of 944 patients treated with ACEi and 5173 not treated with ACEi. Increased mortality was seen in association to the use of ACEi in the context of Covid-19 disease (ACEi users versus non-users; odds ratio, 1.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 2.15; P=0.04). When compared to mortality in patients treated with angiotensin receptor blockers, mortality of patients treated with ACEi was not significantly different (odds ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76 to 1.21; P=0.74). Concerning the remaining reports, different types of data adjustments were used by several authors, after which increased mortality was not seen in association to the use of ACEi in this context. Conclusions. ACEi use could act as a marker of increased mortality risk in some but not all Covid-19 disease settings. The data now presented do not prove a causal relation but argue in favor of carrying out clinical trials studying ACEi in Covid-19 patients, in order to establish the safety of ACEi use in this context.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jose Pedro L.

Here, we designed and expressed over 100 structure-guided spike variants based upon a previously determined cryo-EM structure of the prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike. Biochemical, biophysical and structural characterization of these variants identified numerous individual substitutions that increased protein yields and stability. The best variant, HexaPro, has six beneficial proline substitutions leading to [~]10-fold higher expression than its parental construct and is able to withstand heat stress, storage at room temperature, and multiple freeze-thaws. A 3.2 [A]-resolution cryo-EM structure of HexaPro confirmed that it retains the prefusion spike conformation. High-yield production of a stabilized prefusion spike protein will accelerate the development of vaccines and serological diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ching-Lin Hsieh","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Jory A Goldsmith","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey M Schaub","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Andrea M DiVenere","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Hung-Che Kuo","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Kamyab Javanmardi","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Kevin C Le","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Daniel Wrapp","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Alison Gene-Wei Lee","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Yutong Liu","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Chia-Wei Chou","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Patrick O Byrne","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Christy K Hjorth","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Nicole V Johnson","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"John Ludes-Meyers","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Annalee W Nguyen","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Juyeon Park","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Nianshuang Wang","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Amengor Dzifa","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Jennifier A Maynard","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Ilya J Finkelstein","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Jason S McLellan","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.29.124776","rel_title":"Validation and Performance Comparison of Three SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Assays","rel_date":"2020-05-30","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.29.124776","rel_abs":"Serology testing of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is increasingly being used during the current pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The clinical and epidemiologic utilities of antibody-based SARS-CoV-2 testing are under debate. Characterizing these assays helps to understand the disease and provides scientific basis for deciding how to best use these assays. The study assessed one chemiluminescent assay (Abbott COVID-2 IgG) and two lateral flow assays (STANDARD Q [SQ] IgM\/IgG Duo and Wondfo Total Antibody Test). Validation included 113 blood samples from 71 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients and 1182 samples from negative controls with potential interferences\/cross-reactions, including 1063 pre-pandemic samples. IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected as early as post-symptom onset days 3-4. IgG antibodies were first detected post-onset days 5-6 by SQ assays. The detection rates increased gradually, and SQ IgG, Abbott IgG and Wondfo Total detected antibodies from all the PCR-confirmed patients 14 days after symptom onset. Overall agreements between SQ IgM\/IgG and Wondfo Total was 88.5% and between SQ IgG and Abbott IgG was 94.6% (Kappa = 0.75, 0.89). No cross-reaction with other endemic coronavirus infections were identified. Viral hepatitis and autoimmune samples were the main cross-reactions observed. However, the interferences\/cross-reactions were low. The specificities were 100% for SQ IgG and Wondfo Total and 99.62% for Abbott IgG and 98.87% for SQ IgM. These findings demonstrate high sensitivity and specificity of appropriately validated antibody-based SARS-CoV-2 assays with implications for clinical use and epidemiological seroprevalence studies.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shaolei Lu","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Kimberly J Paiva","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Ricky D Grisson","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Philip A Chan","author_inst":"Rhode Island Department of Health"},{"author_name":"John Lonks","author_inst":"The Miriam Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ewa King","author_inst":"Rhode Island Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Richard C Huard","author_inst":"Rhode Island Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Diane L Pytel-Parenteau","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Ga Hie Nam","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Evgeny Yakirevich","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Chia-Wei Chou","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Patrick O Byrne","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Christy K Hjorth","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Nicole V Johnson","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"John Ludes-Meyers","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Annalee W Nguyen","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Juyeon Park","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Nianshuang Wang","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Amengor Dzifa","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Jennifier A Maynard","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Ilya J Finkelstein","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Jason S McLellan","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"pathology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.30.20117614","rel_title":"Assessing the quality, readability and reliability of online information on COVID-19: aninfoveillance observational study","rel_date":"2020-05-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.30.20117614","rel_abs":"Objective: This study aimed to assess the quality, reliability and readability of internet-based information on COVID-19 available on Brazil most used search engines.

There are preliminary studies correlating qRT-PCR results from different materials to clinical outcomes, yet, comparability is limited due to the plethora of different assays used for diagnostics. In this study we evaluate clinical performance and linear range for the SARS-CoV-2 IVD (cobas6800\/8800 system, a fully automated sample-to-result platform) in different clinically relevant matrix materials outside official specifications. Methods: Assay performance was assessed in human plasma, BAL\/BL and transport medium following chemical inactivation. For analytical evaluation, respective matrix materials were spiked with SARS-CoV-2 RNA in ten-fold dilution series. The efficacy of chemical inactivation by guanidine hydrochloride solution was confirmed in cell culture infectivity experiments. For correlation, a total of 235 predetermined clinical samples including respiratory swabs, plasma and BAL\/BL were subjected to the SARS-CoV-2 IVD test and results were compared. Results: The SARS-CoV-2 IVD showed excellent linearity over five to seven log steps depending on matrix material. Chemical inactivation resulted in a reduction in plaque forming units of at least 3.5 log steps, while having no significant impact on assay performance. Inter-run consistency from three different testing sites demonstrated excellent comparability of RT-PCR results (maximum deviation was 1.53 CT). Clinical evaluation for respiratory swabs showed very good agreement with the comparator assay (Positive agreement 95.7%, negative agreement 98.9%). Conclusion: The SARS-CoV-2 IVD test for the cobas6800\/8800 systems offers excellent linear range and inter-run consistency for quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in different matrices outside official specifications.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dominik N\u00f6rz","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Institute of Medical Microbiology, Virology and Hygiene"},{"author_name":"Andr\u00e9 Frontzek","author_inst":"Labor Stein, Moenchengladbach, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ulrich Eigner","author_inst":"Labor Limbach, Heidelberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Lisa Oestereich","author_inst":"Bernhard Nocht Institute, Leibniz Institute for Tropical Medicine, Hamburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Nicole Fischer","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Institute of Medical Microbiology, Virology and Hygiene"},{"author_name":"Martin Aepfelbacher","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Institute of Medical Microbiology, Virology and Hygiene"},{"author_name":"Susanne Pfefferle","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Institute of Medical Microbiology, Virology and Hygiene"},{"author_name":"Marc L\u00fctgehetmann","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Institute of Medical Microbiology, Virology and Hygiene"},{"author_name":"Ga Hie Nam","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Evgeny Yakirevich","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Chia-Wei Chou","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Patrick O Byrne","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Christy K Hjorth","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Nicole V Johnson","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"John Ludes-Meyers","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Annalee W Nguyen","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Juyeon Park","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Nianshuang Wang","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Amengor Dzifa","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Jennifier A Maynard","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Ilya J Finkelstein","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Jason S McLellan","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.28.20115758","rel_title":"An inflammatory cytokine signature helps predict COVID-19 severity and death","rel_date":"2020-05-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.28.20115758","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to more than 100,000 deaths in the United States. Several studies have revealed that the hyper-inflammatory response induced by SARS-CoV-2 is a major cause of disease severity and death in infected patients. However, predictive biomarkers of pathogenic inflammation to help guide targetable immune pathways are critically lacking. We implemented a rapid multiplex cytokine assay to measure serum IL-6, IL-8, TNF-, and IL-1{beta} in hospitalized COVID-19 patients upon admission to the Mount Sinai Health System in New York. Patients (n=1484) were followed up to 41 days (median 8 days) and clinical information, laboratory test results and patient outcomes were collected. In 244 patients, cytokine measurements were repeated over time, and effect of drugs could be assessed. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to compare survival by cytokine strata, followed by Cox regression models to evaluate the independent predictive value of baseline cytokines. We found that high serum IL-6, IL-8, and TNF- levels at the time of hospitalization were strong and independent predictors of patient survival. Importantly, when adjusting for disease severity score, common laboratory inflammation markers, hypoxia and other vitals, demographics, and a range of comorbidities, IL-6 and TNF- serum levels remained independent and significant predictors of disease severity and death. We propose that serum IL-6 and TNF- levels should be considered in the management and treatment of COVID-19 patients to stratify prospective clinical trials, guide resource allocation and inform therapeutic options. We also propose that patients with high IL-6 and TNF- levels should be assessed for combinatorial blockade of pathogenic inflammation in this disease.","rel_num_authors":31,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Diane Marie Del Valle","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Seunghee Kim-schulze","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Huang Hsin-hui","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Noam D Beckmann","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sharon Nirenberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Bo Wang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Yonit Lavin","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Talia Swartz","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Deepu Madduri","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Aryeh Stock","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Thomas Marron","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Hui Xie","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Manish Kumar Patel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Oliver van Oekelen","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Adeeb Rahman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Patricia Kovatch","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Judith Aberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Eric Schadt","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sundar Jagannath","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Madhu Mazumdar","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alexander Charney","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Firpo-Betancourt","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Damodara Rao Mendu","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Jhang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"David Reich","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Keith Sigel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Carlos Cordon-Cardo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Marc Feldmann","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Samir Parekh","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Miriam Merad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sacha Gnjatic","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.28.20115691","rel_title":"Intensive COVID-19 testing associated with reduced mortality - an ecological analysis of 108 countries","rel_date":"2020-05-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.28.20115691","rel_abs":"Background Intensive screening and testing for COVID-19 could facilitate early detection and isolation of infected persons and thereby control the size of the epidemic.

Results The COVID-19 mortality rate varied between 0.3 and 3110 deaths\/100 000 inhabitants (median 30, IQR 8-105). The intensity of testing per 100 000 also varied considerably (median 21,970, IQR 2,735-89,095) as did the number of COVID-19 cases per 100 000 (median 1,600, IQR 340-4,760 cases\/100 000).

We developed a compartmental model for SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Switzerland and projected the course of the epidemic until the end of year 2020 under various scenarios. The model was age-structured with three categories, children (0-17), adults (18-64) and seniors (65- years). Lifting all restrictions according to the plans disclosed by the Swiss federal authorities by mid-May resulted in a rapid rebound in the epidemic, with the peak expected in July. Measures equivalent to at least 90% reduction in all contacts were able to eradicate the epidemic; 56% reduction in contacts could keep the intensive care unit occupancy under the critical level, and delay the next wave until October. Scenarios where strong contact reductions were only applied in selected age groups could not suppress the epidemic, increasing the risk of a next wave in July, and another stronger wave in September. Future interventions need to cover all age groups to keep the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic under control.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Janne Estill","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Plamenna Venkova-Marchevska","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Maroussia Roelens","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Erol Orel","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Alexander Temerev","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Antoine Flahault","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Olivia Keiser","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Talia Swartz","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Deepu Madduri","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Aryeh Stock","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Thomas Marron","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Hui Xie","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Manish Kumar Patel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Oliver van Oekelen","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Adeeb Rahman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Patricia Kovatch","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Judith Aberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Eric Schadt","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sundar Jagannath","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Madhu Mazumdar","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alexander Charney","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Firpo-Betancourt","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Damodara Rao Mendu","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Jhang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"David Reich","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Keith Sigel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Carlos Cordon-Cardo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Marc Feldmann","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Samir Parekh","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Miriam Merad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sacha Gnjatic","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.28.20115667","rel_title":"Targeted Immunosuppression Distinguishes COVID-19 from Influenza in Moderate and Severe Disease","rel_date":"2020-05-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.28.20115667","rel_abs":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by a high incidence of acute respiratory failure. The underlying immunopathology of that failure and how it compares to other causes of severe respiratory distress, such as influenza virus infection, are not fully understood. Here we addressed this by developing a prospective observational cohort of COVID-19 and influenza subjects with varying degrees of disease severity and assessing the quality and magnitude of their immune responses at the cellular and protein level. Additionally, we performed single-cell RNA transcriptional profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from select subjects. The cohort consists of 79 COVID-19 subjects, 26 influenza subjects, and 15 control subjects, including 35 COVID-19 and 7 influenza subjects with acute respiratory failure. While COVID-19 subjects exhibited largely equivalent or greater activated lymphocyte counts compared to influenza subjects, they had fewer monocytes and lower surface HLA-class II expression on monocytes compared to influenza subjects and controls. At least two distinct immune profiles were observed by cytokine levels in severe COVID-19 patients: 3 of 71 patients were characterized by extreme inflammation, with greater than or equal to ~50% of the 35 cytokines measured greater than 2 standard deviations from the mean level of other severe patients (both influenza and COVID-19); the other immune profile, which characterized 68 of 71 subjects, had a mixed inflammatory signature, where 28 of 35 cytokines in COVID-19 patients had lower mean cytokine levels, though not all were statistically significant. Only 2 cytokines were higher in COVID-19 subjects compared to influenza subjects (IL-6 and IL-8). Influenza and COVID-19 patients could be distinguished statistically based on cytokine module expression, particularly after controlling for the significant effects of age on cytokine expression, but again with lower levels of most cytokines in COVID-19 subjects. Further, high circulating levels of IL-1RA and IL-6 were associated with increased odds of intubation in the combined influenza and COVID-19 cohort [OR = 3.93 and 4.30, respectively] as well as among only COVID-19 patients. Single cell transcriptional profiling of COVID-19 and influenza subjects with respiratory failure identified profound suppression in type I and type II interferon signaling in COVID-19 patients across multiple clusters. In contrast, COVID-19 cell clusters were enriched for alterations in metabolic, stress, and apoptotic pathways. These alterations were consistent with an increased glucocorticoid response in COVID-19 patients compared to influenza. When considered across the spectrum of innate and adaptive immune profiles, the immune pathologies underlying severe influenza and COVID-19 are substantially distinct. The majority of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure do not have a cytokine storm phenotype but instead exhibit profound type I and type II IFN immunosuppression when compared to patients with acute influenza. Upregulation of a small number of inflammatory mediators, including IL-6, predicts acute respiratory failure in both COVID-19 and influenza patients.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Philip A Mudd","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Chase Crawford","author_inst":"St. Jude Children's Research Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jackson S Turner","author_inst":"Washington University in Saint Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Aisha Souquette","author_inst":"St. Jude Children's Research Hospital"},{"author_name":"Daniel Reynolds","author_inst":"Washington University in Saint Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Diane Bender","author_inst":"Washington University in Saint Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James P.

Methods: In 2020, we developed a computational model of the U.S. simulating the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus and vaccination. Results: Simulation experiments revealed that when vaccine efficacy exceeded 70%, coverage exceeded 60%, and vaccination occurred on day 1, the attack rate dropped to 22% with daily cases not exceeding 3.2 million (reproductive rate, R0, 2.5). When R0 was 3.5, the attack rate dropped to 41% with daily cases not exceeding 14.4 million. Increasing coverage to 75% when vaccination occurred by day 90 resulted in 5% attack rate and daily cases not exceeding 258,029when R0 was 2.5 and a 26% attack rate and maximum daily cases of 22.6 million when R0 was 3.5. When vaccination did not occur until day 180, coverage (i.e., those vaccinated plus those otherwise immune) had to reach 100%. A vaccine with an efficacy between 40% and 70% could still obviate the need for other measures under certain circumstances such as much higher, and in some cases, potentially unachievable, vaccination coverages. Conclusion: Our study found that to either prevent or largely extinguish an epidemic without any other measures (e.g., social distancing), the vaccine has to have an efficacy of at least 70%.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sarah M Bartsch","author_inst":"Public Health Informatics, Computational, and Operations Research (PHICOR), CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy,"},{"author_name":"Kelly J O'Shea","author_inst":"Public Health Informatics, Computational, and Operations Research (PHICOR), CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy,"},{"author_name":"Marie C Ferguson","author_inst":"Public Health Informatics, Computational, and Operations Research (PHICOR), CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy,"},{"author_name":"Maria-Elena Bottazzi","author_inst":"National School of Tropical Medicine and Departments of Pediatrics and Molecular Virology & Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sarah N Cox","author_inst":"Public Health Informatics, Computational, and Operations Research (PHICOR), CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy,"},{"author_name":"Ulrich Strych","author_inst":"National School of Tropical Medicine and Departments of Pediatrics and Molecular Virology & Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James A McKinnell","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Clinical Outcomes Research Unit (ID-CORE), Lundquist Institute, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Patrick T.

It allows robust and rapid response under safe and easy conditions for healthcare workers and patients. EasyCov test was assessed under double blind clinical conditions (93 asymptomatic healthcare worker volonteers, 10 actively infected patients, 20 former infected patients tested during late control visit). EasyCov results were compared with classical laboratory RT-PCR performed on nasopharyngeal samples. Our results show that compared with nasopharyngeal laboratory RT-PCR, EasyCov SARS-CoV-2 detection test has a sensitivity of 72.7%. Measured on healthcare worker population the specificity was 95.7%. LAMP technology on saliva is clearly able to identify subjects with infectivity profile. Among healthcare worker population Easycov test detected one presymptomatic subject.

Several drugs are now being repurposed with the aim of identifying if these drugs provide some level of disease resolution. Of particular interest are chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), first developed as an antimalarial therapy. There is increasing concern with regards to the efficacy and safety of these agents. The aims of this review are to systematically identify and collate studies describing the use of CQ and HCQ in human clinical trials and provide a detailed synthesis of evidence of its efficacy and safety. Methods and Findings: Searches for (COVID AND chloroquine [title\/abstract] AND outcomes[full text]) and two (COVID AND hydroxychloroquine[title\/abstract] AND outcomes[full text]) yielded 272 unique articles. Unique articles were manually checked for inclusion and exclusion criteria and also subjected to a quality appraisal assessment. A total of 19 articles were included in the systematic review. Seventy-five percent of observational studies employing an endpoint specific to efficacy recorded no significant difference in the attainment of outcomes, between COVID-19 patients given a range of CQ and\/or HCQ doses, and the control groups. All clinical trials and 82% of observational studies examining an indicator unique to drug safety discovered a higher probability of adverse events in those treated patients suspected of, and diagnosed with, COVID-19. Seventy-five percent of the total papers focusing on cardiac side-effects found a greater incidence among patients administered a wide range of CQ and\/or HCQ doses, with QTc prolongation the most common finding, in addition to its consequences of VT and cardiac arrest. Of the total studies using mortality rate as an end-point, 60% reported no significant change in the risk of death, while 30% showed an elevation, and 10% a depression, in treated relative to control patients. Conclusion: The strongest available evidence suggests that, relative to standard in-hospital management of symptoms, the use of CQ and HCQ to treat hospitalised COVID-19 patients has likely been unsafe. At the very least, the poor quality of data failing to find any significant changes in the risk of VT should preclude definitive judgment on drug safety until the completion of high-quality randomised clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Micheal takla","author_inst":"Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Kamalan Jeevaratnam","author_inst":"Surrey"},{"author_name":"Francisco Santos-Schneider","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG"},{"author_name":"Laurence Molina","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG"},{"author_name":"Julien Espeut","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG"},{"author_name":"Mellis Alali","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG"},{"author_name":"Julie Baptiste","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG"},{"author_name":"Lise Cardeur","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Dubuc","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG"},{"author_name":"Vincent Foulongne","author_inst":"Virology Dpt University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Florence Galtier","author_inst":"CIC  University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Alain Makinson","author_inst":"Infectious diseases dpt  University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Gregory Marin","author_inst":"DIM clinical research unit University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Marie-Chritine Picot","author_inst":"DIM clinical research unit University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Prieux-Lejeune","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Marine Quenot","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Francisco Jesus Checa-Robles","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Salvetat","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Diana Vetter","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Jacques Reynes","author_inst":"Infectious diseases dpt  University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Franck Molina","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Firpo-Betancourt","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Damodara Rao Mendu","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Jhang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"David Reich","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Keith Sigel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Carlos Cordon-Cardo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Marc Feldmann","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Samir Parekh","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Miriam Merad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sacha Gnjatic","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pharmacology and therapeutics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.28.20115311","rel_title":"A survey of the psychological status of primary school students who were quarantined at home during the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic in Hangzhou China","rel_date":"2020-05-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.28.20115311","rel_abs":"Objective: To investigate the presence of social anxiety and depression and the risk factors for them among primary school students who were quarantined at home during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in Hangzhou China. Methods: A total of 1620 students who were quarantined at home for at least one month were recruited from two primary schools in Hangzhou. Students completed a questionnaire on a mobile App with help from their guardians; the measures included demographic and general information, the Social Anxiety Scale for Children (SASC), and the Depression Self-rating Scale for Children (DSRSC). Results: The mean SASC score of the participants was 3.90{+\/-}3.73, which was higher than the mean norm score of Chinese urban children (3.48{+\/-}3.47) (P < 0.01). The mean DSRSC score of the participants (5.67{+\/-}4.97) was much lower than the mean norm score of Chinese urban children (9.84{+\/-}4.73) (P < 0.05). A total of 279 (17.2%) students had social anxiety, with a mean score of 10.41{+\/-}2.59, and 102 (6.3%) students had depression, with a mean score of 18.96{+\/-}3.89. The following variables were found to be significant risk factors for social anxiety during home quarantine: deterioration of the parent-child relationship, increased conflicts with parents, irregular work and rest, and worrying more about being infected. Deterioration of the parent-child relationship, less physical activity, irregular work and rest, and negative mood during home quarantine were significant risk factors for depression. Conclusion: Primary school students who were quarantined at home during the COVID-19 epidemic were more likely to have social anxiety but less likely to have depressive symptoms. Poor parent-child relationships, irregularity of work and rest, and epidemic-related problems were the main reasons for psychological problems. Families, schools, and social organizations need to pay more attention to the psychological status of primary school students quarantined at home.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yanghao Zheng","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Jianhua Li","author_inst":"The Affiliated Xiaoshan First People's Hospital of Hangzhou Normal University"},{"author_name":"Maiyan Zhang","author_inst":"Beigan primary school of Xiaoshan District"},{"author_name":"Bicheng Jin","author_inst":"Greentown Yuhua Primary School of Hangzhou"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyi Li","author_inst":"Beigan primary school of Xiaoshan District"},{"author_name":"Zhiyong Cao","author_inst":"Greentown Yuhua Primary School of Hangzhou"},{"author_name":"Nanping Wu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Changzhong Jin","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Dubuc","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG"},{"author_name":"Vincent Foulongne","author_inst":"Virology Dpt University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Florence Galtier","author_inst":"CIC  University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Alain Makinson","author_inst":"Infectious diseases dpt  University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Gregory Marin","author_inst":"DIM clinical research unit University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Marie-Chritine Picot","author_inst":"DIM clinical research unit University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Prieux-Lejeune","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Marine Quenot","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Francisco Jesus Checa-Robles","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Salvetat","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Diana Vetter","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Jacques Reynes","author_inst":"Infectious diseases dpt  University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Franck Molina","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Firpo-Betancourt","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Damodara Rao Mendu","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Jhang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"David Reich","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Keith Sigel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Carlos Cordon-Cardo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Marc Feldmann","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Samir Parekh","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Miriam Merad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sacha Gnjatic","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.30.20117457","rel_title":"Emotional distress and associated sociodemographic risk factors during the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain","rel_date":"2020-05-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.30.20117457","rel_abs":"Background Spain is one of the countries that has been most affected by COVID-19 disease.

Results Most respondents (n=1753) were female (76.8%), with a mean (SD) age of 40.4 (12.9) years; 39.1% were married and 39.5% held a high school degree. Severe and moderate symptoms of anxiety and depression were high (6.5% and 14.3%; 9.9% and 12.9%, respectively) and more than one in four participants (25.7%) experienced a panic attack. A high proportion of participants met diagnostic criteria for emotional disorders: 15.3% for GAD; 12.2% for MDD; and 17.2% for PD. Significant risk factors were as follows: female, young adult, single, unemployed, and low income. Conclusion Due to limitations related to the study design (convenience sample), the findings of these study may not be applicable to the general population. Nonetheless, the high prevalence of emotional symptoms and disorders in this sample suggests that mental health interventions are urgently needed in Spain.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Roger Munoz-Navarro Sr.","author_inst":"Department of Psychology and Sociology, Faculty of Social and Human Sciences University of Zaragoza"},{"author_name":"Antonio Cano-Vindel Sr.","author_inst":"Department of Experimental Psychology, Faculty of Psychology, Complutense University of Madrid"},{"author_name":"Florian Schmitz Sr.","author_inst":"Institute of Psychology, University of Duisburg-Essen"},{"author_name":"Rosario Cabello Sr.","author_inst":"Department of Developmental and Educational Psychology, Faculty of Psychology, University of Granada"},{"author_name":"Pablo Fernandez-Berrocal Sr.","author_inst":"Department of Basic Psychology, Faculty of Psychology, University of Malaga"},{"author_name":"Zhiyong Cao","author_inst":"Greentown Yuhua Primary School of Hangzhou"},{"author_name":"Nanping Wu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Changzhong Jin","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Dubuc","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG"},{"author_name":"Vincent Foulongne","author_inst":"Virology Dpt University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Florence Galtier","author_inst":"CIC  University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Alain Makinson","author_inst":"Infectious diseases dpt  University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Gregory Marin","author_inst":"DIM clinical research unit University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Marie-Chritine Picot","author_inst":"DIM clinical research unit University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Prieux-Lejeune","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Marine Quenot","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Francisco Jesus Checa-Robles","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Salvetat","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Diana Vetter","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Jacques Reynes","author_inst":"Infectious diseases dpt  University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Franck Molina","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Firpo-Betancourt","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Damodara Rao Mendu","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Jhang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"David Reich","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Keith Sigel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Carlos Cordon-Cardo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Marc Feldmann","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Samir Parekh","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Miriam Merad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sacha Gnjatic","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.30.20117564","rel_title":"Prevalence and acceptance of glove wearing practice among general population when visiting high risk are during local COVID-19 outbreak .","rel_date":"2020-05-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.30.20117564","rel_abs":"Background Healthcare authorities have generally advised against wearing glove by the general population. However, the use of gloves has become a common sight in public places raising the question of the necessity of glove wearing practice by the general population Objective This study aims to investigate the prevalence and types of glove used as well as the acceptance of the glove practice by individuals visiting the high-risk area during Covid-19 pandemic. Setting This prospective observational study was conducted among individuals visiting a wet market and district specialist hospital During Covid-19 pandemic. The required data was recorded based on observation by trained data collectors who were stationed at the strategic entry point. Methods Individuals entering through dedicated entry point were observed for the type, category and practice of wearing personal protective equipment. Inclusion criteria for this study were any individuals entering the facilities from entry points without respiratory symptoms. Exclusion criteria for this study were individuals less than 2 years old, visiting the emergency department, facility staff, individuals who are suspected of multiple entry and individuals who are exiting the treatment facility entrance. Patients were categorized into two groups of acceptable and unacceptable glove practice. The Pearson chi-square was used to test for differences in investigated variables in the univariate setting. Main outcome measure Prevalence, acceptance of glove wearing practice. Results A total of 75 individuals (2.3%) compromising of 45 (60.0%) individuals from hospitals and 30 (40.0%) individuals from wet markets were seen wearing glove amongst 3322 individuals observed during the data collection period. A higher proportion of individuals visiting wet market (30.0%) were observed with unacceptable glove practice compared to individuals visiting the hospital (8.9%), {chi}2 (1) = 5.60, p=.018. Similarly, a Higher proportion of glove use among non-Malay (53.3%) compared to Malay (46.7%) was observed in hospital compared to a higher proportion of glove use among Malay compared to non-Malay (16.7%) visiting wet market, {chi}2 (1) = 10.20, p=.001. As for glove use, we found that male were using more medical-grade glove (78.8%) compared to non-medical grade glove (21.2%) while an equal amount of medical (50.0%) and non-medical grade glove (50.0%) was used among female, {chi}2 (1) = 6.546, p=.011. Besides, we found that higher proportion of individual using medical-grade glove was using medical grade facemask (68.3%) which was similar to the proportion of individuals using non-medical glove was using non-medical facemask (66.7%), {chi}2 (1) = 5.25, p=.022. Conclusion We present the prevalence and characteristics of glove wearing practice in high-risk location during the current COVID-19 outbreak in Malaysia. Facing a worldwide public health emergency with limited effective clinical treatment, the role of glove-wearing in mitigating COVID-19 transmission is questionable. If needed, the compliance to proper glove-wearing could be improved through targeted public health education","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gobi Hariyanayagam Gunasekaran","author_inst":"Ministry of Health , Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Sera Selvanthan Sundram Gunasekaran","author_inst":"Ministry of Health , Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Shargunan Selvanthan Gunasekaran","author_inst":"Ministry of Health , Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Fouzia Hanim Abdul Halim","author_inst":"Ministry of Health , Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Nor Amirah abdul halim","author_inst":"Ministry of Health , Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Nur Syafina Insyirah Zaimi","author_inst":"Ministry of health ,Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Nanping Wu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Changzhong Jin","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Dubuc","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG"},{"author_name":"Vincent Foulongne","author_inst":"Virology Dpt University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Florence Galtier","author_inst":"CIC  University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Alain Makinson","author_inst":"Infectious diseases dpt  University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Gregory Marin","author_inst":"DIM clinical research unit University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Marie-Chritine Picot","author_inst":"DIM clinical research unit University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Prieux-Lejeune","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Marine Quenot","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Francisco Jesus Checa-Robles","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Salvetat","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Diana Vetter","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Jacques Reynes","author_inst":"Infectious diseases dpt  University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Franck Molina","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Firpo-Betancourt","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Damodara Rao Mendu","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Jhang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"David Reich","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Keith Sigel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Carlos Cordon-Cardo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Marc Feldmann","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Samir Parekh","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Miriam Merad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sacha Gnjatic","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.29.20117390","rel_title":"Trend analysis, modelling and impact assessment of COVID-19 in Nepal","rel_date":"2020-05-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.29.20117390","rel_abs":"With continued global expansion of COVID-19 transmission and mounting threat of the disease, the timely analysis of its trend in Nepal and forecasting the potential situation in the country has been deemed necessary. We analyzed the trend, modelling and impact assessment of COVID-19 cases of Nepal from 23rd January 2020 to 30th April 2020 to portray the scenario of COVID-19 after the first phase of lockdown. Exponential smoothing state-space and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models were constructed to forecast the cases. Susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model was fit to estimate the basic reproduction number (Ro) of COVID-19 in Nepal. There has been increase in the number of cases but the overall growth in COVID-19 was not high. Statistical modelling has shown that COVID-19 cases may continue to increase exponentially in Nepal. The basic reproduction number in Nepal being maintained at low level of 1.08 for the period of 23rd January to 30th April 2020 is an indication of effectiveness of lockdown in containing the COVID-19 spread. The models further suggest that COVID-19 might persist until December 2020 with peak cases in August 2020. On the other hand, basic reproduction number of 1.25 was computed for total cases reported for the 22nd March to 30th April 2020 period implying that COVID-19 may remain for at least for a year in the country. Thus, maintaining social distance and stay home policy with an implementation of strict lockdown in COVID-19 affected district is highly recommended.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shital Bhandary","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Patan Academy of Health Sciences, Lalitpur, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Srijan Lal Shrestha","author_inst":"Central Department of Statistics, Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Ram Prasad Khatiwada","author_inst":"Central Department of Statistics, Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Deep Narayan Shah","author_inst":"Central Department of Environmental Science, Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Nabin Narayan Munankarmi","author_inst":"Biotechnology Society Nepal (BSN), Bhaktapur, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Megha Raj Banjara","author_inst":"Central Department of Microbiology, Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Resham Thapa-Parajuli","author_inst":"Central Department of Economics, Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Krishna Das Manandhar","author_inst":"Central Department of Biotechnology, Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Rameshwar Adhikari","author_inst":"Research Center for Applied Science and Technology, Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Reshma Tuladhar","author_inst":"Tribhuvan University"},{"author_name":"Florence Galtier","author_inst":"CIC  University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Alain Makinson","author_inst":"Infectious diseases dpt  University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Gregory Marin","author_inst":"DIM clinical research unit University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Marie-Chritine Picot","author_inst":"DIM clinical research unit University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Prieux-Lejeune","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Marine Quenot","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Francisco Jesus Checa-Robles","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Salvetat","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Diana Vetter","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Jacques Reynes","author_inst":"Infectious diseases dpt  University Hospital Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Franck Molina","author_inst":"Sys2diag CNRS \/ ALCEDIAG, Montpellier, France"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Firpo-Betancourt","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Damodara Rao Mendu","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Jhang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"David Reich","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Keith Sigel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Carlos Cordon-Cardo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Marc Feldmann","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Samir Parekh","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Miriam Merad","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sacha Gnjatic","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.28.20116277","rel_title":"QMRA of SARS-CoV-2 for workers in wastewater treatment plants","rel_date":"2020-05-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.28.20116277","rel_abs":"Faecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is a hot topic and additional research is needed to elucidate the risks of the novel coronavirus in sanitation systems. This is the first article that investigates the potential health risks of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage to wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) workers. A quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) is applied for three COVID-19 scenarios (moderate, aggressive and extreme) to study the effect of different stages of the pandemic, in terms of percentage of infected population, on the probability of infection. Results reveal that estimates of viral loads in sewage at the entrance of WWTPs ranged from 1.03x102 to 1.31x104 GC.mL-1 (0.1 to 13.06 PFU.mL-1, respectively) and that estimated risks for the aggressive and extreme scenarios (6.5x10-3 and 3.1x10-2, respectively) were likely to be above a WHO benchmark of tolerable risk used for virus infection of 10-3 and higher than the risk of infection of E. coli, used herein as common pathogen indicator for a relative comparison, thus reinforcing the concern of sewage systems as a transmission pathway of SARS-CoV-2. These findings are helpful as an early-warning tool and in prioritizing upcoming risk management strategies in the sanitation sector during COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rafael Newton Zaneti","author_inst":"DMAE - Municipal Water and Sewerage Department.
