We sought to investigate the association between ACEI\/ARB use and risk of poor clinical outcomes from COVID-19. We identified 1,290 patients with hypertension, of which 682 had recorded ACEI\/ARB use and 608 without the use during 30 days preceding the date of COVID-19 diagnosis in completely enumerated COVID-19 cohort in South Korea. Our primary endpoint was the clinical outcomes comprised of all-cause mortality, use of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and sepsis. We used inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) to mitigate selection bias, and Poisson regression model to estimate the relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to compare outcomes in ACEI\/ARB users with non-users. Compared to non-use, ACEI\/ARB use was associated with lower clinical outcomes (IPTW adjusted RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.42-0.85; p=0.0046). When assessed by individual outcomes, ACEI\/ARB use was not associated with all-cause mortality (IPTW adjusted RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.35-1.09; p=0.0973) and respiratory events (IPTW adjusted RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.84-1.17; p=0.9043). Subgroup analysis showed a trend toward protective role of ACEIs and ARBs against overall outcomes in men (IPTW adjusted RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.69-1.03; p-for-interaction=0.008) and with pre-existing respiratory disease (IPTW adjusted RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.60-0.92; p-for-interaction=0.0023). We present clinical evidence to support continuing ACE\/ARB use in completely enumerated hypertensive COVID-19 cohort in South Korea.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ju Hwan Kim","author_inst":"Sungkyunkwan University"},{"author_name":"Yeon-Hee Baek","author_inst":"Sungkyunkwan University"},{"author_name":"Hyesung Lee","author_inst":"Sungkyunkwan University"},{"author_name":"Young June Choe","author_inst":"Hallym University College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hyun Joon Shin","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Ju-Young Shin","author_inst":"Sungkyunkwan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.30.20164491","rel_title":"Modeling latent infection transmissions through biosocial stochastic dynamics","rel_date":"2020-08-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.30.20164491","rel_abs":"The events of the recent SARS-CoV-02 epidemics have shown the importance of social factors, especially given the large number of asymptomatic cases that effectively spread the virus, which can cause a medical emergency to very susceptible individuals. Besides, the SARS-CoV-02 virus survives for several hours on different surfaces, where a new host can contract it with a delay. These passive modes of infection transmission remain an unexplored area for traditional mean-field epidemic models. Here, we design an agent-based model for simulations of infection transmission in an open system driven by the dynamics of social activity; the model takes into account the personal characteristics of individuals, as well as the survival time of the virus and its potential mutations. A growing bipartite graph embodies this biosocial process, consisting of active carriers (host) nodes that produce viral nodes during their infectious period. With its directed edges passing through viral nodes between two successive hosts, this graph contains complete information about the routes leading to each infected individual. We determine temporal fluctuations of the number of exposed and the number of infected individuals, the number of active carriers and active viruses at hourly resolution. The simulated processes underpin the latent infection transmissions, contributing significantly to the spread of the virus within a large time window. More precisely, being brought by social dynamics and exposed to the currently existing infection, an individual passes through the infectious state until eventually spontaneously recovers or otherwise is moves to a controlled hospital environment. Our results reveal complex feedback mechanisms that shape the dependence of the infection curve on the intensity of social dynamics and other sociobiological factors. In particular, the results show how the lockdown effectively reduces the spread of infection and how it increases again after the lockdown is removed. Furthermore, a reduced level of social activity but prolonged exposure of susceptible individuals have adverse effects. On the other hand, virus mutations that can gradually reduce the transmission rate by hopping to each new host along the infection path can significantly reduce the extent of the infection, but can not stop the spreading without additional social strategies. Our stochastic processes, based on graphs at the interface of biology and social dynamics, provide a new mathematical framework for simulations of various epidemic control strategies with high temporal resolution and virus traceability.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bosiljka Tadic","author_inst":"Jozef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia"},{"author_name":"Roderick Melnik","author_inst":"Wilfrid Laurier University, Waterloo, ON, Canada"},{"author_name":"Hyesung Lee","author_inst":"Sungkyunkwan University"},{"author_name":"Young June Choe","author_inst":"Hallym University College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hyun Joon Shin","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Ju-Young Shin","author_inst":"Sungkyunkwan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.29.20164509","rel_title":"Estimating the total size of coronavirus epidemic in Algeria via different approaches","rel_date":"2020-08-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.29.20164509","rel_abs":"In this paper, several techniques and models proposed the spread of coronavirus (Covid-19) and determines approximately the final number of coronavirus infected cases as well as infection point (peak time) in Algeria.

We aimed to formulate an applicable epidemiological model to accurately predict and forecast the impact of local resurgence and outbreaks to guide the local healthcare demand and capacity, policy making, and public health decisions. Methods: The model utilised the aggregated daily COVID-19 situation reports (including counts of daily admissions, discharges, and occupancy) from the local NHS hospitals and Covid-19 related weekly deaths in hospitals and other settings in Sussex (population 1.7M), Southeast England. These datasets corresponded to the first wave of COVID-19 infections from 24 March-15 June 2020. The counts of death registrations and regional population estimates were obtained from the Office of National Statistics. A novel epidemiological predictive and forecasting model was then derived based on the local\/regional surveillance data. Through a rigorous inverse parameter inference approach, the model parameters were estimated by fitting the model to the data in an optimal sense and then subsequently validated to make predictions subject to 95% confidence. Findings:The inferred parameters were physically reasonable and matched up to the widely used parameter values derived from the national datasets. Unlike other predictive models, which are restricted to a couple of days, our model can predict local hospital admissions, discharges (including deaths) and occupancy for the next 10, 20, and 30 days at the local level. Interpretation: We have demonstrated that by using local\/regional data, our predictive and forecasting model can be utilised to guide the local healthcare demand and capacity, policy making, and public health decisions to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the local population. Understanding how future COVID-19 spikes\/waves could possibly affect the regional populations empowers us to ensure the timely commissioning and organisation of services. Primary care and community services can be guided by the projected number of infectious and recovered patients and hospital admissions\/discharges to project discharge pathways to bedded and community settings, thus allowing services to understand their likely load in future spikes\/waves. The flexibility of timings in the model, in combination with other early warning systems, produces a timeframe for these services to prepare and isolate capacity for likely and potential demand within regional hospitals. The model also allows local authorities to plan potential mortuary capacity and understand the burden on crematoria and burial services. The model algorithms have been integrated into a web-based multi-institutional toolkit, which can be used by NHS hospitals, local authorities, and public health departments in other regions of the UK and elsewhere. The parameters, which are locally informed, form the basis of predicting and forecasting exercises accounting for different scenarios and impact of COVID-19 transmission.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eduard Campillo-Funollet","author_inst":"University of Sussex"},{"author_name":"James Van Yperen","author_inst":"University of Sussex"},{"author_name":"Phil Allman","author_inst":"NHS Sussex Commissioners"},{"author_name":"Michael Bell","author_inst":"Brighton and Hove City Council"},{"author_name":"Warren Beresford","author_inst":"NHS Sussex Commissioneers"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline Clay","author_inst":"West Sussex County Council"},{"author_name":"Matthew Dorey","author_inst":"West Sussex County Council"},{"author_name":"Graham Evans","author_inst":"East Sussex County Council"},{"author_name":"Kate Gilchrist","author_inst":"Brighton and Hove City Council"},{"author_name":"Pannu Gurprit","author_inst":"East Sussex Health Care Trust"},{"author_name":"Anjum Memon","author_inst":"Brighton and Sussex Medical School"},{"author_name":"Ryan Walkley","author_inst":"West Sussex County Council"},{"author_name":"Mark Watson","author_inst":"Sussex Health and Care Partnership"},{"author_name":"Anotida Madzvamuse","author_inst":"Universtiy of Sussex"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.29.20163907","rel_title":"Adjusting to Disrupted Assessments, Placements and Teaching (ADAPT): a snapshot of the early response by UK medical schools to COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-08-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.29.20163907","rel_abs":"Background Medical school assessments, clinical placements and teaching have been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The ADAPT consortium was formed to document and analyse the effects of the pandemic on medical education in the United Kingdom (UK), with the aim of capturing current and future snapshots of disruption to inform trends in the future performance of cohorts graduating during COVID-19. Methods Members of the consortium were recruited from various national medical student groups to ensure representation from medical schools across the UK. The groups involved were: Faculty of Medical Leadership and Management Medical Students Group (FMLM MSG); Neurology and Neurosurgery Interest Group (NANSIG); Doctors Association UK (DAUK); Royal Society of Medicine (RSM) Student Members Group and Medical Student Investigators Collaborative (MSICo.org). In total, 29 medical schools are represented by the consortium. Our members reported teaching postponement, examination status, alternative teaching provision, elective status and UK Foundation Programme Office (UKFPO) educational performance measure (EPM) ranking criteria relevant to their medical school during a data collection window (1st April 14:00 to 2nd April 23:59). Results All 29 medical schools began postponement of teaching between the 11th and 17th of March 2020. Changes to assessments were highly variable. Final year examinations had largely been completed before the onset of COVID-19. Of 226 exam sittings between Year 1 and Year 4 across 29 schools: 93 (41%) were cancelled completely; 14 (6%) had elements cancelled; 57 (25%) moved their exam sitting online. 23 exam sittings (10%) were postponed to a future date. 36% of cohorts with cancelled exams and 74% of cohorts with online exams were granted automatic progression to the next academic year. There exist 19 cohorts at 9 medical schools where all examinations (written and practical) were initially cancelled and automatic progression was granted. Conclusions The approaches taken by medical schools have differed substantially, though there has been universal disruption to teaching and assessments. The data presented in this study represent initial responses, which are likely to evolve over time. In particular, the status of future elective cancellations and UK Foundation Programme Office (UKFPO) educational performance measure (EPM) decile calculations remains unclear. The long-term implications of the heterogeneous disruption to medical education remains an area of active research. Differences in specialty recruitment and performance on future postgraduate examinations may be affected and will be a focus of future phases of the ADAPT Study.","rel_num_authors":34,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anmol Arora","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Georgios Solomou","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Soham Bandyopadhyay","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Julia Simons","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Alex Osborne","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Ioannis Georgiou","author_inst":"University of Aberdeen"},{"author_name":"Catherine Dominic","author_inst":"Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry"},{"author_name":"Shumail Mahmood","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Shreya Badhrinarayanan","author_inst":"Brighton and Sussex Medical School"},{"author_name":"Syed Rayyan Ahmed","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Jack Wellington","author_inst":"Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"Omar Kouli","author_inst":"University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Robin Jacob Borchert","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Joshua Feyi-Waboso","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Scott Dickson","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Savraj Kalsi","author_inst":"Hull-York Medical School"},{"author_name":"Dimitrios Karponis","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Tim Boardman","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Harmani Daler","author_inst":"Lancaster University"},{"author_name":"Abbey Boyle","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Jessica Speller","author_inst":"Leicester Medical School"},{"author_name":"Connor S Gillespie","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Jie Man Low","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Ratnaraj Vaidya","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Ngan Hong Ta","author_inst":"Norwich Medical School"},{"author_name":"Steven Aldridge","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Coll Martin","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Natasha Douglas","author_inst":"Queen's University Belfast"},{"author_name":"Mary Goble","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Tayyib Abdel-Hafiz Goolamallee","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Emma Jane Norton","author_inst":"St George's, University of London"},{"author_name":"Andre Chu","author_inst":"University of Central Lancashire"},{"author_name":"Inshal Imtiaz","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Oliver Patrick Devine","author_inst":"University College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"medical education"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.31.231746","rel_title":"Engineered ACE2 receptor traps potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-08-01","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.31.231746","rel_abs":"An essential mechanism for SARS-CoV-1 and -2 infection begins with the viral spike protein binding to the human receptor protein angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). Here we describe a stepwise engineering approach to generate a set of affinity optimized, enzymatically inactivated ACE2 variants that potently block SARS-CoV-2 infection of cells. These optimized receptor traps tightly bind the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein and prevent entry into host cells. We first computationally designed the ACE2-RBD interface using a two-stage flexible protein backbone design process that improved affinity for the RBD by up to 12-fold. These designed receptor variants were affinity matured an additional 14-fold by random mutagenesis and selection using yeast surface display. The highest affinity variant contained seven amino acid changes and bound to the RBD 170-fold more tightly than wild-type ACE2. With the addition of the natural ACE2 collectrin domain and fusion to a human Fc domain for increased stabilization and avidity, the most optimal ACE2 receptor traps neutralized SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentivirus and authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) in the 10-100 ng\/ml range. Engineered ACE2 receptor traps offer a promising route to fighting infections by SARS-CoV-2 and other ACE2-utilizing coronaviruses, with the key advantage that viral resistance would also likely impair viral entry. Moreover, such traps can be pre-designed for viruses with known entry receptors for faster therapeutic response without the need for neutralizing antibodies isolated or generated from convalescent patients.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anum Glasgow","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Jeff Edward Glasgow","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Daniel Limonta","author_inst":"University of Alberta"},{"author_name":"Paige Solomon","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Irene Lui","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Yang Zhang","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Matthew A Nix","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J Rettko","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Shion A Lim","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Shoshana Zha","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Rachel Yamin","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Kevin Kao","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Oren S Rosenberg","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey V Ravetch","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Arun P Wiita","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Kevin K Leung","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Xin X Zhou","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Tom C Hobman","author_inst":"University of Alberta"},{"author_name":"Tanja K Kortemme","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"James A.

With repeated sampling, immune monitoring creates a real-time portrait of the cells reacting to a novel virus before disease specific knowledge and tools are established. However, single cell analysis tools can struggle to reveal rare cells that are under 0.1% of the population. Here, the machine learning workflow Tracking Responders Expanding (T-REX) was created to identify changes in both very rare and common cells in diverse human immune monitoring settings. T-REX identified cells that were highly similar in phenotype and localized to hotspots of significant change during rhinovirus and SARS-CoV-2 infections. MHC tetramers were not used during unsupervised analysis and instead  left out to serve as a test of whether T-REX identifies biologically significant cells. In the rhinovirus challenge study, T-REX identified virus-specific CD4+ T cells based on these cells being a distinct phenotype that expanded by [&ge;]95% following infection. T-REX successfully identified hotspots with virus-specific T cells using pairs of samples comparing Day 7 of infection to samples taken either after clearing the infection (Day 28) or samples taken prior to infection (Day 0). Mapping pairwise comparisons in samples according to both the direction and degree of change provided a framework to compare systems level immune changes during infectious disease or therapy response. This revealed that the magnitude and direction of systemic immune change in some COVID-19 patients was comparable to that of blast crisis acute myeloid leukemia patients undergoing induction chemotherapy and characterized the identity of the immune cells that changed the most. Other COVID-19 patients instead matched an immune trajectory like that of individuals with rhinovirus infection or melanoma patients receiving checkpoint inhibitor therapy. T-REX analysis of paired blood samples provides an approach to rapidly identify and characterize mechanistically significant cells and to place emerging diseases into a systems immunology context.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sierra M.

Although the mutation at the population level had been extensively investigated, how the mutations evolve at the individual level is largely unknown, partly due to the difficulty of obtaining unbiased genome coverage of SARS-CoV-2 directly from clinical samples.\n\nMethodsEighteen time series fecal samples were collected from nine COVID-19 patients during the convalescent phase. The nucleic acids of SARS-CoV-2 were enriched by the hybrid capture method with different rounds of hybridization.\n\nResultsBy examining the sequencing depth, genome coverage, and allele frequency change, we demonstrated the impeccable performance of the hybrid capture method in samples with Ct value < 34, as well as significant improvement comparing to direct metatranscriptomic sequencing in samples with lower viral loads. We identified 229 intra-host variants at 182 sites in 18 fecal samples. Among them, nineteen variants presented frequency changes > 0.3 within 1-5 days, reflecting highly dynamic intra-host viral populations. Meanwhile, we also found that the same mutation showed different frequency changes in different individuals, indicating a strong random drift. Moreover, the evolving of the viral genome demonstrated that the virus was still viable in the gastrointestinal tract during the convalescent period.\n\nConclusionsThe hybrid capture method enables reliable analyses of inter- and intra-host variants of SARS-CoV-2 genome, which changed dramatically in the gastrointestinal tract; its clinical relevance warrants further investigation.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mingkun Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yi Xu","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Lu Kang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Genomic and Precision Medicine, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and China National Center for Bioinformation, Beij"},{"author_name":"Zijie Shen","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Genomic and Precision Medicine, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and China National Center for Bioinformation, Beij"},{"author_name":"Xufang Li","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Weili Wu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Genomic and Precision Medicine, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and China National Center for Bioinformation, Beij"},{"author_name":"Wentai Ma","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Genomic and Precision Medicine, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and China National Center for Bioinformation, Beij"},{"author_name":"Chunxiao Fang","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Fengxia Yang","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Xuan Jiang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Genomic and Precision Medicine, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and China National Center for Bioinformation, Beij"},{"author_name":"Sitang Gong","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Li Zhang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Genomic and Precision Medicine, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and China National Center for Bioinformation, Beij"},{"author_name":"Oren S Rosenberg","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey V Ravetch","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Arun P Wiita","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Kevin K Leung","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Xin X Zhou","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Tom C Hobman","author_inst":"University of Alberta"},{"author_name":"Tanja K Kortemme","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"James A.

However, due to limited capacity to test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, there are no reliable estimates of the true burden of infection and death. We, therefore, conducted a SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey amongst health care workers (HCW) in Blantyre city to estimate the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in urban Malawi. Methods Five hundred otherwise asymptomatic HCWs were recruited from Blantyre City (Malawi) from 22nd May 2020 to 19th June 2020 and serum samples were collected all participants. A commercial ELISA was used to measure SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in serum. We run local negative samples (2018 - 2019) to verify the specificity of the assay. To estimate the seroprevalence of SARS CoV-2 antibodies, we adjusted the proportion of positive results based on local specificity of the assay. Results Eighty-four participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The HCW with a positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody result came from different parts of the city. The adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 12.3% [CI 9.0-15.7]. Using age-stratified infection fatality estimates reported from elsewhere, we found that at the observed adjusted seroprevalence, the number of predicted deaths was 8 times the number of reported deaths. Conclusion The high seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among HCW and the discrepancy in the predicted versus reported deaths, suggests that there was early exposure but slow progression of COVID-19 epidemic in urban Malawi. This highlights the urgent need for development of locally parameterised mathematical models to more accurately predict the trajectory of the epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa for better evidence-based policy decisions and public health response planning.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marah Grace Chibwana","author_inst":"Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research programme"},{"author_name":"Khuzwayo Chidiwa Jere","author_inst":"Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research programme"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Mandolo","author_inst":"Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Vincent Katunga-Phiri","author_inst":"Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Dumizulu Tembo","author_inst":"Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Ndaona Mitole","author_inst":"Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Samantha Musasa","author_inst":"College of Medicine, University of Malawi"},{"author_name":"Simon Sichone","author_inst":"Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Agness Lakudzala","author_inst":"Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Lusako Sibale","author_inst":"Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Prisca Matambo","author_inst":"Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Innocent Kadwala","author_inst":"Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Rachel Louise Byrne","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alice Mbewe","author_inst":"Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Marc Y.R.

Animal model studies of SARS-CoV and MERS suggest that the age and sex difference in COVID-19 symptom severity may be due to a protective effect of the female sex hormone estrogen. Females have shown an ability to mount a stronger immune response to a variety of viral infections because of more robust humoral and cellular immune responses. Objectives: We sought to determine whether COVID-19 positivity increases in women entering menopause. We also aimed to identify whether premenopausal women taking exogenous hormones in the form of the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) and post-menopausal women taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT) have lower predicted rates of COVID-19, using our published symptom-based model. Design: The COVID Symptom Study developed by Kings College London and Zoe Global Limited was launched in the UK on 24th March 2020. It captured self-reported information related to COVID-19 symptoms. Data used for this study included records collected between 7th May - 15th June 2020. Main outcome measures: We investigated links between COVID-19 rates and 1) menopausal status, 2) COCP use and 3) HRT use, using symptom-based predicted COVID-19, tested COVID-19, and disease severity based on requirement for hospital attendance or respiratory support. Participants: Female users of the COVID Symptom Tracker Application in the UK, including 152,637 women for menopause status, 295,689 for COCP use, and 151,193 for HRT use. Analyses were adjusted for age, smoking and BMI. Results: Post-menopausal women aged 40-60 years had a higher rate of predicted COVID (P=0.003) and a corresponding range of symptoms, with consistent, but not significant trends observed for tested COVID-19 and disease severity. Women aged 18-45 years taking COCP had a significantly lower predicted COVID-19 (P=8.03E-05), with a reduction in hospital attendance (P=0.023). Post-menopausal women using HRT or hormonal therapies did not exhibit consistent associations, including increased rates of predicted COVID-19 (P=2.22E-05) for HRT users alone. Conclusions: Our findings support a protective effect of estrogen on COVID-19, based on positive association between predicted COVID-19 and menopausal status, and a negative association with COCP use. HRT use was positively associated with COVID-19 symptoms; however, the results should be considered with caution due to lack of data on HRT type, route of administration, duration of treatment, and potential comorbidities.

Methods: We accessed national English data on all adult COVID-19 specific critical care admissions from the COVID-19 Hospitalisation in England Surveillance System (CHESS), up to the 29th June 2020 (n=14,958). The study period was 1st March until 30th May, meaning every patient had 30 days of potential follow-up available. The primary outcome was in-hospital 30-day all-cause mortality. Hazard ratios for mortality were estimated for those admitted each week using a Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for age (non-linear restricted cubic spline), sex, ethnicity, comorbidities, and geographical region. Results: 30-day mortality peaked for people admitted to critical care in early April (peak 29.1% for HDU, 41.5% for ICU). There was subsequently a sustained decrease in mortality risk until the end of the study period. As a linear trend from the first week of April, adjusted mortality risk decreased by 11.2% (adjusted HR 0.89 [95% CI 0.87 - 0.91]) per week in HDU, and 9.0% (adjusted HR 0.91 [95% CI 0.88 - 0.94]) in ICU. Conclusions: There has been a substantial mortality improvement in people admitted to critical care with COVID-19 in England, with markedly lower mortality in people admitted in mid-April and May compared to earlier in the pandemic. This trend remains after adjustment for patient demographics and comorbidities suggesting this improvement is not due to changing patient characteristics. Possible causes include the introduction of effective treatments as part of clinical trials and a falling critical care burden.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"John Dennis","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Andrew McGovern","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Vollmer","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Bilal A Mateen","author_inst":"The Alan Turing Institute"},{"author_name":"Juan Castillo-Fernandez","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Mary Ni Lochlainn","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Joan Capdevila Pujol","author_inst":"Zoe Global Limited"},{"author_name":"Iain Buchan","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Louise C Kenny","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Wolf","author_inst":"Zoe Global Limited"},{"author_name":"Janice Rymer","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Ourselin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Claire Steves","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Timothy Spector","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Louise Newson","author_inst":"Newson HealthMenopause & Wellbeing Centre"},{"author_name":"Jordana Bell","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Chimota Phiri","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jane Mallewa","author_inst":"College of Medicine, University of Malawi"},{"author_name":"Henry C Mwandumba","author_inst":"Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Emily R Adams","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stephen B Gordon","author_inst":"Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Kondwani Charles Jambo","author_inst":"Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Programme"},{"author_name":"Jie Man Low","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Ratnaraj Vaidya","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Ngan Hong Ta","author_inst":"Norwich Medical School"},{"author_name":"Steven Aldridge","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Coll Martin","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Natasha Douglas","author_inst":"Queen's University Belfast"},{"author_name":"Mary Goble","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Tayyib Abdel-Hafiz Goolamallee","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Emma Jane Norton","author_inst":"St George's, University of London"},{"author_name":"Andre Chu","author_inst":"University of Central Lancashire"},{"author_name":"Inshal Imtiaz","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Oliver Patrick Devine","author_inst":"University College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health systems and quality improvement"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.30.20164988","rel_title":"Comparative effects of viral transport medium heat inactivation upon downstream SARS-CoV-2 detection in patient samples","rel_date":"2020-08-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.30.20164988","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic, which began in 2020 is testing economic resilience and surge capacity of healthcare providers worldwide. At time of writing, positive detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus remains the only method for diagnosing COVID-19 infection. Rapid upscaling of national SARS-CoV-2 genome testing presented challenges: 1) Unpredictable supply chains of reagents and kits for virus inactivation, RNA extraction and PCR-detection of viral genomes 2) Rapid time to result of <24 hours is required in order to facilitate timely infection control measures. We evaluated whether alternative commercially available kits provided sensitivity and accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 genome detection comparable to those used by regional National Healthcare Services (NHS), and asked if detection was altered by heat inactivation, an approach for rapid one-step viral inactivation and RNA extraction without chemicals or kits. Using purified RNA, we found the CerTest VIASURE kit to be comparable to Altona RealStar system currently in use, and further showed that both diagnostic kits performed similarly in the BioRad CFX96 and Roche LightCycler 480 II machines. Additionally, both kits were comparable to a third alternative using a combination of Quantabio qScript 1-step qRT-PCR mix and CDC-accredited N1 and N2 primer\/probes when looking specifically at borderline samples. Importantly, when using the kits in an extraction-free protocol, following heat inactivation, we saw differing results, with the combined Quantabio-CDC assay showing superior accuracy and sensitivity. In particular, detection using the CDC N2 probe following the extraction-free protocol was highly correlated to results generated with the same probe following RNA extraction and reported clinically (n=127; R2=0.9259). Our results demonstrate that sample treatment can greatly affect the downstream performance of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic kits, with varying impact depending on the kit. We also showed that one-step heat inactivation methods could reduce time from swab receipt to outcome of test result. Combined, these findings present alternatives to the protocols in use and can serve to alleviate any arising supply chain issues at different points in the workflow, whilst accelerating testing, and reducing cost and environmental impact.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jamie L Thompson","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Angela Downie Ruiz Velasco","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Alice Cardall","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Tarbox","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Jaineeta Richardson","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Gemma Clarke","author_inst":"NUH"},{"author_name":"Michelle Lister","author_inst":"NUH"},{"author_name":"Hannah C Howson-Wells","author_inst":"NUH"},{"author_name":"Vicki M Fleming","author_inst":"NUH"},{"author_name":"Manjinder Khakh","author_inst":"Path Links Pathology"},{"author_name":"Tim Sloan","author_inst":"Path Links Pathology"},{"author_name":"Nichola Duckworth","author_inst":"Path Links Pathology"},{"author_name":"Chris Denning","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"C.

This was a cross-sectional study including all individuals diagnosed of SARS-CoV-2 infection treated with LPV-r and attended at a single center in Southern Spain (March 1st to April 30th, 2020). The frequency [95% confidence interval (95% CI)] of potential and major DDI were calculated. Overall, 469 patients were diagnosed of COVID-19, 125 (27%) of them were prescribed LPV-r. LPV-r had potential DDI with concomitant medications in 97 (78%, 95% CI: 69%-85%) patients, and in 33 (26%, 95% CI: 19%-35%) individuals showed major DDI. Twelve (36%) patients with major DDI and 14 (15%) individuals without major DDI died (p=0.010). After adjustment, only the Charlson index was independently associated with death [adjusted OR (95% CI) for Charlson index [&ge;]5: 85 (10-731), p <0.001]. LPV-r was discontinued due to side effects in 31 (25%) patients.

In conclusion, a high frequency of DDI between LPV-r for treating COVID-19 and concomitant medications was found, including major DDI. Patients with major DDI showed worse outcomes, but this association was explained by the older age and comorbidities. Patients managed by the Infectious Diseases Unit had lower risk of major DDI.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Juan Macias","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de Valme"},{"author_name":"Ana Pinilla","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases and Microbiology Unit, Hospital Universitario Virgen de Valme.

Interestingly, many of these changes were found to increase over time in non-hospitalized longitudinal samples, suggesting a prolonged period of immune dysregulation following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Changes in T-cell activation\/exhaustion in non-hospitalized patients were found to positively correlate with age. Severely infected individuals had increased expression of activation and exhaustion markers. These data suggest a prolonged period of immune dysregulation following SARS-CoV-2 infection highlighting the need for additional studies investigating immune dysregulation in convalescent individuals.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jacob K Files","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Sushma Boppana","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Mildred D Perez","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Sanghita Sarkar","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Kelsey E Lowman","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Kai Qin","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Sarah Sterrett","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Eric Carlin","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Anju Bansal","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Steffanie Sabbaj","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Dustin M Long","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Olaf Kutsch","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"James Kobie","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Paul A Goepfert","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Nathan Erdmann","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Claire H Seedhouse","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Chimota Phiri","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jane Mallewa","author_inst":"College of Medicine, University of Malawi"},{"author_name":"Henry C Mwandumba","author_inst":"Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Emily R Adams","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stephen B Gordon","author_inst":"Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Kondwani Charles Jambo","author_inst":"Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Programme"},{"author_name":"Jie Man Low","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Ratnaraj Vaidya","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Ngan Hong Ta","author_inst":"Norwich Medical School"},{"author_name":"Steven Aldridge","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Coll Martin","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Natasha Douglas","author_inst":"Queen's University Belfast"},{"author_name":"Mary Goble","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Tayyib Abdel-Hafiz Goolamallee","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Emma Jane Norton","author_inst":"St George's, University of London"},{"author_name":"Andre Chu","author_inst":"University of Central Lancashire"},{"author_name":"Inshal Imtiaz","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Oliver Patrick Devine","author_inst":"University College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.30.20164327","rel_title":"Self-rated smell ability enables highly specific predictors of COVID-19 status: a case control study in Israel","rel_date":"2020-08-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.30.20164327","rel_abs":"Background: Clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 poses an enormous challenge to early detection and prevention of COVID-19, which is of crucial importance for pandemic containment. Cases of COVID-19 may be hard to distinguish clinically from other acute viral diseases, resulting in an overwhelming load of laboratory screening. Sudden onset of taste and smell loss emerge as hallmark of COVID-19. The optimal ways for including these symptoms in the screening of suspected COVID-19 patients should now be established. Methods: We performed a case-control study on patients that were PCR-tested for COVID-19 (112 positive and 112 negative participants), recruited during the first wave (March 2020 - May 2020) of COVID-19 pandemic in Israel. Patients were interviewed by phone regarding their symptoms and medical history and were asked to rate their olfactory and gustatory ability before and during their illness on a 1-10 scale. Prevalence and degrees of symptoms were calculated, and odds ratios were estimated. Symptoms-based logistic-regression classifiers were constructed and evaluated on a hold-out set. Results: Changes in smell and taste occurred in 68% (95% CI 60%-76%) and 72% (64%-80%), of positive patients, with 24 (11-53 range) and 12 (6-23) respective odds ratios. The ability to smell was decreased by 0.5 {+\/-} 1.5 in negatives, and by 4.5 {+\/-} 3.6 in positives, and to taste by 0.4 {+\/-} 1.5 and 4.9 {+\/-} 3.8, respectively (mean {+\/-} SD). A penalized logistic regression classifier based on 5 symptoms (degree of smell change, muscle ache, lack of appetite, fever, and a negatively contributing sore throat), has 66% sensitivity, 97% specificity and an area under the ROC curve of 0.83 (AUC) on a hold-out set. A classifier based on degree of smell change only is almost as good, with 66% sensitivity, 97% specificity and 0.81 AUC. Under the assumption of 8% positives among those tested, the predictive positive value (PPV) of this classifier is 0.68 and negative predictive value (NPV) is 0.97. Conclusions: Self-reported quantitative olfactory changes, either alone or combined with other symptoms, provide a specific and powerful tool for clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. The applicability of this tool for prioritizing COVID-19 laboratory testing is facilitated by a simple calculator presented here.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Noam Karni","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Hadassah University Hospital, Mt.

Methods We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on studies and publicly available data to quantify the association between predisposing health conditions, demographics, and behavioural factors with hospitalisation, ICU admission, and death from COVID-19. We provided ranges of reported and calculated effect estimates and pooled relative risks derived from a meta-analysis and meta-regression. Results 75 studies were included into qualitative and 74 into quantitative synthesis, with study populations ranging from 19 - 44,672 COVID-19 cases. The risk of dying from COVID-19 was significantly associated with cerebrovascular [pooled RR 2.7 (95% CI 1.7-4.1)] and cardiovascular [RR 3.2 (CI 2.3-4.5)] diseases, hypertension [RR 2.6 (CI 2.0-3.4)], and renal disease [RR 2.5 (CI 1.8-3.4)]. Health care workers had lower risk for death and severe outcomes of disease (RR 0.1 (CI 0.1-0.3). Our meta-regression showed a decrease of the effect of some comorbidities on severity of disease with higher median age of study populations. Associations between comorbidities and hospitalisation and ICU admission were less strong than for death. Conclusions We obtained robust estimates on the magnitude of risk for COVID-19 hospitalisation, ICU admission, and death associated with comorbidities, demographic, and behavioural risk factors. We identified and confirmed population groups that are vulnerable and that require targeted prevention approaches.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nathalie Veronica Fernandez Villalobos","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Joerdis Jennifer Ott","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Hannover Medical School, German Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Carolina Judith Klett-Tammen","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Annabelle Bockey","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, University Hospital Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Patrizio Vanella","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Gerard Krause","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Hannover Medical School, German Centre for Infection Research, Twincore"},{"author_name":"Berit Lange","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, German Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Ran Nir-Paz","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Hadassah-Hebrew University medical center"},{"author_name":"Alon Hershko","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Hadassah University Hospital, Mt.

However, discrete pandemic effects may not be fully realized on the macro-scale. With this perspective, our goal is to visualize spread of the pandemic and measure county-level features which may portend vulnerability. Materials and Methods: We accessed the New York Times GitHub repository COVID19 data and 2018 US Census data for all US Counties. The disparate datasets were merged and filtered to allow for visualization and assessments about case fatality rate (CFR%) and associated demographic, ethnic and economic features. Results: Our results suggest that county-level COVID19 fatality rates are related to advanced population age (p <0.001) and less diversity as evidenced by higher proportion of Caucasians in High CFR% counties (p < 0.001). Also, lower CFR% counties had a greater proportion of the population reporting has having 2 or more races (p <0.001). We noted no significant differences between High and Low CFR% counties with respect to mean income or poverty rate. Conclusions: Unique COVID19 impacts are realized at the county level. Use of public datasets, data science skills and information visualization can yield helpful insights to drive understanding about community-level vulnerability.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gina Cahill","author_inst":"Baylor College of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Houston TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Carleigh Kutac","author_inst":"Baylor St. Luke's Medical Center, Houston TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Nicholas L Rider","author_inst":"BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE"},{"author_name":"Annabelle Bockey","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, University Hospital Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Patrizio Vanella","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Gerard Krause","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Hannover Medical School, German Centre for Infection Research, Twincore"},{"author_name":"Berit Lange","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, German Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Ran Nir-Paz","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Hadassah-Hebrew University medical center"},{"author_name":"Alon Hershko","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Hadassah University Hospital, Mt.

Taking into account this age-dependent fatality rate, a mathematical model considering young and elder subpopulations was formulated based on the natural history of covid-19 to study the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2. This model can be applied to study the epidemiological scenario resulting from the adoption of isolation or lockdown in many countries to control the rapid propagation of covid-19. We chose as examples the isolation adopted in Sao Paulo State (Brazil) in the early phase but not at the beginning of the epidemic, and the lockdown implemented in Spain when the number of severe covid-19 cases was increasing rapidly. Based on the data collected from Sa o Paulo State and Spain, the model parameters were evaluated and we obtained higher estimation for the basic reproduction number R0 (9.24 for Sao Paulo State, and 8 for Spain) compared to the currently accepted estimation of R0 around 3. The model allowed to explain the flattening of the epidemic curves by isolation in Sao Paulo State and lockdown in Spain when associated with the protective measures (face mask and social distancing) adopted by the population. However, a simplified mathematical model providing lower estimation for R0 did not explain the flattening of the epidemic curves. The implementation of the isolation in Sa o Paulo State before the rapidly increasing phase of the epidemic enlarged the period of the first wave of the epidemic and delayed its peak, which are the desirable results of isolation to avoid the overloading in the health care system.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hyun Mo Yang","author_inst":"State University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Luis Pedro Lombardi Jr.","author_inst":"State University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Fabio Fernandes Morato Castro","author_inst":"General Hospital of the Medicine School of University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Ariana Campos Yang","author_inst":"General Hospital of the Medicine School of University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Patrizio Vanella","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Gerard Krause","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Hannover Medical School, German Centre for Infection Research, Twincore"},{"author_name":"Berit Lange","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, German Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Ran Nir-Paz","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Hadassah-Hebrew University medical center"},{"author_name":"Alon Hershko","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Hadassah University Hospital, Mt.

We took COVID swabs from the peritoneal cavity and from the vagina from all eligible patients. Results were stratified by pre operative COVID status. Results In patients who were presumed COVID negative at the time of surgery SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA was detected in 0\/102 peritoneal samples and 0\/98 vaginal samples. Peritoneal and vaginal swabs were also negative in one patient who had a positive nasopharyngeal swab immediately prior to surgery.

Design: Rapid scoping review of literature available until 8th April 2020. Setting: International studies on the infectiousness of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 Participants: Studies were selected for inclusion if they defined asymptomatics as a separate cohort distinct from pre-symptomatics and if they provided a quantitative measure of the infectiousness of asymptomatics relative to symptomatics. Primary outcome measures: The relative number of secondary cases produced by an average primary case, the relative probability of transmitting infection upon contact, and the degree of viral shedding. Results: Very few studies reported estimates of relative infectiousness of asymptomatic compared with symptomatic individuals. Significant differences exist in the definition of infectiousness. Viral shedding studies in general show no difference in shedding levels between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals but are likely to be impacted by insufficient statistical power. Two contact tracing studies provided estimates of 0.7 and 1.0, but differences in approach and definition preclude comparison across the two studies. Finally, two modelling studies suggest a relative infectiousness of around 0.5 but one of these was more reflective of the infectiousness of undocumented rather than asymptomatic cases. Importantly, one contact tracing study showing a very low level of infectiousness of asymptomatic was not included in the analysis at this point due difficulties interpreting the reported findings. Conclusions: The present study highlights the need for additional studies in this area as a matter of urgency. For the purpose of epidemiological modelling, we cautiously suggest that at present, asymptomatics could be considered to have a degree of infectiousness which is about 0.40-0.70 that of symptomatics. However, it must be stressed that this suggestion comes from a very low evidence base and that estimates exist that are close to zero and close to 1.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Mc Evoy","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Conor G McAloon","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Aine B Collins","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Kevin Hunt","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Francis Butler","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Andrew W Byrne","author_inst":"DAFM"},{"author_name":"Miriam Casey","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Ann Barber","author_inst":"Wageningen University"},{"author_name":"John M Griffin","author_inst":"Centre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth A Lane","author_inst":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine"},{"author_name":"Patrick Wall","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Simon J More","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"James Kobie","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Paul A Goepfert","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Nathan Erdmann","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Claire H Seedhouse","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Chimota Phiri","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jane Mallewa","author_inst":"College of Medicine, University of Malawi"},{"author_name":"Henry C Mwandumba","author_inst":"Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Emily R Adams","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stephen B Gordon","author_inst":"Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Kondwani Charles Jambo","author_inst":"Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Programme"},{"author_name":"Jie Man Low","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Ratnaraj Vaidya","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Ngan Hong Ta","author_inst":"Norwich Medical School"},{"author_name":"Steven Aldridge","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Coll Martin","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Natasha Douglas","author_inst":"Queen's University Belfast"},{"author_name":"Mary Goble","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Tayyib Abdel-Hafiz Goolamallee","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Emma Jane Norton","author_inst":"St George's, University of London"},{"author_name":"Andre Chu","author_inst":"University of Central Lancashire"},{"author_name":"Inshal Imtiaz","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Oliver Patrick Devine","author_inst":"University College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.30.20165118","rel_title":"Effects of COVID-19 lockdown on heart rate variability","rel_date":"2020-08-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.30.20165118","rel_abs":"Introduction: Strict lockdown rules were imposed to the French population from 17 March to 11 May 2020, which may result in limited possibilities of physical activity, modified psychological and health states. This report is focused on HRV parameters kinetics before, during and after this lockdown period. Methods: 95 participants were included in this study, who underwent regular orthostatic tests (a 5-minute supine followed by a 5-minute standing recording of heart rate (HR)) on a regular basis before, during and after the lockdown (BSL, CFN and RCV, respectively). HR, power in low- and high-frequency bands (LF, HF, respectively) and root mean square of the successive differences (RMSSD) were computed for each orthostatic test, and for each positions. Subjective well-being was assessed on a 0-10 visual analogic scale (VAS). Results: Out of the 95 participants, 19 (WB+) reported an improved well-being (i.e., increase >2 in VAS score) during CFN, contradictory to the 76 other participants (WB-). There was an increase in HR and a decrease in RMSSD when measured supine in CFN and RCV, compared to BSL in WB-, whilst opposite results were found in WB+ (i.e. decrease in HR and increase in RMSSD in CFN and RCV; increase in LF and HF in RCV). There was a moderate significant correlation between VAS and HR, RMSSD, HF, respectively, in the supine position; the higher the VAS score (i.e., subjective well-being), the higher the RMSSD and HF and the lower the HR. In standing position, HRV parameters were not modified during CFN. Conclusion: The strict COVID-19 lockdown likely had opposite effects on French population as 20% of participants improved parasympathetic activation (RMSSD, HF) and rated positively this period, whilst 80% showed altered responses and deteriorated well-being. The changes in HRV parameters during and after the lockdown period were in line with subjective well-being responses. These results confirmed the usefulness of HRV as a non-invasive means for monitoring well-being and health in the general population.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicolas Bourdillon","author_inst":"becare SA \/ UNIL"},{"author_name":"Sasan Yazdani","author_inst":"becare SA"},{"author_name":"Laurent Schmitt","author_inst":"becare SA"},{"author_name":"Gregoire P Millet","author_inst":"UNIL - ISSUL"},{"author_name":"Francis Butler","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Andrew W Byrne","author_inst":"DAFM"},{"author_name":"Miriam Casey","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Ann Barber","author_inst":"Wageningen University"},{"author_name":"John M Griffin","author_inst":"Centre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth A Lane","author_inst":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine"},{"author_name":"Patrick Wall","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Simon J More","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"James Kobie","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Paul A Goepfert","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Nathan Erdmann","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Claire H Seedhouse","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Chimota Phiri","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jane Mallewa","author_inst":"College of Medicine, University of Malawi"},{"author_name":"Henry C Mwandumba","author_inst":"Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Emily R Adams","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stephen B Gordon","author_inst":"Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Kondwani Charles Jambo","author_inst":"Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Programme"},{"author_name":"Jie Man Low","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Ratnaraj Vaidya","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Ngan Hong Ta","author_inst":"Norwich Medical School"},{"author_name":"Steven Aldridge","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Coll Martin","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Natasha Douglas","author_inst":"Queen's University Belfast"},{"author_name":"Mary Goble","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Tayyib Abdel-Hafiz Goolamallee","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Emma Jane Norton","author_inst":"St George's, University of London"},{"author_name":"Andre Chu","author_inst":"University of Central Lancashire"},{"author_name":"Inshal Imtiaz","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Oliver Patrick Devine","author_inst":"University College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"cardiovascular medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.30.20163790","rel_title":"Critical Mobility, a practical criterion and early indicator for regional COVID-19 resurgence","rel_date":"2020-07-31","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.30.20163790","rel_abs":"The sharp reduction of human mobility in March 2020, as observed by anonymized cellphone data, has played an important role in thwarting a runaway COVID-19 pandemic.

We report a data-driven approach, grounded in strong correlation between mobility and growth in COVID-19 cases two weeks later, to establish a spatial-temporal model of \"critical mobility\" maps that separate relatively safe mobility levels from dangerous ones. The normalized difference between the current and critical mobility has predictive power for case trajectories during the \"opening-up\" phases. For instance, actual mobility has risen above critical mobility in many southern US counties by the end of May, foreshadowing the latest virus resurgence. Encouragingly, critical mobility has been rising throughout the USA, likely due to face mask-wearing and social distancing measures. However, critical mobility is still well below pre-COVID mobility levels in most of the country suggesting continued mobility-reduction is still necessary.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marcus O Freitag","author_inst":"IBM T.

Here we show that academic biochemistry and molecular biology laboratories equipped with appropriate expertise and infrastructure can replicate commercially available SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR test kits and backfill pipeline shortages. The Georgia Tech COVID-19 Test Kit Support Group, composed of faculty, staff, and trainees across the biotechnology quad at Georgia Institute of Technology, synthesized multiplexed primers and probes and formulated a master mix composed of enzymes and proteins produced in-house. Our in-house kit compares favorably to a commercial product used for diagnostic testing. We also developed an environmental testing protocol to readily monitor surfaces across various campus laboratories for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. Our blueprint should be readily reproducible by research teams at other institutions, and our protocols may be modified and adapted to enable SARS-CoV-2 detection in more resource-limited settings.","rel_num_authors":35,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samantha J.

However, the specific characteristics of these at-risk populations are still not known and approaches to lower mortality are lacking. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective electronic health record data analysis of 25,326 subjects tested for COVID-19 between 2\/25\/20 and 6\/22\/20 at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital, a tertiary health care center in the racially diverse Southern U.S. The primary outcome was mortality in COVID-19-positive subjects and the association with subject characteristics and comorbidities was analyzed using simple and multiple linear logistic regression. RESULTS: The odds ratio of contracting COVID-19 was disproportionately high in Blacks\/African-Americans (OR 2.6; 95%CI 2.19-3.10; p<0.0001) and in subjects with obesity (OR 1.93; 95%CI 1.64-2.28; p<0.0001), hypertension (OR 2.46; 95%CI 2.07-2.93; p<0.0001), and diabetes (OR 2.11; 95%CI 1.78-2.48; p<0.0001). Diabetes was also associated with a dramatic increase in mortality (OR 3.62; 95%CI 2.11-6.2; p<0.0001) and emerged as an independent risk factor in this diverse population even after correcting for age, race, sex, obesity and hypertension. Interestingly, we found that metformin treatment was independently associated with a significant reduction in mortality in subjects with diabetes and COVID-19 (OR 0.33; 95%CI 0.13-0.84; p=0.0210). CONCLUSION: Thus, these results suggest that while diabetes is an independent risk factor for COVID-19-related mortality, this risk is dramatically reduced in subjects taking metformin, raising the possibility that metformin may provide a protective approach in this high risk population.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew Crouse","author_inst":"UAB"},{"author_name":"Tiffany Grimes","author_inst":"UAB"},{"author_name":"Peng Li","author_inst":"UAB"},{"author_name":"Matthew Might","author_inst":"UAB"},{"author_name":"Fernando Ovalle","author_inst":"UAB"},{"author_name":"Anath Shalev","author_inst":"UAB"},{"author_name":"Chieri Ito","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Liangjun Zhao","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Gary P.

The N protein is composed of N-terminal RNA-binding and C-terminal dimerization domains that are flanked by three intrinsically disordered regions. Here we demonstrate that a centrally located 40 amino acid intrinsically disordered domain drives phase separation of N protein when bound to RNA, with the morphology of the resulting condensates affected by inclusion in the RNA of the putative SARS-CoV-2 packaging signal. The SARS-CoV-2 M protein, normally embedded in the virion membrane with its C-terminus extending into the virion core, independently induces N protein phase separation that is dependent on the N proteins C-terminal dimerization domain and disordered region. Three-component mixtures of N+M+RNA form condensates with mutually exclusive compartments containing N+M or N+RNA, including spherical annular structures in which the M protein coats the outside of an N+RNA condensate. These findings support a model in which phase separation of the N protein with both the viral genomic RNA and the SARS-CoV-2 M protein facilitates RNA packaging and virion assembly.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shan Lu","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Qiaozhen Ye","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Digvijay Singh","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Villa","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Don W.

Other notable variations that appear with a moderate to low significance are, M85-NSP1 deletion, D268-NSP2 deletion, 112 amino acids deletion in ORF8, a phenylalanine insertion amidst F34-F36 (NSP6) and several co-existing (dependent) substitution\/deletion (I559V & P585S in NSP2, P504L & Y541C in NSP13, G82 & H83 deletions in NSP1 and K141, S142 & F143 deletions in NSP2) mutations. P323L-NSP12, D614G-spike, L37F-NSP6, L84S-ORF8 and the sequences deficient of the high significant mutations have led to 4 major SARS-CoV-2 clades. The top 5 countries bearing all the high significant and majority of the moderate significant mutations are: USA, England, Wales, Australia and Scotland. Further, the majority of the significant mutations have evolved in the first phase and have already transmitted around the globe indicating the positive selection pressure. Among the 26 SARS-CoV-2 proteins, nucleocapsid protein, ORF3a, ORF8, RNA dependent RNA polymerase and spike exhibit a higher heterogeneity compared with the rest of the proteins. However, NSP9, NSP10, NSP8, the envelope protein and NSP4 are highly resistant to mutations and can be exploited for drug\/vaccine development.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"L Ponoop Prasad Patro","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad, India"},{"author_name":"Chakkarai Sathyaseelan","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad, India"},{"author_name":"Patil Pranita Uttamrao","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad, India"},{"author_name":"Thenmalarchelvi Rathinavelan","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad, India"},{"author_name":"Don W.

Here, we investigated the molecular, phylogenomic, and evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in western India, the most affected region of the country. A total of 90 genomes were sequenced. Four nucleotide variants, namely C241T, C3037T, C14408T (Pro4715Leu), and A23403G (Asp614Gly), located at 5UTR, Orf1a, Orf1b, and Spike protein regions of the genome, respectively, were predominant and ubiquitous (90%). Phylogenetic analysis of the genomes revealed four distinct clusters, formed owing to different variants. The major cluster (cluster 4) is distinguished by mutations C313T, C5700A, G28881A are unique patterns and observed in 45% of samples. We thus report a newly emerging pattern of linked mutations. The predominance of these linked mutations suggests that they are likely a part of the viral fitness landscape. A novel and distinct pattern of mutations in the viral strains of each of the districts was observed. The Satara district viral strains showed mutations primarily at the 3' end of the genome, while Nashik district viral strains displayed mutations at the 5' end of the genome. Characterization of Pune strains showed that a novel variant has overtaken the other strains. Examination of the frequency of three mutations i.e., C313T, C5700A, G28881A in symptomatic versus asymptomatic patients indicated an increased occurrence in symptomatic cases, which is more prominent in females. The age-wise specific pattern of mutation is observed. Mutations C18877T, G20326A, G24794T, G25563T, G26152T, and C26735T are found in more than 30% study samples in the age group of 10-25. Intriguingly, these mutations are not detected in the higher age range 61-80. These findings portray the prevalence of unique linked mutations in SARS-CoV-2 in western India and their prevalence in symptomatic patients.\n\nImportanceElucidation of the SARS-CoV-2 mutational landscape within a specific geographical location, and its relationship with age and symptoms, is essential to understand its local transmission dynamics and control. Here we present the first comprehensive study on genome and mutation pattern analysis of SARS-CoV-2 from the western part of India, the worst affected region by the pandemic. Our analysis revealed three unique linked mutations, which are prevalent in most of the sequences studied. These may serve as a molecular marker to track the spread of this viral variant to different places.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dhiraj Paul","author_inst":"National Centre for Cell Science Pune"},{"author_name":"Kunal Jani","author_inst":"National Centre for Cell Science Pune"},{"author_name":"Janesh Kumar","author_inst":"National Centre for Cell Science Pune"},{"author_name":"Radha Chauhan","author_inst":"National Centre for Cell Science Pune"},{"author_name":"Vasudevan Seshadri","author_inst":"National Centre for Cell Science Pune"},{"author_name":"Girdhari Lal","author_inst":"National Centre for Cell Science Pune"},{"author_name":"Rajesh Karyakarte","author_inst":"B.

Using the current influenza virus vaccine production capacity to manufacture an egg-based inactivated Newcastle disease virus (NDV)\/SARS-CoV-2 vaccine would meet that challenge. Here, we report pre-clinical evaluations of an inactivated NDV chimera stably expressing the membrane-anchored form of the spike (NDV-S) as a potent COVID-19 vaccine in mice and hamsters. The inactivated NDV-S vaccine was immunogenic, inducing strong binding and\/or neutralizing antibodies in both animal models. More importantly, the inactivated NDV-S vaccine protected animals from SARS-CoV-2 infections or significantly attenuated SARS-CoV-2 induced disease. In the presence of an adjuvant, antigen-sparing could be achieved, which would further reduce the cost while maintaining the protective efficacy of the vaccine.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Weina Sun","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Stephen McCroskery","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Wen-Chun Liu","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sarah R.
