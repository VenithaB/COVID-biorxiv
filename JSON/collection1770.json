However, in Texas for instance, 63% of diagnosed cases are currently under 50, compared to only 52% nationally in March-April. Current demographics in Arizona and Florida are similar. Therefore, whether decreasing Covid-19 mortality rates are a reflection of changing demographics or represent improvements in clinical care is unknown. We assessed outcomes over time in a single health system, accounting for changes in demographics and clinical factors. Methods We analyzed biweekly mortality rates for admissions between March 1 and June 20, 2020 in a single health system in New York City. Outcomes were obtained as of July 14, 2020. We included all hospitalizations with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 disease. Patients with multiple hospitalizations (N=157, 3.3%) were included repeatedly if they continued to have laboratory-confirmed disease. Mortality was defined as in-hospital death or discharge to hospice care. Based on prior literature, we constructed a multivariable logistic regression model to generate expected risk of death, adjusting for age; sex; self-reported race and ethnicity; body mass index; smoking history; presence of hypertension, heart failure, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, diabetes, cancer, chronic kidney disease, or pulmonary disease individually as dummy variables; and admission oxygen saturation, D-dimer, C reactive protein, ferritin, and cycle threshold for RNA detection. All data were obtained from the electronic health record. We then calculated the sum of observed and expected deaths in each two-week period and multiplied each period's observed\/expected (O\/E) risk by the overall average crude mortality to generate biweekly adjusted rates. We calculated Poisson control limits and indicated points outside the control limits as significantly different, following statistical process control standards. The NYU institutional review board approved the study and granted a waiver of consent. Results We included 4,689 hospitalizations, of which 4,661 (99.4%) had died or been discharged. The median age, and the proportion male or with any comorbidity decreased over time; median real-time PCR cycle threshold increased (indicating relatively less concentration of virus) (Table). For instance, median age decreased from 67 years in the first two weeks to 49 in the last two. Peak hospitalizations were during the fifth and sixth study weeks, which accounted for 40% of the hospitalizations. Median length of stay for patients who died or were discharged to hospice was 8 days (interquartile range, 4-16). Unadjusted mortality dropped each period, from 30.2% in the first two weeks to 3% in the last two weeks, with the last eight weeks being lower than the 95% control limits. Risk adjustment partially attenuated the mortality decline, but adjusted mortality rates in the second-to-last two weeks remained outside the control limits (Figure, Table). The O\/E risk of mortality decreased from 1.07 (0.64-1.67) in the first two weeks to 0.39 (0.08-1.12) in the last two weeks. Discussion In this 16-week study of Covid-19 mortality at a single health system, we found that changes in demographics and severity of illness at presentation account for some, but not all, of the decrease in unadjusted mortality. Even after risk adjustment for a variety of clinical and demographic factors, mortality was significantly lower towards the end of the study period. Incremental improvements in outcomes are likely a combination of increasing clinical experience, decreasing hospital volume, growing use of new pharmacologic treatments (such as corticosteroids, remdesivir and anti-cytokine treatments), non-pharmacologic treatments (such as proning), earlier intervention, community awareness, and lower viral load exposure from increasing mask wearing and social distancing. It is also possible that earlier periods had a more virulent circulating strain. In summary, data from one health system suggest that Covid-19 remains a serious disease for high risk patients, but that outcomes may be improving.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Leora Horwitz","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Simon A.

We aimed to develop a risk score to identify patients with increased risk of COVID-19, allowing proper identification and allocation of limited resources. A retrospective study was conducted of 338 patients who were admitted to the hospital from the emergency room and tested for COVID-19 at an acute care hospital in the Metropolitan Washington D.C. area. The dataset was split into development and validation sets with a ratio of 6:4. Demographics, presenting symptoms, sick contact, triage vital signs, initial laboratory and chest X-ray results were analyzed to develop a prediction model for COVID-19 diagnosis. Multivariable logistic regression was performed in a stepwise fashion to develop a prediction model, and a scoring system was created based on the coefficients of the final model. Among 338 patients admitted to the hospital from the emergency room, 136 (40.2%) patients tested positive for COVID-19 and 202 (59.8%) patients tested negative. Nursing facility residence (2 points), sick contact (2 points), constitutional symptom (1 point), respiratory symptom (1 point), gastrointestinal symptom (1 point), obesity (1 point), hypoxia at triage (1 point), and leukocytosis (-1 point) were included in the prediction score. A risk score for COVID-19 diagnosis achieved AUROC of 0.87 (95% CI 0.83-0.92) in the development dataset and 0.83 (95% CI 0.76-0.90) in the validation dataset. A risk prediction score for COVID-19 can be used as a supplemental tool to assist clinical decision to triage, test, and quarantine patients admitted to the hospital from the emergency room.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joowhan Sung","author_inst":"MedStar Southern Maryland Hospital Center"},{"author_name":"Naveed Choudry","author_inst":"MedStar Southern Maryland Hospital Center"},{"author_name":"Rima Bachour","author_inst":"MedStar Southern Maryland Hospital Center"},{"author_name":"Fritz Francois","author_inst":"NYU Grossman School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Joseph Greco","author_inst":"NYU Winthrop Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bret Rudy","author_inst":"NYU Langone Hospital - Brooklyn"},{"author_name":"Christopher M Petrilli","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.11.20171975","rel_title":"Clinical and Epidemiological Characteristics of the First Month of the Covid-19 Pandemic in Chile","rel_date":"2020-08-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.11.20171975","rel_abs":"Introduction: Understanding the clinical course and outcomes of patients with Covid-19 in underrepresented populations like Latin America is paramount. In this study, we report the clinical characteristics of Covid-19 in Chile, with a focus on subjects requiring hospitalization during the initial phases of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods: This is a single center study including all consecutive patients diagnosed with Covid-19 during the first month of the pandemic. Demographics, clinical characteristics and laboratory data were collected within 24 hours of admission. The primary outcome was a composite of ICU admission or all-cause, in-hospital mortality. Results: During the first month of the pandemic, 381 patients were confirmed as positive for SARS- CoV-2 by molecular testing; 88 (23.1%) of them eventually required hospitalization. Median age of the cohort was 39 years (IQR 31-49). Overall mortality was 0.7% and 18 (3.7%) out of the 88 subjects who required hospitalization either died and\/or required ICU. Increased body mass index (BMI), C-reactive protein levels (CRP) and the SaTO2\/FiO2 index on admission were independently associated with a higher risk of ICU care or death. Discussion: The lower mortality observed in our prospective cohort during the first month of SARS-Cov-2 pandemic was lower than previously reported. This finding could be due to a lower threshold for admission, a healthcare system not yet overburdened and a younger population, among other factors. BMI, CRP on admission were strong predictors for ICU care or all-cause, in- hospital mortality. Our data provide important information regarding the clinical course of Covid- 19 in Latin America.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Macarena R Vial","author_inst":"Facultad de Medicina Clinica Alemana Universidad del Desarrollo"},{"author_name":"Anne Peters","author_inst":"Instituto de Ciencias e Innovacion en Medicina, Facultad de Medicina Clinica Alemana, Universidad del Desarrollo"},{"author_name":"Inia Perez","author_inst":"Facultad de Medicina Clinica Alemana Universidad del Desarrollo"},{"author_name":"Maria Spencer","author_inst":"Instituto de Ciencias e Innovacion en Medicina, Facultad de Medicina Clinica Alemana, Universidad del Desarrollo"},{"author_name":"Mario Barbe","author_inst":"Clinica Alemana de Santiago"},{"author_name":"Mabel Aylwin","author_inst":"Facultad de Medicina Clinica Alemana, Universidad del Desarrollo"},{"author_name":"Lorena Porte","author_inst":"Facultad de Medicina Clinica Alemana, Universidad del Desarrollo"},{"author_name":"Thomas Weitzel","author_inst":"Instituto de Ciencias e Innovacion en Medicina, Facultad de Medicina Clinica Alemana, Universidad del Desarrollo"},{"author_name":"Pablo Vial","author_inst":"Instituto de Ciencias e Innovacion en Medicina, Facultad de Medicina Clinica Alemana, Universidad del Desarrollo"},{"author_name":"Rafael Araos","author_inst":"Instituto de Ciencias e Innovacion en Medicina, Facultad de Medicina Clinica Alemana, Universidad del Desarrollo; Millennium Initiative for Collaborative Resear"},{"author_name":"Jose M.

Methods: This was a prospective single health system observational cohort study of patients [&ge;]18 years hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 disease who required at least 6 liters of oxygen during admission, had intact baseline cognitive and functional status and were discharged alive. Participants were enrolled between 30 and 40 days after discharge. Outcomes were elicited through validated survey instruments: the PROMIS Dyspnea Characteristics and PROMIS Global Health-10. Results: A total of 161 patients (40.6% of eligible) were enrolled; 152 (38.3%) completed the survey. Median age was 62 years (interquartile range [IQR], 50-67); 57 (37%) were female.

A clear acquired decrease of CR1 density of E from COVID-19 patients was observed, particularly among fatal cases, and paralleling several severity parameters. Deposits of C4d largely above values observed in normal individuals, mostly without C3 deposits, have been observed in more than 80% of the patients, reminiscent of the sub endothelial pericapil-lary deposits in organ transplant rejection, already observed on E in parallel, as well as also observed on E in clinical SLE flares. Conversely, significant C3 deposits were only observed among 1\/4 of the patients. The decrease of CR1\/E density, and the detection of virus spike, C3 or C4 fragment on E, among COVID-19 pa-tients, are likely to be two aspects of the same phenomenon of immune complexes or complement fragment coated cell debris handling and clearance. Measurement of C4d deposit on E might represent a way for assessing inflammation and comple-ment activation occurring in organ capillaries. CR1\/E decrease might represent a cumulative index of complement activation in COVID-19 patients. Taken together, these original findings stress on the participation of the complement regulatory pro-teins in that disease and evidence that E matter in immune mechanisms in COVID-19 patients. The use of CR1, or CR1-like molecules with the aim of down regulating complement activation and inflammation for therapy should also be considered.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aymric KISSERLI","author_inst":"Rheims University hospital"},{"author_name":"Nathalie SCHNEIDER","author_inst":"Rheims University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sandra AUDONNET","author_inst":"University of Rheims Champagne-Ardenne"},{"author_name":"Thierry TABARY","author_inst":"Rheims University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Antoine GOURY","author_inst":"Rheims University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Joel COUSSON","author_inst":"Rheims University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rachid MAHMOUDI","author_inst":"Rheims University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Firouze BANI-SADR","author_inst":"Rheims University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lukshe KANAGARATNAM","author_inst":"Rheims University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Damien JOLLY","author_inst":"Rheims University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jacques H M COHEN","author_inst":"University of Rheims Champagne-Ardenne"},{"author_name":"Alexander M.

In analysis adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics and comorbidities, the blood types A (OR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.54, 1.50), B (OR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.51, 1.69), AB (OR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.20, 2.41), and O (OR: 1.18, 95%: 0.74, 1.98) were not associated with hospitalization for COVID-19. Similarly, the blood types A (OR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.52, 1.65), B (OR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.46, 1.84), AB (OR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.04, 2.44), and O (OR: 1.25, 95%: 0.73, 2.14) were not associated with admission to intensive care unit or death in COVID-19. In conclusion, blood type is not associated with hospitalization or disease severity in COVID-19; therefore, it may not be useful marker for identifying patients at risk for severe COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Angelico Mendy","author_inst":"University of Cincinnati"},{"author_name":"Jason L Keller","author_inst":"University of Cincinnati"},{"author_name":"Senu Apewokin","author_inst":"University of Cincinnati"},{"author_name":"Ardythe L Morrow","author_inst":"University of Cincinnati"},{"author_name":"V\u00edctor Villalobos-Daniel","author_inst":"National Center of Disease Prevention and Control Programs - CENAPRECE"},{"author_name":"Zoi Rapti","author_inst":"University of Illinois"},{"author_name":"Yannis Drossinos","author_inst":"European Comission"},{"author_name":"Firouze BANI-SADR","author_inst":"Rheims University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lukshe KANAGARATNAM","author_inst":"Rheims University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Damien JOLLY","author_inst":"Rheims University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jacques H M COHEN","author_inst":"University of Rheims Champagne-Ardenne"},{"author_name":"Alexander M.

Evidence suggests that virus transmission can be reduced by face coverings, but robust evidence for how mask usage might affect safe distancing parameters is lacking. Accordingly, we investigate the effectiveness of surgical masks and single-layer cotton masks on mitigating dispersion of large respiratory droplets (i.e. non aerosol). We tested a manikin ejecting fluorescent droplets and human volunteers in speaking and coughing conditions. We quantified the number of droplets in flight using laser sheet illumination and UV-light for those that had landed at table height at up to 2m. For human volunteers, expiratory droplets were caught on a microscope slide 5cm from the mouth. Whether manikin or human, wearing a face covering decreased the number of projected droplets by >1000-fold. We estimated that a person standing 2m from someone coughing without a mask is exposed to over 1000 times more respiratory droplets than from someone standing 5 cm away wearing a basic single layer mask. Our results indicate that face coverings show consistent efficacy at blocking respiratory droplets. If aerosol transmission is later determined to be a significant driver of infection, then our findings may overestimate the effectiveness of face coverings.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lucia Bandiera","author_inst":"School of Engineering, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Geethanjali Pavar","author_inst":"School of Engineering, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Gabriele Pisetta","author_inst":"School of Engineering, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Shuji Otomo","author_inst":"School of Engineering, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Enzo Mangano","author_inst":"School of Engineering, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Jonathan R.

Wastewater surveillance has rapidly emerged as a potential tool to effectively monitor community infections for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), through measuring trends of viral RNA signal in wastewater systems. In this study SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA N1 and N2 genes are quantified in solids collected from influent post grit solids (PGS) and primary clarified sludge (PCS) in two water resource recovery facilities (WRRF) serving Canada's national capital region, i.e., the City of Ottawa, ON (pop. = 1.1M) and the City of Gatineau, QC (pop. = 280K). PCS samples show signal inhibition using RT-ddPCR compared to RT-qPCR, with PGS samples showing similar quantifiable concentrations of RNA using both assays. RT-qPCR shows higher frequency of detection of N1 and N2 genes in PCS (92.7, 90.6%) as compared to PGS samples (79.2, 82.3%). Sampling of PCS may therefore be an effective approach for SARS-CoV-2 viral quantification, especially during periods of declining and low COVID-19 incidence in the community. The pepper mild mottle virus (PMMV) is determined to have a less variable RNA signal in PCS over a three month period for two WRRFs, regardless of environmental conditions, compared to Bacteroides 16S rRNA or human eukaryotic 18S rRNA, making PMMV a potentially useful biomarker for normalization of SARS-CoV-2 signal. PMMV-normalized PCS RNA signal from WRRFs of two cities correlated with the regional public health epidemiological metrics, identifying PCS normalized to a fecal indicator (PMMV) as a potentially effective tool for monitoring trends during decreasing and low-incidence of infection of SARS-Cov-2 in communities.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patrick M.

We aimed to describe the place and cause of death during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This national death registry included all adult (aged [&ge;]18 years) deaths in England and Wales between 1st January 2014 and 30th June 2020. Analyses were based upon ICD-10 codes corresponding to the underlying cause of death as stated on the Medical Certificate of Cause of Death. Daily deaths during COVID-19 pandemic were compared against the expected daily deaths estimated using Farrington surveillance algorithm for daily historical data between 2014 and 2020, by place and cause of death. Findings Between 2nd March and 30th June 2020, there was an excess mortality of 57860 (a proportional increase of 35%) compared with the expected deaths, of which 50603 (86.2%) were COVID-19 related. Almost half the excess deaths occurred in care homes (25611 deaths) where deaths were 55% higher than expected. One fifth of the excess deaths occurred in hospital (15938 deaths; a proportional increase of 21%) with the remainder occurring at home (16190 deaths; a proportional increase of 39%). At home, only 14% of 16190 excess deaths were related to COVID-19, with 5 963 deaths due to cancer and 2485 deaths due to cardiac disease, very few of which involved COVID-19. In care homes or hospices, 61% of the 25611 excess deaths were related to COVID-19, 5539 of which were due to respiratory disease and most of these (4315 deaths) involved COVID-19. In hospital, there were 16174 fewer deaths than expected which did not involve COVID-19, and there were 4088 fewer deaths due to cancer and 1398 fewer deaths due to cardiac disease than expected. Interpretation The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a substantial increase in the absolute numbers of deaths occurring at home and care homes. There was a huge burden of excess deaths occurring in care homes, which were poorly characterised, and were likely to be, at least in part, the result of undiagnosed COVID-19. There was a smaller but important and ongoing excess in deaths at home, particularly from cancer and cardiac disease, which suggests avoidance of hospital care for non-COVID-19 conditions.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jianhua Wu","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Marion Mafham","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Mamas Mamas","author_inst":"University of Keele"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Rashid","author_inst":"University of Keele"},{"author_name":"Evangelos Kontopantelis","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"John Deanfield","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Mark de Belder","author_inst":"Barts NHS trust"},{"author_name":"Chris P Gale","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Xu Zhang","author_inst":"University of Ottawa - Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology"},{"author_name":"Tommy Alain","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario - Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Mark R.

The detection of this virus as early as possible will help in contaminating the spread of it as the virus is mutating itself as fast as possible and currently there are about 4,300 strains of the virus according to the reports. Clinical studies have shown that most of the COVID-19 patients suffer from a lung infection similar to influenza. So, it is possible to diagnose lung infection using imaging techniques. Although a chest computed tomography (CT) scan has been shown to be an effective imaging technique for lung-related disease diagnosis, chest X-ray is more widely available across the hospitals due to its considerably lower cost and faster imaging time than CT scan. The advancements in the area of machine learning and pattern recognition has resulted in intelligent systems that analyze CT Scans or X-ray images and classify between pneumonia and normal patients. This paper proposes KE Sieve Neural Network architecture, which helps in the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 using chest X-ray images. This architecture is achieving an accuracy of 98.49%.

Studies have shown that the average number of working hours per week is a significant predictor of stress and that the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the nurses stress levels. Objective: Therefore, we investigated (1) if a change had occurred in the nurses working hours during the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to the hours employed and (2) the influence of the nursing staffs working hours during COVID-19 pandemic on the perceived level of stress. Design: We used an online survey in this Austrian cross-sectional study, distributed using a snowball sampling method. Participants and methods: In the online survey, we asked the nurses many relevant questions, including how many hours they are employed per week and how many hours they had worked on average per week since the outbreak of COVID-19. We used the Perceived Stress scale to measure stress level among these nurses. Data were collected between mid-May and mid-July 2020. Results: Three-quarters of the 2600 participating nurses reported changes in their working hours during the COVID-19 pandemic. The nursing staffs hours of employment were statistically significantly associated with their average number of working hours during the COVID-19 pandemic. About two-thirds of the nurses who were employed either less than 10 hours or for 31-40 hours worked for more than 40 hours. Most of the nurses experienced a moderate level of stress. We identified a statistically significant association between increasing the number of working hours per week and the nurses perceived stress level. In addition, 15% of the nurses who had worked more than 40 hours reported experiencing a high level of stress. In addition, we found that nurses who worked more hours during the pandemic experienced higher stress than nurses who reduced their working hours or kept the same working hours. Conclusions: We found a statistically significant association between an increase in the nursing staffs working hours and their level of stress. We believe that these results reflect the negative consequences of prolonged working hours. For this reason, a (inter-)national discussion is needed on the topic of restricting the working hours of healthcare workers during such pandemics. This discussion can improve the health and safety of the health care workers, the patients, as well as members of the general population.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Manuela Hoedl","author_inst":"Institute of Nursing Science, Medical University of Graz"},{"author_name":"Silvia Bauer","author_inst":"Institute of Nursing Science, Medical University Graz"},{"author_name":"Doris Eglseer","author_inst":"Institute of Nursing Science, Medical University of Graz"},{"author_name":"Rick van der Geest","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Mara Sullivan","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Mark Ross","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Georgios D Kitsios","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Barbara Methe","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Bryan J.

Materials and Methods Clinical data, including demographics, signs, symptoms, comorbidities and blood test results and chest CT scans of 346 patients from two hospitals in the Hubei province, China, were used to develop machine learning models for automated severity assessment of diagnosed COVID-19 cases. We compared the predictive power of clinical and imaging data by testing multiple machine learning models, and further explored the use of four oversampling methods to address the imbalance distribution issue. Features with the highest predictive power were identified using the SHAP framework. Results Targeting differentiation between mild and severe cases, logistic regression models achieved the best performance on clinical features (AUC:0.848, sensitivity:0.455, specificity:0.906), imaging features (AUC:0.926, sensitivity:0.818, specificity:0.901) and the combined features (AUC:0.950, sensitivity:0.764, specificity:0.919). The SMOTE oversampling method further improved the performance of the combined features to AUC of 0.960 (sensitivity:0.845, specificity:0.929). Discussion Imaging features had the strongest impact on the model output, while a combination of clinical and imaging features yielded the best performance overall. The identified predictive features were consistent with findings from previous studies. Oversampling yielded mixed results, although it achieved the best performance in our study. Conclusions This study indicates that clinical and imaging features can be used for automated severity assessment of COVID-19 patients and have the potential to assist with triaging COVID-19 patients and prioritizing care for patients at higher risk of severe cases.

We and others have previously reported promising decontamination methods that may be applied to the recycling and reuse of FFRs. In this study we tested disinfection of three viruses including SARS-CoV-2, dried on a piece of meltblown fabric, the principal component responsible for filtering of fine particles in N95-level FFRs, under a range of temperatures (60-95{degrees}C) at ambient or 100% relative humidity (RH) in conjunction with filtration efficiency testing. We found that heat treatments of 75{degrees}C for 30 min or 85{degrees}C for 20 min at 100% RH resulted in efficient decontamination from the fabric of SARS-CoV-2, human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) and chikungunya virus vaccine strain 181 (CHIKV-181), without lowering the meltblown fabric's filtration efficiency.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rafael K.

These efforts have used various coding frameworks, but most have relied on binary coding that may not adequately describe the gradient in social distancing policies as states re-open. We developed a COVID-19 social distancing intensity framework that is sufficiently specific and sensitive to capture this gradient. Based on a review of policies from a 12-state sample, we developed a social distancing intensity framework consisting of 16 domains and intensity scales of 0-5 for each domain. We found that the states with the highest average daily intensity from our sample were Pennsylvania, Washington, Colorado, California, and New Jersey, with Georgia, Florida, Massachusetts, and Texas having the lowest. While some domains (such as restaurants and movie theaters) showed bimodal policy intensity distributions compatible with binary (yes\/no) coding, others (such as childcare and religious gatherings) showed broader variability that would be missed without more granular coding. We also present a range of methodological recommendations to strengthen COVID-19 comparative policy coding efforts.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jeff Lane","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Michelle M Garrison","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"James Kelley","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Priya Sarma","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Aaron Katz","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Graham Simmons","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, California, United States."},{"author_name":"Steven Chu","author_inst":"Department of Physics and Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States."},{"author_name":"Scott Weaver","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, and Institute for Human Infections and Immunity, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, United States."},{"author_name":"Wah Chiu","author_inst":"Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States; and Division of CryoEM and Bioimaging, SSRL, SLAC National Accelerator L"},{"author_name":"Yi Cui","author_inst":"Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States and Stanford Institute for Materials and Energy Scienc"},{"author_name":"Lei Song","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Xiangyang Central Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Hubei University of Arts and Science, Xiangyang, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoming Qiu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Huangshi Central Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Hubei Polytechnic University, Edong Healthcare Group, Huangshi, China"},{"author_name":"Sidong Liu","author_inst":"Centre for Health Informatics, Australian Institute of Health Innovation, Faculty of Medicine, Health and Human Sciences, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australi"},{"author_name":"Xiangran Cai","author_inst":"Medical Imaging Centre, The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Pamela J.

Acute lung inflammatory edema is a major pathological finding in autopsies explaining O2 diffusion failure and hypoxemia. Only dexamethasone has been shown to reduce mortality in severe cases, further supporting a role for inflammation in disease severity. SARS-CoV-2 enters cells employing angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor, which is highly expressed in lung alveolar cells. ACE2 is one of the components of the cellular machinery that inactivates the potent inflammatory agent bradykinin, and SARS-CoV-2 infection could interfere with the catalytic activity of ACE2, leading to accumulation of bradykinin. In this open-label, randomized clinical trial, we tested two pharmacological inhibitors of the kinin-kallikrein system that are currently approved for the treatment of hereditary angioedema, icatibant and inhibitor of C1 esterase\/kallikrein, in a group of 30 patients with severe COVID-19. Neither icatibant nor inhibitor of C1 esterase\/kallikrein resulted in significant changes in disease mortality and time to clinical improvement. However, both compounds promoted significant improvement of lung computed tomography scores and increased blood eosinophils, which has been reported as an indicator of disease recovery. In this small cohort, we found evidence for a beneficial role of pharmacological inhibition of the kinin-kallikrein system in two markers that indicate improved disease recovery.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eli Mansour","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Andre C Palma","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Raisa G Ulaf","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Luciana C Ribeiro","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Ana Flavia Bernardes","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Thyago A Nunes","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Marcus V Agrela","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Bruna Bombassaro","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Milena Monfort-Pires","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Rafael L Camargo","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Eliana P Araujo","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Natalia S Brunetti","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Alessandro S Farias","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Antonio L Falcao","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Thiago M Santos","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Plinio Trabasso","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Rachel P Dertkigil","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Sergio S Dertkigil","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Maria Luiza Moretti","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Licio A Velloso","author_inst":"University of Campinas"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.11.20171843","rel_title":"Functional SARS-CoV-2-specific immune memory persists after mild COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-08-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.11.20171843","rel_abs":"The recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 virus is currently causing a global pandemic and cases continue to rise.

Thus, we performed a longitudinal assessment of individuals recovered from mildly symptomatic COVID-19 to determine if they develop and sustain immunological memory against the virus. We found that recovered individuals developed SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody and neutralizing plasma, as well as virus-specific memory B and T cells that not only persisted, but in some cases increased numerically over three months following symptom onset. Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2-specific memory lymphocytes exhibited characteristics associated with potent antiviral immunity: memory T cells secreted IFN-{gamma} and expanded upon antigen re-encounter, while memory B cells expressed receptors capable of neutralizing virus when expressed as antibodies. These findings demonstrate that mild COVID-19 elicits memory lymphocytes that persist and display functional hallmarks associated with antiviral protective immunity.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lauren B Rodda","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jason Netland","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Laila Shehata","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kurt B Pruner","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Peter M Morawski","author_inst":"Benaroya Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Christopher Thouvenel","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Kennidy K Takehara","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Julie Eggenberger","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Emily A Hemann","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Hayley R Waterman","author_inst":"Benaroya Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Mitchell L Fahning","author_inst":"Benaroya Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Rathe","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Caleb Stokes","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Samuel Wrenn","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Brooke Fiala","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Lauren P Carter","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jessica A Hamerman","author_inst":"Benaroya Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Neil P King","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Michael Gale","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Daniel J Campbell","author_inst":"Benaroya Research Institute"},{"author_name":"David Rawlings","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Marion Pepper","author_inst":"University of Washington"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.12.20156257","rel_title":"Obesity, old age and frailty are the true risk factors for COVID-19 mortality and not chronic disease or ethnicity in Croydon.","rel_date":"2020-08-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.12.20156257","rel_abs":"Background: Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) mortality in hospitalised patients is strongly associated with old age, nursing home residence, male sex and obesity, with a more controversial association with ethnicity and chronic diseases, in particular diabetes mellitus. Further complicating the evaluation of the independent impacts of these risk factors is the failure to control for frailty in the published studies thus far. Aim: To determine the true risk factors for mortality in patients confirmed to have COVID-19 in Croydon needing hospital admission and to evaluate the independence of these risk factors in this group after adjusting for body mass index (BMI) and frailty. Methods: This observational study retrospectively reviewed hospital electronic medical records of 466 consecutive patients who were admitted to Croydon University Hospital confirmed positive by rapid PCR test from 11th March 2020 to 9th April 2020. Statistical analysis was performed by multiple unconditional and univariate logistic regression. Results: After multivariate analysis, male sex [OR 1.44 (CI 0.92-2.40)], age (per year) [OR 1.07 (CI 1.05-1.09)], morbid obesity (BMI > 40 kg\/m2 vs reference BMI 18.5-24.9 kg\/m2 ) [OR 14.8 (CI 5.25-41.8)], and nursing home residence (OR 3.01 (CI 1.56-5.79) were independently associated with COVID-19 mortality with no statistically significant association found with chronic diseases or ethnicity. In the non-nursing home population, after adjusting for age and sex, the odds ratio for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as a risk factor was 1.64 (CI 1.03-2.61, p = 0.03) and was and was attenuated to 1.30 (CI 0.78-2.18)) after controlling for BMI; the association of mortality with male sex was strengthened [OR 1.66 (CI 0.96-2.87)] and that for ethnic minority patients was weakened [South Asians [from OR 1.30 (CI 0.67-2.53)) to OR 1.21 (CI 0.60-2.46)]; African Caribbeans [from OR 1.24 (CI 0.65-2.34) to OR 1.16 (CI 0.58-2.30)]. There was a borderline but potentially large protective effect (p= 0.09) in patients who were on anticoagulation drugs prior to admission [OR 0.56 (CI 0.28-1.11)]. Conclusion: Our study found no significant effect of ethnicity and chronic diseases as independent risk factors on COVID-19 mortality in Croydon population whereas male sex, high BMI, old age and frailty were found to be independent risk factors. Routine prophylactic treatment with anticoagulant drugs in the high-risk COVID-19 population warrants further prompt investigation.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zinu Philipose","author_inst":"Croydon University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nadia Smati","author_inst":"Croydon University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chun Shing Jefferson Wong","author_inst":"Croydon University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Karen Aspey","author_inst":"Croydon University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michael Anthony Mendall","author_inst":"Croydon University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christopher Thouvenel","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Kennidy K Takehara","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Julie Eggenberger","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Emily A Hemann","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Hayley R Waterman","author_inst":"Benaroya Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Mitchell L Fahning","author_inst":"Benaroya Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Rathe","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Caleb Stokes","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Samuel Wrenn","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Brooke Fiala","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Lauren P Carter","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jessica A Hamerman","author_inst":"Benaroya Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Neil P King","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Michael Gale","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Daniel J Campbell","author_inst":"Benaroya Research Institute"},{"author_name":"David Rawlings","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Marion Pepper","author_inst":"University of Washington"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.12.20173252","rel_title":"Integrating psychosocial variables and societal diversity in epidemic models for predicting COVID-19 transmission dynamics","rel_date":"2020-08-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.12.20173252","rel_abs":"During the current COVID-19 pandemic, governments must make decisions based on a variety of information including estimations of infection spread, health care capacity, economic and psychosocial considerations. The disparate validity of current short-term forecasts of these factors is a major challenge to governments. By causally linking an established epidemiological spread model with dynamically evolving psychosocial variables, using Bayesian inference we estimate the strength and direction of these interactions for German and Danish data of disease spread, human mobility, and psychosocial factors based on the serial cross-sectional COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring (COSMO; N = 16,981). We demonstrate that the strength of cumulative influence of psychosocial variables on infection rates is of a similar magnitude as the influence of physical distancing. We further show that the efficacy of political interventions to contain the disease strongly depends on societal diversity, in particular group-specific sensitivity to affective risk perception. As a consequence, the model may assist in quantifying the effect and timing of interventions, forecasting future scenarios, and differentiating the impact on diverse groups as a function of their societal organization. Importantly, the careful handling of societal factors, including support to the more vulnerable groups, adds another direct instrument to the battery of political interventions fighting epidemic spread.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Viktor Jirsa","author_inst":"Aix-Marseille University"},{"author_name":"Spase Petkoski","author_inst":"Aix-Marseille University"},{"author_name":"Huifang Wang","author_inst":"Aix-Marseille University"},{"author_name":"Marmaduke Woodman","author_inst":"Aix-Marseille University"},{"author_name":"Jan Fousek","author_inst":"Aix-Marseille University"},{"author_name":"Cornelia Betsch","author_inst":"Erfurt University"},{"author_name":"Lisa Felgendreff","author_inst":"Erfurt University"},{"author_name":"Robert Bohm","author_inst":"Copenhagen University"},{"author_name":"Lau Lilleholt","author_inst":"Copenhagen University"},{"author_name":"Ingo Zettler","author_inst":"Copenhagen University"},{"author_name":"Sarah Faber","author_inst":"Baycrest Research Center"},{"author_name":"Kelly Shen","author_inst":"Baycrest Research Center"},{"author_name":"Anthony Randal McIntosh","author_inst":"Baycrest Research Center"},{"author_name":"Caleb Stokes","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Samuel Wrenn","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Brooke Fiala","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Lauren P Carter","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jessica A Hamerman","author_inst":"Benaroya Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Neil P King","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Michael Gale","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Daniel J Campbell","author_inst":"Benaroya Research Institute"},{"author_name":"David Rawlings","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Marion Pepper","author_inst":"University of Washington"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.12.20173609","rel_title":"Frontline healthcare workers' knowledge and perception of COVID-19 and willingness to work during the pandemic in Nepal: a nationwide cross-sectional web-based study","rel_date":"2020-08-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.12.20173609","rel_abs":"Abstract Background The health sector's effectiveness during a pandemic primarily depends on the availability, knowledge, skills, perceptions, and motivations of frontline healthcare workers. In this study, we aimed to investigate the contextual factors associated with the knowledge, perceptions, and the willingness of frontline healthcare workers to work during the COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal. Methods A total of 1051 frontline health-workers from all seven Nepalese provinces were included in this web-based cross-sectional study, which was conducted in May 2020. Using a 5-point Likert scale questionnaire, we collected information on knowledge, perceptions, and the willingness of frontline healthcare workers to work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multivariable logistic regression was applied to identify independent associations between predictors and outcome variables. Results Of the 1051 frontline health-workers, 17.2% were found to have inadequate knowledge on COVID-19, 63.6% reported unsatisfactory perceptions of government response, and 35.9% showed an unwillingness to work during the pandemic. Health workers at local health facilities (AOR: 0.35; 95% CI: 0.17-0.68) and those with chronic diseases were less likely to have adequate knowledge of COVID-19. Nurses (AOR: 2.10; 95% CI: 1.38-3.18), health-workers from Karnali Province (AOR: 2.62; 95% CI: 1.52-4.53), and those who had adequate knowledge of COVID-19 (AOR: 3.86; 95% CI: 2.51-6.16) were more likely to have satisfactory perception towards government response to COVID-19. In addition, laboratory-workers, health workers from Karnali province, and those with adequate knowledge (AOR: 1.81; 95% CI: 1.27-2.58) were more likely to work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions We concluded that frontline healthcare workers have some gaps in knowledge-related to COVID-19; about two-thirds of them had a negative perception of government response, and nearly one-third of them were unwilling to work. These observations demonstrate that prompt actions are required to improve health-worker knowledge of COVID-19, address negative perceptions to government responses, and motivate them to provide healthcare services during the pandemic.

All three assays are suitable for serosurveillance studies, but in low prevalence sites, estimation of exposure may require adjustment based on our findings.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"- DBT India Consortium for Covid-19 Research","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Shinjini Bhatnagar","author_inst":"Translational Health Science and Technology Institute"},{"author_name":"Daniel J Bromberg","author_inst":"Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA"},{"author_name":"Dilaram Acharya","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, College of Medicine, Dongguk University, South Korea"},{"author_name":"Kaveh Khoshnood","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven CT, USA"},{"author_name":"Kwan Lee","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, College of Medicine, Dongguk University, Gyeongju 38066 South Korea"},{"author_name":"Ji-Huyuk Park","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, College of Medicine, Dongguk University, South Korea"},{"author_name":"Seok-Ju Yoo","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, College of Medicine, Dongguk University, South Korea"},{"author_name":"Archana Shrestha","author_inst":"Department of Public Health, Kathmandu University, Kathmandu, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Bom BC","author_inst":"Ministry of Health and Population, Kathmandu, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Sabin Bhandari","author_inst":"B.P Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, Dharan, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Ramgyan Yadav","author_inst":"Ministry of Health and Population, Kathmandu, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Ashish Timalsina","author_inst":"Ministry of Health and Population, Kathmandu, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Chetan Nidhi Wagle","author_inst":"Ministry of Health and Population, Kathmandu, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Brij Kumar Das","author_inst":"Ministry of Health and Population, Kathmandu, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Ramesh Kunwar","author_inst":"Ministry of Health and Population, Kathmandu, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Binaya Chalise","author_inst":"Hiroshima University, Graduate School for International Development and Cooperation, Hiroshima, Japan"},{"author_name":"Deepak Raj Bhatta","author_inst":"Ministry of Health and Population, Kathmandu, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Mukesh Adhikari","author_inst":"Department of Health Policy and Management, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven CT, USA"},{"author_name":"Michael Gale","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Daniel J Campbell","author_inst":"Benaroya Research Institute"},{"author_name":"David Rawlings","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Marion Pepper","author_inst":"University of Washington"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.13.20173757","rel_title":"LAMP-BEAC: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA Using RT-LAMP and Molecular Beacons","rel_date":"2020-08-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.13.20173757","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic, resulting in the need for rapid assays to allow diagnosis and prevention of transmission. Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) provides a gold standard assay for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, but tests are expensive and supply chains are potentially fragile, motivating interest in additional assay methods. Reverse transcription and Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) provides an alternative that uses alternative and often cheaper reagents without the need for thermocyclers. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA is typically detected using dyes to report bulk amplification of DNA; however a common artifact is nonspecific DNA amplification, complicating detection. Here we describe the design and testing of molecular beacons, which allow sequence-specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomes with improved discrimination in simple reaction mixtures. We also show how beacons with different fluorescent labels can allow convenient multiplex detection of several amplicons in \"single pot\" reactions.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Scott Sherrill-Mix","author_inst":"Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Young Hwang","author_inst":"Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Aoife M Roche","author_inst":"Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Susan R Weiss","author_inst":"Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Yize Li","author_inst":"Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Jevon Graham-Wooten","author_inst":"Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Louis J Taylor","author_inst":"Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Ronald G Collman","author_inst":"Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Gregory D Van Duyne","author_inst":"Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Frederic D Bushman","author_inst":"Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Sabin Bhandari","author_inst":"B.P Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, Dharan, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Ramgyan Yadav","author_inst":"Ministry of Health and Population, Kathmandu, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Ashish Timalsina","author_inst":"Ministry of Health and Population, Kathmandu, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Chetan Nidhi Wagle","author_inst":"Ministry of Health and Population, Kathmandu, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Brij Kumar Das","author_inst":"Ministry of Health and Population, Kathmandu, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Ramesh Kunwar","author_inst":"Ministry of Health and Population, Kathmandu, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Binaya Chalise","author_inst":"Hiroshima University, Graduate School for International Development and Cooperation, Hiroshima, Japan"},{"author_name":"Deepak Raj Bhatta","author_inst":"Ministry of Health and Population, Kathmandu, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Mukesh Adhikari","author_inst":"Department of Health Policy and Management, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven CT, USA"},{"author_name":"Michael Gale","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Daniel J Campbell","author_inst":"Benaroya Research Institute"},{"author_name":"David Rawlings","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Marion Pepper","author_inst":"University of Washington"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.13.20173807","rel_title":"Validation of Saliva and Self-Administered Nasal Swabs for COVID-19 Testing","rel_date":"2020-08-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.13.20173807","rel_abs":"Background Active cases of COVID-19 has primarily been diagnosed via RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs. Saliva and self-administered nasal (SN) swabs can be collected safely without trained staff. We aimed to test the sensitivity of naso-oropharyngeal saliva and SN swabs compared to NP swabs in a large cohort of migrant workers in Singapore. Methods We recruited 200 male adult subjects: 45 with acute respiratory infection, 104 asymptomatic close contacts, and 51 confirmed COVID-19 cases. Each subject underwent NP swab, SN swab and saliva collection for RT-PCR testing at 1 to 3 timepoints. We additionally used a direct-from-sample amplicon-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) workflow to establish phylogeny. Results Of 200 subjects, 91 and 46 completed second and third rounds of testing, respectively. Of 337 sets of tests, there were 150 (44.5%) positive NP swabs, 127 (37.7%) positive SN swabs, and 209 (62.0%) positive saliva. Test concordance between different sample sites was good, with a kappa statistic of 0.616 for NP and SN swabs, and 0.537 for NP and saliva. In confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 subjects, the likelihood of a positive test from any sample fell beyond 14 days of symptom onset. NGS was conducted on 18 SN and saliva samples, with phylogenetic analyses demonstrating lineages for all samples tested were Clade O (GISAID nomenclature) and lineage B.6 (PANGOLIN nomenclature). Conclusion This study supports saliva as a sensitive and less intrusive sample for COVID-19 diagnosis and further delineates the role of oropharyngeal secretions in increasing the sensitivity of testing. However, SN swabs were inferior as an alternate sample type. Our study also provides evidence that a straightforward next-generation sequencing workflow can provide direct-from-sample phylogenetic analysis for public health decision-making.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alvin Kuo Jing Teo","author_inst":"Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Yukti Choudhury","author_inst":"Lucence Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Iain Beehuat Tan","author_inst":"National Cancer Centre, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Chae Yin Cher","author_inst":"Lucence Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Shi Hao Chew","author_inst":"Singapore Armed Forces"},{"author_name":"Zi Yi Wan","author_inst":"Lucence Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Lionel Tim Ee Cheng","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lynette Lin Ean Oon","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Min Han Tan","author_inst":"Lucence Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Kian Sing Chan","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Li Yang Hsu","author_inst":"Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Ramgyan Yadav","author_inst":"Ministry of Health and Population, Kathmandu, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Ashish Timalsina","author_inst":"Ministry of Health and Population, Kathmandu, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Chetan Nidhi Wagle","author_inst":"Ministry of Health and Population, Kathmandu, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Brij Kumar Das","author_inst":"Ministry of Health and Population, Kathmandu, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Ramesh Kunwar","author_inst":"Ministry of Health and Population, Kathmandu, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Binaya Chalise","author_inst":"Hiroshima University, Graduate School for International Development and Cooperation, Hiroshima, Japan"},{"author_name":"Deepak Raj Bhatta","author_inst":"Ministry of Health and Population, Kathmandu, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Mukesh Adhikari","author_inst":"Department of Health Policy and Management, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven CT, USA"},{"author_name":"Michael Gale","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Daniel J Campbell","author_inst":"Benaroya Research Institute"},{"author_name":"David Rawlings","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Marion Pepper","author_inst":"University of Washington"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.12.20170282","rel_title":"Observational Study on Clinical Features, Treatment and Outcome of COVID 19 in a tertiary care Centre in India- a retrospective case series","rel_date":"2020-08-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.12.20170282","rel_abs":"ABSTRACT Objective: This study will attempt to explore the demographic profile and outcome in the patients receiving multidisciplinary, personalised approach including use of Broad Spectrum Antivirals - Ivermectin, anti-inflammatory and antioxidants roles of Statins and N-acetyl-cysteine along with Standard of Care (SOC) in hospitalised COVID19 patients in a tertiary care centre.

Although clinical descriptions of COVID-19 are currently available, the factors distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 from other respiratory viruses are unknown. Here, we compared the clinical, histopathological, and immunological characteristics of patients with COVID-19 and pandemic influenza A(H1N1). We observed a higher frequency of respiratory symptoms, increased tissue injury markers, a histological pattern of alveolar pneumonia, and higher levels of IL-1RA, TNF-, CCL3, G-CSF, APRIL, sTNF-R1, sTNF-R2, sCD30, and sCD163 in influenza patients. Conversely, dry cough, gastrointestinal symptoms, interstitial lung pathology, increased Th1 (IL-12, IFN-{gamma}) and Th2 (IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13) cytokine levels, along with IL-1{beta}, IL-6, CCL11, VEGF, TWEAK, TSLP, MMP-1, and MMP-3, were observed in COVID-19 cases. We demonstrated the diagnostic potential of some clinical and immune factors to differentiate COVID-19 from pandemic influenza A(H1N1). Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 induces a dysbalanced polyfunctional inflammatory response that is different from the immune response against influenza. These findings might be relevant for the upcoming 2020-2021 influenza season, which is projected to be historically unique due to its convergence with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":38,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jose Alberto Choreno-Parra","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias Ismael Cosio Villegas (INER), Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Luis Armando Jimenez-Alvarez","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias Ismael Cosio Villegas (INER), Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Cruz Lagunas","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias Ismael Cosio Villegas (INER), Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Tatiana Sofia Rodriguez-Reyna","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Gustavo Ramirez-Martinez","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias Ismael Cosio Villegas (INER), Mexico City, Mexico."},{"author_name":"Montserrat Sandoval-Vega","author_inst":"Facultad de Estudios Superiores Iztacala, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Diana Lizeth Hernandez-Garcia","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias Ismael Cosio Villegas (INER), Mexico City, Mexico."},{"author_name":"Eduardo M.
