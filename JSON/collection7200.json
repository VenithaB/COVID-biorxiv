More than one million infections with the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been confirmed. While PCR-based assays are used for diagnosis, high through-put serologic methods are needed to detect antibodies for seroserveillance and for identification of seroconversion, potential plasma donors, and the nature of the immune response to this pathogen. Methods. A Luminex binding assay was used to assess the presence of antibodies in human sera from COVID-19-infected and -uninfected individuals specific for two recombinant proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Findings. Fluorochrome-labeled beads were coated with a recombinant soluble stabilized trimeric SARS-CoV-2 S protein ectodomain or its central portion, the receptor binding domain (RBD). Coated beads were incubated with sera, followed by incubation with biotinylated anti-human total Ig antibodies and phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled streptavidin. Readout using a Luminex analyzer clearly differentiated between sera of the infected and uninfected subject, delineating a wide range of serum antibody levels in infected subjects. Interpretation. Antibody assays of sera can identify individuals who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 and have seroconverted, as well as subjects who have been infected and recovered. The use of the Luminex binding Ab assay has the advantage that it can be run in approximately 2.5 hours, uses very little antigen, and permits a high through-put of samples\/day. Funding.

Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 show a wide range of symptoms and disease severity, while limited data is available on its immunogenicity. Here, the kinetics of the development of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses in relation to clinical features and dynamics of specific B-cell populations are reported. Immunophenotyping of B cells was performed by flow cytometry with longitudinally collected PBMCs. In parallel, serum samples were analyzed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA, IgG, and IgM antibodies using whole proteome peptide microarrays. Soon after disease onset in a mild case, we observed an increased frequency of plasmablasts concomitantly with a strong SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA response. In contrast, a case with more severe progression showed a delayed, but eventually very strong and broad SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA response. This case study shows that determining SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody epitopes can be valuable to monitor the specificity and magnitude of the early B-cell response, which could guide the development of vaccine candidates. Follow-up studies are required to evaluate whether the kinetics and strength of the SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA response could be potential prognostic markers of viral control.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christine Dahlke","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Jasmin Heidepriem","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces"},{"author_name":"Robin Kobbe","author_inst":"University Medical Center Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Rene Santer","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Till Koch","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Anahita Fathi","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"My L.

Bottlenecks in availability of ventilators and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may contribute to mortality, implying ethically difficult rationing decisions. It is unclear if accelerated equipment production will meet demand, calling for fallback solutions for life support in worst-case scenarios. Methods: Veno-venous extracorporeal gas exchange (VV-ECMO) can provide vital support in bilateral lung failure. VV-ECMO essentially comprises large flow venous accesses, membrane gas exchange, and a blood pump. As thousands of FDA and CE certified Impella blood pumps and consoles are distributed globally for cardiac support, we explored ad-hoc assembly of lean ECMO systems by embedding Impella pumps coaxially in tubes in combination with standard gas exchangers. Results: Ad-hoc integration of Impella blood pumps with gas exchange modules, standard cannulas for large bore venous access, regular ECMO tubing, Y-pieces and connectors led to lean ECMO systems with stable performance over several days. Oxygenation of 2.5-5 L of blood\/minute is realistic. Benefit\/risk analysis appears favorable if a patient requires respiratory support but cannot be supported because of lack of ventilators or unavailability of a required ECMO system. Conclusion: Ad-hoc assembly of veno-venous ECMOs using Impella pumps is feasible and results in stable blood flow across gas exchange modules. However, such off-label use of the devices calls for specific ethical and regulatory considerations prior to their use as last resort in patients for whom no other treatment modalities are available.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patrick Hunziker","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Urs Zenklusen","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Robin Kobbe","author_inst":"University Medical Center Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Rene Santer","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Till Koch","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Anahita Fathi","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"My L.

METHODS Laboratory-confirmed covid-19 cases reported through the beginning of April were extracted from the Italian Civil Protection database. Based on key events and interventions, we divided the epidemic into three periods: before February 21, from February 22 to early March, after early March. We compared epidemiological characteristics across periods and developed a modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model to study the epidemic and evaluate the impact of interventions. We explicitly took into account for unascertained cases (positive cases with no symptoms or mild symptoms that have not been accounted for in official statistics). RESULTS Currently, the number of positive active cases has increased to around 30,000 in the Lombardy region. Due to restriction measures, the effective reproduction number dropped from 3.33 (95% CI: 2.03-3.69) during the first period, to 2.36 (95% CI: 2.21-2.70) during the second period. In the third period, the effective reproduction number is estimated to have dropped to 1.49 (95% CI: 1.35-1.62). The model estimates a great proportion of unascertained cases, about 90% of infected people has not been accounted for in official statistics. CONCLUSIONS Considerable countermeasures have slowed down the covid-19 outbreak in the Lombardy region. However, notwithstanding the long-lasting lockdown period, the epidemic is still not under control. The effective reproduction number, according to the model used in this work, is still greater than 1.0. Estimation of unascertained cases has important implications on continuing surveillance and interventions.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Angelo Riccio","author_inst":"Universita' Parthenope di Napoli"},{"author_name":"Douglas D Miller","author_inst":"Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University"},{"author_name":"Adam E Berman","author_inst":"Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University"},{"author_name":"David C Hess","author_inst":"Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University"},{"author_name":"Steven G Krantz","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Anahita Fathi","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"My L.

A rapid increase in confirmed cases started in March, and the number of infected people is however unknown, largely due to the rather limited testing scale. A number of reports published so far reveal that the COVID-19 has long incubation period, high fatality ratio and non-specific symptoms, making this novel coronavirus far different from common seasonal influenza. In this note, we present a modified SEIR model which takes into account the time lag effect and probability distribution of model states. Based on the proposed model, it is estimated that the actual total number of infected people by 1 April in the UK might have already exceeded 610,000. Average fatality rates under different assumptions at the beginning of April 2020 are also estimated. Our model also reveals that the R0 value is between 7.5-9 which is much larger than most of the previously reported values.

Few recent studies have suggested a positive protective correlation of the BCG vaccination policy of the countries with the observed COVID-19 severity. The current study was undertaken to reassess the existing data as of 4th April 2020. The incidence rates (cases per million population), Case Fatality Rates (CFR) and inherently more robust Infection Fatality Rates (IFR) were calculated across countries accounting for about 99% COVID-19 deaths. The initial scrutiny suggested a weaker association with BCG vaccination policy or BCG coverage, so positivity to the Tuberculin Sensitivity Test (TST)\/ Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) as a measure of the potential protective effect of the resident populations exposure to Mycobacterium spp. whether from BCG vaccination or as a result of exposure to environmental mycobacteria was analyzed. The incidence rates (the number of cases per million population) decreased with an increase in % LTBI (TST\/IGRA positivity) for the analyzed countries with R2 =0.6343, suggesting an exponentially negative covariation. However, the covariation of CFR estimates that ranged from 0.29% to 12.25 % (average 5.39%) among countries, was tenuous. Interim estimates of IFR (i-IFR), a more dependable measure for such studies, for the best and worst-case scenarios, i.e., i-IFR-l and i-IFR-h, predict on an average 20.57% to 30.15 % COVID-19 fatality rates globally, but individual country estimates display huge variation. Among countries accounting for 92.14% deaths (11 countries; top 20% countries included in current study) the estimate for lowest IFRs (i-IFR-l=4.16 (China) & i-IFR-h=4.61 (China)) and highest IFRs (i-IFR-l=96.39% (UK); & i-IFR-h=96.54% (UK)) displayed huge difference (average for the group: CFR=6.8 {+\/-} 3.6%; i-IFR-l=34.97 {+\/-} 30.55%; & i-IFR-h=44.20 {+\/-} 29.08%). Currently, the worst affected countries Italy (CFR=12.25%; i-IFR-l=42.63%; i-IFR-h=48.69%) and Spain (CFR=9.39%; i-IFR-l=26.85%; i-IFR-h=36.60%) would seemingly cope with COVID-19 better than UK, Netherlands and USA while the countries Germany (CFR=1.40%; i-IFR-l=4.93%; i-IFR-h=17.49%) and Switzerland (CFR=3.01%; i-IFR-l=10.87%; i-IFR-h=16.23%) along with China could fare the best.

In order to prevent the epidemic, lockdown was required in many areas of China, which led to inconvenience of treatment for dialysis patients. To explore the psychological distress and the psychological demand induced by COVID-19 in the patients undergoing dialysis and compare the difference between hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal (PD) patients during the lockdown period. Methods: Questionnaires were given to the dialysis patients in West China Hospital of Sichuan University. The Impact of Event Scale (IES) was used to investigate the patients' trauma-related distress in response to COVID-19. Results: 232 eligible respondents were enrolled in this cross-section study, consisting of 156 PD patients and 76 HD patients. The median IES score for all the enrolled patients was 8.00 (2.00-19.00), which belonged to the subclinical dimension of post-traumatic stress symptoms. HD patients had a significant higher IES score than PD patients (11.50 vs 8.00) (p<0.05). HD patients already got more psychological support from the medical staff. There was no significant difference on further demand of psychological support between the two groups. In the multivariate regression analysis, we found that dialysis vintage, the impact of COVID-19 on the severity of illness and daily life, and confidence in overcoming the disease contributed to IES score (p<0.05). Conclusions: HD patients had more severe trauma-related stress symptoms than PD patients.

Knowledge, attitude, and practice survey provides a suitable format to evaluate existing programs and to identify effective strategies for behavior change in society. Therefore, the aim of study is to assess knowledge, attitude and practice among HCPs in Pakistan regarding COVID-19. An online survey-based study was conducted among healthcare professionals including physicians, pharmacists and nurses. A self-administered validated (Cronbach alpha=0.077) questionnaire comprised of five sections (Demographics, Knowledge, attitude, practice and perceived barriers) were used for data collection. Of 414 participants, 29.98% (n=120) physicians, 46.65% (n= 189) pharmacists and 25.36% (n= 105%) nurses. Most commonly utilized information source was social media. Findings showed HCPs have good knowledge (93.2%, n=386), positive attitude (Mean 8.43, SD:1.78) and good practice (88.7%, n=367) regarding COVID-19. HCPs perceived that overcrowding in emergency room (52.9%, n=219), limited infection control material (50.7%, n=210) and poor knowledge regarding transmission (40.6%, n=168) of COVID-19 are the major barriers in infection control practice. Binary logistic regression analysis demonstrated that HCPs of age group 40-49 years (OR: 1.419, 95%CI: (0.14-4.78, P=0.041) have higher odds of good knowledge. Similarly, age group of 31-39 years (OR: 1.377, 95% CI: 0.14-2.04, P=0.05), experience of more than 5 years (OR: 10.71, 95% CI: 2.83-40.75, P<0.001), and pharmacist job (OR: 2.247, 95% CI: 1.11-4.55, P=0.025) were the substantial determinants of good practice regarding COVID-19. HCPs in Pakistan have good knowledge, yet, there are areas where gaps in knowledge and practice was observed.

Public knowledge and awareness about COVID-19 are essential in suppressing its pandemic status. Method: A cross-sectional study using an online survey was conducted between 19th of March and 6th of April 2020 in three Middle Eastern countries (Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait) to explore the knowledge and practices of Middle Eastern population towards COVID-19. A previously developed questionnaire was used. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to identify predictors of COVID-19 knowledge. Results: A total of 1,208 participants were involved in this study from the three countries (Jordan = 389, Saudi Arabia = 433, and Kuwait = 386). The majority of participants (n = 810, 67.2%) were females and aged 30 to 49 years (n = 501, 41.5%). Participants had moderate overall COVID-19 knowledge with a mean score of 7.93 (SD = 1.72) out of 12, 66.1%. Participants had better knowledge about disease prevention and control with 83.0%, whereas the lowest sub-scale scores were for questions about disease transmission routes (43.3%). High education level was an important predictor of greater COVID-19 knowledge scores (p<0.01). Conclusion: Middle Eastern participants are of a relatively low level of knowledge about COVID-19, particularly regarding its transmission routes. Policymakers are recommended to develop informative COVID-19 related campaigns targeted specifically towards university students, unemployed individuals and those with lower levels of education.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abdallah Y Naser","author_inst":"Isra University"},{"author_name":"Eman Zmaily Dahmash","author_inst":"Isra University"},{"author_name":"Hassan Alwafi","author_inst":"Umm Alqura University"},{"author_name":"Zahra Khalil Alsairafi","author_inst":"Kuwait University"},{"author_name":"Ahmed M.

The high prevalence and associated healthcare, social and economic challenges of COVID-19 suggest this pandemic is likely to have a major impact on cancer management, and has been shown to potentially have worse outcomes in this cohort of vulnerable patients (1). This study aims to compare the outcomes of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed COVID-19 positive disease in patients with or without a history of cancer. Method: We retrospectively collected clinical, pathological and radiological characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 RT-PCR positive cancer patients treated consecutively in four different North London hospitals (cohort A). Outcomes recorded included morbidity, mortality and length of hospital stay. All clinically relevant outcomes were then compared to consecutively admitted COVID-19 positive patients, without a history of cancer (cohort B), treated at the primary centre during the same time period (12th March- 7th April 2020). Results: A total of 52 electronic patient records during the study time period were reviewed. Cohort A (median age 76 years, 56% males) and cohort B (median age 58 years, 62% male) comprised of 26 patients each. With the exclusion of cancer, both had a median of 2 comorbidities. Within cohort A, the most frequent underlying cancer was colorectal (5\/26) and prostate cancer (5\/26), and 77% of patients in Cohort A had received previous anti-cancer therapy. The most common presenting symptoms were cough and pyrexia in both cohorts. Frequent laboratory findings included lymphopenia, anaemia and elevated CRP in both cohorts, whilst hypokalaemia, hypoalbuminaemia and hypoproteinaemia was predominantly seen amongst patients with cancer. Median duration of admission was 7 days in both cohorts. The mortality rate was the same in both cohorts (23%), with median age of mortality of 80 years. Of cancer patients who died, all were advanced stage, had been treated with palliative intent and had received anti-cancer therapy within 13 days of admission. Conclusion: Old age, late stage of cancer diagnosis and multiple co-morbidities adversely influence the outcome of patients with COVID-19 positive patients. Whilst extra caution is warranted in the administration of anti-cancer therapies pertaining to the risk of immune-suppression, this data does not demonstrate a higher risk to cancer patients compared to their non-cancer counterparts.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nalinie Joharatnam-Hogan","author_inst":"University College London Hospital"},{"author_name":"Daniel Hochhauser","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Kai-Keen Shiu","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Hannah Rush","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Valerie Crolley","author_inst":"North Middlesex University Hospital NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Emma Butcher","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Anand Sharma","author_inst":"Mount Vernon Hospital"},{"author_name":"Aun Muhammad","author_inst":"Whittington Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nikhil Vasdev","author_inst":"Lister Hospital"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Anwar","author_inst":"Princess Alexandra Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ganna Kantser","author_inst":"North Middlesex University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Aramita Saha","author_inst":"North Middlesex University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fharat Raja","author_inst":"North Middlesex University Hospital"},{"author_name":"John Bridgewater","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Khurum Khan","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Kaj Blennow","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience & Physiology, The Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, Molndal, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Henrik Zetterberg","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Padovani","author_inst":"Neurology Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, Italy"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.12.20062828","rel_title":"Estimation of airborne viral emission: quanta emission rate of SARS-CoV-2 for infection risk assessment","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.12.20062828","rel_abs":"Airborne transmission is a pathway of contagion that is still not sufficiently investigated despite the evidence in the scientific literature of the role it can play in the context of an epidemic. While the medical research area dedicates efforts to find cures and remedies to counteract the effects of a virus, the engineering area is involved in providing risk assessments in indoor environments by simulating the airborne transmission of the virus during an epidemic. To this end, virus air emission data are needed. Unfortunately, this information is usually available only after the outbreak, based on specific reverse engineering cases. In this work, a novel approach to estimate the viral load emitted by a contagious subject on the basis of the viral load in the mouth, the type of respiratory activity (e.g. breathing, speaking), respiratory physiological parameters (e.g. inhalation rate), and activity level (e.g. resting, standing, light exercise) is proposed. The estimates of the proposed approach are in good agreement with values of viral loads of well-known diseases from the literature. The quanta emission rates of an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected subject, with a viral load in the mouth of 108 copies mL-1, were 10.5 quanta h-1 and 320 quanta h-1 for breathing and speaking respiratory activities, respectively, at rest. In the case of light activity, the values would increase to 33.9 quanta h-1 and 1.03x103 quanta h-1, respectively. The findings in terms of quanta emission rates were then adopted in infection risk models to demonstrate its application by evaluating the number of people infected by an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 subject in Italian indoor microenvironments before and after the introduction of virus containment measures. The results obtained from the simulations clearly highlight that a key role is played by proper ventilation in containment of the virus in indoor environments.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giorgio Buonanno","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Mechanical Engineering, University of Cassino and Southern Lazio, Cassino, Italy"},{"author_name":"Luca Stabile","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Mechanical Engineering, University of Cassino and Southern Lazio, Cassino, Italy"},{"author_name":"Lidia Morawska","author_inst":"International Laboratory for Air Quality and Health, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Hannah Rush","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Valerie Crolley","author_inst":"North Middlesex University Hospital NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Emma Butcher","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Anand Sharma","author_inst":"Mount Vernon Hospital"},{"author_name":"Aun Muhammad","author_inst":"Whittington Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nikhil Vasdev","author_inst":"Lister Hospital"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Anwar","author_inst":"Princess Alexandra Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ganna Kantser","author_inst":"North Middlesex University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Aramita Saha","author_inst":"North Middlesex University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fharat Raja","author_inst":"North Middlesex University Hospital"},{"author_name":"John Bridgewater","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Khurum Khan","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Kaj Blennow","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience & Physiology, The Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, Molndal, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Henrik Zetterberg","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Padovani","author_inst":"Neurology Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, Italy"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.12.20062794","rel_title":"Modelling and analysis of COVID-19 epidemic in India.","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.12.20062794","rel_abs":"COVID-19 epidemic is declared as the public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organisation in the second week of March 2020.

It is predicted that actual infectious population is ten times the reported positive case (quarantined) in the country. Also, a single case can infect 1.5 more individuals of the population. Epidemic doubling time is estimated to be around 4.1 days. All indicators are compared with Brazil and Italy as well. SIQR model has also predicted that India will see the peak with 22,000 active cases during the last week of April followed by reduction in active cases. It may take complete July for India to get over with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"ALOK TIWARI","author_inst":"IIT BOMBAY"},{"author_name":"Luca Stabile","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Mechanical Engineering, University of Cassino and Southern Lazio, Cassino, Italy"},{"author_name":"Lidia Morawska","author_inst":"International Laboratory for Air Quality and Health, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia"},{"author_name":"Hannah Rush","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Valerie Crolley","author_inst":"North Middlesex University Hospital NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Emma Butcher","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Anand Sharma","author_inst":"Mount Vernon Hospital"},{"author_name":"Aun Muhammad","author_inst":"Whittington Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nikhil Vasdev","author_inst":"Lister Hospital"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Anwar","author_inst":"Princess Alexandra Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ganna Kantser","author_inst":"North Middlesex University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Aramita Saha","author_inst":"North Middlesex University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fharat Raja","author_inst":"North Middlesex University Hospital"},{"author_name":"John Bridgewater","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Khurum Khan","author_inst":"University College London Hospital NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Kaj Blennow","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience & Physiology, The Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, Molndal, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Henrik Zetterberg","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Padovani","author_inst":"Neurology Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, Italy"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.15.20063107","rel_title":"Association between ABO blood groups and clinical outcome of coronavirus disease 2019: Evidence from two cohorts","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.15.20063107","rel_abs":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become the third most common coronavirus that causes large-scale infections worldwide.

The current retrospective study aimed to examine the correlation between blood type distribution and SARS-CoV-2 infection, progression, and prognosis in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). With 265 patients from multiple medical centers and two established cohorts, we found that the blood type A population was more sensitive to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the blood type distribution was not relevant to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury (AKI), and mortality in COVID-19 patients. These findings are indicative of coping with the great threat since it probed the relationship between blood types and ARDS, AKI, and mortality, in addition to susceptibility in COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xianfei Zeng","author_inst":"Shaanxi Corps Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hongyan Fan","author_inst":"Huoshenshan Hospital \/ 940 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dongxue Lu","author_inst":"Xijing Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fang Huang","author_inst":"Xi'an Chest Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xi Meng","author_inst":"Shaanxi Corps Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhuo Li","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Medical University"},{"author_name":"Mei Tang","author_inst":"Xijing Hospital \/ Huoshenshan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jing Zhang","author_inst":"Xijing Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nannan Liu","author_inst":"Xijing Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhixin Liu","author_inst":"Xijing Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jingya Zhao","author_inst":"Tangdu Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wen Yin","author_inst":"Xijing Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qunxing An","author_inst":"Xijing Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xijing Zhang","author_inst":"Xijing Hospital \/ Huoshenshan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xingbin Hu","author_inst":"Xijing Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kaj Blennow","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience & Physiology, The Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, Molndal, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Henrik Zetterberg","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Padovani","author_inst":"Neurology Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, Italy"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.12.20062661","rel_title":"Artificial intelligence for rapid identification of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.12.20062661","rel_abs":"For diagnosis of COVID-19, a SARS-CoV-2 virus-specific reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test is routinely used. However, this test can take up to two days to complete, serial testing may be required to rule out the possibility of false negative results, and there is currently a shortage of RT-PCR test kits, underscoring the urgent need for alternative methods for rapid and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. Chest computed tomography (CT) is a valuable component in the evaluation of patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nevertheless, CT alone may have limited negative predictive value for ruling out SARS-CoV-2 infection, as some patients may have normal radiologic findings at early stages of the disease. In this study, we used artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to integrate chest CT findings with clinical symptoms, exposure history, and laboratory testing to rapidly diagnose COVID-19 positive patients. Among a total of 905 patients tested by real-time RT-PCR assay and next-generation sequencing RT-PCR, 419 (46.3%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In a test set of 279 patients, the AI system achieved an AUC of 0.92 and had equal sensitivity as compared to a senior thoracic radiologist. The AI system also improved the detection of RT-PCR positive COVID-19 patients who presented with normal CT scans, correctly identifying 17 of 25 (68%) patients, whereas radiologists classified all of these patients as COVID-19 negative. When CT scans and associated clinical history are available, the proposed AI system can help to rapidly diagnose COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xueyan Mei","author_inst":"BioMedical Engineering and Imaging Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Hao-Chih Lee","author_inst":"Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Kaiyue Diao","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Mingqian Huang","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Bin Lin","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China"},{"author_name":"Chenyu Liu","author_inst":"BioMedical Engineering and Imaging Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Zongyu Xie","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu, Anhui, China"},{"author_name":"Yixuan Ma","author_inst":"BioMedical Engineering and Imaging Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Philip M.

This possibility has been discussed for at least two decades, and careful matching of patient ventilation requirements is advised. However, with a large range of lung compliance and other characteristics, which may also vary with time, good matching is difficult to achieve. Adjusting the impedance of the flow path between ventilator and patient gives the opportunity to control the airway pressure and hence flow and volume individually for each patient. Several groups are now investigating this, in particular the addition of a flow restrictor in the inspiration tube for the patient who is more compliant, or requires a lower tidal volume. In this paper, we show that a simple linear resistance-compliance model, termed the BathRC model, of the ventilator tubing system and lung allows direct calculation of the relationships between pressures, volumes, and required flow restriction. The BathRC model is experimentally validated using a GE Aisys CS2 ventilator connected to two test lungs. The pressure-flow relationships for two restrictors are experimentally determined, and despite the need to approximate them with a linear resistance characteristic, their effect in the breathing circuit is accurately predicted by the simple model. The BathRC model is freely available for download; we do not condone dual ventilation, but this tool is provided to demonstrate that flow restriction can be readily estimated. This research is part of a larger test, simulation and design investigation on dual ventilation being undertaken at the UoB and RUH.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew R Plummer","author_inst":"University of Bath"},{"author_name":"Jonathan L du Bois","author_inst":"University of Bath"},{"author_name":"Joseph M Flynn","author_inst":"University of Bath"},{"author_name":"Jens Roesner","author_inst":"University of Bath"},{"author_name":"Siu Man Lee","author_inst":"Royal United Hospital, Bath"},{"author_name":"Patrick Magee","author_inst":"BMI Bath Clinic"},{"author_name":"Malcolm Thornton","author_inst":"Royal United Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Bath"},{"author_name":"Andy Padkin","author_inst":"Royal United Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Bath"},{"author_name":"Harinderjit S Gill","author_inst":"University of Bath"},{"author_name":"Michael Chung","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Adam Bernheim","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Venkatesh Mani","author_inst":"BioMedical Engineering and Imaging Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Claudia Calcagno","author_inst":"BioMedical Engineering and Imaging Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Kunwei Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yet-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Shaolin Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yet-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Hong Shan","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yet-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Jian Lv","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Nanxishan Hospital, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China"},{"author_name":"Tongtong Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, The Second People's Hospital, Fuyang, Anhui, China"},{"author_name":"Junli Xia","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Bozhou Bone Trauma Hospital Image Center, Bozhou, Anhui, China"},{"author_name":"Qihua Long","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Remin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Sharon Steinberger","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Adam Jacobi","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Timothy Deyer","author_inst":"East River Medical Imaging, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Marta Luksza","author_inst":"Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Fang Liu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Brent P.

In the absence of a vaccine, interventions focused on physical distancing have been widely used to reduce community transmission. These physical distancing policies can only control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 if they are able to reduce the amount of close interpersonal contact in a population. To quantify the impact of these policies over the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, we conducted three waves of contact surveys between March 22 and June 23, 2020. We find that rates of interpersonal contact have been dramatically reduced at all ages in the US, with an 82% (95\\% CI:80\\% -- 83\\%) reduction in the average number of daily contacts observed during the first wave compared to pre-pandemic levels. We find that this decline reduced the reproduction number, \\(R_0\\), to below one in March and early April (0.66, 95\\% CI:0.35 -- 0.88). However, with easing of physical distancing measures, we find increases in interpersonal contact rates over the subsequent two waves, pushing \\(R_0\\) above 1. We also find significant differences in numbers of reported contacts by age, gender, race and ethnicity. Certain demographic groups, including people under 45, males, and Black and Hispanic respondents, have significantly higher contact rates than the rest of the population. Tracking changes in interpersonal contact patterns can provide rapid assessments of the impact of physical distancing policies over the course of the pandemic and help identify at-risk populations.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dennis Feehan","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Ayesha Mahmud","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Joseph M Flynn","author_inst":"University of Bath"},{"author_name":"Jens Roesner","author_inst":"University of Bath"},{"author_name":"Siu Man Lee","author_inst":"Royal United Hospital, Bath"},{"author_name":"Patrick Magee","author_inst":"BMI Bath Clinic"},{"author_name":"Malcolm Thornton","author_inst":"Royal United Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Bath"},{"author_name":"Andy Padkin","author_inst":"Royal United Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Bath"},{"author_name":"Harinderjit S Gill","author_inst":"University of Bath"},{"author_name":"Michael Chung","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Adam Bernheim","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Venkatesh Mani","author_inst":"BioMedical Engineering and Imaging Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Claudia Calcagno","author_inst":"BioMedical Engineering and Imaging Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Kunwei Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yet-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Shaolin Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yet-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Hong Shan","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yet-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Jian Lv","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Nanxishan Hospital, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China"},{"author_name":"Tongtong Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, The Second People's Hospital, Fuyang, Anhui, China"},{"author_name":"Junli Xia","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Bozhou Bone Trauma Hospital Image Center, Bozhou, Anhui, China"},{"author_name":"Qihua Long","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Remin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Sharon Steinberger","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Adam Jacobi","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Timothy Deyer","author_inst":"East River Medical Imaging, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Marta Luksza","author_inst":"Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Fang Liu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Brent P.

Standard epidemic models provide a theoretically well-founded dynamical description of disease incidence. For COVID-19 with infectiousness peak- ing before and at symptom onset, the SEIR model explains the hidden build-up of exposed indi- viduals which creates challenges for containment strategies. However, spatial heterogeneity raises questions about the adequacy of modeling epidemic outbreaks on the level of a whole country. Here, we show that by applying sequential data assimilation to the stochastic SEIR epidemic model, we can capture the dynamic behavior of outbreaks on a regional level. Regional modeling, with rela- tively low numbers of infected and demographic noise, accounts for both spatial heterogeneity and stochasticity. Based on adapted models, short-term predictions can be achieved. Thus, with the help of these sequential data assimilation methods, more realistic epidemic models are within reach.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ralf Engbert","author_inst":"University of Potsdam, Germany"},{"author_name":"Maximilian M.

It is likely different countries and populations respond differently to the same NPIs and that these differences are reflected in the epidemic development. Methods We build a Bayesian model that estimates the number of deaths on a given day dependent on changes in the basic reproductive number, R0, due to changes in mobility patterns. We utilize mobility data from Google mobility reports using five different categories: retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, transit stations, workplace and residential. The importance of each mobility category for predicting changes in R0 is estimated through the model. Findings The changes in mobility have a large overlap with the introduction of governmental NPIs, highlighting the importance of government action for population behavioural change. The grocery and pharmacy sector is estimated to account for 97 % of the reduction in R0 (95% confidence interval [0*79,0*99]). Interpretation Our model predicts three-week epidemic forecasts, using real-time observations of changes in mobility patterns, which can provide governments with direct feedback on the effects of their NPIs. The model predicts the changes in a majority of the countries accurately but overestimates the impact of NPIs in Sweden and Denmark and underestimates them in France and Belgium.

I develop a flexible behavioral, dynamic, and sectorial epidemic policy model comprising both endogenous virus transmission and public health and citizen responses. Applicable to the full epidemic cycle including confinement, deconfinement, and resurgence, the model allows exploring the multivariate impact of distinct policy interventions, including general and targeted testing and social contact reduction efforts. Using a cross-sectional calibration to data on the ongoing coronavirus disease outbreak about reported cases and deaths, tests performed, and social interactions from six countries (South Korea, Germany, Italy, France, Sweden, and the United States), I demonstrate how early, rapid, and extensive buildup of testing and social contact reduction efforts interplay to suppress the outbreak. I then use the model to show and quantify limits to the extent of deconfinement and illustrate the critical role of targeted approaches for managing post peak deconfinement and resurgence. To aid necessary public and expert understanding of outbreak control strategies the model is accessible in the form of a web-based management flight simulator.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jeroen Struben","author_inst":"emlyon business school"},{"author_name":"Arne Elofsson","author_inst":"Stockholm University\/Science for Life Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Reinhold Kliegl","author_inst":"University of Potsdam, Germany"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Reich","author_inst":"University of Potsdam, Germany"},{"author_name":"Siu Man Lee","author_inst":"Royal United Hospital, Bath"},{"author_name":"Patrick Magee","author_inst":"BMI Bath Clinic"},{"author_name":"Malcolm Thornton","author_inst":"Royal United Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Bath"},{"author_name":"Andy Padkin","author_inst":"Royal United Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Bath"},{"author_name":"Harinderjit S Gill","author_inst":"University of Bath"},{"author_name":"Michael Chung","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Adam Bernheim","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Venkatesh Mani","author_inst":"BioMedical Engineering and Imaging Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Claudia Calcagno","author_inst":"BioMedical Engineering and Imaging Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Kunwei Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yet-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Shaolin Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yet-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Hong Shan","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yet-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Jian Lv","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Nanxishan Hospital, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China"},{"author_name":"Tongtong Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, The Second People's Hospital, Fuyang, Anhui, China"},{"author_name":"Junli Xia","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Bozhou Bone Trauma Hospital Image Center, Bozhou, Anhui, China"},{"author_name":"Qihua Long","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Remin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Sharon Steinberger","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Adam Jacobi","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Timothy Deyer","author_inst":"East River Medical Imaging, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Marta Luksza","author_inst":"Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Fang Liu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Brent P.

In the United States these orders were not coordinated at the national level during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which creates an opportunity to use spatial and temporal variation to measure the policies' effect with greater accuracy. Here, we combine data on the timing of stay-at-home orders with daily confirmed COVID-19 cases and fatalities at the county level in the United States. We estimate the effect of stay-at-home orders using a difference-in-differences design that accounts for unmeasured local variation in factors like health systems and demographics and for unmeasured temporal variation in factors like national mitigation actions and access to tests. Compared to counties that did not implement stay-at-home orders, the results show that the orders are associated with a 30.2 percent (11.0 to 45.2) reduction in weekly cases after one week, a 40.0 percent (23.4 to 53.0) reduction after two weeks, and a 48.6 percent (31.1 to 61.7) reduction after three weeks. Stay-at-home orders are also associated with a 59.8 percent (18.3 to 80.2) reduction in weekly fatalities after three weeks. These results suggest that stay-at-home orders reduced confirmed cases by 390,000 (170,000 to 680,000) and fatalities by 41,000 (27,000 to 59,000) within the first three weeks in localities where they were implemented.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"James H.

We improve on their estimation by using data from the number of patients in intensive care, which provides two advantages over the number of deaths: first, it can be used to construct a signal with less bias: as the healthcare system of a country reaches saturation, the mortality rate would be expected to increase, which would bias the estimates of Rt and of the impact of measures implemented to contain the epidemic; and second, it is a signal with less lag, as the time from onset of symptoms to ICU admission is shorter than the time from onset to death. The intensive care signal we use is not just the number of people in ICU, as this would also be biased if the healthcare system has reached saturation. Instead, we estimate the daily demand of intensive care, as the sum of two components: the part that is satisfied (new ICU admissions) and the part that is not (which results in excess mortality). Thanks to the advantages of this ICU signal in terms of timeliness and bias, we find that most of the countries in the study have already reached Rt<1 with 95% confidence (Italy, Spain, Austria, Denmark, France, Norway and Switzerland, but not Belgium or Sweden), whereas the original methodology of Flaxman et al (2020), even with updated data, would only find Rt<1 with 95% confidence for Italy and Switzerland.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samuel Hurtado","author_inst":"NA"},{"author_name":"David Tinajero","author_inst":"NA"},{"author_name":"Nick Obradovich","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Human Development"},{"author_name":"Remy Levin","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Siu Man Lee","author_inst":"Royal United Hospital, Bath"},{"author_name":"Patrick Magee","author_inst":"BMI Bath Clinic"},{"author_name":"Malcolm Thornton","author_inst":"Royal United Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Bath"},{"author_name":"Andy Padkin","author_inst":"Royal United Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Bath"},{"author_name":"Harinderjit S Gill","author_inst":"University of Bath"},{"author_name":"Michael Chung","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Adam Bernheim","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Venkatesh Mani","author_inst":"BioMedical Engineering and Imaging Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Claudia Calcagno","author_inst":"BioMedical Engineering and Imaging Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Kunwei Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yet-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Shaolin Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yet-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Hong Shan","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yet-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Jian Lv","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Nanxishan Hospital, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China"},{"author_name":"Tongtong Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, The Second People's Hospital, Fuyang, Anhui, China"},{"author_name":"Junli Xia","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Bozhou Bone Trauma Hospital Image Center, Bozhou, Anhui, China"},{"author_name":"Qihua Long","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Remin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Sharon Steinberger","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Adam Jacobi","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Timothy Deyer","author_inst":"East River Medical Imaging, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Marta Luksza","author_inst":"Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Fang Liu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Brent P.

It can be easily modified to develop new models for the problem. A generalized method is adopted to simulate worldwide outbreaks in an efficient, fast, and simple way. To get a good tracking of the virus spread, a sum of sigmoid functions was proposed to capture any dynamic changes in the data. The parameters used for the input (infection and recovery rate functions) are computed using the parameter estimation tool in MATLAB. Several statistic methods were applied for the rate function including linear, mean, root-mean-square, and standard deviation. In addition, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system is employed and proposed to train the model and predict its output. The programs can be used as a teaching tool and for research studies.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ismael Khorshed Abdulrahman","author_inst":"Erbil Polytechnic University"},{"author_name":"Jiarui Liu","author_inst":"Department of Economics, University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Timothy Schwieg","author_inst":"Becker Friedman Institute, University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Remy Levin","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Siu Man Lee","author_inst":"Royal United Hospital, Bath"},{"author_name":"Patrick Magee","author_inst":"BMI Bath Clinic"},{"author_name":"Malcolm Thornton","author_inst":"Royal United Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Bath"},{"author_name":"Andy Padkin","author_inst":"Royal United Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Bath"},{"author_name":"Harinderjit S Gill","author_inst":"University of Bath"},{"author_name":"Michael Chung","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Adam Bernheim","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Venkatesh Mani","author_inst":"BioMedical Engineering and Imaging Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Claudia Calcagno","author_inst":"BioMedical Engineering and Imaging Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Kunwei Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yet-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Shaolin Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yet-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Hong Shan","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yet-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Jian Lv","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Nanxishan Hospital, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China"},{"author_name":"Tongtong Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, The Second People's Hospital, Fuyang, Anhui, China"},{"author_name":"Junli Xia","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Bozhou Bone Trauma Hospital Image Center, Bozhou, Anhui, China"},{"author_name":"Qihua Long","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Remin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Sharon Steinberger","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Adam Jacobi","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic, Molecular and Interventional Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Timothy Deyer","author_inst":"East River Medical Imaging, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Marta Luksza","author_inst":"Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Fang Liu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Brent P.
