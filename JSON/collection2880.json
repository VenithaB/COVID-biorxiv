In this retrospective case-control study, we used de-identified electronic health records (EHR) from the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Health System between March 9th, 2020 and June 14th, 2020 to identify risk factors for COVID-19 susceptibility (severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) PCR test positive), inpatient admission, and severe outcomes (treatment in an intensive care unit or intubation). Of the 26,602 individuals tested by PCR for SARS-CoV-2, 992 were COVID-19 positive (3.7% of Tested), 220 were admitted in the hospital (22% of COVID-19 positive), and 77 had a severe outcome (35% of Inpatient). Consistent with previous studies, males and individuals older than 65 years old had increased risk of inpatient admission. Notably, individuals self-identifying as Hispanic or Latino constituted an increasing percentage of COVID-19 patients as disease severity escalated, comprising 24% of those testing positive, but 40% of those with a severe outcome, a disparity that remained after correcting for medical co-morbidities. Cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and renal disease were premorbid risk factors present before SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing associated with COVID-19 susceptibility. Less well-established risk factors for COVID-19 susceptibility included pre-existing dementia (odds ratio (OR) 5.2 [3.2-8.3], p=2.6 x 10-10), mental health conditions (depression OR 2.1 [1.6-2.8], p=1.1 x 10-6) and vitamin D deficiency (OR 1.8 [1.4-2.2], p=5.7 x 10-6). Renal diseases including end-stage renal disease and anemia due to chronic renal disease were the predominant premorbid risk factors for COVID-19 inpatient admission. Other less established risk factors for COVID-19 inpatient admission included previous renal transplant (OR 9.7 [2.8-39], p=3.2x10-4) and disorders of the immune system (OR 6.0 [2.3, 16], p=2.7x10-4). Prior use of oral steroid medications was associated with decreased COVID-19 positive testing risk (OR 0.61 [0.45, 0.81], p=4.3x10-4), but increased inpatient admission risk (OR 4.5 [2.3, 8.9], p=1.8x10-5). We did not observe that prior use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers increased the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, being admitted to the hospital, or having a severe outcome. This study involving direct EHR extraction identified known and less well-established demographics, and prior diagnoses and medications as risk factors for COVID-19 susceptibility and inpatient admission. Knowledge of these risk factors including marked ethnic disparities observed in disease severity should guide government policies, identify at-risk populations, inform clinical decision making, and prioritize future COVID-19 research.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Timothy S Chang","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Yi Ding","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Malika K Freund","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Ruth Johnson","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Tommer Schwarz","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Julie M Yabu","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Chad Hazlett","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey N Chiang","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Ami Wulf","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"- UCLA Health Data Mart Working Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Daniel H Geschwind","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Manish J Butte","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Bogdan Pasaniuc","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Raisa Loginov","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL), Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Satu Kurkela","author_inst":"HUS Diagnostic Center, HUSLAB, Clinical Microbiology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Finland"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.03.20145722","rel_title":"Kinetics and performance of the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody assay","rel_date":"2020-07-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.03.20145722","rel_abs":"Objectives: To assess the performance (sensitivity and specificity) of the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody assay across three clinical settings. Methods: Antibody testing was performed on three clinical cohorts of COVID-19 disease: hospitalised patients with PCR confirmation, hospitalized patients with a clinical diagnosis but negative PCR, and symptomatic healthcare workers (HCWs). Pre-pandemic respiratory infection sera were tested as negative controls. The sensitivity of the assay was calculated at different time points (<5 days, 5-9 days, 10-14 days, 15-19 days, >20 days, >42 days), and compared between cohorts. Results: Performance of the Abbot Architect SARS-CoV-2 assay varied significantly between cohorts. For PCR confirmed hospitalised patients (n = 114), early sensitivity was low: <5 days: 44.4% (95%CI: 18.9%-73.3%), 5-9 days: 32.6% (95%CI, 20.5%-47.5%), 10-14 days: 65.2% (95% CI 44.9%-81.2%), 15-20 days: 66.7% (95% CI: 39.1%-86.2%) but by day 20, sensitivity was 100% (95%CI, 86.2-100%). In contrast, 17 out of 114 symptomatic healthcare workers tested at >20 days had negative results, generating a sensitivity of 85.1% (95%CI, 77.4% - 90.5%). All pre-pandemic sera were negative, a specificity of 100%. Seroconversion rates were similar for PCR positive and PCR negative hospitalised cases. Conclusions: The sensitivity of the Abbot Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay increases over time, with sensitivity not peaking until 20 days post symptoms. Performance varied markedly by setting, with sensitivity significantly worse in symptomatic healthcare workers than in the hospitalised cohort. Clinicians, policymakers, and patients should be aware of the reduced sensitivity in this setting.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fergus Hamilton","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Peter Muir","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Marie Attwood","author_inst":"North Bristol NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Alan Noel","author_inst":"North Bristol NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Barry Vipond","author_inst":"Public Heath England"},{"author_name":"Richard Hopes","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Ed Moran","author_inst":"North Bristol NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Nick Maskell","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Deborah Warwick","author_inst":"North Bristol NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Mahableshwar Albur","author_inst":"North Bristol NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Turner","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Alasdair P MacGowan","author_inst":"North Bristol NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"David T Arnold","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Raisa Loginov","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL), Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Satu Kurkela","author_inst":"HUS Diagnostic Center, HUSLAB, Clinical Microbiology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Finland"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.02.20145565","rel_title":"Efficacy of Corticosteroids in Non-Intensive Care Unit Patients with COVID-19 Pneumonia from the New York Metropolitan region","rel_date":"2020-07-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.02.20145565","rel_abs":"Introduction: The role of systemic corticosteroid as a therapeutic agent for patients with COVID19 pneumonia is controversial. Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of corticosteroids in non-intensive care unit (ICU) patients with COVID19 pneumonia complicated by acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF). Methods: This was a single center retrospective cohort study, comprising of 205 patients admitted to the general wards with COVID19 pneumonia. The primary outcome was a composite of ICU transfer, intubation, or inhospital mortality. Cox proportional hazard regression was implemented. Result: Among 205 patients, 60 (29.27%) were treated with corticosteroid. The mean age was ~57 years, and ~75% were men. Thirteen patients (22.41%) developed a primary composite outcome in the corticosteroid cohort vs. 54 (37.5%) patients in the non-corticosteroid cohort (P=0.039). The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for the development of the composite primary outcome was 0.15 (95% CI, 0.07 to 0.33; P <0.001). The adjusted hazard ratio for ICU transfer was 0.16 (95% CI, 0.07 to 0.34; P < 0.001), intubation was 0.31 (95% CI, 0.14 to 0.70; P=0.005), death was 0.53 (95% CI, 0.22 to 1.31; P=0.172), and discharge was 3.65 (95% CI, 2.20 to 6.06; P<0.001). The corticosteroid cohort had increasing SpO2\/FiO2 over time compared to the non-corticosteroid cohort who experience decreasing SpO2\/FiO2 over time. Conclusion: Among non-ICU patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by AHRF, treatment with corticosteroid was associated with a significantly lower risk of the primary composite outcome of ICU transfer, intubation, or inhospital death.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Monil Majmundar","author_inst":"New York Medical College, Metropolitan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tikal Kansara","author_inst":"New York Medical College, Metropolitan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Joanna M Lenik","author_inst":"New York Medical College, Metropolitan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hansang Park","author_inst":"New York Medical College, Metropolitan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kuldeep Ghosh","author_inst":"New York Medical College, Metropolitan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rajkumar Doshi","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Palak Shah","author_inst":"SBKS Medical College and Research Institute, Dhiraj General Hospital, Vadodara, Gujarat, India"},{"author_name":"Ashish Kumar","author_inst":"Saint John's Medical College, Banglore, Karnataka, India"},{"author_name":"Hossam Amin","author_inst":"New York Medical College, Metropolitan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shobhana Chaudhari","author_inst":"New York Medical College, Metropolitan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Imnette Habtes","author_inst":"New York Medical College, Metropolitan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alasdair P MacGowan","author_inst":"North Bristol NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"David T Arnold","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Raisa Loginov","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL), Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Satu Kurkela","author_inst":"HUS Diagnostic Center, HUSLAB, Clinical Microbiology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Finland"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.02.20145391","rel_title":"Laboratory findings that predict a poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients with diabetes: A meta-analysis","rel_date":"2020-07-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.02.20145391","rel_abs":"Diabetes is one of the main comorbidities in patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the causative agent of the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Firearm violence is a significant public health and safety problem in the United States. A surge in firearm purchases following the onset of the coronavirus pandemic may increase rates of firearm violence. Objective. To estimate the association between changes in firearm purchasing and interpersonal firearm violence during the coronavirus pandemic. Design. Cross-sectional time series study. We estimate the difference between observed rates of firearm purchases and those predicted by seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average models. Using negative binomial models, we then estimate the association between excess firearm purchases and rates of interpersonal firearm violence within states, controlling for confounders. Setting. The 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia. Hawaii and Alaska are excluded due to missing or incomplete data. Exposure. The difference between observed and expected rates of firearm purchases in March through May 2020, approximated by National Instant Criminal Background Check System records. Main Outcome and Measure. Fatal and nonfatal injuries from interpersonal firearm violence, recorded in the Gun Violence Archive. Results. We estimate that there were 2.1 million excess firearm purchases from March through May 2020--a 64.3% increase over expected volume, and an increase of 644.4 excess purchases per 100,000 population. We estimate a relative rate of death and injury from firearm violence of 1.015 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.005 to 1.025) for every 100 excess purchases per 100,000, in models that incorporate variation in purchasing across states and control for effects of the pandemic common to all states. This reflects an increase of 776 fatal and nonfatal injuries (95% CI: 216 to 1,335) over the number expected had no increase in purchasing occurred. Conclusions and Relevance. We find a significant increase in firearm violence in the United States associated with the coronavirus pandemic-related surge in firearm purchasing. Our findings are consistent with existing research. Firearm violence prevention strategies may be particularly important during the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julia P.

Information regarding the burden of COVID-19 epidemic in HCWs living in Mexico is scarce. Here, we aimed to explore the epidemiology, symptoms, and risk factors associated with adverse outcomes in HCWs in Mexico City. METHODS: We explored data collected by the National Epidemiological Surveillance System in Mexico City, in HCWs who underwent real-time RT-PCR test. We explored COVID-19 outcomes in HCWs and the performance of symptoms to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: As of September 20th, 2020, 57,758 HCWs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and 17,531 were confirmed (30.35%); 6,610 were nurses (37.70%), 4,910 physicians (28.0%), 267 dentists (1.52%) and 5,744 laboratory personnel and other HCWs (32.76%). Overall, 2,378 HCWs required hospitalization (4.12%), 2,648 developed severe COVID-19 (4.58%), and 336 required mechanical-ventilatory support (0.58%). Lethality was recorded in 472 (0.82%) cases. We identified 635 asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections (3.62%). Compared with general population, HCWs had higher incidence, testing, asymptomatic and mortality rates. No individual symptom offers adequate performance to detect SARS-CoV2. Older HCWs with chronic non-communicable diseases and severe respiratory symptoms were associated with higher risk for adverse outcome; physicians were at higher risk compared with nurses and other HCWs. CONCLUSIONS: We report a high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCWs in Mexico City. Symptoms as a screening method is not efficient to discern those HCWs with a positive PCR-RT test. Particular attention should focus on HCWs with risk factors to prevent adverse outcomes.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Neftali Eduardo Antonio-Villa","author_inst":"MD\/PhD (PECEM), Faculty of Medicine, National Autonomous University of Mexico."},{"author_name":"Omar Yaxmehen Bello-Chavolla","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Geriatria"},{"author_name":"Arsenio Vargas-Vazquez","author_inst":"MD\/PhD (PECEM), Faculty of Medicine, National Autonomous University of Mexico."},{"author_name":"Carlos A.

Such NPIs include social distancing, school closures, limiting international travel and complete lockdown. Worldwide the NPIs enforced to limit the spread of COVID-19 are now being lifted. Understanding how the risk increases when NPIs are lifted is important for decision making. Treating NPIs equally across countries and regions limits the possibility for modelling differences in epidemic response, as the response to the NPIs influences can vary between regions and this can affect the epidemic outcome, so do the strength and speed of lifting these. Our solution to this is to measure mobility changes from mobile phone data and their impacts on the basic reproductive number. We model the epidemic in all US states to compare the difference in outcome if NPIs are lifted or retained. We show that keeping NPIs just a few weeks longer has a substantial impact on the epidemic outcome.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patrick Bryant","author_inst":"Stockholm University\/Science for Life Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Arne Elofsson","author_inst":"Stockholm University"},{"author_name":"Xi Zhang","author_inst":"The University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Carlos A.

We aimed to estimate the serial interval and basic reproduction number for Jodhpur, India and to use it for prediction of epidemic size for next one month. Methods: Contact tracing of SARSCoV2 infected individuals was done to obtain the serial intervals. Aggregate and instantaneous R0 values were derived and epidemic projection was done using R software v4.0.0. Results: From among 79 infector infectee pairs, the estimated median and 95 percentile values of serial interval were 5.98 days (95% CI 5.39 to 6.65) and 13.17 days (95% CI 11.27 to 15.57), respectively. The overall R0 value in the first 30 days of outbreak was 1.64 (95% CI 1.12 to 2.25) which subsequently decreased to 1.07 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.09). The instantaneous R0 value over 14 days window ranged from a peak of 3.71 (95% CI 1.85 -2.08) to 0.88 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.96) as on 24 June 2020. The projected COVID-19 case-load over next one month was 1881 individuals. Reduction of R0 from 1.17 to 1.085 could result in 23% reduction in projected epidemic size over the next one month. Conclusion: Aggressive testing, contact-tracing and isolation of infected individuals in Jodhpur district resulted in reduction of R0. Further strengthening of control measures could lead to substantial reduction of COVID19 epidemic size. A data-driven strategy was found useful in surge capacity planning and guiding the public health strategy at local level.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Suman Saurabh","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Jodhpur"},{"author_name":"Mahendra Kumar Verma","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Jodhpur, India"},{"author_name":"Vaishali Gautam","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Jodhpur, India"},{"author_name":"Akhil Goel","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Jodhpur, India"},{"author_name":"Manoj Kumar Gupta","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Jodhpur, India"},{"author_name":"Pankaj Bhardwaj","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Jodhpur, India"},{"author_name":"Sanjeev Misra","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Jodhpur, India"},{"author_name":"Hannah S.

Health literacy (HL) has been linked to health outcomes and refers to the ability to access, understand, appraise and apply health information in order to make good health decisions. When restrictions are gradually lifted, individual HL becomes essential to control the pandemic and to prevent the resumption of these restriction, should infection numbers surge again. The aim of this rapid scoping review, for which only studies from the general population were considered, was to describe the extent of existing research on HL in the context of previous coronavirus outbreaks (SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2). Facets of HL that were of particular interest were: type of assessment of HL (theory-based versus proxy assessment; validated instrument versus ad hoc assessment), domains of HL, interventions aiming to improve HL during outbreak situations, and HL surveillance during outbreak. METHODS: We searched two major databases and included publications of quantitative and qualitative studies in English and German on any type of research on the functional, critical and communicative domains of HL conducted in the context of the three outbreaks in the general population. We extracted and tabulated relevant data and narratively reported where and when the study was conducted, the design and method used, and how HL was measured. FINDINGS: 72 studies were included. Three investigated HL or explicitly referred to the concept of HL, 14 were guided by health behaviour theory. We did not find any study designed to develop or psychometrically evaluate pandemic HL instruments, or relate pandemic or general HL to a pandemic outcome, or any controlled intervention study. Type of assessment of the domains of HL varied widely. INTERPRETATION: Theory-driven observational studies as well as interventions, examining whether pandemic-related HL can be improved are needed. In addition, the development and validation of instruments that measure pandemic-related HL is desirable.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Uwe Matterne","author_inst":"Otto von Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Nina Egger","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Health Education, Freiburg University of Education, Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jana Tempes","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Health Education, Freiburg University of Education, Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Christina Tischer","author_inst":"Institute of Social Medicine and Health Systems Research, Medical Faculty, Otto von Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jonas Lander","author_inst":"Institute for Epidemiology, Social Medicine and Health Systems Research, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany"},{"author_name":"Marie-Luise Dierks","author_inst":"Institute for Epidemiology, Social Medicine and Health Systems Research, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany"},{"author_name":"Eva-Maria Bitzer","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Health Education, Freiburg University of Education, Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Christian Apfelbacher","author_inst":"Institute of Social Medicine and Health Systems Research, Medical Faculty, Otto von Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Garen J.

As the US faces this health crisis, the magnitude, and rigor of their initial public health response was unprecedented. As a response, the entire nation shutdown at the state-level for the duration of approximately one to three months. These public health interventions, however, were not arbitrarily decided, but rather, implemented as a result of evidence-based practices. These practices were a result of lessons learned during the 1918 influenza pandemic and the city-level non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) taken across the US. During the 1918 pandemic, two model cities, St. Louis, MO, and Philadelphia, PA, carried out two different approaches to address the spreading disease, which resulted in two distinctly different outcomes. Our group has evaluated the state-level public health response adopted by states across the US, with a focus on New York, California, Florida, and Texas, and compared the effectiveness of reducing the spread of COVID-19. Our assessments show that while the states mentioned above benefited from the implementations of early preventative measures, they inadequately replicated the desired outcomes observed in St. Louis during the 1918 crisis. Our study indicates that there are other factors, including health disparities that may influence the effectiveness of public health interventions applied. Identifying more specific health determinants may help implement targeted interventions aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19 and improving health equity.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aliea M.

Healthcare workers are not only at heightened risk of infection, but also of adverse mental health outcomes. Identification of organizational, collegial and individual risk and resilience factors impacting the mental health of healthcare workers are needed to inform preparedness planning and sustainable response. Methods: We performed a rapid systematic review to identify, assess and summarize available research on the mental health impact of the covid-19 pandemic on healthcare workers. On 11 May 2020, we utilized the Norwegian Institute of Public Health's Live map of covid-19 evidence, the visualization of a database of 20,738 screened studies, to identify studies for inclusion. We included studies reporting on any type of mental health outcome in any type of healthcare workers during the pandemic. We described interventions reported by the studies, and narratively summarized mental health-related outcomes, as study heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis. We assessed study quality using design-specific instruments. Results: We included 59 studies, reporting on a total of 54,707 healthcare workers. The prevalence of general psychological distress across the studies ranged from 7-97% (median 37%), anxiety 9-90% (median 24%), depression 5-51% (median 21%), and sleeping problems 34-65% (median 37%). Seven studies reported on implementing mental health interventions, and most focused on individual symptom reduction, but none reported on effects of the interventions. In most studies, healthcare workers reported low interest in and use of professional help, and greater reliance on social support and contact with family and friends. Exposure to covid-19 was the most commonly reported correlate of mental health problems, followed by female gender, and worry about infection or about infecting others. Social support correlated with less mental health problems. Discussion: Healthcare workers in a variety of fields, positions, and exposure risks are reporting anxiety, depression, sleep problems, and distress during the covid-19 pandemic, but most studies do not report comparative data on mental health symptoms. before the pandemic. There seems to be a mismatch between risk factors for adverse mental health outcomes among healthcare workers in the current pandemic and their needs and preferences, and the individual psychopathology focus of current interventions. Efforts to help healthcare workers sustain healthy relationships to colleagues, family and friends over time may be paramount to safeguard what is already an important source of support during the prolonged crisis. Expanding interventions' focus to incorporate organizational, collegial and family factors to support healthcare workers responding to the pandemic could improve acceptability and efficacy of interventions. Other: The protocol for this review is available online. No funding was received.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ashley Elizabeth Muller","author_inst":"Norwegian Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Elisabet Vivianne Hafstad","author_inst":"Norwegian Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Jan Peter William Himmels","author_inst":"Norwegian Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Geir Smedslund","author_inst":"Norwegian Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Signe Flottorp","author_inst":"Norwegian Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Synne Stensland","author_inst":"Norwegian Centre for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies, Oslo, Norway, and Research and Communication Unit for Musculoskeletal Health (FORMI), Division of Cl"},{"author_name":"Stijn Stroobants","author_inst":"Humanitarian Services, Belgian Red Cross, Mechelen, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Stijn Van de Velde","author_inst":"Norwegian Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Gunn Elisabeth Vist","author_inst":"Norwegian Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Shobhana Chaudhari","author_inst":"New York Medical College, Metropolitan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Imnette Habtes","author_inst":"New York Medical College, Metropolitan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alasdair P MacGowan","author_inst":"North Bristol NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"David T Arnold","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Raisa Loginov","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL), Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Satu Kurkela","author_inst":"HUS Diagnostic Center, HUSLAB, Clinical Microbiology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Finland"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"occupational and environmental health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.03.20145664","rel_title":"Battle with COVID-19 Under Partial to Zero Lockdowns in India","rel_date":"2020-07-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.03.20145664","rel_abs":"The cumulative records of COVID-19 are rapidly increasing day by day in India. The key question prevailing in minds of all is when will it get over? There have been several attempts in literature to address this question using time series, Machine learning, epidemiological and statistical models. However due to high level of uncertainty in the domain and lack of big historical data, the performance of these models suffer. In this work, we present an intuitive model that uses a combination of epidemiological model (SEIR) and mathematical curve fitting method to forecast spread of COVID-19 in India in future. By using the combination model, we get characteristics benefits of these models under limited knowledge and historical data about the novel Coronavirus. Instead of fixing parameters of the standard SEIR model before simulation, we propose to learn them from the real data set consisting of progression of Corona spread in India. The learning of model is carefully designed by understanding that available data set consist of records of cases under full, partial to zero lockdown phases in India. Hence, we make two separate predictions by our propose model. One under the situation of full lockdown in India and, other with partial to zero restrictions in India. With continued strict lockdown after May 03, 2020, our model predicted May 14, 2020 as the date of peak of Coronavirus in India. However, in current scenario of partial to zero lockdown phase in India, the peak of Coronavirus cases is predicted to be July 31, 2020. These two predictions presented in this work provide awareness among citizens of India on importance of control measures such as full, partial and zero lockdown and the spread of Corona disease infection rate. In addition to this, it is a beneficial study for the government of India to plan the things ahead.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sakshi Babbar","author_inst":"UNIVO, Edutech"},{"author_name":"Elisabet Vivianne Hafstad","author_inst":"Norwegian Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Jan Peter William Himmels","author_inst":"Norwegian Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Geir Smedslund","author_inst":"Norwegian Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Signe Flottorp","author_inst":"Norwegian Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Synne Stensland","author_inst":"Norwegian Centre for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies, Oslo, Norway, and Research and Communication Unit for Musculoskeletal Health (FORMI), Division of Cl"},{"author_name":"Stijn Stroobants","author_inst":"Humanitarian Services, Belgian Red Cross, Mechelen, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Stijn Van de Velde","author_inst":"Norwegian Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Gunn Elisabeth Vist","author_inst":"Norwegian Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Shobhana Chaudhari","author_inst":"New York Medical College, Metropolitan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Imnette Habtes","author_inst":"New York Medical College, Metropolitan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alasdair P MacGowan","author_inst":"North Bristol NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"David T Arnold","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Raisa Loginov","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL), Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Satu Kurkela","author_inst":"HUS Diagnostic Center, HUSLAB, Clinical Microbiology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Finland"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.02.20144956","rel_title":"Increasing Virus Test Capacity via Recursive Pool Testing with an Application to SARS-CoV-2 Testing","rel_date":"2020-07-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.02.20144956","rel_abs":"In the context of adequate reactions to the current Covid-19 pandemic, Seifried, Ciesek et al.

The extent of the spread of COVID-19 within populations is uncertain since diagnostic tests have not been carried out on all eligible persons and doing such diagnostic tests on everyone is much less feasible in developing countries such as Nigeria. Tests for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, are more affordable, readily available, and require minimal training than current diagnostic tests. Employing a seroepidemiological strategy, serological tests were conducted on 66 volunteering staff and patients at the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital (UCTH), a Federal Government owned tertiary healthcare facility, to determine the extent of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, from 17th to 25th June 2020. Using a COVID-19 IgG\/IgM Rapid Test Cassette with emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States, it was observed that of the 66 samples tested, 5 (7.6%) were both IgG and IgM positive and 17 (26%) were IgG positive. Moreover, for 44 of the 66 participants, simultaneous tests were carried out using a rapid test kit from a different manufacturer but without FDA-EUA and all the results completely matched with the FDA-EUA kit, except one case where the FDA-EUA kit showed positive for both IgG and IgM while the other kit was positive only for IgM. The 26% positive IgG indicates a high exposure rate for the hospital staff and patients and points to community transmission where the facility is situated. Hence, immediate activation of WHO guidelines for controlling community transmission is called for. These results can further serve as a pilot study to guide public health policies in response to COVID-19 pandemic in both the general population and in healthcare settings.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marcus Inyama Asuquo","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, College of Medical Sciences, University of Calabar, Calabar, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Emmanuel Effa","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, College of Medical Sciences, University of Calabar, Calabar, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Akaninyene Otu","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, College of Medical Sciences, University of Calabar, Calabar, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Okokon Ita","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, College of Medical Sciences, University of Calabar, Calabar, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Ubong Udoh","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, College of Medical Sciences, University of Calabar, Calabar, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Victor Umoh","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, College of Health Sciences, University of Uyo, Uyo, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Oluwabukola Gbotosho","author_inst":"Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, 45229, USA"},{"author_name":"Anthonia Ikpeme","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, College of Medical Sciences, University of Calabar, Calabar, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Soter Ameh","author_inst":"Biostatistics Unit, Department of Community Medicine, University of Calabar, Calabar, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"William Egbe","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, College of Medical Sciences, University of Calabar, Calabar, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Margaret Etok","author_inst":"Joseph Ukpo Hospitals and Research Institutes (JUHRI), Afua Site, Ibiono Ibom, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Jochen Guck","author_inst":"Max-Planck-Zentrum f&uumlr Physik und Medizin, Staudtstr. 2, 91058 Erlangen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andrew Ekpenyong","author_inst":"Department of Physics, Creighton University, Omaha, NE, 68178, USA"},{"author_name":"Raisa Loginov","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL), Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Satu Kurkela","author_inst":"HUS Diagnostic Center, HUSLAB, Clinical Microbiology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Finland"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.03.20144949","rel_title":"The projected impact of mitigation and suppression strategies on the COVID-19 epidemic in Senegal: A modelling study","rel_date":"2020-07-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.03.20144949","rel_abs":"Background: Physical distancing measures that reduce social contacts have formed a key part of national COVID-19 containment and mitigation strategies. Many Sub-Saharan African nations are now facing increasing numbers of cases of COVID-19 and there is a need to understand what levels of measures may be required to successfully reduce transmission. Methods: We collated epidemiological data along with information on key COVID-19 specific response policies and health system capacity estimates for services needed to treat COVID-19 patients in Senegal. We calibrated an age-structured SEIR model to these data to capture transmission dynamics accounting for demography, contact patterns, hospital capacity and disease severity. We simulated the impact of mitigation and suppression strategies focussed on reducing social contact rates. Results: Senegal acted promptly to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and as a result has reduced the reproduction number from 1.9 (95% CI 1.7-2.2) to 1.3 (95% CI 1.2-1.5), which has slowed but not fully interrupted transmission. We estimate that continued spread is likely to peak in October, and to overwhelm the healthcare system with an estimated 77,400 deaths(95% CI 55,270-100,700). Further reductions in contact rates to suppress transmission (Rt<1) could significantly reduce this burden on healthcare services and improve overall health outcomes. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that Senegal has already significantly reduced transmission. Enhanced physical distancing measures and rapid scale up of hospital capacity is likely to be needed to reduce mortality and protect healthcare infrastructure from high levels of demand.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hayley A Thompson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Aminata Mboup","author_inst":"IRESSEF: Institut de Recherche en Sante de Surveillance Epidemiologique et de Formations"},{"author_name":"Badara Cisse","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shevanthi Nayagam","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Oliver J Watson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Charles Whittaker","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Patrick G T Walker","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Azra C Ghani","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Souleymane Mboup","author_inst":"IRESSEF: Institut de Recherche en Sante de Surveillance Epidemiologique et de Formations"},{"author_name":"William Egbe","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, College of Medical Sciences, University of Calabar, Calabar, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Margaret Etok","author_inst":"Joseph Ukpo Hospitals and Research Institutes (JUHRI), Afua Site, Ibiono Ibom, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Jochen Guck","author_inst":"Max-Planck-Zentrum f&uumlr Physik und Medizin, Staudtstr. 2, 91058 Erlangen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andrew Ekpenyong","author_inst":"Department of Physics, Creighton University, Omaha, NE, 68178, USA"},{"author_name":"Raisa Loginov","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL), Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Satu Kurkela","author_inst":"HUS Diagnostic Center, HUSLAB, Clinical Microbiology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Finland"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.03.20144931","rel_title":"Psychiatric symptoms, risk, and protective factors among university students in quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic in China","rel_date":"2020-07-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.03.20144931","rel_abs":"This study investigated psychiatric symptoms (depression, anxiety, and traumatic stress) during state-enforced quarantine among university students in China. We conducted a cross-sectional survey with 1,912 university students during March and April 2020.

Further, 19.56% endorsed some degree of suicidal ideation. We explored factors that may contribute to poor psychological health as well as those that may function as protective factors. Risk and protective factors examined included demographic variables, two known protective factors for mental health (mindfulness, perceived social support), four COVID-specific factors (COVID-19 related efficacy, perceived COVID-19 threat, perceived COVID-19 societal stigma, COVID-19 prosocial behavior) and screen media usage. Across psychiatric symptom domains, mindfulness was associated with lower symptom severity, while COVID-19 related financial stress, perceived COVID-19 societal stigma, and perceived COVID-19 threat were associated with higher symptom severity. COVID-19 threat and COVID-19 stigma showed main and interactive effects in predicting all mental health outcomes, with their combination associated with highest symptom severity. Average screen media device usage was 6 hours and usage was positively associated with depression. Female gender and COVID-19 prosocial behavior were associated with higher anxiety, while COVID-19 self-efficacy associated with lower anxiety symptoms.

Hyper-inflammation occurs in Covid-19 and is associated with worse outcomes. The efficacy of dexamethasone in preventing mortality in critical Covid-19 suggests that inflammation has a causal role in death. Whether this deleterious inflammation is primarily a direct response to the presence of SARS-CoV-2 requiring enhanced resistance, or an independent immunopathologic process necessitating enhanced tolerance, is unknown. Here we report an aberrant immune response in fatal Covid-19, principally involving the lung and reticuloendothelial system, that is not clearly topologically associated with the virus, indicating tissue-specific tolerance of SARS-CoV-2. We found that inflammation and organ dysfunction in fatal Covid-19 did not map to the widespread tissue and cellular distribution of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and protein, both between and within tissues. A monocyte\/myeloid-rich vasculitis was identified in the lung, along with an influx of macrophages\/monocytes into the parenchyma. In addition, stereotyped abnormal reticulo-endothelial responses (reactive plasmacytosis and iron-laden macrophages) were present and dissociated from the presence of virus in lymphoid tissues. Our results support virus-independent immunopathology being one of the primary mechanisms underlying fatal Covid-19. This supports prioritising pathogen tolerance as a therapeutic strategy in Covid-19, by better understanding non-injurious organ-specific viral tolerance mechanisms and targeting aberrant macrophage and plasma cell responses.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David A Dorward","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Clark D Russell","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"In Hwa Um","author_inst":"University of St Andrews"},{"author_name":"Mustafa Elshani","author_inst":"University of St Andrews"},{"author_name":"Stuart D Armstrong","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Rebekah Penrice-Randal","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Tracey Millar","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Chris EB Lerpiniere","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Giulia Tagliavini","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Catherine S Hartley","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Nadine P Randall","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Naomi N Gachanja","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Philippe MD Potey","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Alison M Anderson","author_inst":"Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Victoria L Campbell","author_inst":"Western General Hospital Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Alasdair J Duguid","author_inst":"Western General Hospital Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Wael Al Qsous","author_inst":"Western General Hospital Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ralph BouHaidar","author_inst":"Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"J Kenneth Baillie","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Kevin Dhaliwal","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"William A Wallace","author_inst":"Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Christopher OC Bellamy","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Sandrine Prost","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Colin Smith","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Julian A Hiscox","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"David J Harrison","author_inst":"University of St Andrews"},{"author_name":"Christopher D Lucas","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"- ICECAP","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.02.20144964","rel_title":"A systematic review of the smartphone applications available for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) and their assessment using the mobile app rating scale (MARS)","rel_date":"2020-07-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.02.20144964","rel_abs":"The global impact of COVID-19 pandemic has increased the need to rapidly develop and improve utilization of mobile applications across the healthcare continuum to address rising barriers of access to care due to social distancing challenges and allow continuity in sharing of health information, assist with COVID-19 activities including contact tracing, and providing useful information as needed.

We developed statistical regression models that allowed us to estimate the number of infected people from the viral load detected in the wastewater with a reliability close to 90%.

It can help to understand with a high degree of reliability the true magnitude of the epidemic in a place at any given time and can be used as an effective early warning tool for predicting outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Juan A Vallejo","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Institute of A Coruna"},{"author_name":"Soraya Rumbo-Feal","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Institute of A Coruna"},{"author_name":"Kelly Conde-Perez","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Institute of A Coruna"},{"author_name":"Angel Lopez-Oriona","author_inst":"Research Center for Information and Communication Technologies (CITIC), University of A Coruna"},{"author_name":"Javier Tarrio","author_inst":"Research Center for Information and Communication Technologies (CITIC), University of A Coruna"},{"author_name":"Ruben Reif","author_inst":"Advanced Scientific Research Center (CICA), University of A Coruna"},{"author_name":"Susana Ladra","author_inst":"Research Center for Information and Communication Technologies (CITIC), University of A Coruna"},{"author_name":"Bruno K Rodino-Janeiro","author_inst":"University of Vienna"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Nasser","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Institute of A Coruna"},{"author_name":"Angeles Cid","author_inst":"Advanced Scientific Research Center (CICA)- University of A Coruna"},{"author_name":"Maria C Veiga","author_inst":"Advanced Scientific Research Center (CICA)-University of A Coruna"},{"author_name":"Anton Acevedo","author_inst":"Hospital University Complex  of A Coruna"},{"author_name":"Carlos Lamora","author_inst":"Public wastewater treatment plant company EDAR Bens, S.A., A Coruna"},{"author_name":"German Bou","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Institute-Hospital University Complex of A Coruna"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Cao","author_inst":"Research Center for Information and Communication Technologies (CITIC), University of A Coruna-Technological Institute for Industrial Mathematics (ITMATI), Univ"},{"author_name":"Margarita Poza","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Institute-University of A Coruna"},{"author_name":"Wael Al Qsous","author_inst":"Western General Hospital Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ralph BouHaidar","author_inst":"Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"J Kenneth Baillie","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Kevin Dhaliwal","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"William A Wallace","author_inst":"Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Christopher OC Bellamy","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Sandrine Prost","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Colin Smith","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Julian A Hiscox","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"David J Harrison","author_inst":"University of St Andrews"},{"author_name":"Christopher D Lucas","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"- ICECAP","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.04.187583","rel_title":"Gender, race and parenthood impact academic productivity during the COVID-19 pandemic: from survey to action.","rel_date":"2020-07-04","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.04.187583","rel_abs":"While the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is altering academia dynamics, those juggling remote work and domestic demands - including childcare - have already felt the impacts on productivity. Female authors are facing a decrease in papers submission rates since the beginning of the pandemic period. The reasons for this decline in women productivity need to be further investigated. Here we show the influence of gender, parenthood and race in academics productivity during the pandemic period, based on a survey answered by 3,345 Brazilian academics from various knowledge areas and research institutions. Findings revealed that male academics - especially childless ones - were the least affected group, whereas female academics, especially Black women and mothers, were the most impacted group. This scenario will leave long-term effects on the career progression of the most affected groups. The results presented here are crucial for the development of actions and policies that aim to avoid further deepening the gender gap in science. This particular situation we are facing during the pandemic demands institutional flexibility and academia should foster the discussion about actions to benefit Black scientists and academics with families in the post-pandemic scenario.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fernanda Staniscuaski","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"Livia Kmetzsch","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"Eugenia Zandona","author_inst":"Universidade Estadual do Rio de Janeiro"},{"author_name":"Fernanda Reichert","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"Rossana C.

Patients with severe asthma may have a greater risk of dying from COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and enzyme proteases, transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and furin are needed for the attachment and invasion of the virus into host cells. We determined whether their expression in the airways of severe asthma patients is increased. Method. We examined the microarray mRNA expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and furin in the sputum, bronchial brush and bronchial biopsies of participants in the European U-BIOPRED cohort. Results. ACE2 and furin sputum gene expression was significantly increased in severe non-smoking asthma compared to mild-moderate asthma and healthy volunteers. By contrast, TMPRSS2 expression in bronchial biopsy and bronchial brushings was increased in severe smoking and ex-smoking asthmatics, and so was furin expression in bronchial brushings. Several clinical parameters including male gender, oral steroid use and nasal polyps were positively associated with ACE2, TMPRSS2 and furin expression levels. There was a higher expression of ACE2 and furin in the sputum neutrophilic molecular phenotype with inflammasome activation compared to the eosinophilic Type2-high or paucigranulocytic phenotypes. The enrichment score of the IL-13-Type2 gene signature was positively correlated with ACE2, TMPRSS2 and furin levels. Conclusion. These key determinants of virus entry into the lungs may contribute to the poorer outcomes from COVID-19 disease in patients with severe asthma.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nazanin Kermani","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Woo-jung Song","author_inst":"University of Ulsan College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alan Lunt","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Yusef Badi","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ali Versi","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Yike GUO","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Kai Sun","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Pank Bhavsar","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Peter Howarth","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Sven-Erik Dahlen","author_inst":"Karoilinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Peter Sterk","author_inst":"Amsterdam University"},{"author_name":"Ratko Djukanovic","author_inst":"Southampton University"},{"author_name":"Ian Adcock","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Kian Fan Chung","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Adriana Seixas","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Ciencias da Saude de Porto Alegre"},{"author_name":"Charley C.

Yet, there are vast differences in how quickly governments implemented NPIs. In this paper, we analyze the role of public attention, measured as the share of daily Google searches in a country related to COVID-19, in the timing of the NPI responses. We first show that public attention depends strongly on whether there are cases in own country. We then show that countries with high levels of public attention are more likely to implement non-pharmaceutical interventions, even after controlling for the number of cases and deaths. Finally, we show that the extent to which a government responds to public attention is highly dependent on the country's institutional quality. The positive effect of public attention on policy implementation is driven entirely by countries with good institutions.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cevat G.

Curtailment of aggregate social mobility - through policies such as: social distancing recommendations, shelter in place orders and state-enforced lockdowns - has become a primary strategy to address COVID-19 to limit social contact and reduce disease transmission. In this context, a small number of countries have instituted gender or sex-segregated mobility policies (Panama, Peru, and Bogota, Colombia). Through a retrospective analysis of global geographic positioning (GPS) data, this study presents an overview of aggregate mobility in Panama following the countrys implementation of a sex-segregated social distancing policy. Panama was selected as the nationwide sex-segregated policy was enforced throughout the lockdown period. The paper looks at mobility trends on female- and male-sex mobility days, examining differences by volume of movement and type of community locations visited as compared to pre-COVID trends. We find lower visits to all community location categories on female-mobility days. However, we found no significant difference in visits to workplace locations on male- v. female-mobility days. The paper discusses the implications of these findings in three areas: (1) Informal burden of labor and social reproduction, (2) Implications for womens autonomy and safety in the home, and (3) Womens economic empowerment. In addition, it raises open ethical questions regarding gender identity in COVID-19 policies.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Liana R Woskie","author_inst":"London School of Economics, Harvard Global Health Institute"},{"author_name":"Clare Wenham","author_inst":"London School of Economics"},{"author_name":"Panu Poutvaara","author_inst":"LMU Munich and ifo Institute"},{"author_name":"Yusef Badi","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ali Versi","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Yike GUO","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Kai Sun","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Pank Bhavsar","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Peter Howarth","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Sven-Erik Dahlen","author_inst":"Karoilinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Peter Sterk","author_inst":"Amsterdam University"},{"author_name":"Ratko Djukanovic","author_inst":"Southampton University"},{"author_name":"Ian Adcock","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Kian Fan Chung","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Adriana Seixas","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Ciencias da Saude de Porto Alegre"},{"author_name":"Charley C.
