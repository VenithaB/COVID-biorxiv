(H)CQ activity was examined in tissue culture cells to determine if their anti-viral benefits or adverse effects might be due to altering host cell pathways. Metabolic analysis revealed (H)CQ inhibit oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria, likely by sequestering protons needed to drive ATP synthase. This activity could cause cardiotoxicity because heart muscle relies on beta oxidation of fatty acids. However, it might also explain their therapeutic benefit against COVID-19. A new model of SARS-CoV-2 infection postulates virus enters host cell mitochondria and uses its protons for genome release. Oxidative phosphorylation is eventually compromised, so glycolysis is upregulated to maintain ATP levels. (H)CQ could prevent viral infection and\/or slow its replication by sequestering these protons. In support of this model other potential COVID-19 therapeutics also targeted mitochondria, as did tobacco smoke, which may underlie smokers protection. The mitochondria of young people are naturally more adaptable and resilient, providing a rationale for their resistance to disease progression. Conversely, obesity and diabetes could exacerbate disease severity by providing extra glucose to infected cells dependent on glycolysis. The description of (H)CQ function presented here, together with its implications for understanding SARS-CO-V2 infection, makes testable predictions about disease progression and identifies new approaches for treating COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robert J.

To conduct the study, data on mobility patterns, socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of people, lockdown measures, and coronavirus pandemic were collected from multiple sources (e.g., Google, UNDP, UN, BBC, Oxford University, Worldometer). A Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) technique is used to investigate the direct and indirect effects of independent variables on dependent variables considering the intervening effects of mediators. Results show that lockdown measures have significant effects to encourage people to maintain social distancing. However, pandemic severity and socioeconomic and institutional factors have limited effects to sustain social distancing practice. The results also explain that socioeconomic and institutional factors of urbanity and modernity have significant effects on pandemic severity. Countries with a higher number of elderly people, employment in the service sector, and higher globalization trend are the worst victims of the coronavirus pandemic (e.g., USA, UK, Italy, and Spain). Social distancing measures are reasonably effective at tempering the severity of the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Md Mokhlesur Rahman","author_inst":"The University of North Carolina at Charlotte"},{"author_name":"Jean-Claude Thill","author_inst":"The University of North Carolina at Charlotte"},{"author_name":"Kamal Chandra Paul","author_inst":"The University of North Carolina at Charlotte"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.30.20164475","rel_title":"Projecting hospital resource utilization during a surge using parametric bootstrapping","rel_date":"2020-08-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.30.20164475","rel_abs":"During the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, hospitals took drastic action to ensure sufficient capacity, including canceling or postponing elective procedures, expanding the number of available intensive care beds and ventilators, and creating regional overflow hospital capacity. However, in most locations the actual number of patients did not reach the projected surge leaving available, unused hospital capacity. As a result, patients may have delayed needed care and hospitals lost substantial revenue. These initial recommendations were made based on observations and worst-case epidemiological projections, which generally assume a fixed proportion of COVID-19 patients will require hospitalization and advanced resources. This assumption has led to an overestimate of resource demand as clinical protocols improve and testing becomes more widely available throughout the course of the pandemic. Here, we present a parametric bootstrap model for forecasting the resource demands of incoming patients in the near term, and apply it to the current pandemic. We validate our approach using observed cases at UCLA Health and simulate the effect of elective procedure cancellation against worst-case pandemic scenarios. Using our approach, we show that it is unnecessary to cancel elective procedures unless the actual capacity of COVID-19 patients approaches the hospital maximum capacity. Instead, we propose a strategy of balancing the resource demands of elective procedures against projected patients by revisiting the projections regularly to maintain operating efficiency. This strategy has been in place at UCLA Health since mid-April.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jeffrey N Chiang","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Ulzee An","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Misagh Kordi","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Brandon Jew","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Clifford Kravit","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"William J Dunne","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Ronald Perez","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Neil R Parikh","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Drew Weil","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Richard F Azar","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Robert Cherry","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Karen A Grimley","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Samuel A Skootsky","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Christopher E Saigal","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Vladimir Manuel","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Eleazar Eskin","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Eran Halperin","author_inst":"UCLA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.30.20165522","rel_title":"Kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Avidity Maturation and Association with Disease Severity","rel_date":"2020-08-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.30.20165522","rel_abs":"The kinetics of IgG avidity maturation during SARS-CoV-2 infection was studied.

Subjects\/Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 66 patients were remotely (via phone call) and in-person (by home visit) assessed for health status and lifestyle habits. Results: Mean age was 47.4 years. Patients were obese grade I (30.0%), II (22.0%), and III (30.0%), and 94.2% had above reference waist circumference values. Sixty-four percent displayed high blood pressure, whereas 24% showed CRP levels above normal range. Nineteen percent of patients reported irregular use of nutritional supplementation and 6.0% reported binge eating habits. Thirty-three exhibited symptoms of depression. Mild-to-moderate and moderate-to-severe anxiety symptoms were reported by 27.4% and 11.3% of the patients; 4.5% exhibited suicidal ideation and were referred to a specialist for healthcare. Of relevance, inactive patients (59.6%) had poorer global mental and physical health scores as compared to active peers (both p<0.05). Conclusion: This out-of-hospital screening revealed that the absence of face-to-face health care due to the Covid-19 pandemic is associated with suboptimal status of physical and mental health as well as lifestyle inadequacies among patients who have recently undergone bariatric surgery.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Karla Fabiana Goessler","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Carolina Ferreira Nicoletti","author_inst":"Univeristy of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Diego Augusto Nunes Rezende","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Sofia Mendes Sieczkowska","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Perri Esteves","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Rafael Genario","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Gersiel Nascimento Oliveira-Junior","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Kamila Meireles","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Ana Jessica Pinto","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Michele Nakahara-Melo","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Roberto Cleva","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Marco Aurelio Santo","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"John Kirwan","author_inst":"Pennington Biomedical Research Center"},{"author_name":"Hamilton Roschel","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Bruno Gualano","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Eleazar Eskin","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Eran Halperin","author_inst":"UCLA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"endocrinology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.30.20165282","rel_title":"A Compartmental Epidemic Model Incorporating Probable Cases to Model COVID-19 Outbreak in Regions with Limited Testing Capacity","rel_date":"2020-08-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.30.20165282","rel_abs":"We propose a new compartmental epidemic model taking into account people who has symptoms with no confirmatory laboratory testing (probable cases).

This study aimed to report the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 in Bangladesh. We conducted a cross-sectional study at three dedicated COVID-19 hospitals. The severity of the COVID-19 cases was assessed based on the WHO interim guidance. Data were collected only from non-critical COVID-19 patients as critical patients required immediate intensive care admission making them unable to respond to the questions. A total of 103 RT-PCR confirmed non-critical COVID-19 patients were enrolled. Most of the patients (71.8%) were male. Mild, moderate and severe illness were assessed in 74.76%, 9.71% and 15.53% of patients respectively. Nearly 52.4% of patients had a co-morbidity, with hypertension being the most common (34%), followed by diabetes mellitus (21.4%) and ischemic heart disease (9.7%). Fever (78.6%), weakness (68%) and cough (44.7%) were the most common clinical manifestations. Other common symptoms included loss of appetite (37.9%), difficulty in breathing (37.9%), altered sensation of taste or smell (35.0%), headache (32%) and body ache (32%). The median time from onset of symptom to attending hospitals was 7 days (IQR 4-10).

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey from June 16 to July 16, 2020 of U.S. pediatric hospitals regarding protocols for patients with MIS-C. Elements included hospital characteristics, clinical definition of MIS-C, evaluation, treatment, and follow-up. We summarized key findings and compared results from centers that had treated >5 patients vs. those that had treated <5 patients. Results: Forty centers of varying size and experience with MIS-C participated. About half (21\/40) of centers required only 1 day of fever for MIS-C to be considered. In the evaluation of patients, there was often a tiered approach. Intravenous immunoglobulin was the most widely used medication to treat MIS-C (98% of centers). Corticosteroids were listed in 93% of protocols for primarily the moderate or severe cases. Aspirin was commonly used including for mild cases, whereas heparin or low molecular weight heparin were used primarily in severe cases. In severe cases, anakinra and vasopressors were frequently recommended. Nearly all centers (39\/40) recommended follow up with cardiology. There were similar findings between centers that had treated >5 patients vs. those that had treated <5 patients. A supplement containing hospital protocols is provided. Conclusion: There are many similarities yet some key differences between hospital protocols for MIS-C.

Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel beta-coronavirus. Although antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 can be detected early during the infection, several outstanding questions remain to be addressed regarding magnitude and persistence of antibody titer against different viral proteins and their correlation with the strength of the immune response, as measured by serum levels of pro-inflammatory mediators. Methods. An ELISA assay has been developed by expressing and purifying the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), Soluble Ectodomain (Spike), and full length nucleocapsid protein (N protein). Sera from healthcare workers affected by non-severe COVID-19 were longitudinally collected over four weeks, and compared to sera from patients hospitalized in Intensive Care Units (ICU) and SARS-CoV-2-negative subjects for the presence of IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies as well as soluble pro-inflammatory mediators in the sera. Results. Specificity and sensitivity of the ELISA assays were high for anti-RBD IgG and IgA (92-97%) and slightly lower for IgM and the Spike and N proteins (70-85%). The ELISA allowed quantification of IgM, IgG and IgA antibody responses against all the viral antigens tested and showed a correlation between magnitude of the antibody response and disease severity. Non-hospitalized subjects showed lower antibody titers and blood pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles as compared to patients in Intensive Care Units (ICU), irrespective of the antibodies tested. Noteworthy, in non-severe COVID-19 infections, antibody titers against RBD and Spike, but not against the N protein, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines decreased within a month after viral clearance. Conclusions. Rapid decline in antibody titers and in pro-inflammatory cytokines may be a common feature of non-severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that antibody-mediated protection against re-infection with SARS-CoV-2 is of short duration.

Crowded indoor environments with sustained close contact and conversations are a particularly high-risk setting. Methods: We performed a meta-analysis through July 29, 2020 of SARS-CoV-2 household secondary attack rate (SAR), disaggregating by several covariates (contact type, symptom status, adult\/child contacts, contact sex, relationship to index case, index case sex, number of contacts in household, coronavirus). Findings: We identified 40 relevant published studies that report household secondary transmission. The estimated overall household SAR was 18.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 15.4%-22.2%), which is higher than previously observed SARs for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We observed that household SARs were significantly higher from symptomatic index cases than asymptomatic index cases, to adult contacts than children contacts, to spouses than other family contacts, and in households with one contact than households with three or more contacts. Interpretation: To prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2, people are being asked to stay at home worldwide. With suspected or confirmed infections referred to isolate at home, household transmission will continue to be a significant source of transmission.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zachary J.

After patients are discharged, SARS-CoV-2 recurring cases are reported and the recurrence could profoundly impact patient healthcare and social economics. To date, no data on the effects of medical treatments on recurrence has been published. We analyzed the treatment data of combinations of ten different drugs for the recurring cases in a single medical center, Shenzhen, China. A total of 417 patients were considered and 414 of them were included in this study (3 deaths) with mild-to-critical COVID-19. Patients were treated by 10 different drug combinations and followed up for recurrence for 28 days quarantine after being discharged from the medical center between February and May, 2020. We applied the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to overcome the rare recurring events in certain age groups and performed Virtual Twins (VT) analysis facilitated by random forest regression for medical treatment-recurrence classification. Among those drug combinations, Methylprednisolone\/Interferon\/Lopinavir\/Ritonavir\/Arbidol led to the lowest recurring rate (0.133) as compared to the average recurring rate (0.203). For the younger group (age 20-27) or the older group (age 60-70), the optimal drug combinations are different, but the above combination is still the second best. For obese patients, the combination of Ribavirin\/Interferon\/Lopinavir\/Ritonavir\/Arbidol led to the lowest recurring rate for age group of 20-50, whereas the combination of Interferon\/Lopinavir\/Ritonavir\/Arbidol led to lowest recurring rate for age group of 50-70. The insights into combinatorial therapy we provided here shed lights on the use of a combination of (biological and chemical) anti-virus therapy and\/or anti-cytokine storm as a potentially effective therapeutic treatment for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jia Huang","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Song Zhai","author_inst":"University of California at Riverside"},{"author_name":"Fangfan Ye","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Song Wang","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Manfei Zeng","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"George Way","author_inst":"University of California at Riverside"},{"author_name":"Vipul Madarha","author_inst":"University of California at Riverside"},{"author_name":"Tengfei Zhu","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Liping Qiu","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zehui Xu","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Manhua Ye","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xinping Cui","author_inst":"University of California at Riverside"},{"author_name":"Jiayu Liao","author_inst":"UCR"},{"author_name":"Flavio Caprioli","author_inst":"1.

DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. SETTING Three hospitals in China. PARTICIPANTS 274 adult inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 according to the Protocol for Prevention and Control of COVID-19 (Edition 7) of China and confirmed by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) RNA testing, were included from three hospitals from Wuhan, Harbin and Beijing, China from 1 December 2019 to 19 April 2020. The Biobank of Myositis Registry Department of Rheumatology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, provided the plasma of five patients with anti-MDA5 Ab-related dermatomyositis as positive control group. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected from medical records. The anti-MDA5 Ab was determined by an ELISA assay and was verified by immunoblotting analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES In hospital death of all cause. RESULTS The positive rate of anti-MDA5 Ab in patients with COVID-19 was 48.2% (132\/274) and the anti-MDA5 Ab positive patients tended to represent with severe disease (88.6% vs 66.9%, P<0.0001). The titer of anti-MDA5 Ab was significantly elevated in the non-survivals (5.95{+\/-}5.16 vs 8.22{+\/-}6.64, P=0.030) and the positive rate was also higher than that in the survivals (23.5% vs 12.0%, P=0.012). Regarding to severe COVID-19 patients, we found that high titer of anti-MDA5 Ab ([&ge;]10.0 U\/mL) was more prevalent in the non-survivals (31.2% vs 14.0%, P=0.006). Moreover, early profiling of anti-MDA5 Ab could distinguish severe patients from those with non-severe ones. CONCLUSION Anti-MDA5 Ab was prevalent in the COVID-19 patients and high titer of this antibody is correlated with severe disease and unfavorable outcomes. Early screening and serially monitoring of anti-MDA5 Ab titer have the potential to predict the disease progression of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Changzheng Liu","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens and Christophe Merieux Laboratory, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Pek"},{"author_name":"Qian Wang","author_inst":"Department of Rheumatology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College & Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Clinical Researc"},{"author_name":"Yeming Wang","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Center of Respiratory Medicine, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Diseases, China-Japan Frie"},{"author_name":"Geng Wang","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens and Christophe Merieux Laboratory, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Pek"},{"author_name":"Linghang Wang","author_inst":"Laboratory of Infectious Diseases Center of Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."},{"author_name":"Hong Chen","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin"},{"author_name":"Tao Jiao","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens and Christophe Merieux Laboratory, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Pek"},{"author_name":"Chaojun Hu","author_inst":"Department of Rheumatology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College & Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Clinical Researc"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Lei","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens and Christophe Merieux Laboratory, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Pek"},{"author_name":"Li Guo","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens and Christophe Merieux Laboratory, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Pek"},{"author_name":"Lili Ren","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens and Christophe Merieux Laboratory, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Pek"},{"author_name":"Mengtao Li","author_inst":"Department of Rheumatology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College & Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiaofeng Zeng","author_inst":"Department of Rheumatology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College & Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, National Clinical Researc"},{"author_name":"Dingyu Zhang","author_inst":"Joint Laboratory of Infectious Diseases and Health, Wuhan Institute of Virology and Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital."},{"author_name":"Bin Cao","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Center of Respiratory Medicine, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Diseases, China-Japan Frie"},{"author_name":"Jianwei Wang","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Gioacchino Natoli","author_inst":"European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Department of Experimental Oncology, 20139 Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Sebastiano Pasqualato","author_inst":"European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Department of Experimental Oncology, 20139 Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marina Mapelli","author_inst":"European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Department of Experimental Oncology, 20139 Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Federica Facciotti","author_inst":"European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Department of Experimental Oncology, 20139 Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Christine Mikesell","author_inst":"C.

Considering this we conducted a randomized controlled clinical trial for efficacy and safety evaluation of subcutaneous IFN-alpha2b and IFN-gamma administration in patients positive to SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We enrolled 19-82 years-old inpatients at the Military Central Hospital Luis Diaz Soto, Havana, Cuba. They were hospitalized after confirmed diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either, subcutaneous treatment with a co-lyophilized combination of 3.0 MIU IFN-alpha2b and 0.5 MIU IFN-gamma (HeberFERON, CIGB, Havana, Cuba), twice a week for two weeks, or thrice a week intramuscular injection of 3.0 MIU IFN-alpha2b (Heberon Alpha R, CIGB, Havana, Cuba). Additionally, all patients received lopinavir-ritonavir 200\/50 mg every 12 h and chloroquine 250 mg every 12 h (standard of care). The primary endpoints were the time to negativization of viral RNA and the time to progression to severe COVID-19, from the start of treatment. The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee on Clinical Investigation from the Hospital and the Center for the State Control of Medicines, Equipment and Medical Devices in Cuba. Informed consent was obtained from each participant. Results: A total of 79 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, including symptomatic or asymptomatic conditions, fulfilled the inclusion criteria and underwent randomization. Thirty-three subjects were assigned to the HeberFERON group, and 33 to the Heberon Alpha R group. Sixty-three patients were analyzed for viral negativization, of them 78.6% in the HeberFERON group negativized the virus after 4 days of treatment versus 40.6% of patients in the Heberon Alpha R groups (p=0.004). Time to reach the negativization of the SARS-CoV-2 measured by RT-PCR in real time was of 3.0 and 5.0 days for the HeberFERON and Heberon Alpha R groups, respectively. A significant improvement in the reduction of time for negativization was attributable to HeberFERON (p=0.0027, Log-rank test) with a Hazard Ratio of 3.2 and 95% CI of 1.529 to 6.948, as compared to Heberon Alpha R treated group. Worsening of respiratory symptoms was detected in two (6.6%) and one (3.3%) patients in HeberFERON and IFN-alpha2b groups, respectively. None of the subjects transit to severe COVID-19 during the study or the epidemiological follow-up for 21 more days. RT-PCR on day 14 after the start of the treatment was negative to SARS-CoV-2 in 100% and 91% of patients of the combination of IFNs and IFN-alpha2b, respectively. Negativization for HeberFERON treated patients was related to a significant increase in lymphocytes counts and an also significant reduction in CRP as early as 7 days after commencing the therapeutic schedule. All the patients in both cohorts recover by day 14 and were in asymptomatic condition and laboratory parameters return to normal values by day 14 after treatment initiation. Adverse events were identified in 31.5% of patients, 28.5% in the control group, and 34.4% in the HeberFERON group, and the most frequent were headaches (17.4%). Conclusions: In a cohort of 63 hospitalized patients between 19 to 82 years-old with positive SARS-CoV-2, HeberFERON significantly negativized the virus on day 4 of treatment when comparing with IFN-alpha2b. Heberon Alpha R also showed efficacy for the treatment of the viral infection. Both treatments were safe and positively impact on the resolution of the symptoms. None of the patients developed severe COVID-19.

We use a combination of natural language processing and clinician reviews to identify long term self-reported symptoms on a set of Twitter users.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Juan M.

Nasopharyngeal and oral swabs are the main collection tool of biological material used as the source of viral RNA outside a hospital setting. However, limitation in swabs availability, trained health professional with proper PPE and potential risk of aerosols may hinder COVID diagnosis. Self-collection with swabs, saliva and throat wash to obtain oropharyngeal wash has been suggested as having comparable performance of regular swab. We performed throat wash (TW) based surveillance with laboratory heath workers and other employees (LHW) at a laboratory research institute. Methods: Consecutive volunteer testing of LWH and external household and close contacts were included. TW self-collection was performed in 5 mL of sterile saline that was returned to original vial after approximate 5 secs of gargle. RNA extraction and rtPCR were performed as part of routine COVID protocols using Allplex (Seegene, Korea). Results: Four hundred and twenty two volunteers, 387 (93%) LHW and 43 (7%) contacts participated in the survey. One or more positive COVID rtPCR was documented in 63 (14.9% CI95 12%-19%) individuals. No correlation was observed between with direct activities with COVID samples to positivity, with infection observed in comparable rates among different laboratory areas, administrative or supportive activities. Among 63 with detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA, 59 with clinical information, 58% reported symptoms at a median of 4 days prior to collection, most with mild disease. Over a third (38%) of asymptomatic cases developed symptoms 1-3 days after collection. Although overall CT values of TW were higher than that of contemporary swab tests from hospitalized cases, TW from symptomatic cases had comparable CTs. Conclusions: The study suggests that TW may be a valid alternative to the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The proportion of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases is elevated and reinforces the need of universal precautions and frequent surveys to limit the spread of the disease.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giselle Ibette Silva Lopez-Lopes","author_inst":"instituto Adolfo lutz"},{"author_name":"Cintia Mayumi Ahagon","author_inst":"Instituto Adolo Lutz"},{"author_name":"Margarete Aparecida Bonega","author_inst":"Instituto Adolfo lutz"},{"author_name":"Fabiana Pereira dos Santos","author_inst":"Instituto Adolfo lutz"},{"author_name":"Katia Correa de Oliveira Santos","author_inst":"Instituto Adolfo Lutz"},{"author_name":"Audrey Cilli","author_inst":"Instituto Adolfo Lutz"},{"author_name":"Lincoln Spinazola do Prado","author_inst":"Instituto Adolfo Lutz"},{"author_name":"Daniela Bernardes Borges da Silva","author_inst":"Instituto Adolfo Lutz"},{"author_name":"Nuria Borges da Luz","author_inst":"Instituto Adolfo Lutz"},{"author_name":"Claudia Patara Saraceni","author_inst":"Instituto Adolfo Lutz"},{"author_name":"Ana Maria Sardinha Afonso","author_inst":"Instituto Adolfo Lutz"},{"author_name":"Maria do Carmo Timenetsky","author_inst":"Instituto Adolfo Lutz"},{"author_name":"Luis Fernando de Macedo Brigido","author_inst":"Instituto Adolfo Lutz"},{"author_name":"Camacho-Rodriguez Hamlet","author_inst":"CIGB"},{"author_name":"Diaz-Galvez Marisol","author_inst":"Military Central Hospital Luis Diaz Soto"},{"author_name":"Sin-Mayor Adriana","author_inst":"Military Central Hospital Luis Diaz Soto, Havana"},{"author_name":"Garcia-Sanchez Maura","author_inst":"Military Central Hospital Luis Diaz Soto, Havana"},{"author_name":"Martinez-Martin Sara Maria","author_inst":"Military Central Hospital Luis Diaz Soto, Havana"},{"author_name":"Alonso-Valdes Marel","author_inst":"CIGB"},{"author_name":"Hernandez-Bernal Francisco","author_inst":"CIGB"},{"author_name":"Nodarse-Cuni Hugo","author_inst":"CIGB"},{"author_name":"Bello-Garcia Dianela","author_inst":"Faculty Victoria de Giron, Scholl of Medicine;  Havana"},{"author_name":"Beato-Canfuk Abrahan","author_inst":"Military Central Hospital Luis Diaz Soto, Havana"},{"author_name":"Vizcaino-Cesar Mary Tania","author_inst":"Military Central Hospital Luis Diaz Soto, Havana"},{"author_name":"Guillen-Nieto Gerardo","author_inst":"CIGB"},{"author_name":"Muzio-Gonzalez Verena","author_inst":"CIGB"},{"author_name":"Bello-Rivero Iraldo","author_inst":"CIGB"},{"author_name":"Laurie Panesar","author_inst":"Stony Brook Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rupal Patel","author_inst":"Atrium Health Levine Children's"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Schuette","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Children's Center"},{"author_name":"Deepa Thacker","author_inst":"Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children"},{"author_name":"Adrina Tremoulet","author_inst":"Rady Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Navivot Vidwan","author_inst":"Norton Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Matthew Oster","author_inst":"Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Emory University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.29.20164681","rel_title":"Loss expansion of SARS-CoV-2 specific immunity is a key risk factor in fatal patients with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-08-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.29.20164681","rel_abs":"Knowledge of the dynamic immunological characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is essential for clinicians to understand the progression of the disease.

An analysis of the relationship between the number of lymphocytes and age revealed that the lymphocyte and subset counts tended to decline with age significantly. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific immunity declined with age and was associated with survival time in fatal cases. Loss in the expansion of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity could be expanded in vitro. The concurrent decline in SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular and humoral immunities and prolonged SARS-CoV-2 exposure predicted fatal outcomes.

Design: Prospective observational cohort study with in-hospital mortality as the primary outcome. Setting: Five acute care hospitals within a single academic medical system in New York City. Participants: 3,086 hospital inpatients with COVID-19 admitted on or before April 13, 2020 and followed through June 2, 2020. Follow-up till discharge or death was complete for 99.3% of the cohort. Results: The majority of the cohort was male (59.6%). Men were younger (median 64 vs. 70, p<0.001) and less likely to have comorbidities such as hypertension (32.5% vs. 39.9%, p<0.001), diabetes (22.6% vs. 26%, p=0.03), and obesity (6.9% vs. 9.8%, p=0.004) compared to women. Women had lower median values of laboratory markers associated with inflammation compared to men: white blood cells (5.95 vs. 6.8 K\/uL, p<0.001), procalcitonin (0.14 vs 0.21 ng\/mL, p<0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (375 vs. 428 U\/L, p<0.001), C-reactive protein (87.7 vs. 123.2 mg\/L, p<0.001). Unadjusted mortality was similar between men and women (28.8% vs. 28.5%, p=0.84), but more men required intensive care than women (25.2% vs. 19%, p<0.001). Male sex was an independent risk factor for mortality (OR 1.26, 95% 1.04-1.51) after adjustment for demographics, comorbidities, and baseline hypoxia. There were significant interactions between sex and coronary artery disease (p=0.038), obesity (p=0.01), baseline hypoxia (p<0.001), ferritin (p=0.002), lactate dehydrogenase (p=0.003), and procalcitonin (p=0.03). Except for procalcitonin, which had the opposite association, each of these factors was associated with disproportionately higher mortality among women. Conclusions: Male sex was an independent predictor of mortality, consistent with prior studies. Notably, there were significant sex-specific interactions which indicated a disproportionate increase in mortality among women with coronary artery disease, obesity, and hypoxia. These new findings highlight patient subgroups for further study and help explain the recognized sex differences in COVID-19 outcomes.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tomi Jun","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sharon Nirenberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Patricia Kovatch","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kuan-lin Huang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sheng-yong Dong","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tian-yu Zhong","author_inst":"Gannan Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zong-tao Chen","author_inst":"Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yang Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai University of Medicine and Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Nuria Borges da Luz","author_inst":"Instituto Adolfo Lutz"},{"author_name":"Claudia Patara Saraceni","author_inst":"Instituto Adolfo Lutz"},{"author_name":"Ana Maria Sardinha Afonso","author_inst":"Instituto Adolfo Lutz"},{"author_name":"Maria do Carmo Timenetsky","author_inst":"Instituto Adolfo Lutz"},{"author_name":"Luis Fernando de Macedo Brigido","author_inst":"Instituto Adolfo Lutz"},{"author_name":"Camacho-Rodriguez Hamlet","author_inst":"CIGB"},{"author_name":"Diaz-Galvez Marisol","author_inst":"Military Central Hospital Luis Diaz Soto"},{"author_name":"Sin-Mayor Adriana","author_inst":"Military Central Hospital Luis Diaz Soto, Havana"},{"author_name":"Garcia-Sanchez Maura","author_inst":"Military Central Hospital Luis Diaz Soto, Havana"},{"author_name":"Martinez-Martin Sara Maria","author_inst":"Military Central Hospital Luis Diaz Soto, Havana"},{"author_name":"Alonso-Valdes Marel","author_inst":"CIGB"},{"author_name":"Hernandez-Bernal Francisco","author_inst":"CIGB"},{"author_name":"Nodarse-Cuni Hugo","author_inst":"CIGB"},{"author_name":"Bello-Garcia Dianela","author_inst":"Faculty Victoria de Giron, Scholl of Medicine;  Havana"},{"author_name":"Beato-Canfuk Abrahan","author_inst":"Military Central Hospital Luis Diaz Soto, Havana"},{"author_name":"Vizcaino-Cesar Mary Tania","author_inst":"Military Central Hospital Luis Diaz Soto, Havana"},{"author_name":"Guillen-Nieto Gerardo","author_inst":"CIGB"},{"author_name":"Muzio-Gonzalez Verena","author_inst":"CIGB"},{"author_name":"Bello-Rivero Iraldo","author_inst":"CIGB"},{"author_name":"Laurie Panesar","author_inst":"Stony Brook Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rupal Patel","author_inst":"Atrium Health Levine Children's"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Schuette","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Children's Center"},{"author_name":"Deepa Thacker","author_inst":"Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children"},{"author_name":"Adrina Tremoulet","author_inst":"Rady Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Navivot Vidwan","author_inst":"Norton Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Matthew Oster","author_inst":"Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Emory University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.29.20164814","rel_title":"Whether the Weather Will Help Us Weather the COVID-19 Pandemic: Using Machine Learning to Measure Twitter Users' Perceptions","rel_date":"2020-08-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.29.20164814","rel_abs":"Objective: The potential ability for weather to affect SARS-CoV-2 transmission has been an area of controversial discussion during the COVID-19 pandemic. Individuals' perceptions of the impact of weather can inform their adherence to public health guidelines; however, there is no measure of their perceptions. We quantified Twitter users' perceptions of the effect of weather and analyzed how they evolved with respect to real-world events and time. Materials and Methods: We collected 166,005 tweets posted between January 23 and June 22, 2020 and employed machine learning\/natural language processing techniques to filter for relevant tweets, classify them by the type of effect they claimed, and identify topics of discussion. Results: We identified 28,555 relevant tweets and estimate that 40.4% indicate uncertainty about weather's impact, 33.5% indicate no effect, and 26.1% indicate some effect. We tracked changes in these proportions over time. Topic modeling revealed major latent areas of discussion. Discussion: There is no consensus among the public for weather's potential impact. Earlier months were characterized by tweets that were uncertain of weather's effect or claimed no effect; later, the portion of tweets claiming some effect of weather increased. Tweets claiming no effect of weather comprised the largest class by June. Major topics of discussion included comparisons to influenza's seasonality, President Trump's comments on weather's effect, and social distancing. Conclusion: There is a major gap between scientific evidence and public opinion of weather's impacts on COVID-19. We provide evidence of public's misconceptions and topics of discussion, which can inform public health communications.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marichi Gupta","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Adity Bansal","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Delhi"},{"author_name":"Bhav Jain","author_inst":"MIT"},{"author_name":"Jillian Rochelle","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Atharv Oak","author_inst":"MIT"},{"author_name":"Mohammad S.

We develop an agent-based model of social interactions in which the distribution of agents across wards, as well as their travel and interactions are calibrated to real data for Cape Town, South Africa. We characterize the elasticity of various policy interventions including increased likelihood to self-isolate, travel restrictions, assembly bans, and behavioural interventions like washing hands or wearing masks. Even in an informal setting, where agents' ability to self-isolate is compromised, a lockdown remains an effective intervention. In our model, the lockdown enacted in South Africa reduced expected fatalities in Cape Town by 26% and the expected demand for intensive care beds by 46%. However, our best calibration predicts a substantially higher case load, demand for ICU beds, and expected number of deaths than the current best estimate published for Cape Town.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Allan Davids","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Gideon Du Rand","author_inst":"Stellenbosch University"},{"author_name":"Co-Pierre Georg","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Tina Koziol","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Joeri Anton Schasfoort","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Mohammad S.

Collecting demographically and geographically resolved data on NPIs and their association with SARS-CoV-2 infection history can provide critical information related to reopening geographies. Methods: We sampled 1,030 individuals in Maryland from June 17 - June 28, 2020 to capture socio-demographically and geographically resolved information about NPI adoption, access to SARS-CoV-2 testing, and examine associations with self-reported SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Results: Median age of the sample was 43 years and 45% were men; Whites and Blacks\/African Americans represented 60% and 23%, respectively. Overall, 96% of the sample reported traveling outside their home for non-employment related services: most commonly cited reasons were essential services (92%) and visiting friends\/family (66%). Use of public transport was reported by 18% of respondents. 68% reported always social distancing indoors and 53% always wearing masks indoors; indoor social distancing was significantly less common among younger vs. older individuals, and race\/ethnicity and income were significantly associated with mask use (p<0.05 for all). 55 participants (5.3%) self-reported ever testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 with strong dose-response relationships between movement frequency and SARS-CoV-2 positivity that were significantly attenuated by social distancing. In multivariable analysis, history of SARS-CoV-2 infection was negatively associated with the practice of social distancing (adjusted Odd Ratio [aOR]: 0.10; 95% Confidence Interval: 0.03 - 0.33); the only travel associated with higher likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection was use of public transport (aOR for 7 or more times vs. never: 4.29) and visiting a place of worship (aOR for 3 or more times vs. never: 16.0) after adjusting for social distancing. Conclusions: Using a rapid cost-efficient approach, we highlight the role of movement and social distancing on SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk. Continued monitoring of NPI uptake, access to testing, and the subsequent impact on SARS-CoV-2 transmission will be critical for pandemic control and decisions about reopening geographies.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Steven J.

We sought to investigate the association between ACEI\/ARB use and risk of poor clinical outcomes from COVID-19. We identified 1,290 patients with hypertension, of which 682 had recorded ACEI\/ARB use and 608 without the use during 30 days preceding the date of COVID-19 diagnosis in completely enumerated COVID-19 cohort in South Korea. Our primary endpoint was the clinical outcomes comprised of all-cause mortality, use of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and sepsis. We used inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) to mitigate selection bias, and Poisson regression model to estimate the relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to compare outcomes in ACEI\/ARB users with non-users. Compared to non-use, ACEI\/ARB use was associated with lower clinical outcomes (IPTW adjusted RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.42-0.85; p=0.0046). When assessed by individual outcomes, ACEI\/ARB use was not associated with all-cause mortality (IPTW adjusted RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.35-1.09; p=0.0973) and respiratory events (IPTW adjusted RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.84-1.17; p=0.9043). Subgroup analysis showed a trend toward protective role of ACEIs and ARBs against overall outcomes in men (IPTW adjusted RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.69-1.03; p-for-interaction=0.008) and with pre-existing respiratory disease (IPTW adjusted RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.60-0.92; p-for-interaction=0.0023).

Besides, the SARS-CoV-02 virus survives for several hours on different surfaces, where a new host can contract it with a delay. These passive modes of infection transmission remain an unexplored area for traditional mean-field epidemic models. Here, we design an agent-based model for simulations of infection transmission in an open system driven by the dynamics of social activity; the model takes into account the personal characteristics of individuals, as well as the survival time of the virus and its potential mutations. A growing bipartite graph embodies this biosocial process, consisting of active carriers (host) nodes that produce viral nodes during their infectious period. With its directed edges passing through viral nodes between two successive hosts, this graph contains complete information about the routes leading to each infected individual. We determine temporal fluctuations of the number of exposed and the number of infected individuals, the number of active carriers and active viruses at hourly resolution. The simulated processes underpin the latent infection transmissions, contributing significantly to the spread of the virus within a large time window. More precisely, being brought by social dynamics and exposed to the currently existing infection, an individual passes through the infectious state until eventually spontaneously recovers or otherwise is moves to a controlled hospital environment. Our results reveal complex feedback mechanisms that shape the dependence of the infection curve on the intensity of social dynamics and other sociobiological factors. In particular, the results show how the lockdown effectively reduces the spread of infection and how it increases again after the lockdown is removed. Furthermore, a reduced level of social activity but prolonged exposure of susceptible individuals have adverse effects. On the other hand, virus mutations that can gradually reduce the transmission rate by hopping to each new host along the infection path can significantly reduce the extent of the infection, but can not stop the spreading without additional social strategies. Our stochastic processes, based on graphs at the interface of biology and social dynamics, provide a new mathematical framework for simulations of various epidemic control strategies with high temporal resolution and virus traceability.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bosiljka Tadic","author_inst":"Jozef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia"},{"author_name":"Roderick Melnik","author_inst":"Wilfrid Laurier University, Waterloo, ON, Canada"},{"author_name":"Hyesung Lee","author_inst":"Sungkyunkwan University"},{"author_name":"Young June Choe","author_inst":"Hallym University College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hyun Joon Shin","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Ju-Young Shin","author_inst":"Sungkyunkwan University"},{"author_name":"Alain B.

The main technique used in this study is the logistic growth regression model widely used in epidemiology. The results only relate to the two months from the beginning of the epidemic in Algeria, which should be readjusted by integrating the new data over time, because hazardous parameters like possible relaxations (decrease of vigilance or laxity of society) can affect these results and generally cause a time lag in the curve.

We aimed to formulate an applicable epidemiological model to accurately predict and forecast the impact of local resurgence and outbreaks to guide the local healthcare demand and capacity, policy making, and public health decisions. Methods: The model utilised the aggregated daily COVID-19 situation reports (including counts of daily admissions, discharges, and occupancy) from the local NHS hospitals and Covid-19 related weekly deaths in hospitals and other settings in Sussex (population 1.7M), Southeast England. These datasets corresponded to the first wave of COVID-19 infections from 24 March-15 June 2020. The counts of death registrations and regional population estimates were obtained from the Office of National Statistics. A novel epidemiological predictive and forecasting model was then derived based on the local\/regional surveillance data. Through a rigorous inverse parameter inference approach, the model parameters were estimated by fitting the model to the data in an optimal sense and then subsequently validated to make predictions subject to 95% confidence. Findings:The inferred parameters were physically reasonable and matched up to the widely used parameter values derived from the national datasets. Unlike other predictive models, which are restricted to a couple of days, our model can predict local hospital admissions, discharges (including deaths) and occupancy for the next 10, 20, and 30 days at the local level. Interpretation: We have demonstrated that by using local\/regional data, our predictive and forecasting model can be utilised to guide the local healthcare demand and capacity, policy making, and public health decisions to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the local population. Understanding how future COVID-19 spikes\/waves could possibly affect the regional populations empowers us to ensure the timely commissioning and organisation of services. Primary care and community services can be guided by the projected number of infectious and recovered patients and hospital admissions\/discharges to project discharge pathways to bedded and community settings, thus allowing services to understand their likely load in future spikes\/waves. The flexibility of timings in the model, in combination with other early warning systems, produces a timeframe for these services to prepare and isolate capacity for likely and potential demand within regional hospitals. The model also allows local authorities to plan potential mortuary capacity and understand the burden on crematoria and burial services. The model algorithms have been integrated into a web-based multi-institutional toolkit, which can be used by NHS hospitals, local authorities, and public health departments in other regions of the UK and elsewhere. The parameters, which are locally informed, form the basis of predicting and forecasting exercises accounting for different scenarios and impact of COVID-19 transmission.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eduard Campillo-Funollet","author_inst":"University of Sussex"},{"author_name":"James Van Yperen","author_inst":"University of Sussex"},{"author_name":"Phil Allman","author_inst":"NHS Sussex Commissioners"},{"author_name":"Michael Bell","author_inst":"Brighton and Hove City Council"},{"author_name":"Warren Beresford","author_inst":"NHS Sussex Commissioneers"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline Clay","author_inst":"West Sussex County Council"},{"author_name":"Matthew Dorey","author_inst":"West Sussex County Council"},{"author_name":"Graham Evans","author_inst":"East Sussex County Council"},{"author_name":"Kate Gilchrist","author_inst":"Brighton and Hove City Council"},{"author_name":"Pannu Gurprit","author_inst":"East Sussex Health Care Trust"},{"author_name":"Anjum Memon","author_inst":"Brighton and Sussex Medical School"},{"author_name":"Ryan Walkley","author_inst":"West Sussex County Council"},{"author_name":"Mark Watson","author_inst":"Sussex Health and Care Partnership"},{"author_name":"Anotida Madzvamuse","author_inst":"Universtiy of Sussex"},{"author_name":"Diaz-Galvez Marisol","author_inst":"Military Central Hospital Luis Diaz Soto"},{"author_name":"Sin-Mayor Adriana","author_inst":"Military Central Hospital Luis Diaz Soto, Havana"},{"author_name":"Garcia-Sanchez Maura","author_inst":"Military Central Hospital Luis Diaz Soto, Havana"},{"author_name":"Martinez-Martin Sara Maria","author_inst":"Military Central Hospital Luis Diaz Soto, Havana"},{"author_name":"Alonso-Valdes Marel","author_inst":"CIGB"},{"author_name":"Hernandez-Bernal Francisco","author_inst":"CIGB"},{"author_name":"Nodarse-Cuni Hugo","author_inst":"CIGB"},{"author_name":"Bello-Garcia Dianela","author_inst":"Faculty Victoria de Giron, Scholl of Medicine;  Havana"},{"author_name":"Beato-Canfuk Abrahan","author_inst":"Military Central Hospital Luis Diaz Soto, Havana"},{"author_name":"Vizcaino-Cesar Mary Tania","author_inst":"Military Central Hospital Luis Diaz Soto, Havana"},{"author_name":"Guillen-Nieto Gerardo","author_inst":"CIGB"},{"author_name":"Muzio-Gonzalez Verena","author_inst":"CIGB"},{"author_name":"Bello-Rivero Iraldo","author_inst":"CIGB"},{"author_name":"Laurie Panesar","author_inst":"Stony Brook Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rupal Patel","author_inst":"Atrium Health Levine Children's"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Schuette","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Children's Center"},{"author_name":"Deepa Thacker","author_inst":"Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children"},{"author_name":"Adrina Tremoulet","author_inst":"Rady Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Navivot Vidwan","author_inst":"Norton Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Matthew Oster","author_inst":"Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Emory University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.29.20163907","rel_title":"Adjusting to Disrupted Assessments, Placements and Teaching (ADAPT): a snapshot of the early response by UK medical schools to COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-08-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.29.20163907","rel_abs":"Background Medical school assessments, clinical placements and teaching have been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The ADAPT consortium was formed to document and analyse the effects of the pandemic on medical education in the United Kingdom (UK), with the aim of capturing current and future snapshots of disruption to inform trends in the future performance of cohorts graduating during COVID-19. Methods Members of the consortium were recruited from various national medical student groups to ensure representation from medical schools across the UK. The groups involved were: Faculty of Medical Leadership and Management Medical Students Group (FMLM MSG); Neurology and Neurosurgery Interest Group (NANSIG); Doctors Association UK (DAUK); Royal Society of Medicine (RSM) Student Members Group and Medical Student Investigators Collaborative (MSICo.org). In total, 29 medical schools are represented by the consortium. Our members reported teaching postponement, examination status, alternative teaching provision, elective status and UK Foundation Programme Office (UKFPO) educational performance measure (EPM) ranking criteria relevant to their medical school during a data collection window (1st April 14:00 to 2nd April 23:59). Results All 29 medical schools began postponement of teaching between the 11th and 17th of March 2020. Changes to assessments were highly variable. Final year examinations had largely been completed before the onset of COVID-19. Of 226 exam sittings between Year 1 and Year 4 across 29 schools: 93 (41%) were cancelled completely; 14 (6%) had elements cancelled; 57 (25%) moved their exam sitting online. 23 exam sittings (10%) were postponed to a future date. 36% of cohorts with cancelled exams and 74% of cohorts with online exams were granted automatic progression to the next academic year. There exist 19 cohorts at 9 medical schools where all examinations (written and practical) were initially cancelled and automatic progression was granted. Conclusions The approaches taken by medical schools have differed substantially, though there has been universal disruption to teaching and assessments. The data presented in this study represent initial responses, which are likely to evolve over time. In particular, the status of future elective cancellations and UK Foundation Programme Office (UKFPO) educational performance measure (EPM) decile calculations remains unclear. The long-term implications of the heterogeneous disruption to medical education remains an area of active research. Differences in specialty recruitment and performance on future postgraduate examinations may be affected and will be a focus of future phases of the ADAPT Study.","rel_num_authors":34,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anmol Arora","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Georgios Solomou","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Soham Bandyopadhyay","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Julia Simons","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Alex Osborne","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Ioannis Georgiou","author_inst":"University of Aberdeen"},{"author_name":"Catherine Dominic","author_inst":"Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry"},{"author_name":"Shumail Mahmood","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Shreya Badhrinarayanan","author_inst":"Brighton and Sussex Medical School"},{"author_name":"Syed Rayyan Ahmed","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Jack Wellington","author_inst":"Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"Omar Kouli","author_inst":"University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Robin Jacob Borchert","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Joshua Feyi-Waboso","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Scott Dickson","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Savraj Kalsi","author_inst":"Hull-York Medical School"},{"author_name":"Dimitrios Karponis","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Tim Boardman","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Harmani Daler","author_inst":"Lancaster University"},{"author_name":"Abbey Boyle","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Jessica Speller","author_inst":"Leicester Medical School"},{"author_name":"Connor S Gillespie","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Jie Man Low","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Ratnaraj Vaidya","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Ngan Hong Ta","author_inst":"Norwich Medical School"},{"author_name":"Steven Aldridge","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Coll Martin","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Natasha Douglas","author_inst":"Queen's University Belfast"},{"author_name":"Mary Goble","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Tayyib Abdel-Hafiz Goolamallee","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Emma Jane Norton","author_inst":"St George's, University of London"},{"author_name":"Andre Chu","author_inst":"University of Central Lancashire"},{"author_name":"Inshal Imtiaz","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Oliver Patrick Devine","author_inst":"University College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"medical education"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.31.231746","rel_title":"Engineered ACE2 receptor traps potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-08-01","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.31.231746","rel_abs":"An essential mechanism for SARS-CoV-1 and -2 infection begins with the viral spike protein binding to the human receptor protein angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). Here we describe a stepwise engineering approach to generate a set of affinity optimized, enzymatically inactivated ACE2 variants that potently block SARS-CoV-2 infection of cells. These optimized receptor traps tightly bind the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein and prevent entry into host cells. We first computationally designed the ACE2-RBD interface using a two-stage flexible protein backbone design process that improved affinity for the RBD by up to 12-fold. These designed receptor variants were affinity matured an additional 14-fold by random mutagenesis and selection using yeast surface display. The highest affinity variant contained seven amino acid changes and bound to the RBD 170-fold more tightly than wild-type ACE2. With the addition of the natural ACE2 collectrin domain and fusion to a human Fc domain for increased stabilization and avidity, the most optimal ACE2 receptor traps neutralized SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentivirus and authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) in the 10-100 ng\/ml range. Engineered ACE2 receptor traps offer a promising route to fighting infections by SARS-CoV-2 and other ACE2-utilizing coronaviruses, with the key advantage that viral resistance would also likely impair viral entry. Moreover, such traps can be pre-designed for viruses with known entry receptors for faster therapeutic response without the need for neutralizing antibodies isolated or generated from convalescent patients.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anum Glasgow","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Jeff Edward Glasgow","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Daniel Limonta","author_inst":"University of Alberta"},{"author_name":"Paige Solomon","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Irene Lui","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Yang Zhang","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Matthew A Nix","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J Rettko","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Shion A Lim","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Shoshana Zha","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Rachel Yamin","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Kevin Kao","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Oren S Rosenberg","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey V Ravetch","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Arun P Wiita","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Kevin K Leung","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Xin X Zhou","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Tom C Hobman","author_inst":"University of Alberta"},{"author_name":"Tanja K Kortemme","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"James A.

With repeated sampling, immune monitoring creates a real-time portrait of the cells reacting to a novel virus before disease specific knowledge and tools are established. However, single cell analysis tools can struggle to reveal rare cells that are under 0.1% of the population. Here, the machine learning workflow Tracking Responders Expanding (T-REX) was created to identify changes in both very rare and common cells in diverse human immune monitoring settings. T-REX identified cells that were highly similar in phenotype and localized to hotspots of significant change during rhinovirus and SARS-CoV-2 infections. MHC tetramers were not used during unsupervised analysis and instead  left out to serve as a test of whether T-REX identifies biologically significant cells. In the rhinovirus challenge study, T-REX identified virus-specific CD4+ T cells based on these cells being a distinct phenotype that expanded by [&ge;]95% following infection. T-REX successfully identified hotspots with virus-specific T cells using pairs of samples comparing Day 7 of infection to samples taken either after clearing the infection (Day 28) or samples taken prior to infection (Day 0). Mapping pairwise comparisons in samples according to both the direction and degree of change provided a framework to compare systems level immune changes during infectious disease or therapy response. This revealed that the magnitude and direction of systemic immune change in some COVID-19 patients was comparable to that of blast crisis acute myeloid leukemia patients undergoing induction chemotherapy and characterized the identity of the immune cells that changed the most. Other COVID-19 patients instead matched an immune trajectory like that of individuals with rhinovirus infection or melanoma patients receiving checkpoint inhibitor therapy. T-REX analysis of paired blood samples provides an approach to rapidly identify and characterize mechanistically significant cells and to place emerging diseases into a systems immunology context.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sierra M.

Although the mutation at the population level had been extensively investigated, how the mutations evolve at the individual level is largely unknown, partly due to the difficulty of obtaining unbiased genome coverage of SARS-CoV-2 directly from clinical samples.\n\nMethodsEighteen time series fecal samples were collected from nine COVID-19 patients during the convalescent phase. The nucleic acids of SARS-CoV-2 were enriched by the hybrid capture method with different rounds of hybridization.\n\nResultsBy examining the sequencing depth, genome coverage, and allele frequency change, we demonstrated the impeccable performance of the hybrid capture method in samples with Ct value < 34, as well as significant improvement comparing to direct metatranscriptomic sequencing in samples with lower viral loads. We identified 229 intra-host variants at 182 sites in 18 fecal samples. Among them, nineteen variants presented frequency changes > 0.3 within 1-5 days, reflecting highly dynamic intra-host viral populations. Meanwhile, we also found that the same mutation showed different frequency changes in different individuals, indicating a strong random drift. Moreover, the evolving of the viral genome demonstrated that the virus was still viable in the gastrointestinal tract during the convalescent period.\n\nConclusionsThe hybrid capture method enables reliable analyses of inter- and intra-host variants of SARS-CoV-2 genome, which changed dramatically in the gastrointestinal tract; its clinical relevance warrants further investigation.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mingkun Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yi Xu","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Lu Kang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Genomic and Precision Medicine, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and China National Center for Bioinformation, Beij"},{"author_name":"Zijie Shen","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Genomic and Precision Medicine, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and China National Center for Bioinformation, Beij"},{"author_name":"Xufang Li","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Weili Wu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Genomic and Precision Medicine, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and China National Center for Bioinformation, Beij"},{"author_name":"Wentai Ma","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Genomic and Precision Medicine, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and China National Center for Bioinformation, Beij"},{"author_name":"Chunxiao Fang","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Fengxia Yang","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Xuan Jiang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Genomic and Precision Medicine, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and China National Center for Bioinformation, Beij"},{"author_name":"Sitang Gong","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Li Zhang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Genomic and Precision Medicine, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and China National Center for Bioinformation, Beij"},{"author_name":"Oren S Rosenberg","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey V Ravetch","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Arun P Wiita","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Kevin K Leung","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Xin X Zhou","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Tom C Hobman","author_inst":"University of Alberta"},{"author_name":"Tanja K Kortemme","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"James A.

However, due to limited capacity to test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, there are no reliable estimates of the true burden of infection and death. We, therefore, conducted a SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey amongst health care workers (HCW) in Blantyre city to estimate the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in urban Malawi. Methods Five hundred otherwise asymptomatic HCWs were recruited from Blantyre City (Malawi) from 22nd May 2020 to 19th June 2020 and serum samples were collected all participants. A commercial ELISA was used to measure SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in serum. We run local negative samples (2018 - 2019) to verify the specificity of the assay. To estimate the seroprevalence of SARS CoV-2 antibodies, we adjusted the proportion of positive results based on local specificity of the assay. Results Eighty-four participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The HCW with a positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody result came from different parts of the city. The adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 12.3% [CI 9.0-15.7]. Using age-stratified infection fatality estimates reported from elsewhere, we found that at the observed adjusted seroprevalence, the number of predicted deaths was 8 times the number of reported deaths. Conclusion The high seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among HCW and the discrepancy in the predicted versus reported deaths, suggests that there was early exposure but slow progression of COVID-19 epidemic in urban Malawi. This highlights the urgent need for development of locally parameterised mathematical models to more accurately predict the trajectory of the epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa for better evidence-based policy decisions and public health response planning.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marah Grace Chibwana","author_inst":"Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research programme"},{"author_name":"Khuzwayo Chidiwa Jere","author_inst":"Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research programme"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Mandolo","author_inst":"Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Vincent Katunga-Phiri","author_inst":"Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Dumizulu Tembo","author_inst":"Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Ndaona Mitole","author_inst":"Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Samantha Musasa","author_inst":"College of Medicine, University of Malawi"},{"author_name":"Simon Sichone","author_inst":"Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Agness Lakudzala","author_inst":"Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Lusako Sibale","author_inst":"Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Prisca Matambo","author_inst":"Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Innocent Kadwala","author_inst":"Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Rachel Louise Byrne","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alice Mbewe","author_inst":"Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Marc Y.R.
