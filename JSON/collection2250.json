The acute phase was characterized by a rapid migration of CD16+ monocytes from the blood and concomitant increase in CD16+ macrophages in the lungs. We identified two subsets of interstitial macrophages (HLA- DR+ CD206-), a transitional CD11c+ CD16+ population that was directly associated with IL-6 levels in plasma, and one long lasting CD11b+ CD16+ population. Strikingly, monocytes were a correlate of viral replication in bronchial brushes and levels of TARC (CCL17), and worse disease outcomes were associated with high levels of cell infiltration in lungs and CD11b+ CD16+ macrophages accumulation. Importantly, this accumulation was long-lasting and detectable even in animals with mild or no signs of disease. Interestingly, animals with less signs of disease had a high IL-10:IL-6 ratio. Our results unravel cellular mechanisms of COVID-19 and validate NHP as models to test immune therapies.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marissa D Fahlberg","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Robert V Blair","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Lara A Doyle-Meyers","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Cecily C Midkiff","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Zenere","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Kasi E Russell-Lodrigue","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Christopher J Monjure","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Erin H Haupt","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Toni P Penney","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Gabrielle Lehmicke","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Brienna M Threeton","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Nadia Golden","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Presan K Datta","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Chad J Roy","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Rudolph P Bohm","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J Maness","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Tracy Fischer","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Jay Rappaport","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Monica Vaccari","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.20.213082","rel_title":"Discovery of potential imaging and therapeutic targets for severe inflammation in COVID-19 patients","rel_date":"2020-07-21","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.20.213082","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused more than 540,000 deaths globally. Hyperinflammation mediated by dysregulated monocyte\/macrophage function is considered to be the key factor that triggers severe illness in COVID-19. However, no specific targeting molecule has been identified for detecting or treating hyperinflammation related to dysregulated macrophages in severe COVID-19. Herein, we suggest candidate targets for imaging and therapy in severe COVID-19 by analyzing single-cell RNA-sequencing data based on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of COVID-19 patients. We found that expression of SLC2A3, which can be imaged by [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose, was higher in macrophages from severe COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, by integrating the surface target database and drug-target binding database with RNA-sequencing data of severe COVID-19, we identified CCR1 and FPR1 as surface and druggable targets for drug delivery as well as molecular imaging. Our results provide a resource for candidate targets in the development of specific imaging and therapy for COVID-19-related hyperinflammation.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hyunjong Lee","author_inst":"Seoul National University"},{"author_name":"Hyung-Jun Im","author_inst":"Seoul National University"},{"author_name":"Kwon Joong Na","author_inst":"Seoul National University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hongyoon Choi","author_inst":"Seoul National University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Zenere","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Kasi E Russell-Lodrigue","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Christopher J Monjure","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Erin H Haupt","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Toni P Penney","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Gabrielle Lehmicke","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Brienna M Threeton","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Nadia Golden","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Presan K Datta","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Chad J Roy","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Rudolph P Bohm","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J Maness","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Tracy Fischer","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Jay Rappaport","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Monica Vaccari","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.21.213405","rel_title":"Multi-site co-mutations and 5'UTR CpG immunity escape drive the evolution of SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-07-21","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.21.213405","rel_abs":"The SARS-CoV-2 infected cases and the caused mortalities have been surging since the COVID-19 pandemic. Viral mutations emerge during the virus circulating in the population, which is shaping the viral infectivity and pathogenicity. Here we extensively analyzed 6698 SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences with specific sample collection dates in NCBI database. We found that four mutations, i.e., 5UTR_c-241-t, NSP3_c-3037-t, NSP12_c-14408-t, and S_a-23403-g, became the dominant variants and each of them represented nearly 100% of all virus sequences since the middle May, 2020. Notably, we found that co-occurrence rates of three significant multi-site co-mutational patterns, i.e., (i) S_a-23403-g, NSP12_c-14408-t, 5UTR_c-241-t, NSP3_c-3037-t, and ORF3a_c-25563-t; (ii) ORF8_t-28144-c, NSP4_c-8782-t, NSP14_c-18060-t, NSP13_a-17858-g, and NSP13_c-17747-t; and (iii) N_g-28881-a, N_g-28882-a, and N_g-28883-c, reached 66%, 90%, and nearly 100% of recent sequences, respectively.

Quarantines, travel bans, regulatory changes, social distancing and 'lockdown' measures have affected drug and alcohol supply chains and subsequently their availability, price and use patterns, with possible downstream effects on presentations of SUDs and demand for treatment. Given the lack of multicentric epidemiologic studies, we conducted a rapid global survey within the International Society of Addiction Medicine (ISAM) network in order to understand the status of substance-use patterns during the current pandemic. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: Worldwide. Participants: Starting on April 4th, 2020 during a 5-week period, the survey received 185 responses from 77 countries. Measurements: To assess addiction medicine professionals' perceived changes in drug and alcohol supply, price, use pattern and related complications during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: Participants reported (among who answered ''decreased'' or ''increased'', percentage of those who were in majority is reported in the parenthesis) a decrease in drug supply (69.0%), and at the same time an increase in price (95.3%) globally. With respect to changes in use patterns, an increase in alcohol (71.7%), cannabis (63.0%), prescription opioids (70.9%), and sedative\/hypnotics (84.6%) use was reported while the use of amphetamines (59.7%), cocaine (67.5%), and opiates (58.2%) was reported to decrease overall. Conclusions: The global report on changes in the availability, use patterns and complications of alcohol and drugs during the COVID-19 pandemic should be considered in making new policies and in developing mitigating measures and guidelines during the current pandemic (and probable future ones) in order to minimize risks to SUDs. Key words: COVID-19, pandemic, alcohol, drug, substance use disorder, supply, price.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ali Farhoudian","author_inst":"Substance Abuse and Dependence Research Center, University of Social Welfare and Rehabilitation Sciences, Tehran, Iran; Department of Psychiatry, Tehran Univers"},{"author_name":"Seyed Ramin Radfar","author_inst":"UCLA Integrated Substance Abuse Programs"},{"author_name":"Hossein Mohaddes Ardabili","author_inst":"Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Research Center, Ibn-e-Sina Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran"},{"author_name":"Parnian Rafei","author_inst":"Department of Psychology, Faculty of Psychology and Education, University of Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Mohsen Ebrahimy","author_inst":"Iranian National Center for Addiction Studies, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Iran"},{"author_name":"Arash Khojasteh Zonoozi","author_inst":"Student Research Committee, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran"},{"author_name":"Cornelis A J De Jong","author_inst":"Behavioral Science Institute, Radboud University, the Netherlands."},{"author_name":"Mehrnoosh Vahidi","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Masud Yunesian","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Iran"},{"author_name":"Christos Kouimtsidis","author_inst":"Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, UK"},{"author_name":"Shalini Arunogiri","author_inst":"Turning Point, Eastern Health, Box Hill, Australia"},{"author_name":"Helena Hansen","author_inst":"Departments of Anthropology and Psychiatry, New York University, USA"},{"author_name":"Kathleen T Brady","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Medical University of South Carolina, USA."},{"author_name":"Marc N Potenza","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine, Connecticut Council on Problem Gambling and Connecticut Mental Health Center, USA"},{"author_name":"- ISAM-PPIG Global Survey Consortium","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Alexander Mario Baldacchino","author_inst":"Division of Population and Behaviour Sciences, Medical School, University of St Andrews, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Hamed Ekhtiari","author_inst":"Laureate Inst for Brain Research"},{"author_name":"Jay Rappaport","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"},{"author_name":"Monica Vaccari","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"addiction medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.21.214049","rel_title":"Intranasal Immunization with a Lentiviral Vector Coding for SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Confers Vigorous Protection in Pre-Clinical Animal Models","rel_date":"2020-07-21","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.21.214049","rel_abs":"To develop a vaccine candidate against COVID-19, we generated a Lentiviral Vector (LV), eliciting neutralizing antibodies against the Spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2.

We describe the binding mode of both drugs with TMPRSS2 in a Michaelis complex (MC) state preceding the formation of a long-lived covalent inhibitory state. We find that nafamostat to has a higher MC population, which in turn leads to the more frequent formation of the covalent complex and thus higher inhibition efficacy, as confirmed in vitro and consistent with previous virus cell entry assays.

The aim of this study was to perform a comprehensive evolutionary analysis to describe the human outbreak and the evolutionary rate of different genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThe molecular evolution in nine genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed using three different approaches: phylogenetic signal assessment, emergence of amino acid substitutions, and Bayesian evolutionary rate estimation in eight successive fortnights since the virus emergence.\n\nAll observed phylogenetic signals were very low and trees topologies were in agreement with those signals. However, after four months of evolution, it was possible to identify regions revealing an incipient viral lineages formation despite the low phylogenetic signal, since fortnight 3. Finally, the SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary rate for regions nsp3 and S, the ones presenting greater variability, was estimated to values of 1.37 x 10-3 and 2.19 x 10-3 substitution\/site\/year, respectively.\n\nIn conclusion, results obtained in this work about the variable diversity of crucial viral regions and the determination of the evolutionary rate are consequently decisive to understand essential feature of viral emergence. In turn, findings may allow characterizing for the first time, the evolutionary rate of S protein that is crucial for vaccines development.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matias J Pereson Sr.","author_inst":"Universidad de Buenos Aires.

We compared the Malaysia weekly epidemiological records of dengue incidences during the period of lockdown to the trend of previous years (2015 to 2019) and a simulation at the corresponding period that expected no movement restrictions. We found that the dengue incidence declined significantly with a greater magnitude at phase 1 of lockdown, with a negative gradient of 3.2-fold steeper than the trend observed in previous years and 6.5-fold steeper than the simulation, indicating that the control of population movement did reduce dengue transmission. However, starting from phase 2 of lockdown, the dengue incidences demonstrated an elevation and earlier rebound by at least 4 weeks and grew with an exponential pattern compared to the simulation and previous years. Together with our data on Aedes mosquitoes from a district of Penang, Malaysia, we revealed that Aedes albopictus is the predominant species for both indoor and outdoor environments. The abundance of the mosquito was increasing steadily during the period of lockdown, and demonstrated strong correlation with the locally reported dengue incidences; therefore, we proposed the possible diffusive effect of vector that led to a higher acceleration of incidence rate. These findings would help authorities review the direction and efforts of the vector control strategy.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Song-Quan Ong","author_inst":"UOW Malaysia KDU Penang University College"},{"author_name":"Hamdan Ahmad","author_inst":"Universiti Sains Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Ahmad Mohiddin Mohd.

This assumes a great significance in the context of the current COVD-19 pandemic, as there are chances of aerosol-borne disease transmission in orthopedic surgical procedures. Hence, this systematic review and meta-analysis will be undertaken to assimilate and analyse the available evidence on bioaerosols in orthopedic surgical procedures and their significance with respect to SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission. Objectives To determine the characteristics (amount and\/or density, size, infectivity, and spread etc.) of bioaerosols found in orthopaedic operating rooms (ORs) and to determine the characteristics of aerosols generated by different orthopaedic power tools and devices. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis will be conducted. The PRISMA guidelines will be strictly followed. The primary search will be conducted on the PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, medRxiv, bioRxix and Lancet preprint databases, using a well-defined search strategy. Any original research study (including cohort, case-control, case series, cadaveric studies and studies, animal models, laboratory based experimental studies) looking at aerosol generation in orthopedic surgical procedures, or aerosol generation by orthopaedic power tools and devices will included. Outcome measures will include characteristics (amount and\/or density, size, infectivity, and spread etc.) of bioaerosols found in orthopaedic operating rooms (ORs) and those generated by various orthopaedics power tools and devices. Metanalysis using the random-effects model will be conducted to determined pooled estimates of the outcome variables. Heterogeneity will be assessed by the I2 test. Risk of bias will be assessed by the Risk of Bias in Studies estimating Prevalence of Exposure to Occupational risk factors (RoB-SPEO) tool. The overall strength of evidence will be assessed by the GRADE approach.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Siddhartha Sharma","author_inst":"Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India"},{"author_name":"Rakesh John","author_inst":"Department of Trauma & Orthopedics, Hull University Teaching Hospitals, Hull, East Yorkshire, UK"},{"author_name":"Deepak Neradi","author_inst":"Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India"},{"author_name":"Sandeep Patel","author_inst":"Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India"},{"author_name":"Mandeep Singh Dhillon","author_inst":"Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India"},{"author_name":"Federico A Di Lello Sr.","author_inst":"Universidad de Buenos Aires.

Highly contagious diseases need to be seeded into populations and we hypothesized that greater distance from the epicenter in Wuhan, as well as higher province-level GDP per capita, would delay the time until a province detected COVID-19 cases. To test this hypothesis, we used province-level socioeconomic data such as GDP per capita and percentage of the population aged over 65, distance from the Wuhan epicenter, and health systems capacity in a Cox proportional hazards analysis of the determinants of each province's time until epidemic start. The start was defined by the number of days it took for each province to reach thresholds of 3, 5, 10, or 100 cases. We controlled for the number of hospital beds and physicians as these could influence the speed of case detection. Surprisingly, none of the explanatory variables had a statistically significant effect on the time it took for each province to get its first cases; the timing of COVID-19 spread appears to have been random with respect to distance, GDP, demography, and the strength of the health system. Looking to other factors, such as travel, policy, and lockdown measures, could provide additional insights on realizing most critical factors in the timing of spread.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alice Kuan","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Mingxin Chen","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"David Bishai","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Sandeep Patel","author_inst":"Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India"},{"author_name":"Mandeep Singh Dhillon","author_inst":"Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India"},{"author_name":"Federico A Di Lello Sr.","author_inst":"Universidad de Buenos Aires.

Bearing the largest single-stranded RNA genomes in nature, coronaviruses are critically dependent on long-distance RNA-RNA interactions to regulate the viral transcription and replication pathways. Here we experimentally mapped the in vivo RNA-RNA interactome of the full-length SARS-CoV-2 genome and its subgenomic mRNAs. We uncovered a network of RNA-RNA interactions spanning tens of thousands of nucleotides. These interactions reveal that the viral genome adopts alternative topologies inside cells and undergoes genome cyclization. In addition, the SARS-CoV-2 genome and subgenomic mRNAs engage in different interactions with host RNAs. Most importantly, we discovered a long-range RNA-RNA interaction - the FSE-arch - that encircles the programmed ribosomal frame-shifting element. The FSE-arch is conserved in the related MERS-CoV virus and is under purifying selection. Our findings illuminate RNA-based mechanisms governing replication, discontinuous transcription, and translation of coronaviruses, and will aid future efforts to develop antiviral strategies.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Omer Ziv","author_inst":"Wellcome Trust\/Cancer Research UK Gurdon Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 1QN, UK"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Price","author_inst":"Wellcome Trust\/Cancer Research UK Gurdon Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 1QN, UK"},{"author_name":"Lyudmila Shalamova","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, FB10-Veterinary Medicine, Justus-Liebig University, Giessen 35392, Germany"},{"author_name":"Tsveta Kamenova","author_inst":"Wellcome Trust\/Cancer Research UK Gurdon Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 1QN, UK"},{"author_name":"Friedemann Weber","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, FB10-Veterinary Medicine, Justus-Liebig University, Giessen 35392, Germany"},{"author_name":"Eric A.

Here, we report the discovery of a novel, primate-specific isoform of ACE2, which we designate as deltaACE2 (dACE2). We demonstrate that dACE2, but not ACE2, is an ISG. In vitro, dACE2, which lacks 356 N-terminal amino acids, was non-functional in binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and as a carboxypeptidase. Our results reconcile current knowledge on ACE2 expression and suggest that the ISG-type induction of dACE2 in IFN-high conditions created by treatments, inflammatory tumor microenvironment, or viral co-infections is unlikely to affect the cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 and promote infection.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Olusegun O Onabajo","author_inst":"Laboratory of Translational Genomics, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"A Rouf Banday","author_inst":"Laboratory of Translational Genomics, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Wusheng Yan","author_inst":"Laboratory of Translational Genomics, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Adeola Obajemu","author_inst":"Laboratory of Translational Genomics, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Megan L Stanifer","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Molecular Virology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Deanna M Santer","author_inst":"Li Ka Shing Institute of Virology and Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada."},{"author_name":"Oscar Florez-Vargas","author_inst":"Laboratory of Translational Genomics, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Helen Piontkivska","author_inst":"Department of Biological Sciences and Brain Health Research Institute, Kent State University, Kent, OH, USA"},{"author_name":"Joselin Vargas","author_inst":"Laboratory of Translational Genomics, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Carmon Kee","author_inst":"Division of Cellular Polarity and Viral Infection, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ); Department of Infectious Diseases, Virology, University Hospital Heidel"},{"author_name":"D Lorne Tyrrell","author_inst":"Li Ka Shing Institute of Virology and Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada."},{"author_name":"Juan L Mendoza","author_inst":"Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA"},{"author_name":"Steeve Boulant","author_inst":"Division of Cellular Polarity and Viral Infection, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ); Department of Infectious Diseases, Virology, University Hospital Heidel"},{"author_name":"Ludmila Prokunina-Olsson","author_inst":"National Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Ugo Bonfanti","author_inst":"La Vallonea Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, Passirana di Rho, Italy"},{"author_name":"Angelica Stranieri","author_inst":"Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Milan, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Vito Martella","author_inst":"Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Bari, Valenzano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Fabrizio Solari Basano","author_inst":"Arcoblu s.r.l., Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Vanessa R Barrs","author_inst":"City University s Jockey Club College of Veterinary Medicine and Life Sciences, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Alan D Radford","author_inst":"Institute of Infection, Veterinary and Ecological Sciences, University of Liverpool, Neston, UK"},{"author_name":"Umberto Agrimi","author_inst":"Department of Food Safety, Nutrition and Veterinary Public Health, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Grant L Hughes","author_inst":"Departments of Vector Biology and Tropical Disease Biology, Centre for Neglected Tropical Disease, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine,  Liverpool, UK"},{"author_name":"Saverio Paltrinieri","author_inst":"Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Milan, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Nicola Decaro","author_inst":"Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Bari, Valenzano, Italy"}],"version":"1","license":"cc0","type":"new results","category":"genetics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.20.211789","rel_title":"A human disease model of SARS-CoV-2-induced lung injury and immune responses with a microengineered organ chip","rel_date":"2020-07-20","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.20.211789","rel_abs":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that seriously endangers human health. There is an urgent need to build physiological relevant human models for deep understanding the complex organ-level disease processes and facilitating effective therapeutics for COVID-19. Here, we first report the use of microengineered alveolus chip to create a human disease model of lung injury and immune responses induced by native SARS-CoV-2 at organ-level. This biomimetic system is able to reconstitute the key features of human alveolar-capillary barrier by co-culture of alveolar epithelial and microvascular endothelial cells under microfluidic flow. The epithelial cells on chip showed higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection than endothelial cells identified by viral spike protein expression. Transcriptional analysis showed distinct responses of two cell types to SARS-CoV-2 infection, including activated type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling pathway in epithelium and activated JAK-STAT signaling pathway in endothelium. Notably, in the presence of circulating immune cells, a series of alveolar pathological changes were observed, including the detachment of endothelial cells, recruitment of immune cells, and increased production of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-1{beta} and TNF-). These new findings revealed a crucial role of immune cells in mediating lung injury and exacerbated inflammation. Treatment with antiviral compound remdesivir could suppress viral copy and alleviate the disruption of alveolar barrier integrity induced by viral infection. This bioengineered human organ chip system can closely mirror human-relevant lung pathogenesis and immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, not possible by other in vitro models, which provides a promising and alternative platform for COVID-19 research and preclinical trials.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Min Zhang","author_inst":"Division of Biotechnology, CAS Key Laboratory of SSAC, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian, China."},{"author_name":"Peng Wang","author_inst":"Division of Biotechnology, CAS Key Laboratory of SSAC, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian, China."},{"author_name":"Ronghua Luo","author_inst":"Kunming National High-level Bio-safety Research Center for Non-human Primates, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy "},{"author_name":"Yaqing Wang","author_inst":"Division of Biotechnology, CAS Key Laboratory of SSAC, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian, China;

To present day, however, lack of race-disaggregated individual data has prevented a rigorous assessment of the extent of this phenomenon and the reasons why blacks may be particularly vulnerable to the disease. Using individual and georeferenced death data collected daily by the Cook County Medical Examiner, we provide first evidence that race does affect COVID-19 outcomes. The data confirm that in Cook County blacks are overrepresented in terms of COVID-19 related deaths since - as of June 16, 2020 - they constitute 35 percent of the dead, so that they are dying at a rate 1.3 times higher than their population share. Furthermore, by combining the spatial distribution of mortality with the 1930s redlining maps for the Chicago area, we obtain a block group level panel dataset of weekly deaths over the period January 1, 2020-June 16, 2020, over which we establish that, after the outbreak of the epidemic, historically lower-graded neighborhoods display a sharper increase in mortality, driven by blacks, while no pre-treatment differences are detected. Thus, we uncover a persistence influence of the racial segregation induced by the discriminatory lending practices of the 1930s, by way of a diminished resilience of the black population to the shock represented by the COVID-19 outbreak. A heterogeneity analysis reveals that the main channels of transmission are socioeconomic status and household composition, whose influence is magnified in combination with a higher black share.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Graziella Bertocchi","author_inst":"University of Modena and Reggio Emilia and EIEF"},{"author_name":"Arcangelo Dimico","author_inst":"Queen's University Belfast"},{"author_name":"Ronghua Luo","author_inst":"Kunming National High-level Bio-safety Research Center for Non-human Primates, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy "},{"author_name":"Yaqing Wang","author_inst":"Division of Biotechnology, CAS Key Laboratory of SSAC, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian, China; University of Chinese A"},{"author_name":"Zhongyu Li","author_inst":"Division of Biotechnology, CAS Key Laboratory of SSAC, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian, China."},{"author_name":"Yaqiong Guo","author_inst":"Division of Biotechnology, CAS Key Laboratory of SSAC, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian, China; University of Chinese A"},{"author_name":"Yulin Yao","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Animal Models and Human Disease Mechanisms of Chinese Academy of Sciences and Yunnan Province, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy o"},{"author_name":"Minghua Li","author_inst":"Kunming National High-level Bio-safety Research Center for Non-human Primates, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy "},{"author_name":"Tingting Tao","author_inst":"Division of Biotechnology, CAS Key Laboratory of SSAC, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian, China; University of Chinese A"},{"author_name":"Wenwen Chen","author_inst":"Division of Biotechnology, CAS Key Laboratory of SSAC, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian, China; University of Chinese A"},{"author_name":"Jianbao Han","author_inst":"Kunming National High-level Bio-safety Research Center for Non-human Primates, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy "},{"author_name":"Haitao Liu","author_inst":"Division of Biotechnology, CAS Key Laboratory of SSAC, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian, China; University of Chinese A"},{"author_name":"Kangli Cui","author_inst":"Division of Biotechnology, CAS Key Laboratory of SSAC, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian, China; University of Chinese A"},{"author_name":"Xu Zhang","author_inst":"Division of Biotechnology, CAS Key Laboratory of SSAC, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian, China."},{"author_name":"Yongtang Zheng","author_inst":"Kunming National High-level Bio-safety Research Center for Non-human Primates, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy "},{"author_name":"Jianhua Qin","author_inst":"Division of Biotechnology, CAS Key Laboratory of SSAC, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian, China; Institute for Stem Cell"},{"author_name":"Vito Martella","author_inst":"Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Bari, Valenzano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Fabrizio Solari Basano","author_inst":"Arcoblu s.r.l., Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Vanessa R Barrs","author_inst":"City University s Jockey Club College of Veterinary Medicine and Life Sciences, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Alan D Radford","author_inst":"Institute of Infection, Veterinary and Ecological Sciences, University of Liverpool, Neston, UK"},{"author_name":"Umberto Agrimi","author_inst":"Department of Food Safety, Nutrition and Veterinary Public Health, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Grant L Hughes","author_inst":"Departments of Vector Biology and Tropical Disease Biology, Centre for Neglected Tropical Disease, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine,  Liverpool, UK"},{"author_name":"Saverio Paltrinieri","author_inst":"Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Milan, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Nicola Decaro","author_inst":"Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Bari, Valenzano, Italy"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health economics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.15.20150490","rel_title":"Observational Study of Haloperidol in Hospitalized Patients with Covid-19","rel_date":"2020-07-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.15.20150490","rel_abs":"Background: Haloperidol, a widely used antipsychotic, has been suggested as potential effective treatment for Covid-19 on the grounds of its in-vitro antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We examined the association between haloperidol use and respiratory failure at AP-HP Greater Paris University hospitals. Data were obtained regarding all adult patients hospitalized with Covid-19 since the beginning of the epidemic. Study baseline was defined as the date of hospital admission. The primary endpoint was a composite of intubation or death and the secondary endpoint was discharge home among survivors in time-to-event analyses. We compared outcomes between patients who were exposed to haloperidol and those who were not, using a multivariable Cox regression model with inverse probability weighting according to the propensity score. Results: Of the 13,279 hospitalized adult patients with positive Covid-19 RT-PCR test, 667 patients (5.0%) were excluded because of missing data. Of the remaining 12,612 patients, 104 (0.8%) were exposed to haloperidol. Over a mean follow-up of 20.8 days, the primary endpoint of respiratory failure respectively occurred in 27 patients (26.0%) exposed to haloperidol and 1,700 patients (13.6%) who were not. Among survivors, the secondary endpoint of discharge home occurred in 26 patients (32.1%) who received haloperidol and 6,110 patients (55.3%) who did not. In the main analysis, there were no significant associations between haloperidol use and the primary (HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.60 to 1.97, p=0.772) and secondary (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.53, p=0.643) endpoints. Results were similar in multiple sensitivity analyses. Conclusion: In this observational study involving patients with Covid-19 who had been admitted to the hospital, haloperidol use was not associated with risk of intubation or death, or with time to hospital discharge home. These results suggest that haloperidol is unlikely to have a clinical efficacy for Covid-19.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicolas HOERTEL","author_inst":"Universite de Paris"},{"author_name":"Marina SANCHEZ RICO","author_inst":"Universidad Complutense de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Raphael VERNET","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Anne-Sophie JANNOT","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Antoine NEURAZ","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Carlos BLANCO","author_inst":"National Institute on Drug Abuse"},{"author_name":"Cedric LEMOGNE","author_inst":"Universite de Paris"},{"author_name":"Guillaume AIRAGNES","author_inst":"Universite de Paris"},{"author_name":"Nicolas PARIS","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Christel DANIEL","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Alexandre GRAMFORT","author_inst":"INRIA"},{"author_name":"Guillaume LEMAITRE","author_inst":"INRIA"},{"author_name":"Melodie BERNAUX","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Ali BELLAMINE","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Nathanael BEEKER","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Frederic LIMOSIN","author_inst":"Universite de Paris"},{"author_name":"Vito Martella","author_inst":"Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Bari, Valenzano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Fabrizio Solari Basano","author_inst":"Arcoblu s.r.l., Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Vanessa R Barrs","author_inst":"City University s Jockey Club College of Veterinary Medicine and Life Sciences, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Alan D Radford","author_inst":"Institute of Infection, Veterinary and Ecological Sciences, University of Liverpool, Neston, UK"},{"author_name":"Umberto Agrimi","author_inst":"Department of Food Safety, Nutrition and Veterinary Public Health, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Grant L Hughes","author_inst":"Departments of Vector Biology and Tropical Disease Biology, Centre for Neglected Tropical Disease, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine,  Liverpool, UK"},{"author_name":"Saverio Paltrinieri","author_inst":"Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Milan, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Nicola Decaro","author_inst":"Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Bari, Valenzano, Italy"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.18.20155374","rel_title":"Dynamics and significance of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection","rel_date":"2020-07-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.18.20155374","rel_abs":"BACKGROUND Characterizing the humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and developing accurate serologic assays are needed for diagnostic purposes and estimating population-level seroprevalence. METHODS We measured the kinetics of early antibody responses to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of 259 symptomatic North American patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (up to 75 days after symptom onset) compared to antibody levels in 1548 individuals whose blood samples were obtained prior to the pandemic. RESULTS Between 14-28 days from onset of symptoms, IgG, IgA, or IgM antibody responses to RBD were all accurate in identifying recently infected individuals, with 100% specificity and a sensitivity of 97%, 91%, and 81% respectively. Although the estimated median time to becoming seropositive was similar across isotypes, IgA and IgM antibodies against RBD were short-lived with most individuals estimated to become seronegative again by 51 and 47 days after symptom onset, respectively. IgG antibodies against RBD lasted longer and persisted through 75 days post-symptoms. IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 RBD were highly correlated with neutralizing antibodies targeting the S protein. No cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-targeted antibodies was observed with several known circulating coronaviruses, HKU1, OC 229 E, OC43, and NL63. CONCLUSIONS Among symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 cases, RBD-targeted antibodies can be indicative of previous and recent infection. IgG antibodies are correlated with neutralizing antibodies and are possibly a correlate of protective immunity.","rel_num_authors":35,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anita S

We show that the choice of pooling method and pool size is an intricate decision with a prevalence-dependent efficiency-sensitivity trade-off.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jasper Verwilt","author_inst":"Ghent University"},{"author_name":"Pieter Mestdagh","author_inst":"Ghent University"},{"author_name":"Jo Vandesompele","author_inst":"Ghent University"},{"author_name":"Meagan Kelly","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Margaret Becker","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Damien Slater","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Rachel Mills","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Erica Teng","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Kamruzzaman","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Wilfredo F Garcia-Beltran","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Michael Astudillo","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Diane Yang","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Tyler E Miller","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Oiver","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Fischinger","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Caroline Atyeo","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Anthony John Iafrate","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Stephen B Calderwood","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Stephen A Lauer","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Jingyou Yu","author_inst":"Center for Virology and Vaccine Research, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical  School, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Zhenfeng Li","author_inst":"Center for Virology and Vaccine Research, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard"},{"author_name":"Jared Feldman","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Blake M Hauser","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Timothy M Cardonna","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"John A Branda","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Sarah E Turbett","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Regina C LaRocque","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Guillaume Mellon","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Dan H Barouch","author_inst":"Center for Virology and Vaccine Research, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical  School, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Aaron G Schmidt","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Andrew S Azman","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Galit Alter","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Edward T Ryan","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Jason B Harris","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Richelle C Charles","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.09.20149450","rel_title":"Genetic validation of the use of tocilizumab, statins and dexamethasone in COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-07-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.09.20149450","rel_abs":"Background: New means of treating COVID-19 are urgently needed. Genetic validation of drugs can foreshadow trial results, and help prioritize investigations. We assessed whether common drugs, suggested as possible treatments for COVID-19 (tocilizumab, anakinra and statins) with established genetic proxies, are effective in COVID-19. We also included dexamethasone as a positive control exposure because the RECOVERY trial suggested benefit in severe COVID-19. Methods: We assessed, using Mendelian randomization, whether genetic proxies of tocilizumab, anakinra, statins and dexamethasone use affected risk of very severe (cases=536, non-cases=329391) or hospitalized (cases=3199, non-cases=897488) COVID-19 using a recent genome-wide association study. Results: Using rs2228145 (IL6R) to proxy effects of tocilizumab use, no association with very severe COVID-19 was found, but possibly an inverse association with hospitalized COVID-19 (odds ratio (OR) 0.83 per standardized effect of higher soluble interleukin-6r, 95% confidence interval 0.67 to 1.02). Using rs12916 (HMGCR) to proxy effects of statins use, an inverse association with very severe COVID-19 was found (OR 0.30 per standardized effect, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.89). Using rs6743376 and rs1542176 to proxy effects of anakinra use, no associations with COVID-19 were found. Dexamethasone, instrumented by cortisol, was possibly inversely associated with very severe COVID-19 (OR 0.20 per standardized effect 95% CI 0.04 to 1.04). Conclusion: Our study provides some genetic validation for the use of both tocilizumab and statins in COVID-19, but not anakinra, whilst being consistent with the findings from the RECOVERY trial about dexamethasone. Investigation of the underlying mechanisms might facilitate re-purposing and development of effective treatments.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"C M Schooling","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong and CUNY SPH"},{"author_name":"SL Au Yeung","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"MK Kwok","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"JV Zhao","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Margaret Becker","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Damien Slater","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Rachel Mills","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Erica Teng","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Kamruzzaman","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Wilfredo F Garcia-Beltran","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Michael Astudillo","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Diane Yang","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Tyler E Miller","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Oiver","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Fischinger","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Caroline Atyeo","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Anthony John Iafrate","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Stephen B Calderwood","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Stephen A Lauer","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Jingyou Yu","author_inst":"Center for Virology and Vaccine Research, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical  School, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Zhenfeng Li","author_inst":"Center for Virology and Vaccine Research, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard"},{"author_name":"Jared Feldman","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Blake M Hauser","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Timothy M Cardonna","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"John A Branda","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Sarah E Turbett","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Regina C LaRocque","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Guillaume Mellon","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Dan H Barouch","author_inst":"Center for Virology and Vaccine Research, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical  School, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Aaron G Schmidt","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Andrew S Azman","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Galit Alter","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Edward T Ryan","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Jason B Harris","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Richelle C Charles","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.15.20154336","rel_title":"Epidemiological Profile and Transmission Dynamics of COVID-19 in the Philippines","rel_date":"2020-07-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.15.20154336","rel_abs":"The Philippines confirmed local transmission of COVID-19 on 7 March 2020.

One hundred and thirty six mothers (64%) sought support to protect their infants by continuing breastfeeding, increasing milk supply, or restarting breastfeeding. Mothers were commonly stressed, isolated and needing reassurance. Thirty four (10%) raised concerns about COVID-19 and breastfeeding safety. One hundred and twenty nine (61%) informed volunteers they were unable to access face-to-face health services because of fear or unavailability. Most common breastfeeding concerns were related to insufficient milk or weight gain, painful breasts, relactation, and reducing supplemental milk. Volunteers reported mothers were worried stress had reduced milk supply, that milk supply concerns were exacerbated by the inability to weigh infants, and that seeking medical treatment was being delayed. ABA volunteers stated they felt supported and confident assisting mothers while also expressing distress at mothers situation.

The first is to keep the COVID-19 fatality rate down. The second is to revive the U.S. economy and the livelihood of millions of Americans. In this paper, a team of researchers from the Center on Stochastic Modeling, Optimization, & Statistics (COSMOS) at the University of Texas at Arlington, in collaboration with researchers from University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, has formulated a computationally-efficient optimization framework, referred to as COSMOS COVID-19 Linear Programming (CC19LP), to study the delicate balance between the expected fatality rate and the level of normalcy in the community. Given the disproportionate fatality characteristics of COVID-19 among those in different age groups or with an underlying medical condition or those living with crowding, the key to the CC19LP framework is a focus on \"key contacts\" that separate individuals at higher risk from the rest of the population. The philosophy of CC19LP lies in maximizing protection of key contacts, so as to shield high-risk individuals from infection. Given the lack of pharmaceutical solutions, i.e., a vaccine or cure, the CC19LP framework minimizes expected fatalities by optimizing the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions, namely COVID-19 testing; personal protective equipment; and social precautions, such as distancing, hand-washing, and face coverings. Low-risk individuals that are not key contacts, including most children, are unrestricted and can choose to participate in pre-pandemic normal activities, which eliminates the need for compliance across the entire population. Consequently, the CC19LP framework demonstrates optimal strategies for protecting high-risk individuals while reopening communities.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Victoria C.

The research employs a model of the laboratory's testing process, created after interviewing of PCR laboratories and studying their operations. The limitations and operational characteristics of this model were applied in a simulation of the testing process with different pool-testing strategies managed by a computer program developed in the LOMT project. The efficiency indicators assessed are the number of assays needed to obtain results of a batch of specimens, the number of specimens identified after the first analysis, and total time to obtain all results. Depending on prevalence, constraints of testing, and priorities of optimization, different pool-testing strategies provide the best operational efficiency. The binary splitting algorithm provides the maximum reduction of the number of assays: from 1.99x reduction for a high prevalence (10%) to 25x reduction for a low prevalence (0.1%), while other algorithms provide the least amount of time to obtain results or the maximum number of the specimens classified after the first analysis.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kirill Vechera","author_inst":"Jetware"},{"author_name":"Yuan Zhou","author_inst":"University of Texas at Arlington"},{"author_name":"Alireza Fallahi","author_inst":"University of Texas at Arlington"},{"author_name":"Amith Viswanatha","author_inst":"University of Texas at Arlington"},{"author_name":"Yasaman Ghasemi","author_inst":"University of Texas at Arlington"},{"author_name":"Nilabh S.

As a response to the emergency virtual education was implemented in almost every country of the region. Methods: a massive open online course about epilepsy was made using only free software and platforms following the international league against epilepsy competence-based domains for epileptology teaching. Results: 250 healthcare students signed up for the course and only 17.2% of them had previously participated in courses like this one. This course had a completion rate of 37.2% and of the students that completed the course 98.3% would participate in course like this in the future. Conclusion: In conclusion MOOCs can be easily implemented as a powerful pedagogic strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic and can have a positive impact not only in in its proposed learning objectives but it can help closing the gap that prevent Latin American healthcare students to acquire actively knowledge trough them.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Ramirez","author_inst":"Universidad pedagogica y Tecnologica de Colombia."},{"author_name":"Yuan Zhou","author_inst":"University of Texas at Arlington"},{"author_name":"Alireza Fallahi","author_inst":"University of Texas at Arlington"},{"author_name":"Amith Viswanatha","author_inst":"University of Texas at Arlington"},{"author_name":"Yasaman Ghasemi","author_inst":"University of Texas at Arlington"},{"author_name":"Nilabh S.

Here we present antibody and T cell responses after BNT162b1 vaccination from a second, non-randomized open-label phase 1\/2 trial in healthy adults, 18-55 years of age. Two doses of 1 to 50 g of BNT162b1 elicited robust CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses and strong antibody responses, with RBD-binding IgG concentrations clearly above those in a COVID-19 convalescent human serum panel (HCS). Day 43 SARS-CoV-2 serum neutralising geometric mean titers were 0.7-fold (1 g) to 3.5-fold (50 g) those of HCS. Immune sera broadly neutralised pseudoviruses with diverse SARS-CoV-2 spike variants. Most participants had TH1 skewed T cell immune responses with RBD-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell expansion. Interferon (IFN){gamma} was produced by a high fraction of RBD-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. The robust RBD-specific antibody, T-cell and favourable cytokine responses induced by the BNT162b1 mRNA vaccine suggest multiple beneficial mechanisms with potential to protect against COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":42,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ugur Sahin","author_inst":"BioNTech"},{"author_name":"Alexander Muik","author_inst":"BioNTech"},{"author_name":"Evelyna Derhovanessian","author_inst":"BioNTech"},{"author_name":"Isabel Vogler","author_inst":"BioNTech"},{"author_name":"Lena M Kranz","author_inst":"BioNTech"},{"author_name":"Mathias Vormehr","author_inst":"BioNTech"},{"author_name":"Alina Baum","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc."},{"author_name":"Kristen Pascal","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jasmin Quandt","author_inst":"BioNTech"},{"author_name":"Daniel Maurus","author_inst":"BioNTech"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Brachtendorf","author_inst":"BioNTech"},{"author_name":"Verena L Loerks","author_inst":"BioNTech"},{"author_name":"Julian Sikorski","author_inst":"BioNTech"},{"author_name":"Rolf Hilker","author_inst":"BioNTech"},{"author_name":"Dirk Becker","author_inst":"BioNTech"},{"author_name":"Ann-Kathrin Eller","author_inst":"BioNTech"},{"author_name":"Jan Gruetzner","author_inst":"BioNTech"},{"author_name":"Carsten Boesler","author_inst":"BioNTech"},{"author_name":"Corinna Rosenbaum","author_inst":"BioNTech"},{"author_name":"Marie-Cristine Kuehnle","author_inst":"BioNTech"},{"author_name":"Ulrich Luxemburger","author_inst":"BioNTech"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Kemmer-Brueck","author_inst":"BioNTech"},{"author_name":"David Langer","author_inst":"BioNTech"},{"author_name":"Martin Bexon","author_inst":"Bexon Clinical Consulting LLC"},{"author_name":"Stefanie Bolte","author_inst":"BioNTech"},{"author_name":"Katalin Kariko","author_inst":"BioNTech"},{"author_name":"Tania Palanche","author_inst":"BioNTech"},{"author_name":"Boris Fischer","author_inst":"BioNTech"},{"author_name":"Armin Schultz","author_inst":"CRS Clinical Research Services Mannheim GmbH"},{"author_name":"Pei-Yong Shi","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Camila Fontes-Garfias","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"John L Perez","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Kena A Swanson","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Jakob Loschko","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Ingrid L Scully","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Mark Cutler","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Warren Kalina","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Christos A Kyratsous","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc."},{"author_name":"David Cooper","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Philip R Dormitzer","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Kathrin U Jansen","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Oezlem Tuereci","author_inst":"BioNTech"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.14.20144469","rel_title":"Initial experience in Mexico with convalescent plasma in COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory failure, a retrospective case series","rel_date":"2020-07-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.14.20144469","rel_abs":"Introduction: Hospital mortality due to COVID-19 in Mexico is high (32%) and as of today, effective treatment options are limited. More effective treatments that shorten hospital stay and reduce mortality are needed. Initial reports for the use of convalescent plasma (CP) therapy for COVID-19 appear promising. We describe a case series of eight patients with impending respiratory failure, who underwent CP therapy. Methods: Six male and two female (ages 31 to 79) patients that were admitted to the intensive-care unit for severe COVID-19 were transfused with two doses of CP (250 mL per dose, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers > 1:100). Donors were six SARS-CoV-2 infected males who remained asymptomatic for > 7 days and were negative for two nasopharyngeal RT-PCR tests. Clinical characteristics, inflammatory and cellular injury markers, chest X-ray findings and viral loads were analyzed before and after CP administration. Viral load association to disease severity was further analyzed on a separate cohort of asymptomatic vs hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Results: Eight patients with respiratory failure were successfully discharged with a median length of stay of 22.5 (IQR 18.25-29.00). After CP therapy, we observed a reduction of C-reactive protein (CRP) (median, 22.80 mg\/dL vs. 1.63 mg\/dL), and of procalcitonin (median, 0.27 ng\/mL vs. 0.13 ng\/mL). High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin I (hs-cTnI), Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) and Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) were lower, and a mild reduction of pulmonary infiltrates by chest X-ray was observed. Lastly, a reduction of viral load was after CP therapy was found. (log, median [IQR], 1.2 [0.70-2.20] vs. 0.25 [0.00-1.78]). We observed no adverse effects. Conclusions: CP could potentially be an effective therapeutic option for patients with severe COVID-19. Clinical benefit needs to be studied further through randomized controlled trials.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michel F.

Traditional Chinese herbal medicine has been integrated into the official therapeutic protocol against COVID-19 in China. Qing Fei Pai Du Tang (QFPDT) is a Chinese multi-herbal formula newly developed and specifically optimized for the treatment of COVID-19. Therapeutic administration of QFPDT resulted in an improved cure rate in mild to critically-ill patients. However, the immunological mechanism for the efficacy of QFPDT has been poorly understood. Furthermore, the feasibility of prophylactic use in uninfected individuals remain unconfirmed. We thus examined whether the administration of QFPDT at a dose lower than recommended for therapeutic use alters hematological and\/or immunological measures in healthy individuals. We found that QFPDT elevates the plasma levels of IL-1{beta}, IL-18, TNF-, and IL-8, which are key mediators of acute inflammatory responses to ssRNA viruses. No apparent adverse effects were observed during the trial. Our finding suggests that the pharmacological action of QFPDT is associated with the upregulation of a subset of proinflammatory cytokines despite its clinical benefits for COVID-19 patients. We should therefore be careful in its prophylactic use in uninfected individuals until we have a better understanding of the immunopharmacological action of QFPDT through further clinical studies with larger cohorts.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yasunari Kageyama","author_inst":"Takanawa Clinic"},{"author_name":"Koichi Aida","author_inst":"Takanawa Clinic"},{"author_name":"Kimihiko Kawauchi","author_inst":"Takanawa Clinic"},{"author_name":"Masafumi Morimoto","author_inst":"Takanawa Clinic"},{"author_name":"Tomoka Ebisui","author_inst":"Takanawa Clinic"},{"author_name":"Tetsu Akiyama","author_inst":"Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, The University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Tsutomu Nakamura","author_inst":"Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, The University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Reynaldo Lara-Medrano","author_inst":"Tecnologico de Monterrey, Escuela de Medicina y Ciencias de la Salud, Monterrey, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Hiram Villanueva-Lozano","author_inst":"Tecnologico de Monterrey, Escuela de Medicina y Ciencias de la Salud, Monterrey, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Teresa Ramirez-Elizondo","author_inst":"Tecnologico de Monterrey, Escuela de Medicina y Ciencias de la Salud, Monterrey, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Victor Sanchez-Nava","author_inst":"Tecnologico de Monterrey, Escuela de Medicina y Ciencias de la Salud, Monterrey, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Francisco Moreno-Hoyos","author_inst":"Tecnologico de Monterrey, Escuela de Medicina y Ciencias de la Salud, Monterrey, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Alfonso Martinez-Thomae","author_inst":"Tecnologico de Monterrey, Escuela de Medicina y Ciencias de la Salud, Monterrey, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Martin Hernandez-Torre","author_inst":"Tecnologico de Monterrey, Escuela de Medicina y Ciencias de la Salud, Monterrey, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Carlos Diaz-Olachea","author_inst":"Tecnologico de Monterrey, Escuela de Medicina y Ciencias de la Salud, Monterrey, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Servando Cardona-Huerta","author_inst":"Tecnologico de Monterrey, Escuela de Medicina y Ciencias de la Salud, Monterrey, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Sylvia de la Rosa-Pacheco","author_inst":"Tecnologico de Monterrey, Escuela de Medicina y Ciencias de la Salud, Monterrey, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Carlos Diaz-Garza","author_inst":"Tecnologico de Monterrey, Escuela de Medicina y Ciencias de la Salud, Monterrey, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Paola Reynoso-Lobo","author_inst":"Tecnologico de Monterrey, Escuela de Medicina y Ciencias de la Salud, Monterrey, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Alma R.

Measurements were made to characterize the size distribution of aerosol particles, and size-fractionated, aerosol samples were collected to assess the presence of infectious virus in particles sizes of >4.1 m, 1-4 m, and <1 m in the patient environment. Samples were analyzed by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), cell culture, western blot, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in all six rooms in all particle size fractions (>4.1 m, 1-4 m, and <1 m). Increases in viral RNA during cell culture of the virus from recovered aerosol samples demonstrated the presence of infectious, replicating virions in three <1 m aerosol samples (P<0.05). Viral replication of aerosol was also observed in the 1-4 m stage but did not reach statistical significance (0.05<P<0.10). Western blot and TEM analysis of these samples also showed evidence of viral proteins and intact virions. The infectious nature of aerosol collected in this study further suggests that airborne transmission of COVID-19 is possible, and that aerosol prevention measures are necessary to effectively stem the spread of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joshua L Santarpia","author_inst":"University of Nebraska Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Vicki L Herrera","author_inst":"University of Nebraska Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Danielle N Rivera","author_inst":"National Strategic Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Shanna Ratnesar-Shumate","author_inst":"University of Nebraska Medical Center"},{"author_name":"St. Patrick Reid","author_inst":"University of Nebraska Medical Cener"},{"author_name":"Paul W Denton","author_inst":"University of Nebraska Omaha"},{"author_name":"Jacob W.S.

By extensively analyzing 346 whole SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we demonstrated the simultaneous circulation in Lombardy of two major viral lineages, likely derived from multiple introductions, occurring since the second half of January. Seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (five of them non-synonymous) characterized the SARS-CoV-2 sequences, none of them affecting N-glycosylation sites. These two lineages, and the presence of two well defined clusters inside Lineage 1, revealed that a sustained community transmission was ongoing way before the first COVID-19 case found in Lombardy.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Claudia Alteri","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Valeria Cento","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Antonio Piralla","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo"},{"author_name":"Valentino Costabile","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Monica Tallarita","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo"},{"author_name":"Luna Colagrossi","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Silvia Renica","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Federica Giardina","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo"},{"author_name":"Federica Novazzi","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo"},{"author_name":"Stefano Gaiarsa","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo"},{"author_name":"Elisa Matarazzo","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Maria Antonello","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Chiara Vismara","author_inst":"ASST Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda"},{"author_name":"Roberto Fumagalli","author_inst":"ASST Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda"},{"author_name":"Oscar Massimiliano Epis","author_inst":"ASST Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda"},{"author_name":"Massimo Puoti","author_inst":"ASST Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda"},{"author_name":"Carlo Federico Perno","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Fausto Baldanti","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo"},{"author_name":"Paola Reynoso-Lobo","author_inst":"Tecnologico de Monterrey, Escuela de Medicina y Ciencias de la Salud, Monterrey, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Alma R.
