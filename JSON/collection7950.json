However, evidence is scarce regarding the efficacy of adjuvant corticosteroids in patients who are critically ill. We retrospectively evaluated the effects of adjuvant corticosteroid treatment on the outcome of 244 critically ill patients with COVID-19, using a risk stratification model that adjusts for potential differences between the steroid group (n=151) and the non-steroid group (n=93). We observed that adjuvant corticosteroid therapy was independent from 28-day mortality, either in multivariate logistic regression of the entire cohort after adjustment for major mortality-associated variables (age, SpO2\/FiO2, and lymphocyte count) and individual propensity score (adjusted OR: 1.05; 95% CI: -1.92-2.01), or in propensity score-matched (1:1 without replacement) case-control analysis (62 patients in 31 pairs; log-rank test P=0.17). Additionally, subgroup analyses of 147 (60%) patients who had dyspnea and 87 (36%) patients who had ARDS revealed corticosteroid treatment was not associated with clinical outcome (both, P>0.3). However, increased corticosteroids dosage was significantly associated with elevated mortality risk after adjustment for administration duration (P=0.003); every ten-milligram increase in hydrocortisone-equivalent dosage was associated with additional 4% mortality risk (adjusted HR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.07). Our findings indicated that limited effect of corticosteroid therapy could pose to overall survival and prudent dose within effective limits may be recommended for critically ill patients under certain circumstances.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaofan Lu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Research Center of Biostatistics and Computational Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China"},{"author_name":"Taige Chen","author_inst":"Medical School of Nanjing University"},{"author_name":"Yang Wang","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, The Affiliated Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, China"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Bing Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, The Affiliated Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, China"},{"author_name":"Yongsheng Li","author_inst":"Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1095 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430030"},{"author_name":"Fangrong Yan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Research Center of Biostatistics and Computational Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.06.20055640","rel_title":"Gaussian Statistics and Data-Assimilated Model of Mortality due to COVID-19: China, USA, Italy, Spain, UK, Iran, and the World Total","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.06.20055640","rel_abs":"Covid-19 is characterized by rapid transmission and severe symptoms, leading to deaths in some cases (ranging from 1.5 to 12% of the affected, depending on the country).

This limits not only the ability to fit PPE to medical practitioners, but also the ability to rapidly prototype and produce alternative sources of PPE as it is difficult to validate fit. At the George Washington University, we evaluated an easily sourced method of qualitative fit testing using a nebulizer or atomizer and a sodium saccharin solution in water. If aerosolized saccharin entered candidate masks due to poor fit or inadequate filtration, then a sweet taste was detected in the mouth of the user. This method was tested against previously fit tested Milwaukee N95 and 3D Printed Reusable N95 Respirator as a positive control. A Chinese sourced KN95, cotton cloth material, and surgical mask were tested as other masks of interest. Sensitivity testing was done with no mask prior to fit test. A sweet taste was detected for both the surgical mask and cotton cloth, demonstrating a lack of seal. However, there was no sweet taste detected for the Milwaukee N95, 3D Printed Reusable N95 Respirator, or Chinese KN95. These results demonstrate this could be a valuable methodology for rapid prototyping, evaluation, and validation of fit in a non-clinical environment for use in creation of PPE. This method should be not be used without confirmation in a formal qualitative or quantitative fit test but can be used to preserve those resources until developers are confident that potential new N95 comparable respirators will pass. We strongly suggest validation of masks and respirators with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) approved fit testing prior to use in a clinical environment.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Destie Provenzano","author_inst":"The George Washington University"},{"author_name":"Yuan James Rao","author_inst":"The George Washington University"},{"author_name":"Konstantin Mitic","author_inst":"The George Washington University"},{"author_name":"Sofian N Obaid","author_inst":"The George Washington University"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Berger","author_inst":"The George Washington University"},{"author_name":"Sharad Goyal","author_inst":"The George Washington University"},{"author_name":"Murray H Loew","author_inst":"The George Washington University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health systems and quality improvement"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.07.20056440","rel_title":"Convalescent Plasma to Treat COVID-19: Chinese Strategy and Experiences","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.07.20056440","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 is currently spreading around the world, which has posed significant threats to global health and economy.

While the analogous event in China appears to be rather under control at the moment, the outbreaks in western countries are still at an early stage of the evolution. Italy at present is playing a major role in understanding transmission dynamics of these new infections and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures in a western social context. Methods: We combined a quarantined models with early stage evolution data in Italy (during February 20th - March 30th) to predict longer term evolution (March 30th, on ...) within different control measures. Due to significant variations in the control strategies, which have been changing over time, and thanks to the introduction of detection technologies leading to faster confirmation of the SARS-CoV-2 infections, we made use of time-dependent contact and diagnose rates to estimate when the effective daily reproduction ratio can fall below 1. Within the same framework we analyze the possible event of a secondary infection after relaxing the isolation measures. Outcomes and interpretation: We study two simplified scenarios compatible with the observation data and the effects of two stringent measures on the evolution of the epidemic. On one side the contact rate must obviously kept as low as possible, but it is also clear that, in a modern developed country, it cannot fall under certain minimum levels and for long time. The complementary parameter tuned is the transition rate of the symptomatic infected individuals to the quarantined class, a parameter {delta}_I connected with the time t_I=1\/{delta}_I needed to perform diagnostic tests. Within the conditions of the outbreak in Italy this time must fall under 12-8 hours in order to make the reproduction number less than 1 to minimize the case numbers. Moreover we show how the same parameter plays an even more relevant role in mitigating the effects of a possible secondary infection event.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marco Claudio Traini","author_inst":"Trento University"},{"author_name":"Carla Caponi","author_inst":"Clinica Geriatrica, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria, Piazzale Gambuli 1, 06132, Perugia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Riccardo Ferrari","author_inst":"Bilubah LLC, 30 N.

Design This is the protocol of a living systematic review. Data sources We will conduct searches in PubMed\/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), grey literature and in a centralised repository in L-OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence). L-OVE is a platform that maps PICO questions to evidence from Epistemonikos database. In response to the COVID-19 emergency, L-OVE was adapted to expand the range of evidence it covers and customised to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place. The search will cover the period until the day before submission to a journal. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies and methods We will follow a common protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews, already published and submitted to PROSPERO (awaiting ID allocation). We will include studies that assess patients with confirmed or suspected infection with SARS-CoV-2 and inform the relation of potential prognostic factors with death or disease severity. Two groups of two reviewers will independently screen studies for eligibility, extract data, and assess the risk of bias. We will perform meta-analyses and use GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each prognostic factor and outcome. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will resubmit it if the conclusions change or there are substantial updates. Ethics and dissemination No ethics approval is considered necessary. The results of this review will be widely disseminated via peer-reviewed publications, social networks and traditional media.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ariel Izcovich","author_inst":"Hospital Alem\u00e1n de Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Mart\u00edn Ragusa","author_inst":"Hospital Alem\u00e1n de Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Ver\u00f3nica Sanguine","author_inst":"Ministerio de Salud de la Naci\u00f3n, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Fernando Tortosa","author_inst":"Hospital Ram\u00f3n Carrillo, San Carlos de Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Federico Espinosa","author_inst":"Hospital Alem\u00e1n de Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Camila Agnoletti","author_inst":"Hospital Alem\u00e1n de Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Mar\u00eda Andrea Lavena Marzio","author_inst":"Hospital Alem\u00e1n de Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Agust\u00edn Bengolea","author_inst":"Hospital Alem\u00e1n de Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Ezequiel Saavedra","author_inst":"Hospital Alem\u00e1n de Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Hugo Norberto Catalano","author_inst":"Hospital Alem\u00e1n de Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Rada","author_inst":"Fundaci\u00f3n Epistemonikos, Santiago, Chile"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.08.20056986","rel_title":"Development of a dual-gene loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) detection assay for SARS-CoV-2: A preliminary study","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.08.20056986","rel_abs":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as a rapidly spreading global pathogen stressing the need for development of rapid testing protocols ever than before.

For this purpose, we implemented the reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) methodology for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In order to improve the detection capability, the RT-LAMP assay was developed to simultaneously amplify two viral genes: ORF1a and N. A total of 45 SARS-CoV-2 associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases were enrolled. Viral RNA was extracted from the nasopharyngeal swab samples and analyzed simultaneously using PCR and RT-LAMP protocols. Overall, our SARS-CoV-2 dual gene RT-LAMP assay was found to be 95% accurate in detecting positive cases and showed no cross-reactivity or false-positive result in non-COVID-19 samples.

Recent publications have drawn attention to the possible benefit of chloroquine (CQ). Our study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the safety and efficacy of two different CQ dosages in patients with established severe COVID-19. Methods We performed a parallel, double-blinded, randomized, phase IIb clinical trial, aiming to assess safety and efficacy of two different CQ dosages as adjunctive therapy of hospitalized patients with SARS in Manaus, Brazilian Amazon. Eligible participants were allocated to receive orally or via nasogastric tube high dose CQ (600mg CQ twice daily for 10 days or total dose 12g); or low dose CQ (450mg for 5 days, twice daily only on the first day, or total dose 2.7g). In addition, all patients received ceftriaxone and azithromycin. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT04323527. Findings Out of a pre-defined 440 patients sample size, 81 patients were enrolled. The high dose CQ arm presented more QTc>500ms (25%), and a trend toward higher lethality (17%) than the lower dosage. Fatality rate was 13.5% (95%CI=6.9-23.0%), overlapping with the CI of historical data from similar patients not using CQ (95%CI=14.5-19.2%). In 14 patients with paired samples, respiratory secretion at day 4 was negative in only one patient. Interpretation Preliminary findings suggest that the higher CQ dosage (10-day regimen) should not be recommended for COVID-19 treatment because of its potential safety hazards. Such results forced us to prematurely halt patient recruitment to this arm. Given the enormous global push for the use of CQ for COVID-19, results such as the ones found in this trial can provide robust evidence for updated COVID-19 patient management recommendations.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mayla Gabriela Silva Borba","author_inst":"Universidade do Estado do Amazonas"},{"author_name":"Fernando de Almeida Val","author_inst":"Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Doutor Heitor Vieira Dourado"},{"author_name":"Vanderson Sousa Sampaio","author_inst":"Fundacao de MedicinaTropical Doutor Heitor Vieira Dourado"},{"author_name":"Marcia Almeida Ara&uacutejo Alexandre","author_inst":"Fundacoa de Medicina Tropical Doutor Heitor Vieira Dourado"},{"author_name":"Gisely Cardoso Melo","author_inst":"Fundacoa de Medicina Tropical Doutor Heitor Vieira Dourado"},{"author_name":"Marcelo Brito","author_inst":"Universidade do Estado do Amazonas"},{"author_name":"Maria Paula Gomes Mour&atildeo","author_inst":"Universidade do Estado do Amazonas"},{"author_name":"Jos&eacute Diego Brito Sousa","author_inst":"Universidade do Estado do Amazonas"},{"author_name":"Djane Clarys Baia-da-Silva","author_inst":"Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Doutor Heitor Vieira Dourado"},{"author_name":"Marcus Vinitius Farias Guerra","author_inst":"Fundacao de MedicinaTropical Doutor Heitor Vieira Dourado"},{"author_name":"Ludhmila Abrah\u0101o Hajjar","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Rosemary Costa Pinto","author_inst":"Fundacao de Vigilancia em Saude do Amazonas"},{"author_name":"Antonio Alcirley Silva Balieiro","author_inst":"Instituto Leonidas e Maria Deane"},{"author_name":"Felipe Gomes Naveca","author_inst":"Instituto Leonidas & Maria Deane"},{"author_name":"Mariana Sim\u0101o Xavier","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Carlos Chagas-FIOCRUZ"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Salom\u00e3o","author_inst":"Hospital Santa Julia"},{"author_name":"Andr\u00e9 Machado Siqueira","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Carlos Chagas-FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Schwarzbolt","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil"},{"author_name":"J\u00falio Henrique Rosa Croda","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade Federal do Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Maur\u00edcio Lacerda Nogueira","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Sao Jose do Rio Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Gustavo Adolfo Sierra Romero","author_inst":"Universidade de Brasilia, Brasilia, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Quique Bassat","author_inst":"ISGlobal, Hospital Clinic Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Cor Jesus Fontes","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Bernardino Cl\u00e1udio Albuquerque","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade Federal do Amazonas, Manaus, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Cl\u00e1udio Tadeu Daniel-Ribeiro","author_inst":"Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil"},{"author_name":"Wuelton Marcelo Monteiro","author_inst":"Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Doutor Heitor Vieira Dourado"},{"author_name":"Marcus Vin\u00edcus Guimar\u00e3es Lacerda","author_inst":"Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Doutor Heitor Vieira Dourado"},{"author_name":"CloroCovid-19 Team","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.06.20055228","rel_title":"Multi-route respiratory infection: when a transmission route may dominate","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.06.20055228","rel_abs":"The exact transmission route of many respiratory infectious diseases remains a subject for debate to date.

It is illustrated that all transmission routes can dominate the total transmission risk under different scenarios. Influential parameters considered include dose-response rate of different routes, droplet governing size that determines virus content in droplets, exposure distance, and virus dose transported to the hand of infector.

We developed a method using a widely available lysis buffer coupled with solid-phase reverse immobilization (SPRI) beads to extract viral RNA from swabs collected in viral transport medium (VTM) which can be performed manually or on a Hamilton STAR liquid-handling robot. Using a WHO recommended, laboratory-developed RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2, we validated this method in a CAP-accredited laboratory, against the IVD-labelled bioMerieux NucliSENS easyMAG automated extraction platform. Our method demonstrates a comparable sensitivity and specificity, making it suitable for large-scale testing and monitoring of suspected COVID-19 cases and healthcare workers.

We develop a compartmental model for assessing the community-wide impact of mask use by the general, asymptomatic public, a portion of which may be asymptomatically infectious. Model simulations, using data relevant to COVID-19 dynamics in the US states of New York and Washington, suggest that broad adoption of even relatively ineffective face masks may meaningfully reduce community transmission of COVID-19 and decrease peak hospitalizations and deaths. Moreover, mask use decreases the effective transmission rate in nearly linear proportion to the product of mask effectiveness (as a fraction of potentially infectious contacts blocked) and coverage rate (as a fraction of the general population), while the impact on epidemiologic outcomes (death, hospitalizations) is highly nonlinear, indicating masks could synergize with other non-pharmaceutical measures. Notably, masks are found to be useful with respect to both preventing illness in healthy persons and preventing asymptomatic transmission. Hypothetical mask adoption scenarios, for Washington and New York state, suggest that immediate near universal (80%) adoption of moderately (50%) effective masks could prevent on the order of 17--45% of projected deaths over two months in New York, while decreasing the peak daily death rate by 34--58%, absent other changes in epidemic dynamics. Even very weak masks (20% effective) can still be useful if the underlying transmission rate is relatively low or decreasing: In Washington, where baseline transmission is much less intense, 80% adoption of such masks could reduce mortality by 24--65% (and peak deaths 15--69%), compared to 2--9% mortality reduction in New York (peak death reduction 9--18%). Our results suggest use of face masks by the general public is potentially of high value in curtailing community transmission and the burden of the pandemic. The community-wide benefits are likely to be greatest when face masks are used in conjunction with other non-pharmaceutical practices (such as social-distancing), and when adoption is nearly universal (nation-wide) and compliance is high.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Steffen E.

Although quarantine measures have been used widely, the critical steps among them to suppress the outbreak without a huge social-economic loss remain unknown. Hong Kong, unlike other regions in the world, had a massive number of travellers from Mainland China during the early expansion period, and yet the spread of virus has been relatively limited. Understanding the effect of control measures to reduce the transmission in Hong Kong can improve the control of the virus spreading. We have developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantined-recovered (SEIQR) meta-population model that can stratify the infections into imported and subsequent local infections, and therefore to obtain the control effects on transmissibility in a region with many imported cases. We fitted the model to both imported and local confirmed cases with symptom onset from 18 January to 29 February 2020 in Hong Kong with daily transportation data and the transmission dynamics from Wuhan and Mainland China. The model estimated that the reproductive number was dropped from 2.32 to 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66 to 0.86) after an infected case was estimated to be quarantined half day before the symptom onset, corresponding to the incubation time of 5.43 days (95% CI, 1.30-9.47). If the quarantine happened about one day after the onset, community spread would be likely to occur, indicated by the reproductive number larger than one. The results suggest that the early quarantine for a suspected case before the symptom onset is a key factor to suppress COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hsiang-Yu Yuan","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Axiu Mao","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Guiyuan Han","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Hsiangkuo Yuan","author_inst":"Thomas Jefferson University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dirk Pfeiffer","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Yang Kuang","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Eric Kostelich","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Abba B.

As the number of cases worldwide overtakes one million, data reveals closed outbreaks in Hubei and South Korea, with a new slight increase in the number of infected people in the latter. Both of these countries have reached a plateau in the number of Total Confirmed Cases per Million (TCCpM) residents, suggesting a trend to be followed by other affected regions. Using Hubei's data as a basis of analysis, we have studied the spreading rate of COVID-19 and modelled the epidemic center for 10 European countries. We have also given the final TCCpM curves for Italy and Lombardia. The introduction of the -factor allows us to analyse the different stages of the outbreak, compare the European countries amongst each other, and, finally, to confront the initial phase of the disease between Europe and South America. Methods: By dividing the TCCpM curves in multiple sections spanning short time frames we were able to fit each section to a linear model. By pairing then the angular coefficient ( factor) of each section to the total number of confirmed infections at the center of the corresponding time interval, we have analysed how the spreading rate of Covid-19 changes as more people are infected. Also, by modelling the TCCpM curves with an asymmetrical time integral of a Normal Distribution, we were able to study, by fitting progressively larger data ensembles, how the fitting parameters change as more data becomes available. Findings: The data analysis shows that the spreading rate of COVID-19 increases similarly for all countries in its early stage, but changes as the number of TCCpM in each country grows. Regarding the modelling of the TCCpM curves, we have found that the fitting parameters oscillate with time before reaching constant values. The estimation of such values allows the determination of better parameters for the model, which in turn leads to more trustworthy forecasts on the pandemic development. Interpretation: The analysis of the oscillating fitting parameters allows an early prediction of the TCC, epidemic center and standard deviation of the outbreak. The  factor and the recovered over confirmed cases ratio can be used to understand the pandemic development in each country and to compare the protective measures taken by local authorities and their impact on the spreading of the disease.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stefano De Leo","author_inst":"State University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Gulak Maia","author_inst":"Institute for Industrial and Scientific Research, Osaka University,  Ibaraki, Japan"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Solidoro","author_inst":"Salento University, Lecce, Italy"},{"author_name":"Hsiangkuo Yuan","author_inst":"Thomas Jefferson University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dirk Pfeiffer","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Yang Kuang","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Eric Kostelich","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Abba B.

This connection arises from differences in the rates of infection in countries where BCG vaccination is mandatory compared to countries where mandatory vaccination no longer exists or was never implemented in the first place. In at least 2 preprint publications the authors expressed the view that the \"known immunological benefits\" of BCG vaccination may be behind the biological mechanism of such observation. One study accounted for different income levels in different groups. Another study did not attempted to do so, instead exploring the differences between countries where a booster shot is given vs others where no such practice exists (finding no connection). Both of these studies did not explore other potential confounding factors. Meanwhile the press has focused on these headlines and pushed the narrative that BCG vaccination is causally linked to infection and mortality rates. This poses a serious challenge, demonstrated by the recently initiated clinical trials on BCG vaccination within the COVID19 context. This study shows that population age is a very significant confounding factor that explains the rates of infections much better and has a solid biology mechanism which explains this correlation. It suggests that BCG vaccination may have little or no causal link to infection rates and advises that any follow up studies should control for several confounding factors, such as population age, ethnicity, rates of certain chronic diseases, time from community spread start date, major public policy decisions and income levels.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"STEFAN Kirov","author_inst":"Bristol Myers Squibb"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Gulak Maia","author_inst":"Institute for Industrial and Scientific Research, Osaka University,  Ibaraki, Japan"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Solidoro","author_inst":"Salento University, Lecce, Italy"},{"author_name":"Hsiangkuo Yuan","author_inst":"Thomas Jefferson University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dirk Pfeiffer","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Yang Kuang","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Eric Kostelich","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Abba B.

Justified by the sigmoidal nature of a pandemic, i.e. initial exponential spread to eventual saturation, we apply the GM to the first corona pandemic wave using data from 25 countries, for which a sufficient amount of not yet fully developed data exists, as of April 2, 2020, and study the model's predictions. We find that logarithmic daily fatalities caused by Covid-19 are well described by a quadratic function in time. By fitting the data to second order polynomials from a statistical chi2-fit with 95% confidence, we are able to obtain the characteristic parameters of the GM, i.e. a width, peak height and time of peak, for each country separately. We provide evidence that this supposedly oversimplifying model might still have predictive power and use it to forecast the further course of the fatalities caused by Covid-19 per country, including peak number of deaths per day, date of peak, and duration within most deaths occur. While our main goal is to present the general idea of the simple modeling process using GMs, we also describe possible estimates for the number of required respiratory machines and the duration left until the number of infected will be significantly reduced.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Janik Schuttler","author_inst":"ETH Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Reinhard Schlickeiser","author_inst":"Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany"},{"author_name":"Frank Schlickeiser","author_inst":"Ruhr-University Bochum,Germany"},{"author_name":"Martin Kroger","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Dirk Pfeiffer","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Yang Kuang","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Eric Kostelich","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Abba B.

Findings: In this epidemiological study based on publicly available data, we develop a model that predicts vulnerability to COVID-19 for each US county in terms of likelihood of going from no documented cases to at least one case within five days and in terms of number of occurrences of the virus. Meaning: Predicting county vulnerability to COVID-19 can assist health organizations to better plan for resource and workforce needs. Abstract Importance: The rapid spread of COVID-19 means that government and health services providers have little time to plan and design effective response policies. It is therefore important to rapidly provide accurate predictions of how vulnerable geographic regions such as counties are to the spread. Objective: Developing county level prediction around near future disease movement for COVID-19 occurrences using publicly available data. Design: Original Investigation; Decision Analytical Model Study for County Level COVID-19 occurrences using data from March 14-31, 2020. Setting: Disease spread prediction for US counties. Participants: All US county level granularity based on data fused from multiple publicly available sources inclusive of health statistics, demographics, and geographical features. Exposure(s) (for observational studies): Daily county level reported COVID-19 occurrences from March 14-31, 2020. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): We developed a 3-stage model to quantify, firstly the probability of COVID-19 occurrence for unaffected counties using XGBoost classifier and secondly, the number of potential occurrences of a county via XGBoost regression. Thirdly, these results are combined to compute the county level risk. This risk is then used as an estimated after-five-day-vulnerability of the county. Results: Using data from March 14-31, 2020, the model shows a sensitivity over 71.5% and specificity over 94%. Conclusions and Relevance: We found that population, population density, percentage of people aged 70 or greater and prevalence of comorbidities play an important role in predicting COVID-19 occurrences. We found a positive association between affected and urban counties as well as less vulnerable and rural counties. The developed model can be used for identification of vulnerable counties and potential data discrepancies. Limited testing facilities and delayed results introduces significant variation in reported cases and produces a bias in the model.

We use a stochastic model to investigate containment and elimination scenarios for COVID-19 in New Zealand, as the country considers the exit from its four week period of strong Level 4 population-wide control measures. In particular we consider how the effectiveness of its case isolation operations influence the outcome of lifting these strong population-wide controls. The model is parameterised for New Zealand and is initialised using current case data, although we do not make use of information concerning the geographic dispersion of cases and the model is not stratified for age or co-morbidities. We find that fast tracing and case isolation (i.e. operations that are sustained at rates comparable to that at the early stages of New Zealand's response) can lead to containment or elimination, as long as strong population-wide controls remain in place. Slow case isolation can lead to containment (but not elimination) as long as strong Level 4 population-wide controls remain in place. However, we find that relaxing strong population-wide controls after four weeks will most likely lead to a further outbreak, although the speed of growth of this outbreak can be reduced by fast case isolation, by tracing, testing, or otherwise. We find that elimination is only likely if case isolation is combined with strong population-wide controls that are maintained for longer than four weeks. Further versions of this model will include an age-structured population as well as considering the effects of geographic dispersion and contact network structure, the possibility of regional containment combined with inter-regional travel restrictions, and the potential for harm to at risk communities and essential workers.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael J Plank","author_inst":"University of Canterbury"},{"author_name":"Rachelle N Binny","author_inst":"Manaaki Whenua"},{"author_name":"Shaun C Hendy","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Audrey Lustig","author_inst":"Manaaki Whenua"},{"author_name":"Alex James","author_inst":"University of Canterbury"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Steyn","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Eric Kostelich","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Abba B.

Hospital-associated transmission is an important route of spreading for the SARS-CoV-2 virus and healthcare providers are at the highest risk. As of February 2020, 1716, Chinese healthcare workers had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and at least 6 died. Unfortunately, there is currently no vaccine or pharmacological prophylaxis to decrease the risk of healthcare providers contracting the infection. Methods and analysis. We will randomize 470 healthcare providers scheduled to work with COVID 19 patients to receive nitric oxide gas administration (NO group, n=235) or no gas administration (control group, n=235). The primary endpoint of this study is the incidence of subjects with COVID-19 disease at 14 days from enrollment. Secondary endpoints are the proportion of healthcare providers who present a positive real time RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 14 days after enrollment, the proportion of healthcare providers requiring quarantine, and the total number of quarantine days in the two groups. Ethics and dissemination. The trial protocol is under the approval of The Partners Human Research Committee of Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, USA) and recruitment is expected to start in April 2020.

The projections from the age-stratified probabilities give much lower predicted incidences of infection than the Q-SEIR model.

The prevalence of CRD in Critical and Moderate+Severe patients was 53.85% and 13.95%, respectively. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed a significantly higher mortality rate in patients with CRD (P=0.0019). Multivariable analysis indicated that CRD was an independent predictor for death (HR = 3.75, 95% CI 1.26-11.15). Cluster analysis suggested that indicators for multi-organ injury were interdependent, and more proximities of FBG with indicators for multi-organ injury was present. Conclusion Our results suggest that new onset COVID-19-related diabetes is an indicator of multi-organ injury and predictor for poor outcomes and death in COVID-19 patients. As it is easy to perform for clinical practices and even self-monitoring, glucose testing will be much helpful for predicting poor outcomes to facilitate appropriate intensive care in patients with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jin-Kui Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jian-Min Jin","author_inst":"Beijing Tongren Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shi Liu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Peng Bai","author_inst":"Beijing Tongren Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wei He","author_inst":"Beijing Tongren Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fei Wu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Fang Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Tongren Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhong-Lin Chai","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"De-Min Han","author_inst":"Beijing Tongren Hospital"},{"author_name":"Robert Kacmarek","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesia,Critical Care and Pain Medicine, Massachussets General Hospital, Boston, Massachussets, USA."},{"author_name":"Ryan Carroll","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Massachussets General Hospital, Boston, Massachussets, USA"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Berra","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesia,Critical Care and Pain Medicine, Massachussets General Hospital, Boston, Massachussets, USA."},{"author_name":"Jianfang Tang","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qin Tian","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wei Yao","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Li Hu","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xiaofeng Yan","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Xinyuan Zhou","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pinghuang Liu","author_inst":"China Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Yuzhang Wu","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Kai Deng","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yaokai Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Zhaohui Qian","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Cl\u00e1udio Tadeu Daniel-Ribeiro","author_inst":"Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil"},{"author_name":"Wuelton Marcelo Monteiro","author_inst":"Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Doutor Heitor Vieira Dourado"},{"author_name":"Marcus Vin\u00edcus Guimar\u00e3es Lacerda","author_inst":"Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Doutor Heitor Vieira Dourado"},{"author_name":"CloroCovid-19 Team","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.09.034967","rel_title":"Comparative ACE2 variation and primate COVID-19 risk","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.09.034967","rel_abs":"The emergence of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which in humans is highly infectious and leads to the potentially fatal disease COVID-19, has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths and huge global disruption. The viral infection may also represent an existential threat to our closest living relatives, the nonhuman primates, many of which are endangered and often reduced to small populations. The virus engages the host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), through the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the spike protein. The contact surface of ACE2 displays amino acid residues that are critical for virus recognition, and variations at these critical residues are likely to modulate infection susceptibility across species. While infection studies are emerging and have shown that some primates, such as rhesus macaques and vervet monkeys, develop COVID-19-like symptoms when exposed to the virus, the susceptibility of many other nonhuman primates is unknown. Here, we show that all apes, including chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans, and all African and Asian monkeys (catarrhines), exhibit the same set of twelve key amino acid residues as human ACE2. Monkeys in the Americas, and some tarsiers, lemurs and lorisoids, differ at significant contact residues, and protein modeling predicts that these differences should greatly reduce the binding affinity of the ACE2 for the virus, hence moderating their susceptibility for infection. Other lemurs are predicted to be closer to catarrhines in their susceptibility. Our study suggests that apes and African and Asian monkeys, as well as some lemurs are all likely to be highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, representing a critical threat to their survival. Urgent actions have been undertaken to limit the exposure of Great Apes to humans, and similar efforts may be necessary for many other primate species.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mareike C Janiak","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Frank Marrone","author_inst":"New York University"},{"author_name":"Paramjit S Arora","author_inst":"New York University"},{"author_name":"James Paul Higham","author_inst":"New York University"},{"author_name":"Wei He","author_inst":"Beijing Tongren Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fei Wu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Fang Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Tongren Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhong-Lin Chai","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"De-Min Han","author_inst":"Beijing Tongren Hospital"},{"author_name":"Robert Kacmarek","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesia,Critical Care and Pain Medicine, Massachussets General Hospital, Boston, Massachussets, USA."},{"author_name":"Ryan Carroll","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Massachussets General Hospital, Boston, Massachussets, USA"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Berra","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesia,Critical Care and Pain Medicine, Massachussets General Hospital, Boston, Massachussets, USA."},{"author_name":"Jianfang Tang","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qin Tian","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wei Yao","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Li Hu","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xiaofeng Yan","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Xinyuan Zhou","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pinghuang Liu","author_inst":"China Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Yuzhang Wu","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Kai Deng","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yaokai Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Zhaohui Qian","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Cl\u00e1udio Tadeu Daniel-Ribeiro","author_inst":"Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil"},{"author_name":"Wuelton Marcelo Monteiro","author_inst":"Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Doutor Heitor Vieira Dourado"},{"author_name":"Marcus Vin\u00edcus Guimar\u00e3es Lacerda","author_inst":"Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Doutor Heitor Vieira Dourado"},{"author_name":"CloroCovid-19 Team","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"genetics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.08.20058495","rel_title":"Fast SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-qPCR in preheated nasopharyngeal swab samples","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.08.20058495","rel_abs":"The current reference for COVID-19 diagnosis is based on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 on RNA extracts using one-step retrotranscription and quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR).

Both vaccines and targeted therapeutics for treatment of this disease are currently lacking. Viral entry requires binding of the viral spike receptor binding domain (RBD) with the human angiotensin converting enzyme (hACE2). In an earlier paper1, we report on the specific residue interactions underpinning this event. Here we report on the de novo computational design of high affinity antibody variable regions through the recombination of VDJ genes targeting the most solvent-exposed hACE2-binding residues of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using the software tool OptMAVEn-2.02. Subsequently, we carry out computational affinity maturation of the designed prototype variable regions through point mutations for improved binding with the target epitope. Immunogenicity was restricted by preferring designs that match sequences from a 9-mer library of \"human antibodies\" based on H-score (human string content, HSC)3. We generated 106 different designs and report in detail on the top five that trade-off the greatest affinity for the spike RBD epitope (quantified using the Rosetta binding energies) with low H-scores. By grafting the designed Heavy (VH) and Light (VL) chain variable regions onto a human framework (Fc), high-affinity and potentially neutralizing full-length monoclonal antibodies (mAb) can be constructed. Having a potent antibody that can recognize the viral spike protein with high affinity would be enabling for both the design of sensitive SARS-CoV-2 detection devices and for their deployment as therapeutic antibodies.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Veda Sheersh Boorla","author_inst":"The Pennsylvania State University"},{"author_name":"Ratul Chowdhury","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Costas D Maranas","author_inst":"The Pennsylvania State University"},{"author_name":"Jiao Fan","author_inst":"Wuhan University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hsing-Ying Ho","author_inst":"Guo-Yuan Clinic, Taichung, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Wei-Shio Hor","author_inst":"TOPO Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, Taichung, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Chih-Hui Yang","author_inst":"I-Shou University"},{"author_name":"Chengdao Li","author_inst":"Murdoch University; Department of Primary Industry and Regional Development, Government of Western Australia, South Perth, WA, 6155, Australia"},{"author_name":"Wei-Lung Wang","author_inst":"National Changhua University of Education"},{"author_name":"Robert Kacmarek","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesia,Critical Care and Pain Medicine, Massachussets General Hospital, Boston, Massachussets, USA."},{"author_name":"Ryan Carroll","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Massachussets General Hospital, Boston, Massachussets, USA"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Berra","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesia,Critical Care and Pain Medicine, Massachussets General Hospital, Boston, Massachussets, USA."},{"author_name":"Jianfang Tang","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qin Tian","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wei Yao","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Li Hu","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xiaofeng Yan","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Xinyuan Zhou","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pinghuang Liu","author_inst":"China Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Yuzhang Wu","author_inst":"Third Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Kai Deng","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yaokai Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Zhaohui Qian","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Cl\u00e1udio Tadeu Daniel-Ribeiro","author_inst":"Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil"},{"author_name":"Wuelton Marcelo Monteiro","author_inst":"Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Doutor Heitor Vieira Dourado"},{"author_name":"Marcus Vin\u00edcus Guimar\u00e3es Lacerda","author_inst":"Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Doutor Heitor Vieira Dourado"},{"author_name":"CloroCovid-19 Team","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.09.20058909","rel_title":"Classification of COVID-19 in intensive care patients: towards rational and effective clinical triage","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.09.20058909","rel_abs":"The number of pertinent researches of COVID-19 has increased rapidly but they mainly focused on the description of general information of patients with confirmed infection.
