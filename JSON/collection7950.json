Twelve full viral genomes were determined in this study by Illumina sequencing either from virus isolates or directly from specimens, among which 5 originated from clustered infections. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that these sequences were in different clades, indicating that no major strain has been circulating in Taiwan.

Here, we calculated the secondary structure content of >2000 coronaviruses and computed >100000 human protein interactions with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The genomic regions display different degrees of conservation. SARS-CoV-2 domain encompassing nucleotides 22500 - 23000 is conserved both at the sequence and structural level. The regions upstream and downstream, however, vary significantly. This part codes for the Spike S protein that interacts with the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Thus, variability of Spike S may be connected to different levels of viral entry in human cells within the population.\n\nOur predictions indicate that the 5 end of SARS-CoV-2 is highly structured and interacts with several human proteins. The binding proteins are involved in viral RNA processing such as double-stranded RNA specific editases and ATP-dependent RNA-helicases and have strong propensity to form stress granules and phase-separated complexes. We propose that these proteins, also implicated in viral infections such as HIV, are selectively recruited by SARS-CoV-2 genome to alter transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of host cells and to promote viral replication.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrea Vandelli","author_inst":"Autonomous University of Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Michele Monti","author_inst":"Italian Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Edoardo Milanetti","author_inst":"University \"Sapienza\" of Rome"},{"author_name":"Alex Armaos","author_inst":"Italian Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Jakob Rupert","author_inst":"Sapienza University Rome"},{"author_name":"Elsa Zacco","author_inst":"Italian Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Elias Bechara","author_inst":"Italian Institute of Techonology"},{"author_name":"Riccardo Delli Ponti","author_inst":"University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Gian Gaetano Tartaglia","author_inst":"University of Rome Sapienza and Italian Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Rei-Lin Kuo","author_inst":"Chang Gung University"},{"author_name":"Ming-Tsan Liu","author_inst":"Taiwan Centers for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Ji-Rong Yang","author_inst":"Taiwan Centers for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Cheng-Hsun Chiu","author_inst":"Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cheng-Ta Yang","author_inst":"Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shin-Ru Shih","author_inst":"Chang Gung University"},{"author_name":"Guang-Wu Chen","author_inst":"Chang Gung University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.30.015685","rel_title":"Re-insights into origin and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-03-31","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.30.015685","rel_abs":"In depth evolutionary and structural analyses of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) isolated from bats, pangolins, and humans are necessary to assess the role of natural selection and recombination in the emergence of the current pandemic strain. The SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein unique features have been associated with efficient viral spread in the human population. Phylogeny-based and genetic algorithm methods clearly show that recombination events between viral progenitors infecting animal hosts led to a mosaic structure in the S gene. We identified recombination coldspots in the S glycoprotein and strong purifying selection. Moreover, although there is little evidence of diversifying positive selection during host-switching, structural analysis suggests that some of the residues emerged along the ancestral lineage of current pandemic strains may contribute to enhanced ability to infect human cells. Interestingly, recombination did not affect the long-range covariant movements of SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein monomer in pre-fusion conformation but, on the contrary, could contribute to the observed overall viral efficiency. Our dynamic simulations revealed that the movements between the host cell receptor binding domain (RBD) and the novel furin-like cleavage site are correlated. We identified threonine 333 (under purifying selection), at the beginning of the RBD, as the hinge of the opening\/closing mechanism of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein monomer functional to hACE2 binding. Our findings support a scenario where ancestral recombination and fixation of amino acid residues in the RBD of the S glycoprotein generated a virus with unique features, capable of extremely efficient infection of the human host.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Massimiliano S Tagliamonte","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Nabil Adid","author_inst":"High Institute of Biotechnology Sidi Thabet"},{"author_name":"David A Ostrov","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Chillemi","author_inst":"Department for Innovation in Biological, Agro-food and Forest systems"},{"author_name":"Sergei  L Kosakovsky Pond","author_inst":"Temple University"},{"author_name":"Marco Salemi","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Carla N Mavian","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Riccardo Delli Ponti","author_inst":"University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Gian Gaetano Tartaglia","author_inst":"University of Rome Sapienza and Italian Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Rei-Lin Kuo","author_inst":"Chang Gung University"},{"author_name":"Ming-Tsan Liu","author_inst":"Taiwan Centers for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Ji-Rong Yang","author_inst":"Taiwan Centers for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Cheng-Hsun Chiu","author_inst":"Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cheng-Ta Yang","author_inst":"Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shin-Ru Shih","author_inst":"Chang Gung University"},{"author_name":"Guang-Wu Chen","author_inst":"Chang Gung University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"evolutionary biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.30.015644","rel_title":"Atlas of ACE2 gene expression in mammals reveals novel insights in transmission of SARS-Cov-2","rel_date":"2020-03-31","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.30.015644","rel_abs":"BackgroundCOVID-19 has become a worldwide pandemic. It is caused by a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 with elusive origin. SARS-CoV-2 infects mammalian cells by binding to ACE2, a transmembrane protein. Therefore, the conservation of ACE2 and its expression pattern across mammalian species, which are yet to be comprehensively investigated, may provide valuable insights into tracing potential hosts of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nMethodsWe analyzed gene conservation of ACE2 across mammals and collected more than 140 transcriptome datasets from human and common mammalian species, including presumed hosts of SARS-CoV-2 and other animals in close contact with humans. In order to enable comparisons across species and tissues, we used a unified pipeline to quantify and normalize ACE2 expression levels.\n\nResultsWe first found high conservation of ACE2 genes among common mammals at both DNA and peptide levels, suggesting that a broad range of mammalian species can potentially be the hosts of SARS-CoV-2. Next, we showed that high level of ACE2 expression in certain human tissues is consistent with clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, we observed that ACE2 expressed in a species-specific manner in the mammals examined. Notably, high expression in skin and eyes in cat and dog suggested that these animals may play roles in transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to humans.\n\nConclusionsThrough building the first atlas of ACE2 expression in pets and livestock, we identified species and tissues susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, yielding novel insights into the viral transmission.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kun Sun","author_inst":"Shenzhen Bay Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Liuqi Gu","author_inst":"Beijing Huayuan Academy of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Li Ma","author_inst":"Shenzhen Bay Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Yunfeng Duan","author_inst":"Beijing Huayuan Academy of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Sergei  L Kosakovsky Pond","author_inst":"Temple University"},{"author_name":"Marco Salemi","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Carla N Mavian","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Riccardo Delli Ponti","author_inst":"University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Gian Gaetano Tartaglia","author_inst":"University of Rome Sapienza and Italian Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Rei-Lin Kuo","author_inst":"Chang Gung University"},{"author_name":"Ming-Tsan Liu","author_inst":"Taiwan Centers for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Ji-Rong Yang","author_inst":"Taiwan Centers for Disease Control"},{"author_name":"Cheng-Hsun Chiu","author_inst":"Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cheng-Ta Yang","author_inst":"Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shin-Ru Shih","author_inst":"Chang Gung University"},{"author_name":"Guang-Wu Chen","author_inst":"Chang Gung University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.29.013490","rel_title":"Lectin-like Intestinal Defensin Inhibits 2019-nCoV Spike binding to ACE2","rel_date":"2020-03-31","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.29.013490","rel_abs":"The burgeoning epidemic caused by novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) is currently a global concern.

Herein, we investigated the interactions between ACE2 and human defensins (HDs) specifically secreted by intestinal Paneth cells. The lectin-like HD5, rather than HD6, bound ACE2 with a high affinity of 39.3 nM and weakened the subsequent recruitment of 2019-nCoV S1. The cloak of HD5 on the ligand-binding domain of ACE2 was confirmed by molecular dynamic simulation. A remarkable dose-dependent preventive effect of HD5 on 2019-nCoV S1 binding to intestinal epithelial cells was further evidenced by in vitro experiments.

Given the known interaction between the human ACE2 (\"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2\") protein and the SARS-CoV virus (responsible for the coronavirus outbreak circa. 2003), considerable focus has been directed towards the putative interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and ACE2. However, a more holistic understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 vs. human inter-species interactome promises additional putative protein-protein interactions (PPI) that may be considered targets for the development of inhibitory therapeutics.\n\nTo that end, we leverage two state-of-the-art, sequence-based PPI predictors (PIPE4 & SPRINT) capable of generating the comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 vs. human interactome, comprising approximately 285,000 pairwise predictions. Of these, we identify the high-scoring subset of human proteins predicted to interact with each of the 14 SARS-CoV-2 proteins by both methods, comprising 279 high-confidence putative interactions involving 225 human proteins. Notably, the Spike-ACE2 interaction was the highest ranked for both the PIPE4 and SPRINT predictors, corroborating existing evidence for this PPI.

The candidate vaccine showed an average of [&ge;] 90.0% world population coverage for different ethnic groups. Molecular docking of the chimeric vaccine peptide with the immune receptors (TLR3 and TLR4) predicted efficient binding. Immune simulation predicted significant primary immune response with increased IgM and secondary immune response with high levels of both IgG1 and IgG2. It also increased the proliferation of T-helper cells and cytotoxic T-cells along with the increased INF-{gamma} and IL-2 cytokines. The codon optimization and mRNA secondary structure prediction revealed the chimera is suitable for high-level expression and cloning.

We computationally contrasted the binding interactions between human ACE2 and coronavirus spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) of the 2002 epidemic-causing SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and bat coronavirus RaTG13 using the Rosetta energy function. We find that the RBD of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is highly optimized to achieve very strong binding with human ACE2 (hACE2) which is consistent with its enhanced infectivity. SARS-CoV-2 forms the most stable complex with hACE2 compared to SARS-CoV-1 (23% less stable) or RaTG13 (11% less stable) while occupying the greatest number of residues in the ATR1 binding site. Notably, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD out-competes the angiotensin 2 receptor type I (ATR1) which is the native binding partner of ACE2 by 35% in terms of the calculated binding affinity. Strong binding is mediated through strong electrostatic attachments with every fourth residue on the N-terminus alpha-helix (starting from Ser19 to Asn53) as the turn of the helix makes these residues solvent accessible. By contrasting the spike protein SARS-CoV-2 Rosetta binding energy with ACE2 of different livestock and pet species we find strongest binding with bat ACE2 followed by human, feline, equine, canine and finally chicken. This is consistent with the hypothesis that bats are the viral origin and reservoir species. These results offer a computational explanation for the increased infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and allude to therapeutic modalities by identifying and rank-ordering the ACE2 residues involved in binding with the virus.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ratul Chowdhury","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Costas D Maranas","author_inst":"The Pennsylvania State University"},{"author_name":"M.

Methods A total of 262 COVID-19 patients were discharged from January 23 to February 25, 2020, and were enrolled for analysis of their clinical parameters. The RP and non-RP (NRP) patients were grouped according to the disease severity during their hospitalization period. The clinical characterization at re-admission to the hospital was analyzed. SARS-CoV-2 RNA and plasma antibody levels were detected using high-sensitive detection methods. Findings Up to March 10, 2020, all of patients were followed up for at least 14 days, and 38\/262 of RP patients (14.5%) were present. The RP patients were characterized by being less than 14-years old and having mild and moderate conditions as compared to NRP patients, while no severe patients became RP. Retrospectively, the RP patients displayed fewer symptoms, more sustained remission of CT imaging and earlier RNA negative-conversion but similar plasma antibody levels during their hospitalization period as compared to those NRP patients. When re-admitted to the hospital, these RP patients showed no obvious clinical symptoms or disease progression indicated by normal or improving CT imaging and inflammatory cytokine levels. All 21 close contacts of RP patients were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and no suspicious clinical symptoms were reported. However, 18\/24 of RNA-negative samples detected by the commercial kit were tested to be positive for virus RNA using a hyper-sensitive method, suggesting the carrier status of virus possibly existed in patients recovered from COVID-19. Interpretation Our results showed that young and mild COVID-19 patients seem to be RP patients after discharge, who show no obviously clinical symptoms and disease progression upon re-admission. More sensitive RNA detection methods are required to monitor these patients during follow-up. Our findings provide empirical information and evidence for the effective management of COVID-19 patients during their convalescent phase.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jianghong An","author_inst":"Department of Oncology and Hematology, Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital, Shenzhen 518112, Guangdong Province, China"},{"author_name":"Xuejiao Liao","author_inst":"Institute of Hepatology, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Disease, Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital, Shenzhen 518112, Guangdong Province, China"},{"author_name":"Tongyang Xiao","author_inst":"Institute of Hepatology, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Disease, Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital, Shenzhen 518112, Guangdong Province, China"},{"author_name":"Shen Qian","author_inst":"Institute of Hepatology, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Disease, Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital, Shenzhen 518112, Guangdong Province, China"},{"author_name":"Jing Yuan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital, Shenzhen 518112, Guangdong Province, China"},{"author_name":"Haocheng Ye","author_inst":"Institute of Hepatology, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Disease, Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital, Shenzhen 518112, Guangdong Province, China"},{"author_name":"Furong Qi","author_inst":"Institute of Hepatology, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Disease, Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital, Shenzhen 518112, Guangdong Province, China"},{"author_name":"Chengguang Shen","author_inst":"Institute of Hepatology, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Disease, Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital, Shenzhen 518112, Guangdong Province, China"},{"author_name":"Yang Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Hepatology, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Disease, Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital, Shenzhen 518112, Guangdong Province, China"},{"author_name":"Lifei Wang","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital, Shenzhen 518112, Guangdong Province, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoya Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Oncology and Hematology, Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital, Shenzhen 518112, Guangdong Province, China"},{"author_name":"Na Li","author_inst":"Institute of Hepatology, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Disease, Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital, Shenzhen 518112, Guangdong Province, China"},{"author_name":"Qingxian Cai","author_inst":"Department of Hepatology, Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital, Shenzhen 518112, Guangdong Province, China"},{"author_name":"Fang Wang","author_inst":"Department of Hepatology, Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital, Shenzhen 518112, Guangdong Province, China"},{"author_name":"Jun Chen","author_inst":"Department of Hepatology, Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital, Shenzhen 518112, Guangdong Province, China"},{"author_name":"Yingxia Liu","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital, Shenzhen 518112, Guangdong Province, China"},{"author_name":"Yunfang Wang","author_inst":"Translational Research Center, Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital, Tsinghua University, Beijing 102218, Beijing , China"},{"author_name":"Feng Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Biological Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA"},{"author_name":"Yang Fu","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong, 518055, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaohua Tan","author_inst":"Department of Oncology and Hematology, Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital, Shenzhen 518112, Guangdong Province, China"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine,Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen 518112, Guangdong Province, China.Institute of Hepato"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Hepatology, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Disease, Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital, Shenzhen 518112, Guangdong Province, China.T"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.25.20043166","rel_title":"Risk assessment of progression to severe conditions for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia: a single-center retrospective study","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.25.20043166","rel_abs":"Background: Management of high mortality risk due to significant progression requires prior assessment of time-to-progression.

We compared characteristics between patients with severe and non-severe outcome, and used multivariate survival analyses to assess the risk of progression to severe conditions. Results: A total of 76 (31.9%) patients progressed to severe conditions and 3 (0.9%) died. The mean time from hospital admission to severity onset is 3.7 days. Age, body mass index (BMI), fever symptom on admission, co-existing hypertension or diabetes are associated with severe progression. Compared to non-severe group, the severe group already demonstrated, at an early stage, abnormalities in biomarkers indicating organ function, inflammatory responses, blood oxygen and coagulation function. The cohort is characterized with increasing cumulative incidences of severe progression up to 10 days after admission. Competing risks survival model incorporating CT imaging and baseline information showed an improved performance for predicting severity onset (mean time-dependent AUC = 0.880). Conclusions: Multiple predisposition factors can be utilized to assess the risk of progression to severe conditions at an early stage. Multivariate survival models can reasonably analyze the progression risk based on early-stage CT images that would otherwise be misjudged by artificial analysis.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lijiao Zeng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jialu Li","author_inst":"HuaJia Biomedical Intelligence"},{"author_name":"Mingfeng Liao","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rui Hua","author_inst":"HuaJia Biomedical Intelligence"},{"author_name":"Pilai Huang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mingxia Zhang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Youlong Zhang","author_inst":"HuaJia Biomedical Intelligence"},{"author_name":"Qinlang Shi","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhaohua Xia","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xinzhong Ning","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dandan Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jiu Mo","author_inst":"HuaJia Biomedical Intelligence"},{"author_name":"Ziyuan Zhou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zigang Li","author_inst":"Shenzhen Bay Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Yu Fu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuhui Liao","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jing Yuan","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lifei Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qing He","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kun Qiao","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Hepatology, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Disease, Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital, Shenzhen 518112, Guangdong Province, China.T"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.27.20043299","rel_title":"Failed detection of the full-length genome of SARS-CoV-2 by ultra-deep sequencing from the recovered and discharged patients retested viral PCR positive","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.27.20043299","rel_abs":"Over 10 percent of recovered and discharged patients retested positive for SARS-CoV-2, raising a public health concern whether they could be potential origins of infection.

The objective of this study determines if it is feasible to use machine learning method to evaluate how much prediction results are close to original data related to Confirmed-Negative-Released-Death cases of Covid-19. For this purpose, a verification method is proposed in this paper that uses the concept of Deep-learning Neural Network. In this framework, Long short-term memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) are also assimilated finally for training the dataset and the prediction results are tally with the results predicted by clinical doctors. The prediction results are validated against the original data based on some predefined metric. The experimental results showcase that the proposed approach is useful in generating suitable results based on the critical disease outbreak. It also helps doctors to recheck further verification of virus by the proposed method. The outbreak of Coronavirus has the nature of exponential growth and so it is difficult to control with limited clinical persons for handling a huge number of patients with in a reasonable time. So it is necessary to build an automated model, based on machine learning approach, for corrective measure after the decision of clinical doctors. It could be a promising supplementary confirmation method for frontline clinical doctors. The proposed method has a high prediction rate and works fast for probable accurate identification of the disease. The performance analysis shows that a high rate of accuracy is obtained by the proposed method.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samir Kumar Bandyopadhyay Sr.","author_inst":"The Bhawanipur Education Society College, Kolkata, India"},{"author_name":"Shawni Dutta Jr.","author_inst":"The Bhawanipur Education Society College, Kolkata, India"},{"author_name":"Yaping Wang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Teng Xu","author_inst":"Vision Medicals"},{"author_name":"Xiaoping Tang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Feng Li","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Youlong Zhang","author_inst":"HuaJia Biomedical Intelligence"},{"author_name":"Qinlang Shi","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhaohua Xia","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xinzhong Ning","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dandan Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jiu Mo","author_inst":"HuaJia Biomedical Intelligence"},{"author_name":"Ziyuan Zhou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zigang Li","author_inst":"Shenzhen Bay Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Yu Fu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuhui Liao","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jing Yuan","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lifei Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qing He","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kun Qiao","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Hepatology, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Disease, Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital, Shenzhen 518112, Guangdong Province, China.T"}],"version":"1","license":"cc0_ng","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.27.20043968","rel_title":"Evaluation of Group Testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.27.20043968","rel_abs":"During the current COVID-19 pandemic, testing kit and RNA extraction kit availability has become a major limiting factor in the ability to determine patient disease status and accurately quantify prevalence. Current testing strategies rely on individual tests of cases matching restrictive diagnostic criteria to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA, limiting testing of asymptomatic and mild cases. Testing these individuals is one effective way to understand and reduce the spread of COVID-19. Here, we develop a pooled testing strategy to identify these low-risk individuals. Drawing on the well-studied group testing literature, modeling suggests practical changes to testing protocols which can reduce test costs and stretch a limited test kit supply. When most tests are negative, pooling reduces the total number of tests up to four-fold at 2% prevalence and eight-fold at 0.5% prevalence. At current SARS-CoV-2 prevalence, randomized group testing optimized per country could double the number of tested individuals from 1.8M to 3.6M using only 672k more tests. This strategy is well-suited to supplement testing for asymptomatic and mild cases who would otherwise go untested, and enable them to adopt behavioral changes to slow the spread of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nasa Sinnott-Armstrong","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Daniel Klein","author_inst":"Oracle Corporation"},{"author_name":"Brendan Hickey","author_inst":"."},{"author_name":"Teng Xu","author_inst":"Vision Medicals"},{"author_name":"Xiaoping Tang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Feng Li","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Youlong Zhang","author_inst":"HuaJia Biomedical Intelligence"},{"author_name":"Qinlang Shi","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhaohua Xia","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xinzhong Ning","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dandan Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jiu Mo","author_inst":"HuaJia Biomedical Intelligence"},{"author_name":"Ziyuan Zhou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zigang Li","author_inst":"Shenzhen Bay Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Yu Fu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuhui Liao","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jing Yuan","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lifei Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qing He","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kun Qiao","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Hepatology, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Disease, Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital, Shenzhen 518112, Guangdong Province, China.T"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.27.20043836","rel_title":"A considerable proportion of individuals with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in Tibetan population","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.27.20043836","rel_abs":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) quickly became a major epidemic threat in the whole China.

Design, Setting, and Participants A cross-sectional study of COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized at Tongji and Mobile Cabin Hospitals from Jan 28, 2020 to March 8, 2020. Sex differences in severity and composite endpoints (admission to intensive care unit (ICU), use of mechanical ventilation, or death) of COVID-19 patients were compared. The correlation analysis and cox\/logistic regression modeling of menstruation status\/sex hormones and prognosis were conducted. Correlation between cytokines related to immunity and inflammation and disease severity or estradiol (E2) was revealed.Results Chi square test indicated significant differences in distribution of composite endpoints (p<0.01) and disease severity (p=0.05) between male and female patients (n=1902). 435 female COVID-19 patients with menstruation records were recruited. By the end of Mar 8, 111 patients recovered and discharged (25.3%). Multivariate Cox regression model adjusted for age and severity indicated that post-menopausal patients show the greater risk of hospitalization time than non-menopausal patients (relative hazard [RH], 1.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-3.46)Logistic regression model showed that higher AMH as a control for age increases the risk of severity of COVID-19 (HR=0.146, 95%CI= (0.026-0.824) p=0.029). E2 showed protective effect against disease severity (HR=0.335, 95%CI= (0.105-1.070), p=0.046).In the Mann-Whitney U test, the higher levels of IL6 and IL8 were found in severe group (p=0.040, 0.033).The higher levels of IL2R, IL6, IL8 and IL10 were also observed in patients with composite end points(p<0.001,<0.001, =0.009, = 0.040).E2 levels were negatively correlated with IL2R, IL6, IL8 and TNF in luteal phase (Pearson Correlation=-0.592, -0.558, -0.545, -0.623; p=0.033, 0.048, 0.054, 0.023) and with C3 in follicular phase (Pearson Correlation=-0.651; p=0.030). Conclusions and Relevance Menopause is an independent risk factor for COVID-19. E2 and AMH are negatively correlated with COVID-19 severity probably due to their regulation of cytokines related to immunity and inflammation.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ting Ding","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology; National Clinical Research Cent"},{"author_name":"Jinjin Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology; National Clinical Research Cent"},{"author_name":"Tian Wang","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology; National Clinical Research Cent"},{"author_name":"Pengfei Cui","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology; National Clinical Research Cent"},{"author_name":"Zhe Chen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology; National Clinical Research Cent"},{"author_name":"Jingjing Jiang","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology; National Clinical Research Cent"},{"author_name":"Su Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology; National Clinical Research Cent"},{"author_name":"Jun Dai","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology; National Clinical Research Cent"},{"author_name":"Bo Wang","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology; National Clinical Research Cent"},{"author_name":"Suzhen Yuan","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology; National Clinical Research Cent"},{"author_name":"Wenqing Ma","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology; National Clinical Research Cent"},{"author_name":"Lingwei Ma","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology; National Clinical Research Cent"},{"author_name":"Yueguang Rong","author_inst":"Department of Pathogen Biology, School of Basic Medicine, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China"},{"author_name":"Jiang Chang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Key Laboratory for Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of"},{"author_name":"Xiaoping Miao","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Key Laboratory for Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of"},{"author_name":"Xiangyi Ma","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology; National Clinical Research Cent"},{"author_name":"Shixuan Wang","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology; National Clinical Research Cent"},{"author_name":"Lifei Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qing He","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kun Qiao","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Hepatology, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Disease, Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital, Shenzhen 518112, Guangdong Province, China.T"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.27.20043661","rel_title":"Clinical characteristics associated with COVID-19 severity in California","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.27.20043661","rel_abs":"Given the rapidly progressing COVID-19 pandemic, this report on a US cohort of 54 COVID-19 patients from Stanford Hospital and data regarding risk factors for severe disease obtained at initial clinical presentation is of high importance and is immediately clinically relevant.

The model takes into account the known or reported number of infected cases being fewer than the actual number of infected individuals due to insufficient testing. The model integrates intercity travel data to track the movement of exposed and infected individuals among cities, and allows different levels of active intervention to be considered so that realistic prediction of the number of infected individuals can be performed. The data of the COVID-19 infection cases and the intercity travel data for Japan (January 15 to March 20, 2020) and the USA (February 20 to March 20, 2020) are used to illustrate the prediction of the pandemic progression in 47 regions of Japan and 50 states (plus a federal district) in the USA. By fitting the model with the data, we reveal that, as of March 19, 2020, the number of infected individuals in Japan and the USA could be twenty-fold and five-fold as many as the number of confirmed cases, respectively. Moreover, the model generates future progression profiles for different levels of intervention by setting the parameters relative to the values found from the data fitting. Results show that without tightening the implementation of active intervention, Japan and the USA will see about 6.55% and 18.2% of the population eventually infected, and with drastic ten-fold elevated active intervention, the number of people eventually infected can be reduced by up to 95% in Japan and 70% in the USA. Finally, an assessment of the relative effectiveness of active intervention and personal protective measures is discussed. With a highly vigilant public maintaining personal hygiene and exercising strict protective measures, the percentage of population infected can be further reduced to 0.23% in Japan and 2.7% in the USA.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Choujun Zhan","author_inst":"South China Normal University"},{"author_name":"Chi K.

Virus genomes were sampled from 29 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection from Feb 3rd through Mar 15th. Phylogenetic analyses revealed at least 8 different SARS-CoV-2 lineages, suggesting multiple independent introductions of the virus into the state. Virus genomes from passengers on two consecutive excursions of the Grand Princess cruise ship clustered with those from an established epidemic in Washington State, including the WA1 genome representing the first reported case in the United States on January 19th. We also detected evidence for presumptive transmission of SARS-CoV-2 lineages from one community to another. These findings suggest that cryptic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Northern California to date is characterized by multiple transmission chains that originate via distinct introductions from international and interstate travel, rather than widespread community transmission of a single predominant lineage. Rapid testing and contact tracing, social distancing, and travel restrictions are measures that will help to slow SARS-CoV-2 spread in California and other regions of the USA.","rel_num_authors":47,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xianding Deng","author_inst":"University of Californa, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Wei Gu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Scot Federman","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Louis Du Plessis","author_inst":"Oxford University"},{"author_name":"Oliver Pybus","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nuno Faria","author_inst":"Oxford University"},{"author_name":"Candace Wang","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Guixia Yu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Chao-Yang Pan","author_inst":"California Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Hugo Guevara","author_inst":"California Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Alicia Sotomayor-Gonzalez","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Kelsey Zorn","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Allan Gopez","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Venice Servellita","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Elaine Hsu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Steve Miller","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Trevor Bedford","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Alexander Greninger","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Pavitra Roychoudhury","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Michael Famulare","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Helen Y Chu","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jay Shendure","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Lea Starita","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Catie Anderson","author_inst":"Scripps Institute"},{"author_name":"Karthik Gangavarapu","author_inst":"Scripps Institute"},{"author_name":"Mark Zeller","author_inst":"Scripps Institute"},{"author_name":"Emily Spencer","author_inst":"Scripps Institute"},{"author_name":"Kristian Andersen","author_inst":"Scripps Institute"},{"author_name":"Duncan MacCannell","author_inst":"United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Suxiang Tong","author_inst":"United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Gregory Armstrong","author_inst":"United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Clinton Paden","author_inst":"United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yan Li","author_inst":"United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Ying Zhang","author_inst":"United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Scott Morrow","author_inst":"San Mateo County Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Matthew Willis","author_inst":"Marin County Division of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Bela Matyas","author_inst":"Solano County Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Sundari Mase","author_inst":"Sonoma County Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Olivia Kasirye","author_inst":"Sacramento County Division of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Maggie Park","author_inst":"San Joaquin County Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Curtis Chan","author_inst":"San Francisco Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Alexander Yu","author_inst":"California Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Shua Chai","author_inst":"California Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Elsa Villarino","author_inst":"Santa Clara County Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Brandon Bonin","author_inst":"Santa Clara County Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Debra Wadford","author_inst":"California Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Charles Y Chiu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.27.20043752","rel_title":"Forecasting COVID-19 impact on hospital bed-days, ICU-days, ventilator-days and deaths by US state in the next 4 months","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.27.20043752","rel_abs":"Key Points Question: Assuming social distancing measures are maintained, what are the forecasted gaps in available health service resources and number of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic for each state in the United States? Findings: Using a statistical model, we predict excess demand will be 64,175 (95% UI 7,977 to 251,059) total beds and 17,380 (95% UI 2,432 to 57,955) ICU beds at the peak of COVID-19. Peak ventilator use is predicted to be 19,481 (95% UI 9,767 to 39,674) ventilators. Peak demand will be in the second week of April. We estimate 81,114 (95% UI 38,242 to 162,106) deaths in the United States from COVID-19 over the next 4 months. Meaning: Even with social distancing measures enacted and sustained, the peak demand for hospital services due to the COVID-19 pandemic is likely going to exceed capacity substantially. Alongside the implementation and enforcement of social distancing measures, there is an urgent need to develop and implement plans to reduce non-COVID-19 demand for and temporarily increase capacity of health facilities. Abstract Importance: This study presents the first set of estimates of predicted health service utilization and deaths due to COVID-19 by day for the next 4 months for each state in the US. Objective: To determine the extent and timing of deaths and excess demand for hospital services due to COVID-19 in the US. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study used data on confirmed COVID-19 deaths by day from WHO websites and local and national governments; data on hospital capacity and utilization for US states; and observed COVID-19 utilization data from select locations to develop a statistical model forecasting deaths and hospital utilization against capacity by state for the US over the next 4 months. Exposure(s): COVID-19. Main outcome(s) and measure(s): Deaths, bed and ICU occupancy, and ventilator use. Results: Compared to licensed capacity and average annual occupancy rates, excess demand from COVID-19 at the peak of the pandemic in the second week of April is predicted to be 64,175 (95% UI 7,977 to 251,059) total beds and 17,380 (95% UI 2,432 to 57,955) ICU beds. At the peak of the pandemic, ventilator use is predicted to be 19,481 (95% UI 9,767 to 39,674). The date of peak excess demand by state varies from the second week of April through May. We estimate that there will a total of 81,114 (95% UI 38,242 to 162,106) deaths from COVID-19 over the next 4 months in the US. Deaths from COVID-19 are estimated to drop below 10 deaths per day between May 31 and June 6. Conclusions and Relevance: In addition to a large number of deaths from COVID-19, the epidemic in the US will place a load well beyond the current capacity of hospitals to manage, especially for ICU care. These estimates can help inform the development and implementation of strategies to mitigate this gap, including reducing non-COVID-19 demand for services and temporarily increasing system capacity. These are urgently needed given that peak volumes are estimated to be only three weeks away. The estimated excess demand on hospital systems is predicated on the enactment of social distancing measures in all states that have not done so already within the next week and maintenance of these measures throughout the epidemic, emphasizing the importance of implementing, enforcing, and maintaining these measures to mitigate hospital system overload and prevent deaths.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"IHME COVID-19 health service utilization forecasting team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Christopher JL Murray","author_inst":"Institute

disease (COVID-19), general population may experience psychological distress. Evidence has suggested that negative coping styles may be related to subsequent mental illness. Therefore, we investigate the general population's psychological distress and coping styles in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods A cross-sectional battery of surveys was conducted from February 1-4, 2020. The Kessler 6 psychological distress scale, the simplified coping style questionnaire and a general information questionnaire were administered on-line to a convenience sample of 1599 in China. Spearman's correlation was used to measure the correlations among category variables. Results General population's psychological distress were significant differences based on age, marriage, epidemic contact characteristics, concern with media reports, and perceived impacts of the epidemic outbreak (all p <0.001) except gender (p=0.316). Those with a history of visiting Wuhan and a history of epidemics occurring in the community, more concern with media reports, perceived more severe impacts and negative coping style had a higher level of psychological distress, which was significantly positively correlated with a history of visiting Wuhan (r=0.548, p<0.001), a history of epidemics occurring in the community (r=0.219, p<0.001), and concern with media reports (r=0.192, p<0.001). Coping styles were significantly different across all category variables (all p <0.001), and negatively correlated with other category variables (all p<0.01) except age and marriage. Psychological distress was significantly negatively correlated with the coping style (r=-0.573, p<0.01). Conclusions In the early stages of COVID-19, general population with epidemic contact characteristics, excessive concern with media reports, and perceived more severe impacts have higher levels of psychological distress. Psychological distress was significantly negatively correlated with the coping style. Interventions should be implemented early, especially for those population with a high level of psychological distress and\/or with a negative coping style.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hui-yao Wang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Qian Xia","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Zhen-zhen Xiong","author_inst":"Chengdu Medical College"},{"author_name":"Zhi-xiong Li","author_inst":"Karamay Municipal People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wei-yi Xiang","author_inst":"The West China College of Medicine, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yi-wen Yuan","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Ya-ya Liu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"zhe li","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Chao-Yang Pan","author_inst":"California Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Hugo Guevara","author_inst":"California Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Alicia Sotomayor-Gonzalez","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Kelsey Zorn","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Allan Gopez","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Venice Servellita","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Elaine Hsu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Steve Miller","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Trevor Bedford","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Alexander Greninger","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Pavitra Roychoudhury","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Michael Famulare","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Helen Y Chu","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jay Shendure","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Lea Starita","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Catie Anderson","author_inst":"Scripps Institute"},{"author_name":"Karthik Gangavarapu","author_inst":"Scripps Institute"},{"author_name":"Mark Zeller","author_inst":"Scripps Institute"},{"author_name":"Emily Spencer","author_inst":"Scripps Institute"},{"author_name":"Kristian Andersen","author_inst":"Scripps Institute"},{"author_name":"Duncan MacCannell","author_inst":"United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Suxiang Tong","author_inst":"United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Gregory Armstrong","author_inst":"United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Clinton Paden","author_inst":"United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yan Li","author_inst":"United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Ying Zhang","author_inst":"United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Scott Morrow","author_inst":"San Mateo County Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Matthew Willis","author_inst":"Marin County Division of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Bela Matyas","author_inst":"Solano County Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Sundari Mase","author_inst":"Sonoma County Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Olivia Kasirye","author_inst":"Sacramento County Division of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Maggie Park","author_inst":"San Joaquin County Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Curtis Chan","author_inst":"San Francisco Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Alexander Yu","author_inst":"California Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Shua Chai","author_inst":"California Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Elsa Villarino","author_inst":"Santa Clara County Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Brandon Bonin","author_inst":"Santa Clara County Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Debra Wadford","author_inst":"California Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Charles Y Chiu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.27.20045757","rel_title":"Changing transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in China: a nationwide population-based piecewise mathematical modelling study","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.27.20045757","rel_abs":"Background: The first case of COVID-19 atypical pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, China on December 1, 2019. Since then, at least 33 other countries have been affected and there is a possibility of a global outbreak. A tremendous amount of effort has been made to understand its transmission dynamics; however, the temporal and spatial transmission heterogeneity and changing epidemiology have been mostly ignored. The epidemic mechanism of COVID-19 remains largely unclear. Methods: Epidemiological data on COVID-19 in China and daily population movement data from Wuhan to other cities were obtained and analyzed. To describe the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 at different spatio-temporal scales, we used a three-stage continuous-time Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) meta-population model based on the characteristics and transmission dynamics of each stage: 1) local epidemic from December 1, 2019 to January 9, 2020; 2) long-distance spread due to the Spring Festival travel rush from January 10 to 22, 2020; and 3) intra-provincial transmission from January 23, 2020 when travel restrictions were imposed. Together with the basic reproduction number (R_0) for mathematical modelling, we also considered the variation in infectivity and introduced the controlled reproduction number (R_c) by assuming that exposed individuals to be infectious; we then simulated the future spread of COVID across Wuhan and all the provinces in mainland China. In addition, we built a novel source tracing algorithm to infer the initial exposed number of individuals in Wuhan on January 10, 2020, to estimate the number of infections early during this epidemic. Findings: The spatial patterns of disease spread were heterogeneous. The estimated controlled reproduction number (R_c) in the neighboring provinces of Hubei province were relatively large, and the nationwide reproduction number (except for Hubei) ranged from 0.98 to 2.74 with an average of 1.79 (95% CI 1.77-1.80). Infectivity was significantly greater for exposed than infectious individuals, and exposed individuals were predicted to have become the major source of infection after January 23. For the epidemic process, most provinces reached their epidemic peak before February 10, 2020. It is expected that the maximum number of infections will be approached by the end of March. The final infectious size is estimated to be about 58,000 for Wuhan, 20,800 for the rest of Hubei province, and 17,000 for the other provinces in mainland China. Moreover, the estimated number of the exposed individuals is much greater than the officially reported number of infectious individuals in Wuhan on January 10, 2020. Interpretation: The transmission dynamics of COVID-19 have been changing over time and were heterogeneous across regions. There was a substantial underestimation of the number of exposed individuals in Wuhan early in the epidemic, and the Spring Festival travel rush played an important role in enhancing and accelerating the spread of COVID-19. However, China's unprecedented large-scale travel restrictions quickly reduced R_c. The next challenge for the control of COVID-19 will be the second great population movement brought by removing these travel restrictions.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jiawen Hou","author_inst":"Institute of Science and Technology for Brain-Inspired Intelligence, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China;

Many drugs showed potential for COVID-19 therapy. However, genetic factors which can lead to different drug efficiency and toxicity among populations are still undisclosed in COVID-19 therapy. Methods: We selected 67 potential drugs for COVID-19 therapy (DCTs) from clinical guideline and clinical trials databases. 313 pharmaco-genes related to these therapeutic drugs were included. Variation information in 125,748 exomes were collected for racial differences analyses. The expression level of pharmaco-genes in single cell resolution was evaluated from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of 17 healthy adults. Results: Pharmacogenes, including CYP3A4, ABCB1, SLCO1B1, ALB, CYP3A5, were involved in the process of more than multi DCTs. 224 potential drug-drug interactions (DDI) of DCTs were predicted, while 112 of them have been reported. Racial discrepancy of common nonsynonymous mutations was found in pharmacogenes including: VDR, ITPA, G6PD, CYP3A4 and ABCB1 which related to DCTs including ribavirin, -interferon, chloroquine and lopinavir. Moreover, ACE2, the target of 2019-nCoV, was only found in parts of lung cells, which makes drugs like chloroquine that prevent virus binding to ACE2 more specific than other targeted drugs such as camostat mesylate. Conclusions: At least 17 drugs for COVID-19 therapy with predictable pharmacogenes should be carefully utilized in risk races which are consisted of more risk allele carriers. At least 29 drugs with potential of DDIs are reported to be affected by other DDIs, they should be replaced by similar drugs without interaction if it is possible. Drugs which specifically targeted to infected cells with ACE2 such as chloroquine are preferred in COVID-19 therapy.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lei-Yun Wang","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Jia-Jia Cui","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Qian-Ying OuYang","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yan Zhan","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yi-Min Wang","author_inst":"Genetalks Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Xiang-Yang Xu","author_inst":"Genetalks Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Cheng-Xian Guo","author_inst":"Center of Clinical Pharmacology, the Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"JiYe Yin","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Jian Hu","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China;
