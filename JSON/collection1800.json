We analyzed contact tracing data of 1147 Covid-19 positive cases (mean age 34.91 years, 61.99% aged 11-40, 742 males), anonymized and made public by the government. We used software tools Cytoscape and Gephi to create SNA graphics and determine network attributes of nodes (cases) and edges (directed links, determined by contact tracing, from source to target patients). Outdegree was 1-47 for 199 (17.35%) nodes, and betweenness 0.5-87 for 89 (7.76%) nodes. Men had higher mean outdegree and women, higher betweenness. Delhi was the exogenous source of 17.44% cases. Bangalore city had the highest caseload in the state (229, 20%), but comparatively low cluster formation. Thirty-four (2.96%) super-spreaders (outdegree[&ge;]5) caused 60% of the transmissions. Real-time social network visualization can allow healthcare administrators to flag evolving hotspots and pinpoint key actors in transmission. Prioritizing these areas and individuals for rigorous containment could help minimize resource outlay and potentially achieve a significant reduction in COVID-19 transmission.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sakranaik Saraswathi","author_inst":"Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute, Bangalore, Karnataka, India."},{"author_name":"Amita Mukhopadhyay","author_inst":"Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute (former)"},{"author_name":"Hemant Shah","author_inst":"Independent researcher"},{"author_name":"T S Ranganath","author_inst":"Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute, Bangalore, Karnataka, India"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.12.20173831","rel_title":"Temporal Dynamics of Viral Load and False Negative Rate Influence the Levels of Testing Necessary to Combat COVID19 Spread","rel_date":"2020-08-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.12.20173831","rel_abs":"Colleges and other organizations are considering testing plans to return to operation as the COVID19 pandemic continues.

Here, we develop a stochastic agent-based model of COVID19 in a university sized population, considering the dynamics of both viral load and false negative rate of tests on the ability of testing to combat viral spread. Reported dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 can lead to an apparent false negative rate from ~17% to ~48%. Nonuniform distributions of viral load and false negative rate lead to higher requirements for frequency and fraction of population tested in order to bring the apparent Reproduction number (Rt) below 1. Thus, it is important to consider non-uniform dynamics of viral spread and false negative rate in order to model effective testing plans.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Katherine F Jarvis","author_inst":"University of Maine"},{"author_name":"Joshua B Kelley","author_inst":"University of Maine"},{"author_name":"Hemant Shah","author_inst":"Independent researcher"},{"author_name":"T S Ranganath","author_inst":"Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute, Bangalore, Karnataka, India"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.12.20173674","rel_title":"Double-zero-event studies matter: a re-evaluation of physical distancing, face masks, and eye protection for preventing person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 and its policy impact","rel_date":"2020-08-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.12.20173674","rel_abs":"Objectives: High-quality meta-analyses on COVID-19 are in urgent demand for evidence-based decision making. However, conventional approaches exclude double-zero-event studies (DZS) from meta-analyses. We assessed whether including such studies impacts the conclusions in a recent systematic urgent review on prevention measures for preventing person-to-person transmission of COVID-19. Study designs and settings: We extracted data for meta-analyses containing DZS from a recent review that assessed the effects of physical distancing, face masks, and eye protection for preventing person-to-person transmission. A bivariate generalized linear mixed model was used to re-do the meta-analyses with DZS included. We compared the synthesized relative risks (RRs) of the three prevention measures, their 95% confidence intervals (CI), and significance tests (at the level of 0.05) including and excluding DZS. Results: The re-analyzed COVID-19 data containing DZS involved a total of 1,784 participants who were not considered in the original review. Including DZS noticeably changed the synthesized RRs and 95% CIs of several interventions. For the meta-analysis of the effect of physical distancing, the RR of COVID-19 decreased from 0.15 (95% CI, 0.03 to 0.73) to 0.07 (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.98). For several meta-analyses, the statistical significance of the synthesized RR was changed. The RR of eye protection with a physical distance of 2 m and the RR of physical distancing when using N95 respirators were no longer statistically significant after including DZS. Conclusions: DZS may contain useful information. Sensitivity analyses that include DZS in meta-analysis are recommended.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mengli Xiao","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Lifeng Lin","author_inst":"Florida State University"},{"author_name":"James S.

On March 5, the government of Palestine declared a state of emergency in order to curb the spread of the virus, a declaration that it extended for a fifth time on July 5th. The degree to which a population complies with corresponding safety measures is surely affected by the people's knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) towards the disease. To explore this hypothesis, we gathered data from 1,731 Palestinians between April 19th and May 1st, 2020 through a KAP questionnaire. The participant pool represented a stratified sample of Palestinians living across a number of governorates in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, with 36.5% from Gaza and (63.5%) from the West Bank. Gender was almost equally distributed within the sample with (51%) male respondents and (49%) female respondent. The questionnaire included 17 questions about participants knowledge and awareness of COVID19, 17 questions regarding the safety measures they had taken in the wake of the outbreak and 3 questions asking them to assess the efficacy of the governments response to the pandemic. The overall correct mean of the knowledge was 79.26+-0.35. Most participants' expressed confidence that Covid19 would be successfully controlled and that Palestine could win the battle against Covid19, though 62% believed that stricter measurements must be applied. Based on the results of this study, we conclude that health education programs aimed at improving the public's understanding of COVID19 are important in helping the population maintain appropriate practices, and that findings such as those discussed in this report may provide valuable feedback to lawmakers working to stop the spread of the virus.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nouar Qutob","author_inst":"Arab American University"},{"author_name":"Faisal Awartani","author_inst":"Arab American Universiry"},{"author_name":"James S.

Thus, there is an urgent need for developing treatments for COVID-19. Drug repurposing, which is the process of reusing already-approved drugs for new medical conditions, can be a good way to solve this problem quickly and broadly. Many clinical trials for COVID-19 patients using treatments for other diseases have already been in place or will be performed at clinical sites in the near future. Additionally, patients with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, liver cirrhosis, kidney diseases, hypertension, and asthma are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Thus, the relationship of comorbidity disease with COVID-19 may help to find repurposable drugs. To reduce trial and error in finding treatments for COVID-19, we propose building a network-based drug repurposing framework to prioritize repurposable drugs. First, we utilized knowledge of COVID-19 to construct a disease-gene-drug network (DGDr-Net) representing a COVID-19-centric interactome with components for diseases, genes, and drugs. DGDr-Net consisted of 592 diseases, 26,681 human genes and 2,173 drugs, and medical information for 18 common comorbidities. The DGDr-Net recommended candidate repurposable drugs for COVID-19 through network reinforcement driven scoring algorithms. The scoring algorithms determined the priority of recommendations by utilizing graph-based semi-supervised learning. From the predicted scores, we recommended 30 drugs, including dexamethasone, resveratrol, methotrexate, indomethacin, quercetin, etc., as repurposable drugs for COVID-19, and the results were verified with drugs that have been under clinical trials. The list of drugs via a data-driven computational approach could help reduce trial-and-error in finding treatment for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yonghyun Nam","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Jae-Seung Yun","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Seung Mi Lee","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Ji Won Park","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Ziqi Chen","author_inst":"The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Brian Lee","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Anurag Verma","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Xia Ning","author_inst":"The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Li Shen","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Dokyoon Kim","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pharmacology and therapeutics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.12.20173468","rel_title":"Immediate Effects of COVID-19 Outbreak on Psychiatric Outpatients: Posttraumatic Stress and Influencing Factors","rel_date":"2020-08-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.12.20173468","rel_abs":"We aimed to investigate the effects of COVID-19 outbreak and public health measures on the psychological well-being of patients with psychiatric disorders. This cross-sectional study assessed 436 outpatients recruited from a tertiary psychiatry clinic in Istanbul, Turkey, nearly one month after the government introduced strict measures of lockdown against the ongoing outbreak. Respondents completed a web-based survey on sociodemographic data, subjective sleep quality, and a range of psychiatric symptoms using the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Respondents reported high frequencies of clinically significant posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (32.6%, IES-R score equal to or above 33), anxiety (36.4%, HADS anxiety score > 10), and depression (51%, HADS depression score > 10). 20.5% of respondents described that their psychological status worsened during the COVID-19 outbreak, and 12.1% of respondents described poor or very poor sleep in the prior month. Positive predictors of increased PTSD symptoms included the chronic medical diseases, knowing someone in the social vicinity diagnosed with the COVID-19 infection, job loss or being on temporary leave after the outbreak, and increased exposure time to TV or social media. In contrast, male gender, older age, higher educational attainment, and the psychiatric diagnoses of schizophrenia and (to a lesser degree) bipolar disorder were the negative predictors. Our results suggest that patients with psychiatric disorders are prone to substantial psychological distress during the COVID-19 outbreak, and various individual, behavioral, and social factors mediate this effect.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Burc Cagri Poyraz","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, Cerrahpasa Medical School, Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Istanbul, Turkey."},{"author_name":"Cana Aksoy Poyraz","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, Cerrahpasa Medical School, Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Istanbul, Turkey."},{"author_name":"Senol Turan","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, Cerrahpasa Medical School, Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Istanbul, Turkey."},{"author_name":"Omer Faruk Demirel","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, Cerrahpasa Medical School, Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Istanbul, Turkey."},{"author_name":"Yasin Kavla","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, Cerrahpasa Medical School, Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Istanbul, Turkey."},{"author_name":"Ersel Bulu","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, Cerrahpasa Medical School, Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Istanbul, Turkey."},{"author_name":"Irem Hacisalihoglu","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, Cerrahpasa Medical School, Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Istanbul, Turkey."},{"author_name":"Elif Burcu Ersungur","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, Cerrahpasa Medical School, Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Istanbul, Turkey."},{"author_name":"Li Shen","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Dokyoon Kim","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.12.20173476","rel_title":"Superspreading k-cores at the center of COVID-19 pandemic persistence","rel_date":"2020-08-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.12.20173476","rel_abs":"The spread of COVID-19 caused by the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 virus has become a worldwide problem with devastating consequences. To slow down the spread of the pandemic, mass quarantines have been implemented globally, provoking further social and economic disruptions. Here, we address this problem by implementing a large-scale contact tracing network analysis to find the optimal quarantine protocol to dismantle the chain of transmission of coronavirus with minimal disruptions to society. We track billions of anonymized GPS human mobility datapoints from a compilation of hundreds of mobile apps deployed in Latin America to monitor the evolution of the contact network of disease transmission before and after the confinements. As a consequence of the lockdowns, people's mobility across the region decreases by ~53%, which results in a drastic disintegration of the transmission network by ~90%. However, this disintegration did not halt the spreading of the disease. Our analysis indicates that superspreading k-core structures persist in the transmission network to prolong the pandemic. Once the k-cores are identified, the optimal strategy to break the chain of transmission is to quarantine a minimal number of 'weak links' with high betweenness centrality connecting the large k-cores. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of an optimal tracing strategy to halt the pandemic. As countries race to build and deploy contact tracing apps, our results could turn into a valuable resource to help deploy protocols with minimized disruptions.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matteo Serafino","author_inst":"Levich Institute and Physics Department, City College   of New York, New York, NY 10031, USA and IMT School for Advanced Studies, 55100 Lucca, Italy"},{"author_name":"Higor S.

Whether ethnicity is an independent risk factor for severe Covid-19 illness is unclear. Purpose: Review the association between ethnicity and poor Covid-19 outcomes including all-cause mortality, hospitalisation, critical care admission, respiratory and kidney failure. Data Sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, WHO COVID-19 Global Research Database up to 15\/06\/2020, and preprint servers. No language restriction. Study Selection: All studies providing ethnicity-aggregated data on the pre-specified outcomes, except case reports or interventional trials Data Extraction: Pairs of investigators independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias using Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS), and rated certainty of evidence following GRADE framework. Data Synthesis: Seventy-two articles (59 cohort studies with 17,950,989 participants; 13 ecological studies; 54 US-based and 15 UK-based; 41 peer-reviewed) were included for systematic review and 45 for meta-analyses. Risk of bias was low, with median NOS of 7 (interquartile range 6-8). In the unadjusted analyses, compared to white ethnicity, all-cause mortality risk was similar in Black (RR:0.96 [95%CI: 0.83-1.08]), Asian (RR:0.99 [0.85-1.16]) but reduced in Hispanic ethnicity (RR:0.69 [0.57-0.84]). Age and sex-adjusted-risks were significantly elevated for Black (HR:1.38 [1.09-1.75]) and Asian (HR:1.42 [1.15-1.75]), but not for Hispanic (RR:1.14 [0.93-1.40]). Further adjusting for comorbidities attenuated these association to non-significance; Black (HR:0.95 [0.72-1.25]); Asian (HR:1.17 [0.84-1.63]); Hispanic (HR:0.94 [0.63-1.44]). Similar results were observed for other outcomes. In subgroup analysis, there is a trend towards greater disparity in outcomes for UK ethnic minorities, especially hospitalisation risks. Limitations: Paucity of evidence on native ethnic groups, and studies outside US and UK. Conclusions: Currently available evidence cannot confirm ethnicity as an independent risk factor for severe Covid-19 illness, but indicates that disparity may be partially attributed to greater burden of comorbidities.

However, the incidence and severity of sequelae after the acute infection is uncertain. Data measuring the longer-term impact of COVID19 on symptoms, radiology and pulmonary function are urgently needed to inform patients and plan follow up services. Methods: Consecutive patients hospitalised with COVID19 were prospectively recruited to an observational cohort with outcomes recorded at 28 days. All were invited to a systematic follow up at 12 weeks, including chest radiograph, spirometry, exercise test, blood tests, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) questionnaires. Findings: Between 30th March and 3rd June 2020, 163 patients with COVID19 were recruited. Median hospital length of stay was 5 days (IQR 2 to 8) and 30 patients required ITU or NIV, 19 patients died. At 12 weeks post admission, 134 were available for follow up and 110 attended. Most (74%) had persistent symptoms (notably breathlessness and excessive fatigue) with reduced HRQoL. Only patients with disease sufficiently severe to warrant oxygen therapy in hospital had abnormal radiology, clinical examination or spirometry at follow up. Thirteen (12%) patients had an abnormal chest X-ray with improvement in all but 2 from admission. Eleven (10%) had restrictive spirometry. Blood test abnormalities had returned to baseline in the majority (104\/110). Interpretation: Patients with COVID19 remain highly symptomatic at 12 weeks, however, clinical abnormalities requiring action are infrequent, especially in those without a supplementary oxygen requirement during their acute illness. This has significant implications for physicians assessing patients with persistent symptoms, suggesting that a more holistic approach focussing on rehabilitation and general wellbeing is paramount.

We describe the results of a SARS-CoV-2 universal screening program at the L&D Unit at Elmhurst Hospital in Queens, NY, a 545-bed public hospital serving a diverse, largely immigrant and low-income patient population and an epicenter of the global pandemic. Methods and findings We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study. All pregnant women admitted to the L&D Unit of Elmhurst Hospital from March 29, 2020 to April 22, 2020 were included for analysis. The primary outcomes of the study were: (1) SARS-CoV-2 positivity among universally screened pregnant women, stratified by demographic characteristics, maternal comorbidities, and delivery outcomes; and (2) Symptomatic or asymptomatic presentation at the time of testing among SARS-CoV-2 positive women. A total of 126 obstetric patients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 between March 29 and April 22. Of these, 37% were positive. Of the women who tested positive, 72% were asymptomatic at the time of testing. Patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were more likely to be of Hispanic ethnicity (unadjusted difference 24.4 percentage points, CI 7.9, 41.0) and report their primary language as Spanish (unadjusted difference 32.9 percentage points, CI 15.8, 49.9) than patients who tested negative. Conclusions In this retrospective cross-sectional study of data from a universal SARS-Cov-2 screening program implemented in the L&D unit of a safety-net hospital in Queens, New York, we found over one-third of pregnant women testing positive, the majority of those asymptomatic. The rationale for universal screening at the L&D Unit at Elmhurst Hospital was to ensure safety of patients and staff during an acute surge in SARS-Cov-2 infections through appropriate identification and isolation of pregnant women with positive test results.

As in USA and elsewhere, disadvantaged communities have been disproportionately affected. Methods National REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-2 (REACT-2) seroprevalence study using self-administered lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) test for IgG among a random population sample of 100,000 adults over 18 years in England, 20 June to 13 July 2020. Results Completed questionnaires were available for 109,076 participants, yielding 5,544 IgG positive results and adjusted (for test performance), re-weighted (for sampling) prevalence of 6.0% (95% CI: 5.8, 6.1). Highest prevalence was in London (13.0% [12.3, 13.6]), among people of Black or Asian (mainly South Asian) ethnicity (17.3% [15.8, 19.1] and 11.9% [11.0, 12.8] respectively) and those aged 18-24 years (7.9% [7.3, 8.5]). Care home workers with client-facing roles had adjusted odds ratio of 3.1 (2.5, 3.8) compared with non-essential workers. One third (32.2%, [31.0-33.4]) of antibody positive individuals reported no symptoms. Among symptomatic cases, the majority (78.8%) reported symptoms during the peak of the epidemic in England in March (31.3%) and April (47.5%) 2020. We estimate that 3.36 million (3.21, 3.51) people have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 in England to end June 2020, with an overall infection fatality ratio of 0.90% (0.86, 0.94). Conclusion The pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 infection in England disproportionately affected ethnic minority groups and health and care home workers. The higher risk of infection in these groups may explain, at least in part, their increased risk of hospitalisation and mortality from COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Helen Ward","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Christina J Atchison","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Matthew Whitaker","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Kylie E.

Design: Systematic review. Data sources: PubMed, bioRxiv.org and medRxiv.org were searched for studies suggestive of effective treatments for COVID-19. Additional studies were identified via a snowballing method applied to the references of retrieved papers as well as a subsequent targeted search for drug names. Review methods: Inclusion criteria included any case series or randomised control trials in any language that were published from 18th December 2019 to 18th April 2020 and described COVID-19 treatment. Of an initial 2140 studies identified from the initial search, 29 studies were found to meet the inclusion criteria and included in this comprehensive systematic review. Results: 19 studies of antiviral treatments for COVID-19 have been reported and seven studies for immunomodulatory treatments. Six randomised controlled trials have been published with one positive trial for Hydroxychloroquine. This small study consisted of 31 patients though subsequent studies showed contradictory findings. All the remaining studies were observational studies, retrospective case reviews or non-randomised trials and these results are difficult to interpret due to methodological issues. Conclusions: To date, an impressive number of studies have been performed in a short space of time, indicative of a resilient clinical trials infrastructure. However, there is a lack of high quality evidence to support any novel treatments for COVID-19 to be incorporated into the current standard of care. The majority of the studies of treatments for COVID-19 could only be found in pre-print servers. Future clinical reviews should therefore be Comprehensive Systematic Reviews involving pre-print studies to prevent potential unnecessary replications of clinical studies.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas Hill","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, Mindelsohn Way, Edgbaston, B152GW"},{"author_name":"Mark Baker","author_inst":"Birmingham Medical School, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham B15 2TT"},{"author_name":"Lawrence Isherwood","author_inst":"Birmingham Medical School, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham B15 2TT"},{"author_name":"Lennard YW Lee","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, Mindelsohn Way, Edgbaston B15 2GW, United Kingdom.

The objective is to present our experience of tocilizumab use in patients with severe COVID-19. Methods: Observational retrospective cohort study. Hospitalized patients were evaluated by our multidisciplinary team for eventual use of tocilizumab. Patients with progressive ventilatory impairment and evidence of a hyperinflammatory state despite usual treatment received tocilizumab 8 mg\/kg intravenous (maximum dose 800 mg), in addition to standard treatment. The use and time of use of mechanical ventilation (MV), the change of the Alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient, of the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (PaO2\/FiO2) and of inflammation laboratory parameters after 72 hours of tocilizumab use was evaluated. Results: 29 patients received tocilizumab. 93.1% were men, 37.9% were obese, and 34.5% had hypertension. Of the 20 patients who were not on MV when receiving tocilizumab, 11 required non-invasive MV, for an average of five days, and one of them required intubation. A-a gradient, PaO2\/FiO2, and inflammation parameters improved significantly. A better lymphocyte count, which improved significantly after tocilizumab use, was significantly associated with less use of MV. Five patients presented positive culture samples after tocilizumab, three being of clinical significance. A lower lymphocyte count was associated with having a positive culture. No other significant adverse events were seen. Conclusion: Our study suggests the utility and shows the safety of tocilizumab use in COVID-19 patients who have respiratory failure and evidence of hyperinflammation. Lymphocyte improvement was a predictor of good response.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Omar Valenzuela","author_inst":"Clinica Alemana de Santiago"},{"author_name":"Sebastian E Ibanez","author_inst":"Clinica Alemana de Santiago"},{"author_name":"Maria Poli","author_inst":"Clinica Alemana de Santiago"},{"author_name":"Patricia Roessler","author_inst":"Clinica Alemana de Santiago"},{"author_name":"Mabel Aylwin","author_inst":"Clinica Alemana de Santiago"},{"author_name":"Gigia Roizen","author_inst":"Clinica Alemana de Santiago"},{"author_name":"Mirentxu Iruretagoyena","author_inst":"Clinica Alemana de Santiago"},{"author_name":"Vivianne Agar","author_inst":"Clinica Alemana de Santiago"},{"author_name":"Javiera Donoso","author_inst":"Clinica Alemana de Santiago"},{"author_name":"Margarita Fierro","author_inst":"Clinica Alemana de Santiago"},{"author_name":"Jose Montes","author_inst":"Clinica Alemana de Santiago"},{"author_name":"Graham Cooke","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Steven Riley","author_inst":"Dept Inf Dis Epi, Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Paul Elliott","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Rachel Vreeman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Joseph Masci","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and New York City Health + Hospitals\/Elmhurst"},{"author_name":"Nick A Maskell","author_inst":"Academic Respiratory Unit, North Bristol NHS Trust, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Shaney Barratt","author_inst":"Academic Respiratory Unit, North Bristol NHS Trust, Bristol, UK"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.13.20173914","rel_title":"Sero-prevalence findings from metropoles in Pakistan: implications for assessing COVID-19 prevalence and case-fatality within a dense, urban working population","rel_date":"2020-08-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.13.20173914","rel_abs":"Population-level serologic testing has demonstrated groundbreaking results in monitoring the prevalence and case-fatality of COVID-19 within a population.

Identifying these could help formulate effective public health strategies. Incidence and mortality of COVID-19 for each of the 220 countries as on July 30, 2020 were evaluated against key epidemiological variables, namely - BCG vaccination (ongoing vs. discontinued\/never undertaken), %population aged [&ge;]65 years, incidences of ischemic heart disease (IHD), hypertensive heart disease (HHD), cancer, malaria, and diabetes; human development index (HDI) and population density. These were retrieved from the public domains of WHO, UN, World Bank and published reports. The COVID-19 CFRs ranged between 0.0% and 28.3% (mean {+\/-} SD: 3.05% {+\/-} 3.48). The influence of the individual epidemiological parameters on CFR were evaluated through the event rate estimations. A significantly lower event rate was observed in countries with ongoing BCG vaccination program (ER: with vs without ongoing BCG vaccination: 0.020 vs 0.034, p<0.001). The type of BCG strains used also influenced the ER; this being 0.018, 0.031 and 0.019 for early, late and mixed strains respectively (p=0.008). The epidemiological variables significantly associated with higher COVID-19 event rate were countries with higher %population aged [&ge;]65 years (p<0.001), greater incidence of IHD (p<0.001) and cancer (p=0.003) and better HDI (p=0.003). Incidences of malaria, HHD and diabetes along with population density had no significant impact on COVID-19 CFR. Further, BCG vaccination significantly lowered the COVID-19 ER in each of the high-risk population subgroups - countries with >7.1% population aged [&ge;]65 years (p=0.008), >0.737 HDI (p=0.001), IHD >1171\/105 population (p=0.004) and cancer incidence >15726 (p<0.001).

We use a calibrated multi-agent model to describe these dynamics. We assert here that this phenomenon can be understood as the result of local protective bubbles formed in the city's sub-environments at the same time that there was an exhaustion of contagion networks. Both reduce the velocity of the virus's spread, causing temporary reductions in the epidemic curve, albeit in an unstable equilibrium. These local bubbles can burst anytime and anywhere due to the reintroduction of a few infected people at the same time that there is a reduction in non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), such as social-distancing practices. It is important to stress that this hypothesis aligns with the dynamics of the virus's spread observed so far, without needing ad hoc suppositions about natural collective immunity thresholds or heterogeneity in the population's transmission rate, which come with the risk of making mistaken predictions that may could lead to the loss of many lives. The safe way to move ahead is to continue doing all we can to avoid new infections until a vaccine is found that properly and safely creates herd immunity.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jose Paulo Guedes Pinto","author_inst":"Federal University of ABC (UFABC)"},{"author_name":"Patricia Camargo Magalhaes","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Gerusa Maria Figueiredo","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Domingos Alves","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Diana Maritza Segura-Angel","author_inst":"Army Aviation School, Bogota, Colombia"},{"author_name":"Alexander Sherman","author_inst":"UCLA Ronald Reagan"},{"author_name":"Catherine C Lindsay","author_inst":"UCLA Ronald Reagan"},{"author_name":"Jennifer A Fulcher","author_inst":"UCLA Ronald Reagan"},{"author_name":"David Goodman-Meza","author_inst":"UCLA Ronald Reagan"},{"author_name":"Anil Sapru","author_inst":"UCLA Ronald Reagan"},{"author_name":"Russell G Buhr","author_inst":"UCLA Ronald Reagan"},{"author_name":"Steven Y Chang","author_inst":"UCLA Ronald Reagan"},{"author_name":"Tisha Wang","author_inst":"UCLA Ronald Reagan"},{"author_name":"Nida Qadir","author_inst":"UCLA Ronald Reagan"},{"author_name":"Rachel Vreeman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Joseph Masci","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and New York City Health + Hospitals\/Elmhurst"},{"author_name":"Nick A Maskell","author_inst":"Academic Respiratory Unit, North Bristol NHS Trust, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Shaney Barratt","author_inst":"Academic Respiratory Unit, North Bristol NHS Trust, Bristol, UK"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.13.20163030","rel_title":"Clinical characteristics and Outcomes of 500 patients with COVID Pneumonia : Results from a Single center(Southend University Hospital)","rel_date":"2020-08-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.13.20163030","rel_abs":"Objectives To characterise the clinical features of hospitalised COVID 19 patients in a single centre during the first epidemic wave and explore potential predictive variables associated with outcomes such as mortality and the need for mechanical ventilation, using baseline clinical parameters. Methodology We conducted a retrospective review of electronic records for demographic, clinical and laboratory data, imaging and outcomes for 500 hospitalised patients between February 20th and May 7th 2020 from Southend University Hospital, Essex, UK. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify risk factors relevant to outcome. Results The mean age of the cohort admitted to hospital with Covid-19, was 69.4 and 290 (58%) were over 70. The majority were Caucasians, 437 (87%) with less than 2 co-morbidities 280(56%). Most common were hypertension 186(37 %), Cardiovascular disease 178(36 %) and Diabetes 128 (26 %), represented in a larger proportion on the mortality group. Mean CFS was 4 with Non Survivors had significantly higher CFS 5 vs 3 in survivors, p<0.001. In addition, Mean CRP was significantly higher 150 vs 90, p<0.001 in Non Survivors. We observed the baseline predictors for mortality were age, CFS and CRP. Conclusions In this single centre study, older and frailer patients with more comorbidities and a higher baseline CRP and creatinine were risk factors for worse outcomes. Integrated frailty and age based risk stratification are essential, in addition to monitoring SFR (Sp02\/Fi02) and inflammatory markers throughout the disease course to allow for early intervention to improve patient outcomes.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gouri Koduri","author_inst":"Southend University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sriya Gokaraju","author_inst":"Southend University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maria Darda","author_inst":"Southend University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Vinod Warrier","author_inst":"Southend University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Irina Duta","author_inst":"Southend University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fiona Hayes","author_inst":"Southend University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Iman El Sayed","author_inst":"Alexandria University, EG"},{"author_name":"Yasser Noeman Ahmed","author_inst":"Southend University Hospital"},{"author_name":"David Goodman-Meza","author_inst":"UCLA Ronald Reagan"},{"author_name":"Anil Sapru","author_inst":"UCLA Ronald Reagan"},{"author_name":"Russell G Buhr","author_inst":"UCLA Ronald Reagan"},{"author_name":"Steven Y Chang","author_inst":"UCLA Ronald Reagan"},{"author_name":"Tisha Wang","author_inst":"UCLA Ronald Reagan"},{"author_name":"Nida Qadir","author_inst":"UCLA Ronald Reagan"},{"author_name":"Rachel Vreeman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Joseph Masci","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and New York City Health + Hospitals\/Elmhurst"},{"author_name":"Nick A Maskell","author_inst":"Academic Respiratory Unit, North Bristol NHS Trust, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Shaney Barratt","author_inst":"Academic Respiratory Unit, North Bristol NHS Trust, Bristol, UK"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.11.20173203","rel_title":"A simple numerical and analytical analysis of Covid-19 progression, infection inhibition and control in various countries","rel_date":"2020-08-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.11.20173203","rel_abs":"Covid-19 disease outspread and its subsequent control and inhibition strategies in various countries have been different which led to quite drastic difference in the outcome of the disease progression. In this paper we present an analytical and numerical study of Covid-19 disease spread and control by applying the modified SIR model of epidemic outbreak to explain the Covid spread from February-July 2020 in various countries. Two approaches are evident from the disease progression; one focused on disease eradication and inhibition, and the other is less restrictive dynamic response. Both the approaches are analytically modeled to determine the parameters that characterize the effectiveness of dealing with the disease progression. The model successfully explains the Covid-19 evolution and control of various countries over a vast span of four-five months. The study is highly beneficial to simply analytically and numerically model this complex problem of epidemic proliferation. It assists to easily determine the mathematical parameters for the Covid-19 control measures, helps in predicting the end of the epidemic, and most importantly conceiving the judicious way of unlock process to restore communication between cities, states and countries.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Uday Chakravarty","author_inst":"Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology, Indore"},{"author_name":"Deepa Chaturvedi","author_inst":"Department Applied Science, Alard College of Engineering and Management, Marunji, Pune"},{"author_name":"Mukesh P Joshi","author_inst":"Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology, Indore"},{"author_name":"Vinod Warrier","author_inst":"Southend University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Irina Duta","author_inst":"Southend University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fiona Hayes","author_inst":"Southend University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Iman El Sayed","author_inst":"Alexandria University, EG"},{"author_name":"Yasser Noeman Ahmed","author_inst":"Southend University Hospital"},{"author_name":"David Goodman-Meza","author_inst":"UCLA Ronald Reagan"},{"author_name":"Anil Sapru","author_inst":"UCLA Ronald Reagan"},{"author_name":"Russell G Buhr","author_inst":"UCLA Ronald Reagan"},{"author_name":"Steven Y Chang","author_inst":"UCLA Ronald Reagan"},{"author_name":"Tisha Wang","author_inst":"UCLA Ronald Reagan"},{"author_name":"Nida Qadir","author_inst":"UCLA Ronald Reagan"},{"author_name":"Rachel Vreeman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Joseph Masci","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and New York City Health + Hospitals\/Elmhurst"},{"author_name":"Nick A Maskell","author_inst":"Academic Respiratory Unit, North Bristol NHS Trust, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Shaney Barratt","author_inst":"Academic Respiratory Unit, North Bristol NHS Trust, Bristol, UK"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.10.20171819","rel_title":"Investigation of pooling strategies using clinical COVID-19 samples for more efficient diagnostic testing","rel_date":"2020-08-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.10.20171819","rel_abs":"When testing large numbers of clinical COVID-19 samples for diagnostic purposes, pooling samples together for processing can offer significant reductions in the materials, reagents, time, and labor needed. We have evaluated two different strategies for pooling independent nasopharyngeal swab samples prior to testing with an EUA-approved SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR diagnostic assay. First, in the Dilution Study, we assessed the assay's ability to detect a single positive clinical sample diluted in multiple negative samples before the viral RNA extraction stage. We observed that positive samples with Ct values at ~30 can be reliably detected in pools of up to 30 independent samples, and positive samples with Ct values at ~35 can be detected in pools of 5 samples. Second, in the Reloading Study, we assessed the efficacy of reloading QIAamp viral RNA extraction columns numerous times using a single positive sample and multiple negative samples. We determined that one RNA extraction column can be reloaded with up to 20 clinical samples (1 positive and 19 negatives) sequentially without any loss of signal in the diagnostic assay. Furthermore, we found there was no significant difference in assay readout whether the positive sample was loaded first or last in a series of 20 samples. These results demonstrate that different pooling strategies can lead to increased process efficiencies for COVID-19 clinical diagnostic testing.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samantha H Adikari","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Emily Z Alipio Lyon","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Attelia D Hollander","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Alina Deshpande","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Hong-Geller","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Fiona Hayes","author_inst":"Southend University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Iman El Sayed","author_inst":"Alexandria University, EG"},{"author_name":"Yasser Noeman Ahmed","author_inst":"Southend University Hospital"},{"author_name":"David Goodman-Meza","author_inst":"UCLA Ronald Reagan"},{"author_name":"Anil Sapru","author_inst":"UCLA Ronald Reagan"},{"author_name":"Russell G Buhr","author_inst":"UCLA Ronald Reagan"},{"author_name":"Steven Y Chang","author_inst":"UCLA Ronald Reagan"},{"author_name":"Tisha Wang","author_inst":"UCLA Ronald Reagan"},{"author_name":"Nida Qadir","author_inst":"UCLA Ronald Reagan"},{"author_name":"Rachel Vreeman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Joseph Masci","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and New York City Health + Hospitals\/Elmhurst"},{"author_name":"Nick A Maskell","author_inst":"Academic Respiratory Unit, North Bristol NHS Trust, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Shaney Barratt","author_inst":"Academic Respiratory Unit, North Bristol NHS Trust, Bristol, UK"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.13.20173997","rel_title":"Deep Learning for Automated Recognition of Covid-19 from Chest X-ray Images","rel_date":"2020-08-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.13.20173997","rel_abs":"Abstract Background: The pandemic caused by coronavirus in recent months is having a devastating global effect, which puts the world under the most ever unprecedented emergency. Currently, since there are not effective antiviral treat- ments for Covid-19 yet, it is crucial to early detect and monitor the progression of the disease, thus helping to reduce mortality. While a corresponding vaccine is being developed, and different measures are being used to combat the virus, medical imaging techniques have also been investigated to assist doctors in diag- nosing this disease. Objective: This paper presents a practical solution for the detection of Covid-19 from chest X-ray (CXR) images, exploiting cutting-edge Machine Learning techniques. Methods: We employ EfficientNet and MixNet, two recently developed families of deep neural networks, as the main classifica- tion engine. Furthermore, we also apply different transfer learning strategies, aiming at making the training process more accurate and efficient. The proposed approach has been validated by means of two real datasets, the former consists of 13,511 training images and 1,489 testing images, the latter has 14,324 and 3,581 images for training and testing, respectively. Results: The results are promising: by all the experimental configurations considered in the evaluation,our approach always yields an accuracy larger than 95.0%, with the maximum accuracy obtained being 96.64%. Conclusions: As a comparison with various existing studies, we can thus conclude that our performance improvement is significant.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Phuong Nguyen","author_inst":"University of L'Aquila"},{"author_name":"Ludovico Iovino","author_inst":"Gran Sasso Science Institute, Italy"},{"author_name":"Michele Flammini","author_inst":"Gran Sasso Science Institute, Italy"},{"author_name":"Linh Tuan Linh","author_inst":"Duy Tan University"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Hong-Geller","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Fiona Hayes","author_inst":"Southend University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Iman El Sayed","author_inst":"Alexandria University, EG"},{"author_name":"Yasser Noeman Ahmed","author_inst":"Southend University Hospital"},{"author_name":"David Goodman-Meza","author_inst":"UCLA Ronald Reagan"},{"author_name":"Anil Sapru","author_inst":"UCLA Ronald Reagan"},{"author_name":"Russell G Buhr","author_inst":"UCLA Ronald Reagan"},{"author_name":"Steven Y Chang","author_inst":"UCLA Ronald Reagan"},{"author_name":"Tisha Wang","author_inst":"UCLA Ronald Reagan"},{"author_name":"Nida Qadir","author_inst":"UCLA Ronald Reagan"},{"author_name":"Rachel Vreeman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Joseph Masci","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and New York City Health + Hospitals\/Elmhurst"},{"author_name":"Nick A Maskell","author_inst":"Academic Respiratory Unit, North Bristol NHS Trust, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Shaney Barratt","author_inst":"Academic Respiratory Unit, North Bristol NHS Trust, Bristol, UK"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"radiology and imaging"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.11.20172551","rel_title":"Results and Impact of Intensive SARS-CoV-2 Testing in a High Volume, Outpatient Radiation Oncology Clinic in a Pandemic Hotspot","rel_date":"2020-08-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.11.20172551","rel_abs":"Background: In an attempt to reduce interruptions in radiation treatment, our department implemented universal SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing during the peak of the New York City COVID-19 epidemic. Methods: Starting 4\/18\/20, outpatients coming into the Department of Radiation Oncology for either simulation or brachytherapy were required to undergo PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2. Starting on 5\/6\/20, patients were offered simultaneous SARS CoV-2 IgG antibody testing. Results: Between 4\/18\/20-6\/25\/20, 1360 patients underwent 1,401 outpatient screening visits (Table 1). Of the patients screened, 411 were screened between 4\/18\/20 and 5\/6\/20 (Phase 1) with PCR testing: 13 (3.1%) patients were PCR positive. From 5\/7\/20 to 6\/25\/20, 990 patients were scheduled for both PCR and antibody testing (Phase 2), including 41 previously screened in Phase 1. Of those with known antibody status (n=952), 5.5% were seropositive. After 5\/21\/20, no screened patient (n=605) tested PCR positive. In the month prior to screening (3\/17\/20-4\/19\/20), 24 of 625 patients initiating external radiation had treatment interrupted due to COVID-19 infection (3.8%) vs 7 of 600 patients (1.1%) in the month post screening (4\/20\/20-5\/24\/20) (p=0.002). Conclusions: State-wide mitigation efforts, coupled with intensive departmental screening, helped prevent interruptions in radiation during the COVID-19 epidemic that could have compromised treatment efficacy.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sean M McBride","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Kimberly Bundick","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Harper Hubbeling","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Morgan Freret","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Leslie Modlin","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Mini Kamboj","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Oren Cahlon","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Daniel Gomez","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"David Goodman-Meza","author_inst":"UCLA Ronald Reagan"},{"author_name":"Anil Sapru","author_inst":"UCLA Ronald Reagan"},{"author_name":"Russell G Buhr","author_inst":"UCLA Ronald Reagan"},{"author_name":"Steven Y Chang","author_inst":"UCLA Ronald Reagan"},{"author_name":"Tisha Wang","author_inst":"UCLA Ronald Reagan"},{"author_name":"Nida Qadir","author_inst":"UCLA Ronald Reagan"},{"author_name":"Rachel Vreeman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Joseph Masci","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and New York City Health + Hospitals\/Elmhurst"},{"author_name":"Nick A Maskell","author_inst":"Academic Respiratory Unit, North Bristol NHS Trust, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Shaney Barratt","author_inst":"Academic Respiratory Unit, North Bristol NHS Trust, Bristol, UK"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"oncology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.13.20174417","rel_title":"Causal associations between COVID-19 and Atrial Fibrillation: A bidirectional Mendelian randomization study","rel_date":"2020-08-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.13.20174417","rel_abs":"Abstract Background Observational studies showed that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) attacks universally and its most menacing progression uniquely endangers the elderly with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Whether COVID-19 is causally related to increasing susceptibility and severity of atrial fibrillation (AF), the main form of CVD, remains still unknown. Methods The study aims to investigate the bidirectional causal relations of COVID-19 with AF using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Results MR evidence suggested genetically predicted severe COVID-19 was significantly associated with higher risk of AF (odds ratio [OR], 1.041; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.007-1.076; P = 0.017), while genetically predicted AF was not causally associated with severe COVID-19 (OR, 0.831; 95% CI, 1.619-1.115; P=0.217). There was limited evidence to support association of genetically proxied COVID-19 with risk of AF (OR, 1.051; 95% CI, 0.991-1.114; P=0.097), and vice versa (OR, 0.163; 95% CI, 0.004-6.790; P=0.341).

Here we test the suitability of different RNA extraction methods for integration into a diagnostic workflow for coronavirus testing. Methods: We applied six RNA extraction methods on the same 24 SARS-CoV-2 positive patient samples and quantified their results by subsequent reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) of three viral genes. These methods included a) column-based extraction, b) phenol-chloroform extraction, as well as c) extraction using magnetic beads (i.e., one commercial kit as well as three different magnetic beads in combination with home-brewed buffers and solutions). Results: We achieved diagnostic-quality RT-PCR results with all methods, and there was no significant difference between the tested methods, except for one magnetic bead protocol with home-brewed buffers, in which the number of positive tested genes was significantly lower. Conclusions: Five of the six RNA extraction methods are interchangeable in a diagnostic workflow. Since some methods are more scalable than others, and have comparable results on RT-PCR quantitation, they may be more amenable to high-throughput sample processing pipelines.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ossia M Eichhoff","author_inst":"Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland; Faculty of Medicine, University of Zurich, 8006 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Elisa Bellini","author_inst":"Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Zurich, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland Switzerland; Faculty of Medicine, University of Zurich, 8006 Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Reto Lienhard","author_inst":"ADMED Microbiologie, 2300 La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Wendelin J.

Overproduction of cytokines triggered by COVID-19 infection, known as \"cytokine storm\", is a highly risk factor associated with disease severity. However, how COVID-19 infection induce cytokine storm is still largely unknown. Accumulating in vitro and in vivo evidence suggests that gut is also susceptible to COVID19 infection: Human intestinal organoids, an in vitro model which mimic the specific cell type and spatial structure of the intestine, were susceptible to SARS-CoV2 infection; A significant fraction of patients reported gut symptoms; Viral RNA may persist for more than 30 days and infectious virus could be isolated in fecal samples. The gastrointestinal tract is the primary site of interaction between the host immune system with symbiotic and pathogenic microorganisms. The bacteria resident in our gastrointestinal tract, known as gut microbiota, is important to maintain the homeostasis of our immune system. While imbalance of gut microbiota, or dysbiosis, is associated with multiple inflammation diseases5. It's possible that SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to alternation of gut microbiota thus worsen the host symptom. IL-18 is a proinflammatory cytokine produced multiple enteric cells, including intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), immune cells as well as enteric nervous system, and was shown to increase in the serum of COVID-19 patients. Immunoglobin A (IgA) is mainly produced in the mucosal surfaces, in humans 40-60mg kg-1 day-1 than all other immunoglobulin isotypes combined, and at least 80% of all plasma cells are located in the intestinal lamina propria.

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic people is an urgent priority for the prevention and containment of disease outbreaks in communities. However, few data are available in asymptomatic persons regarding the accuracy of PCR testing. Additionally, although self-collected saliva has significant logistical advantages in mass screening, its utility as an alternative specimen in asymptomatic persons is yet to be determined. Methods We conducted a mass-screening study to compare the utility of nucleic acid amplification, such as reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, using NPS and saliva samples from each individual in two cohorts of asymptomatic persons: the contact tracing cohort and the airport quarantine cohort. Results In this mass-screening study including 1,924 individuals, the sensitivity of nucleic acid amplification testing with nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens were 86% (90%CI:77-93%) and 92% (90%CI:83-97%), respectively, with specificities greater than 99.9%. The true concordance probability between the nasopharyngeal and saliva tests was estimated at 0.998 (90%CI:0.996-0.999) on the estimated airport prevalence, 0.3%. In positive individuals, viral load was highly correlated between NPS and saliva. Conclusion Both nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens had high sensitivity and specificity. Self-collected saliva is a valuable specimen to detect SARS-CoV-2 in mass screening of asymptomatic persons.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Isao Yokota","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Peter Y Shane","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Kazufumi Okada","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Yoko Unoki","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Yichi Yang","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Tasuku Inao","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Kentaro Sakamaki","author_inst":"Yokohama City  University"},{"author_name":"Sumio Iwasaki","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Kasumi Hayasaka","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Junichi Sugita","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Mutsumi Nishida","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Shinichi Fujisawa","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Takanori Teshima","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Jianping Weng","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Rachel Vreeman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Joseph Masci","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and New York City Health + Hospitals\/Elmhurst"},{"author_name":"Nick A Maskell","author_inst":"Academic Respiratory Unit, North Bristol NHS Trust, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Shaney Barratt","author_inst":"Academic Respiratory Unit, North Bristol NHS Trust, Bristol, UK"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.13.20171751","rel_title":"Identification on Admission of COVID-19 Patients at Risk of Subsequent Rapid Clinical Deterioration","rel_date":"2020-08-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.13.20171751","rel_abs":"Introduction: Recent localized surges in COVID-19 cases have resulted in the hospitals serving those areas being overwhelmed. In such cases, the ability to rapidly and objectively determine a patient's acuity and predict near-term care needs is a major challenge. At issue is the clinician's ability to correctly identify patients at risk for subsequent rapid clinical deterioration. Data-driven tools that can support such determinations in real-time may be a valuable adjunct to clinician judgement during COVID-19 surges. Objective: To assess the effectiveness of the Rothman Index (RI) predictive model in distinguishing the risk of subsequent deterioration or elevated care needs among hospitalized COVID-19 patients at the time of hospital admission. Methods: We evaluated the initial RI score on admission to predict COVID-19 patient risk for 216 COVID-19 patients discharged from March 21st to June 7th, 2020 at Sinai LifeBridge Hospital and 1,453 COVID-19 patients discharged from any of Yale New Haven Health System's Yale New Haven, Bridgeport, and Greenwich hospitals from April 1st to April 28th, 2020. In-hospital mortality as a function of age and RI on admission for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients were compared. AUC values using each COVID-19 patient's initial RI on admission to predict in-hospital mortality, mechanical ventilation, and ICU utilization were computed, as were precision and recall for mortality prediction at specific RI thresholds. Results: The RI computed at the time of admission provides a high degree of objective discrimination to differentiate the COVID-19 population into high and low risk populations at the outset of hospitalization. The high risk segment based on initial RI constitutes 20-30% of the COVID-19 positive population with mortality rates from 40-50%. The low risk segment based on initial RI constitutes 40%-55% of the population with mortality rates ranging from 1%-8%. Of note is that COVID-19 patients who present with heightened but generally unremarkable acuity can be identified early as having considerably elevated risk for subsequent physiological deterioration. Conclusion: COVID-19 patients exhibit elevated mortality rates compared to non-COVID-19 medical service patients and may be subject to rapid deterioration following hospital admission. A lack of predictive indicators for identifying patients at high risk of subsequent deterioration or death can pose a challenge to clinicians. The RI has excellent performance characteristics when stratifying risk among COVID-19 patients at the time of admission. The RI can assist clinicians in real-time with a high degree of objective discrimination by segmenting the COVID-19 population into high and low risk populations. This supports rapid and optimal patient bed assignment and resource allocation.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joseph Beals","author_inst":"PeraHealth, Inc"},{"author_name":"Jaime Barnes","author_inst":"Sinai LifeBridge Hospital"},{"author_name":"Daniel Durand","author_inst":"Sinai LifeBridge Hospital"},{"author_name":"Joan Rimar","author_inst":"Yale New Haven Health, Yale New Haven Hospital"},{"author_name":"Thomas Donohue","author_inst":"Yale New Haven Health, Yale New Haven Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mahfuz Hoq","author_inst":"Yale New Haven Health, Bridgeport Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kathy Belk","author_inst":"PeraHealth, Inc"},{"author_name":"Alpesh Amin","author_inst":"University of California Irvine Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael Rothman","author_inst":"PeraHealth, Inc"},{"author_name":"Junichi Sugita","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Mutsumi Nishida","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Shinichi Fujisawa","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Takanori Teshima","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Jianping Weng","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Rachel Vreeman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Joseph Masci","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and New York City Health + Hospitals\/Elmhurst"},{"author_name":"Nick A Maskell","author_inst":"Academic Respiratory Unit, North Bristol NHS Trust, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Shaney Barratt","author_inst":"Academic Respiratory Unit, North Bristol NHS Trust, Bristol, UK"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"emergency medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.13.20174326","rel_title":"Topological data analysis model for the spread of the coronavirus","rel_date":"2020-08-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.13.20174326","rel_abs":"We apply topological data analysis, specifically the Mapper algorithm, to the U.S. COVID-19 data.
