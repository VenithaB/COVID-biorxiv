Computational analysis of mammalian ACE2 orthologues suggests various residues at the interface with the viral receptor binding domain that could facilitate tighter interaction compared to the human-ACE2. Introducing several mutations to the human-ACE2 resulted with significantly augmented affinity to the viral spike complex. This modified human-ACE2 fused to an Fc portion of an antibody makes a potent immunoadhesin that effectively targets SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hadas Cohen-Dvashi","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Weinstein","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Michael Katz","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Maayan Eilon","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Yuval Mor","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Amir Shimon","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Romano Strobelt","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Maya Shemesh","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Sarel J Fleishman","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Ron Diskin","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"bioengineering"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.05.20160499","rel_title":"COVID-19 and Mental Health: A Study of its Impact on Students","rel_date":"2020-08-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.05.20160499","rel_abs":"The purpose of this study was to identify and analyse the personal, social and psychological impact of COVID - 19 on the mental health of students of age group 16 to 25. A response from N= 351 students (from the most affected state in India), provided a comparative analysis based on the gender, and background to understand the pattern in issues related to mental health during the pandemic. The results show that female students are more concerned about health, and future, and are more prone to psychological issues like feelings of uncertainty, helplessness and outbursts than male students. Urban student population is more mentally affected than their rural counterparts, however time spent on the internet is almost the same despite the difference in infrastructure and resources. Also, there is an increase in need for solitude, being withdrawn and self-harm in male students require attention. A shift in perception from seeing family as a source of support to that of a restriction is indicated, although the benefits of a collectivist society are undisputed. The results indicate that there is overall increased awareness about mental health among the student population and with programs\/strategies focusing on background and gender, a significant improvement is attainable.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kshipra Moghe","author_inst":"Asst Professor of Psychology, Department of Applied Science, College of Engineering Pune, Shivajinagar, Pune, Maharashtra, India"},{"author_name":"Disha Kotecha","author_inst":"Final year, Department of Electronics & Telecommunications Engineering, College of Engineering Pune, Shivajinagar, Pune, Maharashtra, India"},{"author_name":"Manjusha Patil","author_inst":"Final year, Department of Electronics & Telecommunications Engineering, College of Engineering Pune, Shivajinagar, Pune, Maharashtra, India"},{"author_name":"Maayan Eilon","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Yuval Mor","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Amir Shimon","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Romano Strobelt","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Maya Shemesh","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Sarel J Fleishman","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Ron Diskin","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.05.20151027","rel_title":"Time to negative PCR from symptom onset in COVID-19 patients on Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin - A real world experience","rel_date":"2020-08-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.05.20151027","rel_abs":"Background: The role of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin in the treatment of COVID-19 and its effect on SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance is not known. Methods: This is a retrospective observational study to assess the effect of HCQ and Azithromycin on duration from symptom onset to negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR using nasopharyngeal swab in hospitalized patient with COVID-19. Eighty-five patients were included in the study, 65 in HCQ (Hydroxychloroquine + Azithromycin) and 20 in non-HCQ group. Measurement of duration from symptom onset to negative PCR and effect of gender, age and disease severity on time to viral clearance was measured. Results: Median time to negative PCR in HCQ group was 23 days (IQR: 9, Mean 24+8, N=65) compared with non-HCQ group, 19 days (IQR: 8, Mean 18+6, N=20), (p <0.05). Forty-one (63%) patients in HCQ group and all patients (100%) in non-HCQ group had mild disease. Multivariate regression model (F=6.8, P<0.002, R2=0.20) shows that being in HCQ group would delay the time to negative PCR by 7 days (95%CI: 2-12) and with every year increase in the age, the time to negative PCR would be delayed by 0.12 days (95%CI: 0.017-0.22). Among HCQ sub-groups, gender and disease severity had no effect on duration (p 0.142 and 0.156 respectively) but older patients >60 year had longer duration compared to patients <60 year of age although p value did not reach significance (p 0.073). Median time to negative PCR in mild-HCQ group (23 days, IQR: 9, Mean 23+8, N=41) was longer when compared with non-HCQ group (p <0.05). On day 28, all patients in non-HCQ group had negative PCR while only 50\/65 (77%) were negative in HCQ group. Conclusion: Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin delay SARS-CoV-2 virus clearance in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and it is correlated with older age. Larger studies are needed to confirm this finding.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sarfraz A Saleemi","author_inst":"Section of Pulmonary Medicine, Department of Medicine, King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Abdulrahman Alrajhi","author_inst":"Section of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Alhajji","author_inst":"Section of Pulmonary Medicine, Department of Medicine, King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Areej Alfattani","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Scientific Computing.

This study aimed to investigate the indirect impact of COVID-19 on national SAVR and TAVR activity and outcomes. Methods The UK TAVR Registry and the National Adult Cardiac Surgery Audit were used to identify all TAVR and SAVR procedures in England, between January 2017 and June 2020. The number of isolated AVR, AVR+coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, AVR+other surgery and TAVR procedures per month was calculated. Separate negative binomial regression models were fit to monthly procedural counts, with functions of time as covariates, to estimate the expected change in activity during COVID-19. Results We included 13376 TAVR cases, 12328 isolated AVR cases, 7829 AVR+CABG cases, and 6014 AVR+Other cases. Prior to March 2020 (UK lockdown), monthly TAVR activity was rising, with a slight decrease in SAVR activity during 2019. We observed a rapid and significant drop in TAVR and SAVR activity during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for elective cases. Cumulatively, over the period March to June 2020, we estimated an expected 2294 (95% CI 1872, 2716) cases of severe aortic stenosis who have not received treatment. Conclusion This study has demonstrated a significant decrease in TAVR and SAVR activity in England following the COVID-19 outbreak. This situation should be monitored closely, to ensure that monthly activity rapidly returns to expected levels. There is potential for significant backlog in the near-to-medium term, and potential for increased mortality in this population.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Glen P Martin","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Nick Curzen","author_inst":"University of Southamptom"},{"author_name":"Andrew Goodwin","author_inst":"South Tees Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"James Nolan","author_inst":"Barts Health NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Lognathen Balacumaraswami","author_inst":"University of Keele"},{"author_name":"Peter Ludman","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Evangelos Kontopantelis","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Jianhua Wu","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Chris P Gale","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Mark de Belder","author_inst":"Barts Health NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Mamas A Mamas","author_inst":"University of Keele"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"cardiovascular medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.06.20169581","rel_title":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on rabies reemergence in Latin America: the case of Arequipa, Peru","rel_date":"2020-08-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.06.20169581","rel_abs":"Over the past decades, there has been tremendous progress towards eliminating canine rabies in Latin America. Major components of rabies prevention programs in Latin America leading to these successes have been constant and intense surveillance for rabid dogs and uninterrupted yearly mass dog vaccination campaigns. However, vital measures to control COVID-19 in Latin America have had the negative trade-off of jeopardizing these rabies elimination and prevention activities. In this paper, we aimed to assess the effect of interrupting canine rabies surveillance and mass dog vaccination campaigns on rabies trends. We built a deterministic compartment model of dog rabies dynamics parameterized for conditions found in Arequipa, Peru, where there is an ongoing dog rabies epidemic. Our model suggests that a decrease in canine vaccination coverage as well as decreased surveillance leading to an increased length of survival of infected dogs could lead to a sharp rise in canine rabies and, subsequently, human rabies risk. We examined our results over the best estimate of the basic reproductive number in Arequipa (R0 = 1.44) and a range of plausible values for R0 (1.36 - 2). The rising trend was consistent. It is very possible that COVID-19 will continue to challenge our public health departments in the short- and medium-term. Innovative strategies to conduct dog vaccination and rabies surveillance during these trying times should be considered to safeguard the achievements made in Latin America towards the elimination of dog-mediated human rabies. Resumen (Abstract in Spanish) En las ultimas decadas ha habido un tremendo progreso hacia la eliminacion de la rabia canina en America Latina. Los principales componentes de los programas de prevencion de la rabia en America Latina que condujeron a estos exitos han sido la vigilancia constante e intensa de los perros con rabia y las campanas anuales de vacunacion masiva ininterrumpida. Sin embargo, las medidas esenciales para controlar el COVID-19 en America Latina han tenido el balance negativo de poner en peligro estas actividades de prevencion y eliminacion de rabia. En este articulo, nuestro objetivo fue evaluar el efecto que la interrupcion de la vigilancia de la rabia canina y las campanas de vacunacion masiva de perros tendria en las tendencias de la rabia. Modelamos la dinamica de la rabia canina mediante un modelo deterministico de comportamientos parametrizado para las condiciones que se encuentran en Arequipa, Peru, donde hay una epidemia de rabia canina en curso. Nuestro modelo sugiere que una disminucion en la cobertura de vacunacion canina, asi como una disminucion en la vigilancia (que llevaria a una mayor supervivencia de los perros infectados), podria llevar a un aumento subito de rabia canina y, seguidamente, del riesgo de rabia humana. Examinamos nuestros resultados sobre la mejor estimacion del numero reproductivo basico en Arequipa (R0 = 1.44) y un rango de valores plausibles para R0 (1.36 - 2). La tendencia al alza fue consistente. Es muy posible que el COVID-19 continue desafiando a nuestros departamentos de salud publica a corto y mediano plazo. Por lo tanto, deben considerarse estrategias innovadoras para llevar a cabo la vacunacion de perros y la vigilancia de la rabia durante estos tiempos dificiles para salvaguardar los logros alcanzados en America Latina hacia la eliminacion de la rabia humana mediada por perros.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brinkley Raynor","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Elvis W.

While symptom screening has the benefit of reducing the number of infected individuals in the workplace, it raises some inherently difficult privacy issues as a traditional approach requires the employer to collect symptom data from each employee which is essentially medical information. In this paper, we describe a system to implement Cryptographic Anonymous Symptom Screening (CASS) which allows for individuals to perform COVID symptom screening anonymously while avoiding the privacy issues of traditional approaches. In the system, individuals report their symptoms without any identifying information and are issued a completion certificate. This certificate contains a cryptographic code which certifies that the certificate was obtained from the screener after reporting no symptoms. The codes can be verified using a cryptographic algorithm which is publicly available. A standard cryptography approach to implement such a system would be to use digital signatures. Unfortunately, standard digital signatures have some limitations for this application in that the signatures are often hundreds of characters long and if the signature contains the name of the individual, then there is also a risk of compromising privacy. In our approach, we develop and utilize a relaxed digital signature scheme to provide 16 character long codes and handle names using equivalence classes which helps preserve privacy. Both of these extensions technically compromise the security but in a way that is negligible for this application. Our system can either serve the function of standard symptom screening system approaches for employees, but can also extend symptom screening to non-employees such as visitors or customers. In this case, the system can be utilized in retail, restaurants and schools to ensure that everyone in the physical space, including employees, customers, visitors and students have performed symptom screening.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brandon Jew","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Alexis Korb","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Paul Lou","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey N Chiang","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Ulzee An","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Amit Sahai","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Eran Halperin","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Eleazar Eskin","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Chris P Gale","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Mark de Belder","author_inst":"Barts Health NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Mamas A Mamas","author_inst":"University of Keele"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.06.20162859","rel_title":"Whole Care Home Testing for Covid-19 in a Local Authority Area in the United Kingdom","rel_date":"2020-08-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.06.20162859","rel_abs":"Objectives: To describe the point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in care homes reporting low numbers of cases of COVID-19. Design: A cross-sectional study of care homes, ascertaining perceived disease burden using interviews with care home managers and SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in residents and staff using nose and throat swabbing. Setting: 15 Care homes in Essex, United Kingdom, all of which had reported either zero or one case of COVID-19 to the Health Protection Team. Participants: 912 residents and staff of care homes were tested. Residents were eligible to be tested regardless of symptoms. Main outcome measure: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in residents and staff. Results: In the 15 care homes studied, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 23 (5.2%)of 441 residents. Of these 23, 21\/23 (91%) were asymptomatic as reported by the care home managers. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 8\/471 (1.7%) of staff. This differs from that in residents (p=0.003). Conclusions: The findings of the study suggest that symptoms, as reported by care home managers, are an insensitive method of defining the extent of SARS-CoV-2 infection in nursing homes. Viral detection from residents is more common than from staff. Microbiological screening is a more sensitive method for defining the extent of SARS-CoV-2 in care homes than managerial reporting of resident symptoms.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anna Starling","author_inst":"Essex County Council"},{"author_name":"Eleanor White","author_inst":"Essex County Council"},{"author_name":"Danny Showell","author_inst":"Essex County Council"},{"author_name":"David Wyllie","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Smita Kapadia","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Ravikumar Balakrishnan","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Eran Halperin","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Eleazar Eskin","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Chris P Gale","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Mark de Belder","author_inst":"Barts Health NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Mamas A Mamas","author_inst":"University of Keele"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.06.20169573","rel_title":"Beneficial effects of colchicine for moderate to severe COVID-19: an interim analysis of a randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled clinical trial","rel_date":"2020-08-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.06.20169573","rel_abs":"Introduction. Neutrophilia and high levels of proinflammatory cytokines and other mediators of inflammation are common finds in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome due to COVID-19. By its action on leukocytes, we propose colchicine as an intervention worthy of being tested. Objective. To evaluate whether the addition of colchicine to standard treatment for COVID-19 results in better outcomes. Methods. We present the interim analysis of a single-center randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled clinical trial of colchicine for the treatment of moderate to severe COVID-19, with 38 patients allocated 1:1 from April 11 to July 06, 2020. Colchicine regimen was 0.5 mg thrice daily for 5 days, then 0.5 mg twice daily for 5 days. The first dose was 1.0 mg whether body weight was [&ge;] 80 kg. Endpoints. The primary endpoints were the need for supplemental oxygen; time of hospitalization; need for admission and length of stay in intensive care units; and death rate and causes of mortality. As secondary endpoints, we assessed: serum C-reactive protein, serum Lactate dehydrogenase and relation neutrophil to lymphocyte of peripheral blood samples from day zero to day 7; the number, type, and severity of adverse events; frequency of interruption of the study protocol due to adverse events; and frequency of QT interval above 450 ms. Results. Thirty-five patients (18 for Placebo and 17 for Colchicine) completed the study. Both groups were comparable in terms of demographic, clinical and laboratory data at baseline. Median (and interquartile range) time of need for supplemental oxygen was 3.0 (1.5-6.5) days for the Colchicine group and 7.0 (3.0-8.5) days for Placebo group (p = 0.02). Median (IQR) time of hospitalization was 6.0 (4.0-8.5) days for the Colchicine group and 8.5 (5.5-11.0) days for Placebo group (p = 0.03). At day 2, 53% vs 83% of patients maintained the need for supplemental oxygen, while at day 7 the values were 6% vs 39%, in the Colchicine and Placebo groups, respectively (log rank; p = 0.01). Hospitalization was maintained for 53% vs 78% of patients at day 5 and 6% vs 17% at day 10, for the Colchicine and Placebo groups, respectively (log rank; p = 0.01). One patient per group needed admission to ICU. No recruited patient died. At day 4, patients of Colchicine group presented significant reduction of serum C-reactive protein compared to baseline (p < 0.001). The majority of adverse events were mild and did not lead to patient withdrawal. Diarrhea was more frequent in the Colchicine group (p = 0.17). Cardiac adverse events were absent. Discussion. The use of colchicine reduced the length of supplemental oxygen therapy and the length of hospitalization. Clinical improvement was in parallel with a reduction on serum levels of C-reactive protein. The drug was safe and well tolerated. Colchicine may be considered a beneficial and not expensive option for COVID-19 treatment. Clinical trials with larger numbers of patients should be conducted to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of colchicine as an adjunctive therapy for hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":31,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria Isabel F Lopes","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Leticia P Bonjorno","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Marcela C Giannini","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Natalia B Amaral","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Maira N Benatti","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Uebe C Rezek","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Laerte L Emrich-Filho","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Betania AA Sousa","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Sergio CL Almeida","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo Luppino-Assad","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Flavio P Veras","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Ayda Schneider","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Tamara S Rodrigues","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Luiz OS Leiria","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Larissa D Cunha","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Jose C Alves-Filho","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Thiago M Cunha","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Eurico Arruda Neto","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Carlos H Miranda","author_inst":"Sao Paulo University"},{"author_name":"Antonio Pazin-Filho","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Maria A Martins","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Marcos C Borges","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Benedito AL Fonseca","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Valdes R Bollela","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Cristina M Del-Ben","author_inst":"Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Fernando Q Cunha Sr.","author_inst":"Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Dario S Zamboni","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, School of Medicine Ribeirao Preto"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo C Santana","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Fernando C Vilar","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Paulo Louzada-Junior","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Rene D R Oliveira","author_inst":"Hospital das Clinicas de Ribeirao Preto"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.07.20170035","rel_title":"Quantifying threat from COVID-19 infection hazard in Primary Schools in England","rel_date":"2020-08-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.07.20170035","rel_abs":"We have constructed a COVID-19 infection hazard model for the return of pupils to the 16,769 state Primary Schools in England that takes into account uncertainties in model input parameters. The basic probabilistic model estimates likely number of primary schools with one or more infected persons under three different return-to-school circumstances. Inputs to the infection hazard model are: the inventory of children, teachers and support staff; the prevalence of COVID-19 in the general community including its spatial variation, and the ratio of adult susceptibility to that of children. Three scenarios of inventory are: the counts on 1st June when schools re-opened to Nursery, Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 children, when approximately one-third of eligible children attended; a scenario assuming a full return of eligible children in those cohorts; and a return of all primary age children, scheduled for September. With a national average prevalence, we find that for the first scenario between 178 and 924 schools out of 16,769 in total (i.e. about 1% and 5.5% respectively) may have infected individuals present, expressed as a 90% credible interval. For the second scenario, the range is between 336 (2%) and 1873 (11%) schools with one (or more) infected persons, while for the third scenario the range is 661 (4%) to 3310 (20%) schools, assuming that the prevalence is the same as it was on 5th June. The range decreases to between 381 (2%) and 900 (5%) schools with an infected person if prevalence is one-quarter that of 5th June, and increases to between 2131 (13%) and 9743 (58%) schools for the situation where prevalence increases to 4 times the 5th June level. Net prevalence of COVID-19 in schools is reduced relative to the general community because of the lower susceptibility of primary age children to infection. When regional variations in prevalence and school size distribution are taken into account there is a slight decrease in number of infected schools, but the uncertainty on these projected numbers increases markedly. The probability of having an infected school in a community is proportional to the local prevalence and school size. Analysis of a scenario equivalent to a full return to school with an average national prevalence of 1 in 1700 and spatial prevalence variations, estimated from data for late June, indicates 82% of infected schools would be located in areas where prevalence exceeds the national average. The probability of having multiple infected persons in a school increases markedly in high prevalence areas. Assuming national prevalence characteristic of early June, individual, operational and societal risk will increase if schools re-open fully in September due to both increases in numbers of children and the increased challenges of sustaining mitigation measures. Comparison between incidents in primary schools with positive tests in June and July and our estimates of number of infected schools indicates at least an order of magnitude difference. The much lower number of incidents reflects several factors, including effective reduction in transmission resulting from risk mitigation measure instigated by schools.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stephen RJ Sparks","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"William P Aspinall","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Roger Cooke","author_inst":"Delft University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Jane H Scarrow","author_inst":"University of Grenada"},{"author_name":"Maira N Benatti","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Uebe C Rezek","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Laerte L Emrich-Filho","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Betania AA Sousa","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Sergio CL Almeida","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo Luppino-Assad","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Flavio P Veras","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Ayda Schneider","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Tamara S Rodrigues","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Luiz OS Leiria","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Larissa D Cunha","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Jose C Alves-Filho","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Thiago M Cunha","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Eurico Arruda Neto","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Carlos H Miranda","author_inst":"Sao Paulo University"},{"author_name":"Antonio Pazin-Filho","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Maria A Martins","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Marcos C Borges","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Benedito AL Fonseca","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Valdes R Bollela","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Cristina M Del-Ben","author_inst":"Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Fernando Q Cunha Sr.","author_inst":"Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Dario S Zamboni","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, School of Medicine Ribeirao Preto"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo C Santana","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Fernando C Vilar","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Paulo Louzada-Junior","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Rene D R Oliveira","author_inst":"Hospital das Clinicas de Ribeirao Preto"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.07.20169904","rel_title":"Model to Describe Fast Shutoff of CoVID-19 Pandemic Spread","rel_date":"2020-08-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.07.20169904","rel_abs":"Early CoVID-19 growth obeys: N{t*}=N\/I\\ exp[+K\/o\\ t*], with K\/o\\ = [(ln 2) \/ (t\/dbl\\)], where t\/dbl\\ is the pandemic growth doubling time.

While many institutions have released return-to-campus plans designed to reduce viral spread and to rapidly identify outbreaks should they occur, in many cases communications by college administrators have been opaque. To contribute to an evaluation of university preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic, we assessed a crucial element: COVID-19 on-campus testing. We examined testing plans at more than 500 colleges and universities throughout the US, and collated statistics, as well as narratives from publicly facing websites. We discovered a highly variable and muddled state of COVID-19 testing plans among US institutions of higher education that has been shaped by discrepancies between scientific studies and federal guidelines. We highlight cases of divergence between university testing plans and public health best practices, as well as potential bioethical issues.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"A.

While the hallmarks of SARS-CoV-2 and severe COVID-19 within routine laboratory parameters are emerging, little is known about the impact of sex and age on these profiles. Methods: We performed multidimensional analysis of millions of records of laboratory parameters and diagnostic tests for 178,887 individuals, of which 33,266 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. These included complete blood cell count, electrolytes, metabolites, arterial blood gases, enzymes, hormones, cancer biomarkers, and others. Results: COVID-19 induced more alterations in the laboratory parameters in males compared to females between 13 and 60 years old, in contrast to older individuals, where several parameters were altered by COVID-19 in both men and women. Biomarkers of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin, were increased especially in older men with COVID-19, whereas other markers such as abnormal liver function tests were common across several age groups, except for young women. Low peripheral blood basophils and eosinophils were also more common in the elderly with COVID-19. Both male and female COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) displayed alterations in the coagulation system, and higher levels of neutrophils, CRP, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), among others. Discussion: Our study uncovers the laboratory profile of a large cohort of COVID-19 patients that underly discrepancies influenced by aging and biological sex. These profiles directly link COVID-19 disease presentation to an intricate interplay between sex, age and the immune response.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Felipe ten-Caten","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Patricia Gonzalez-Dias","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Icaro Castro","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo Ogava","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Jeevan Giddaluru","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Juan CS Silva","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Felipe Martins","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Andre NA Goncalves","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Andre G Costa-Martins","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Jose D Araujo","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Ana C Viegas","author_inst":"Federal University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Fernando Q Cunha Sr.","author_inst":"Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Sandra Farsky","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Fernando A Bozza","author_inst":"D'Or institute for Research and Education"},{"author_name":"Anna S Levin","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Pia S Pannaraj","author_inst":"University of Southern California"},{"author_name":"Thushan I de Silva","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Paola Minoprio","author_inst":"Scientific Platform Pasteur-University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Bruno Bezerril Andrade","author_inst":"FIOCRUZ"},{"author_name":"Fabiano P da Silva","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Helder I Nakaya","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Marcos C Borges","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Benedito AL Fonseca","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Valdes R Bollela","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Cristina M Del-Ben","author_inst":"Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Fernando Q Cunha Sr.","author_inst":"Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Dario S Zamboni","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, School of Medicine Ribeirao Preto"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo C Santana","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Fernando C Vilar","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Paulo Louzada-Junior","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Rene D R Oliveira","author_inst":"Hospital das Clinicas de Ribeirao Preto"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"hematology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.07.20170258","rel_title":"Salivary anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA as an accessible biomarker of mucosal immunity against COVID-19.","rel_date":"2020-08-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.07.20170258","rel_abs":"Background: Mucosal immunity, including secretory IgA (sIgA), plays an important role in early defenses against respiratory pathogens. Salivary testing, the most convenient way to measure sIgA, has been used to characterize mucosal immune responses to many viral infections including SARS, MERS, influenza, HIV, and RSV. However, its role has not yet been characterized in the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we report development and validation of a rapid immunoassay for measuring salivary IgA against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and report quantitative results in both pre-COVID-19 and muco-converted subjects. Methods: We developed and refined a specific test for salivary IgA against SARS-CoV-2 on the Brevitest platform, a rapid immunoassay system designed for point-of-care use. A qualitative test was validated as per FDA guidelines with saliva obtained from subjects prior to the emergence of COVID-19, and from PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients. We also generated a quantitative measure of anti-SARS-CoV-2 salivary IgA. Time taken for saliva self-collection was measured and its ease-of-use assessed. Results: We successfully validated a qualitative salivary assay for SARS-CoV-2 IgA antibodies, with positive and negative predictive values of 92% and 97%, respectively, and no observable cross-reactivity with any of seven potential confounders. Pre-COVID-19 saliva samples showed an 8-fold range of IgA concentrations, suggesting a broad continuum of natural antibody resistance against the novel virus, though at levels lower than that observed in COVID-19 PCR-confirmed subjects. Samples from muco-positive subjects also shown a ~9-fold variation in salivary IgA levels, with elevated salivary IgA observed beyond three months after onset of symptoms. We observed a correlation (r=0.4405) between salivary IgA levels and COVID-19 disease severity. In anecdotal observations, we observed individuals who exhibited antibodies early in the course of their disease, contemporaneously with a positive PCR test, as well as individuals who muco-converted despite no known direct exposure to a COVID-19 patient, no symptoms, and negative molecular and\/or serum antibody tests. Salivary collection took 5-10 minutes, and was reported as being easy (mean of 1.1 on a scale of 1 to 10). Implications: Mucosal immunity, including secretory IgA, plays an important role in host defense against respiratory pathogens, and our early data suggest it may do so in COVID-19. Salivary IgA, an accessible marker of mucosal immunity, may be a useful indicator of several key parameters including individual and community immune response, disease severity, clinical risk, and herd immunity. The non-invasive nature and ease of saliva collection facilitates its potential use as a biomarker for ongoing patient assessment and management, as well as a community surveillance tool. By measuring mucosal immune responses directly and systemic immune responses indirectly, salivary IgA could be useful in developing and deploying a vaccine(s) against COVID-19. Quantitative IgA assessment could also potentially serve as a tool to segment the population into different risk categories and inform individual and collective decisions relating to appropriate activities and vaccine prioritization\/delivery. These data reinforce the importance of further investigation into the role of mucosal immunity and IgA in host responses against COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Atul Varadhachary","author_inst":"Fannin Innovation Studio and BreviTest Technologies, LLC."},{"author_name":"Dev Chatterjee","author_inst":"Fannin Innovation Studio and BreviTest Technologies, LLC."},{"author_name":"Javier Garza","author_inst":"Fannin Innovation Studio and BreviTest Technologies, LLC."},{"author_name":"Robert Patrick Garr","author_inst":"Fannin Innovation Studio and BreviTest Technologies, LLC."},{"author_name":"Christopher Foley","author_inst":"Fannin Innovation Studio and BreviTest Technologies, LLC."},{"author_name":"Andrea Ford Letkeman","author_inst":"Fannin Innovation Studio and BreviTest Technologies, LLC."},{"author_name":"John Dean","author_inst":"Fannin Innovation Studio and BreviTest Technologies, LLC."},{"author_name":"David Haug","author_inst":"Arctas Capital Group"},{"author_name":"Juliet Breeze","author_inst":"Next Level Urgent Care"},{"author_name":"Robbyn Traylor","author_inst":"Next Level Urgent Care"},{"author_name":"Andrew Malek","author_inst":"Alchemy Industrial, LLC"},{"author_name":"Rohan Nath","author_inst":"APC Health, LLC"},{"author_name":"Leo Linbeck III","author_inst":"Fannin Innovation Studio and BreviTest Technologies, LLC."},{"author_name":"Fernando A Bozza","author_inst":"D'Or institute for Research and Education"},{"author_name":"Anna S Levin","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Pia S Pannaraj","author_inst":"University of Southern California"},{"author_name":"Thushan I de Silva","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Paola Minoprio","author_inst":"Scientific Platform Pasteur-University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Bruno Bezerril Andrade","author_inst":"FIOCRUZ"},{"author_name":"Fabiano P da Silva","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Helder I Nakaya","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Marcos C Borges","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Benedito AL Fonseca","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Valdes R Bollela","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Cristina M Del-Ben","author_inst":"Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Fernando Q Cunha Sr.","author_inst":"Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Dario S Zamboni","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, School of Medicine Ribeirao Preto"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo C Santana","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Fernando C Vilar","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Paulo Louzada-Junior","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Rene D R Oliveira","author_inst":"Hospital das Clinicas de Ribeirao Preto"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.08.20170787","rel_title":"Comparative Clinical Outcomes and Mortality in Prisoner and Non-Prisoner Populations Hospitalized with COVID-19: A Cohort from Michigan","rel_date":"2020-08-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.08.20170787","rel_abs":"Background: Prisons in the United States have become a hotbed for spreading Covid-19 among incarcerated individuals. Covid-19 cases among prisoners are on the rise, with more than 46,000 confirmed cases to date. However, there is paucity of data addressing clinical outcomes and mortality in prisoners hospitalized with Covid-19. Methods: An observational study of all patients hospitalized with Covid-19 between March 10 and May 10, 2020 at two Henry Ford Health System hospitals in Michigan. Clinical outcomes were compared amongst hospitalized prisoners and non-prisoner patients. The primary outcomes were intubation rates, in-hospital mortality, and 30-day mortality. Multivariable logistic regression and Cox-regression models were used to investigate primary outcomes. Results: Of the 706 hospitalized Covid-19 patients (mean age 66.7 +\/- 16.1 years, 57% males, and 44% black), 108 were prisoners and 598 were non-prisoners. Compared to non-prisoners, prisoners were more likely to present with fever, tachypnea, hypoxemia, and markedly elevated inflammatory markers. Prisoners were more commonly admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (26.9% vs. 18.7%), required vasopressors (24.1% vs. 9.9%), and intubated (25.0% vs. 15.2%). Prisoners had higher unadjusted inpatient mortality (29.6% vs. 20.1%) and 30-day mortality (34.3% vs. 24.6%). In the adjusted models, prisoner status was associated with higher in-hospital death (odds ratio, 1.95; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.07 to 3.57) and 30-day mortality (hazard ratio, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.24 to 2.98). Conclusions: In this cohort of hospitalized Covid-19 patients, prisoner status was associated with more severe clinical presentation, higher rates of ICU admissions, vasopressors requirement, intubation, in-hospital mortality, and 30-day mortality.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ahmed M Altibi","author_inst":"Henry Ford Allegiance Health"},{"author_name":"Pallavi Bhargava","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Henry Ford Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hassan Liaqat","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Henry Ford Allegiance Hospital, Henry Ford Health System"},{"author_name":"Alexander A.

These individuals are at high risk for COVID-19. Objective: To assess clinical outcomes, costs, and cost-effectiveness of strategies for COVID-19 prevention and management among sheltered homeless adults. Design: We developed a dynamic microsimulation model of COVID-19. We modeled sheltered homeless adults in Boston, Massachusetts, using cohort characteristics and costs from Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program. Disease progression, transmission, and clinical outcomes data were from published literature and national databases. We examined surging, growing, and slowing epidemics (effective reproduction numbers [Re] 2.6, 1.3, and 0.9). Costs were from a health care sector perspective; time horizon was 4 months. Setting & Participants: Simulated cohort of 2,258 adults residing in homeless shelters in Boston. Interventions: We assessed combinations of daily symptom screening with same-day polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of screen-positive individuals, universal PCR testing every 2 weeks, hospital-based COVID-19 care, alternate care sites [ACSs] for mild\/moderate COVID-19 management, and moving people from shelters to temporary housing, compared to no intervention. Main Outcomes: Infections, hospital-days, costs, and cost-effectiveness. Results: Compared to no intervention, daily symptom screening with ACSs for those with pending tests or confirmed COVID-19 and mild\/moderate disease leads to 37% fewer infections and 46% lower costs when Re=2.6, 75% fewer infections and 72% lower costs when Re=1.3, and 51% fewer infections and 51% lower costs when Re=0.9. Adding universal PCR testing every 2 weeks further decreases infections in all epidemic scenarios, with incremental cost per case prevented of $1,000 (Re=2.6), $27,000 (Re=1.3), and $71,000 (Re=0.9). In all scenarios, moving shelter residents to temporary housing with universal PCR testing every 2 weeks is most effective but substantially more costly than other options. Results are most sensitive to the cost and sensitivity of PCR testing and the efficacy of ACSs in preventing transmission. Conclusions & Relevance: Daily symptom screening and ACSs for sheltered homeless adults will substantially decrease COVID-19 cases and reduce costs compared to no intervention. In a surging epidemic, adding universal PCR testing every 2 weeks further decreases cases at modest incremental cost and should be considered.

Increasingly, it is becoming clear that childcare centers must be (at least partially) operational in order to further mitigate the socially debilitating challenges related to pandemic induced closures. However, proposals to safely reopen childcare while limiting COVID-19 outbreaks remain understudied, and there is a pressing need for evidence-based scrutiny of the plans that are being proposed. Thus, in order to support safe childcare reopening procedures, the present study employed an agent-based modeling approach to generate predictions surrounding risk of COVID-19 infection and student-days lost within a hypothetical childcare center hosting 50 children and educators. Based on existing proposals for childcare and school reopening in Ontario, Canada, six distinct room configurations were evaluated that varied in terms of child-to-educator ratio (15:2, 8:2, 7:3), and family clustering (siblings together vs. random assignment). The results for the 15:2 random assignment configuration are relevant to early childhood education in Ontario primary schools, which require two educators per classroom. High versus low transmission rates were also contrasted, keeping with the putative benefit of infection control measures within centers, yielding a total of 12 distinct scenarios. Simulations revealed that the 7:3 siblings together configuration demonstrated the lowest risk, whereas centres hosting classrooms with more children (15:2) experienced 3 to 5 times as many COVID-19 cases. Across scenarios, having less students per class and grouping siblings together almost always results in significantly lower peaks for number of active infected and infectious cases in the institution. Importantly, the total student-days lost to classroom closure were between 5 and 8 times higher in the 15:2 ratios than for 8:2 or 7:3. These results suggest that current proposals for childcare reopening could be enhanced for safety by considering lower ratios and sibling groupings.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brendon Phillips","author_inst":"University of Waterloo"},{"author_name":"Dillon Browne","author_inst":"University of Waterloo"},{"author_name":"Madhur Anand","author_inst":"University of Guelph"},{"author_name":"Chris Bauch","author_inst":"University of Waterloo"},{"author_name":"Lynn Ly","author_inst":"Oxford Nanopore Technologies"},{"author_name":"Stuart Reid","author_inst":"Oxford Nanopore Technologies"},{"author_name":"Daniel J Turner","author_inst":"Oxford Nanopore Technologies"},{"author_name":"Sissel Juul","author_inst":"Oxford Nanopore Technologies"},{"author_name":"Jessie Gaeta","author_inst":"Boston Healthcare for the Homeless Program"},{"author_name":"Anne M.

This study aimed to provide data on demographics and clinical features of a hospitalized patient population who were confirmed with infection by our in-house (CDI) real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Methods We included consecutive patients who were admitted to Hackensack Meridian Health system hospitals with laboratory-confirmed diagnoses of COVID-19 at Hackensack University Medical Center by the CDI virus test between March 12, 2020, and April 8, 2020. Clinical data and viral testing results were collected and analyzed for characteristics associated with outcomes, as well as the correlation with viral load. Results A total of 722 patients were included in the study, with a median age of 63 (interquartile range (IQR), 51-75) and 272 (37.7%) females. Mortality of this case series was 25.8%, with a statistically significant linear increase observed from age 40 to [&ge;]80 by 10-year intervals. Viral load, as indicated by the cycle of threshold (Ct) values from the RT-PCR test, was significantly higher in the oldest patient group ([&ge;]80), and inversely correlated with survival.

Such an event would necessitate a large-scale evacuation, with implications for the trajectory of the pandemic. Here we model how a hypothetical hurricane evacuation from four counties in southeast Florida would affect COVID-19 case levels. We find that hurricane evacuation increases the total number of COVID-19 cases in both origin and destination locations; however, if transmission rates in destination counties can be kept from rising during evacuation, excess evacuation-induced case numbers can be minimized by directing evacuees to counties experiencing lower COVID-19 transmission rates. Ultimately, the number of excess COVID-19 cases produced by the evacuation depends on the ability of destination counties to meet evacuee needs while minimizing virus exposure through public health directives.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sen Pei","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Kristina A.

The impact of COVID-19 is evaluated by comparing the 2019 and 2020 civilian death records. There is evidence of a considerable excess of deaths since the pandemic started with respect to the previous year. In some states, it is clear that not all excess of deaths in 2020 is due to COVID-19, but to other respiratory causes that did not present the same prevalence in the previous year. Because of this unusual behavior of respiratory deaths, we may infer the evidence of a huge amount of under-reporting deaths due to the COVID-19. The data also shows that COVID-19 has produced an excess death in all ages besides people above 90 and below 10 years. In addition, when separates by sex, data indicate a larger increase in the deaths among males than females.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lisandro Lovisolo","author_inst":"Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro"},{"author_name":"Diego H S Catalao","author_inst":"Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo B Burgos","author_inst":"Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro"},{"author_name":"Malu Grave","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro"},{"author_name":"Pamella Constantino-Teles","author_inst":"Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro"},{"author_name":"Americo Cunha Jr.","author_inst":"Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro"},{"author_name":"Ronak J Shah","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Evelina Woin","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Christine Shi","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Nael Alavi","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Hala Bedri","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Niamh Brady","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Sophie Blackburn","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Martina Leczycka","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Sanya Patel","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Elizaveta Sokol","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Edward Toke-Bjolgerud","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Ambreen Qayum","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Mariana Abdel-Malek","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"David C D Hope","author_inst":"Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Nick S Oliver","author_inst":"Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Vasiliki Bravis","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Shivani Misra","author_inst":"Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Tricia M Tan","author_inst":"Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Neil Hill","author_inst":"Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Victoria Salem","author_inst":"Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Dario S Zamboni","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, School of Medicine Ribeirao Preto"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo C Santana","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Fernando C Vilar","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Paulo Louzada-Junior","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Rene D R Oliveira","author_inst":"Hospital das Clinicas de Ribeirao Preto"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.07.20170548","rel_title":"Social Media Reveals Psychosocial Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic","rel_date":"2020-08-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.07.20170548","rel_abs":"Background: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused several disruptions in personal and collective lives worldwide. The uncertainties surrounding the pandemic have also led to multi-faceted mental health concerns, which can be exacerbated with precautionary measures such as social distancing and self-quarantining, as well as societal impacts such as economic downturn and job loss. Despite noting this as a mental health tsunami, the psychological effects of the COVID-19 crisis remains unexplored at scale. Consequently, public health stakeholders are currently limited in identifying ways to provide timely and tailored support during these circumstances. Objective: Our work aims to provide insights regarding people's psychosocial concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic by leveraging social media data. We aim to study the temporal and linguistic changes in symptomatic mental health and support-seeking expressions in the pandemic context. Methods: We obtain 60M Twitter streaming posts originating from the U.S. from March, 24 to May, 25, 2020, and compare these with 40M posts from a comparable period in 2019 to causally attribute the effect of COVID-19 on people's social media self-disclosure. Using these datasets, we study people's self-disclosure on social media in terms of symptomatic mental health concerns and expressions seeking support. We employ transfer learning classifiers that identify the social media language indicative of mental health outcomes (anxiety, depression, stress, and suicidal ideation) and support (emotional and informational support). We then examine the changes in psychosocial expressions over time and language, comparing the 2020 and 2019 datasets. Results: We find that all of the examined psychosocial expressions have significantly increased during the COVID-19 crisis, mental health symptomatic expressions have increased by ~14%, and support seeking expressions have increased by 5%, both thematically related to COVID-19. We also observe a steady decline and eventual plateauing in these expressions during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have been due to habituation or due to supportive policy measures enacted during this period. Our language analyses highlight that people express concerns that are contextually related to the COVID-19 crisis. Conclusions: We studied the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 crisis by using social media data from 2020, finding that people's mental health symptomatic and support-seeking expressions significantly increased during the COVID-19 period as compared to similar data from 2019. However, this effect gradually lessened over time, suggesting that people adapted to the circumstances and their new normal. Our linguistic analyses revealed that people expressed mental health concerns regarding personal and professional challenges, healthcare and precautionary measures, and pandemic-related awareness. This work shows the potential to provide insights to mental healthcare and stakeholders and policymakers in planning and implementing measures to mitigate mental health risks amidst the health crisis.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Koustuv Saha","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"John Torous","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Eric D Caine","author_inst":"Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Munmun De Choudhury","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Pamella Constantino-Teles","author_inst":"Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro"},{"author_name":"Americo Cunha Jr.","author_inst":"Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro"},{"author_name":"Ronak J Shah","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Evelina Woin","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Christine Shi","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Nael Alavi","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Hala Bedri","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Niamh Brady","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Sophie Blackburn","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Martina Leczycka","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Sanya Patel","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Elizaveta Sokol","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Edward Toke-Bjolgerud","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Ambreen Qayum","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Mariana Abdel-Malek","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"David C D Hope","author_inst":"Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Nick S Oliver","author_inst":"Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Vasiliki Bravis","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Shivani Misra","author_inst":"Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Tricia M Tan","author_inst":"Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Neil Hill","author_inst":"Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Victoria Salem","author_inst":"Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Dario S Zamboni","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, School of Medicine Ribeirao Preto"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo C Santana","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Fernando C Vilar","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Paulo Louzada-Junior","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Rene D R Oliveira","author_inst":"Hospital das Clinicas de Ribeirao Preto"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.07.20170225","rel_title":"Population perspective comparing COVID-19 to all and common causes of death in seven European countries","rel_date":"2020-08-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.07.20170225","rel_abs":"Background: Mortality statistics on the COVID-19 pandemic have led to widespread concern and fear. To contextualise these data, we compared mortality related to COVID-19 with all and common causes of death, stratifying by age and sex. We also calculated deaths as a proportion of the population by age and sex. Methods: COVID-19 related mortality and population statistics from seven European countries were extracted: England and Wales, Italy, Germany, Spain, France, Portugal and Netherlands. Available data spanned 14-16 weeks since the first recorded deaths in each country, except Spain, where only comparable stratified data over an 8-week time period was available. The Global Burden of Disease database provided data on all deaths and those from pneumonia, cardiovascular disease combining ischaemic heart disease and stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, road traffic accidents and dementia. Findings: Deaths related to COVID-19, while modest overall, varied considerably by age. Deaths as a percentage of all cause deaths during the time period under study ranged from <0.01% in children in Germany, Portugal and Netherlands, to as high as 41.65% for men aged over 80 years in England and Wales. The percentage of the population who died from COVID-19 was less than 0.2% in every age group under the age of 80. In each country, over the age of 80, these proportions were: England and Wales 1.27% males, 0.87% females; Italy 0.6% males, 0.38% females; Germany 0.13% males, 0.09% females; France 0.39% males, 0.2% females; Portugal 0.2% males, 0.15% females; and Netherlands 0.6% males, 0.4% females. Interpretation: Mortality rates from COVID-19 remains low including when compared to other common causes of death and will likely decline further while control measures are maintained. These data may help people contextualise their risk and policy makers in decision-making.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bayanne Olabi","author_inst":"Department of Dermatology, Lauriston Building, Lauriston Place, Edinburgh, EH3 9EN"},{"author_name":"Jayshree Bagaria","author_inst":"Independent Consultant in Global Public Health"},{"author_name":"Sunil Bhopal","author_inst":"Population Health Sciences Institute, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 7RU"},{"author_name":"Gwenetta Curry","author_inst":"The University of Edinburgh Usher Institute of Population Health Sciences and Informatics Edinburgh, Edinburgh, EH3 9AG"},{"author_name":"Nazmy Villarroel","author_inst":"University of Sheffield, S10 2TG"},{"author_name":"Raj Bhopal","author_inst":"The University of Edinburgh Usher Institute of Population Health Sciences and Informatics Edinburgh, Edinburgh, EH3 9AG"},{"author_name":"Ronak J Shah","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Evelina Woin","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Christine Shi","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Nael Alavi","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Hala Bedri","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Niamh Brady","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Sophie Blackburn","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Martina Leczycka","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Sanya Patel","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Elizaveta Sokol","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Edward Toke-Bjolgerud","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Ambreen Qayum","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Mariana Abdel-Malek","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"David C D Hope","author_inst":"Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Nick S Oliver","author_inst":"Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Vasiliki Bravis","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Shivani Misra","author_inst":"Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Tricia M Tan","author_inst":"Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Neil Hill","author_inst":"Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Victoria Salem","author_inst":"Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Dario S Zamboni","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, School of Medicine Ribeirao Preto"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo C Santana","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Fernando C Vilar","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Paulo Louzada-Junior","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Rene D R Oliveira","author_inst":"Hospital das Clinicas de Ribeirao Preto"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.07.20167957","rel_title":"Mask-associated de novo headache in healthcare workers during the Covid-19 pandemic.","rel_date":"2020-08-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.07.20167957","rel_abs":"Introduction: The pandemic caused by the new coronavirus (COVID-19) has led to changes in the development of health care activities by health professionals.

Method: cross-sectional study in a tertiary hospital in Extremadura, Spain. We administered an online questionnaire to healthcare workers during the period of maximum incidence of COVID-19 in our setting. Results: n=306, 244 women (79.7%), with an average age of 43 years (range 23-65). Of the total, 129 (42.2%) were physicians, 112 (36.6%) nurses and 65 (21.2%) other health workers. 208 (79.7%) used surgical masks and 53 (20.3%) used filtering masks. Of all those surveyed, 158 (51.6%) presented de novo headache. The occurrence of headache was independently associated with the use of a filtering mask, OR 2.14 (IC95% 1.07-4.32), being a nurse OR 2.09 (IC95% 1.18-3.72) or another health worker OR 6.94 (IC95% 3.01-16.04) or having a history of asthma OR 0.29 (IC95% 0.09-0.89).

There is conflicting evidence about how HIV infection influences COVID-19. We compared the presentation characteristics and outcomes of people with and without HIV hospitalised with COVID-19 at 207 centres across the United Kingdom. Methods. We analysed data from people with laboratory confirmed or highly likely COVID-19 enrolled into the ISARIC CCP-UK study. The primary endpoint was day-28 mortality after presentation. We used Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox regression to describe the association with HIV status after adjustment for sex, ethnicity, age, indeterminate\/probable hospital acquisition of COVID-19 (definite hospital acquisition excluded), presentation date, and presence\/absence of ten comorbidities. We additionally adjusted for disease severity at presentation as defined by hypoxia\/oxygen therapy. Findings. Among 47,539 patients, 115 (0.24%) had confirmed HIV-positive status and 103\/115 (89.6%) had a record of antiretroviral therapy. At presentation, relative to the HIV-negative group, HIV-positive people were younger (median 55 versus 74 years; p<0.001), had a higher prevalence of obesity and moderate\/severe liver disease, higher lymphocyte counts and C-reactive protein, and more systemic symptoms. The cumulative incidence of day-28 mortality was 25.2% in the HIV-positive group versus 32.1% in the HIV-negative group (p=0.12); however, stratification for age revealed a higher mortality among HIV-positive people aged below 60 years. The effect of HIV-positive status was confirmed in adjusted analyses (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.99-2.25; p=0.06). Following additional adjustment for disease severity at presentation, mortality was higher in HIV-positive people (adjusted HR 1.63; 95% CI 1.07-2.48; p=0.02). In the HIV-positive group, mortality was more common among those who were slightly older and among people with obesity and diabetes with complications. Interpretation. HIV-positive status may be associated with an increased risk of day-28 mortality following a COVID-19 related hospitalisation.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anna Maria Geretti","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Alexander Stockdale","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Sophie Kelly","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Muge Cevik","author_inst":"University of St Andrews"},{"author_name":"Simon Collins","author_inst":"HIV i-Base"},{"author_name":"Laura Waters","author_inst":"Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust, British HIV Association"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Villa","author_inst":"University of Sussex"},{"author_name":"Annemarie B Docherty","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ewen M Harrison","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Lance Turtle","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Peter JM Openshaw","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Baillie","author_inst":"Royal Infirmary Edinburgh, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Caroline Sabin","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Malcolm Gracie Semple","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Sanya Patel","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Elizaveta Sokol","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Edward Toke-Bjolgerud","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Ambreen Qayum","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Mariana Abdel-Malek","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"David C D Hope","author_inst":"Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Nick S Oliver","author_inst":"Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Vasiliki Bravis","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Shivani Misra","author_inst":"Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Tricia M Tan","author_inst":"Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Neil Hill","author_inst":"Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Victoria Salem","author_inst":"Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Dario S Zamboni","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, School of Medicine Ribeirao Preto"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo C Santana","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Fernando C Vilar","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Paulo Louzada-Junior","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Rene D R Oliveira","author_inst":"Hospital das Clinicas de Ribeirao Preto"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"hiv aids"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.05.20169060","rel_title":"Tocilizumab in hospitalized patients with COVID-19: Clinical outcomes, inflammatory marker kinetics, safety, and a review of the literature","rel_date":"2020-08-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.05.20169060","rel_abs":"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes substantial morbidity. Tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist, might improve outcomes by mitigating inflammation. Methods We conducted a retrospective study of patients admitted to the University of Washington Hospital system with COVID-19 and requiring supplemental oxygen. Outcomes included clinical improvement, defined as a two-point reduction in severity on a 6-point ordinal scale or discharge, and mortality within 28 days. We used Cox proportional-hazards models with propensity score inverse probability weighting to compare outcomes in patients who did and did not receive tocilizumab. Results We evaluated 43 patients who received tocilizumab and 45 who did not. Patients receiving tocilizumab were younger with fewer comorbidities but higher baseline oxygen requirements. Tocilizumab treatment was associated with reduced CRP, fibrinogen, and temperature, but there were no meaningful differences in Cox models of time to clinical improvement (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.92; 95% CI, 0.38-2.22) or mortality (aHR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.21-1.52). A numerically higher proportion of tocilizumab-treated patients had subsequent infections, transaminitis, and cytopenias.

The aim of this study was to describe the complete clinical spectrum of COVID-19, based on a nationwide cohort with extensive diagnostic testing and a rigorous contact tracing approach. Methods: A population-based cohort study examining symptom progression using prospectively recorded data on all individuals with a positive test (RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) who were enrolled in a telehealth monitoring service provided to all identified cases in Iceland. Symptoms were systematically monitored from diagnosis to recovery. Results: From January 31 to April 30, 2020, a total of 45,105 individuals (12% of the Icelandic population) were tested for SARS-CoV-2, of whom 1797 were positive, yielding a population incidence of 5 per 1000 individuals. The most common presenting symptoms were myalgia (55%), headache (51%), and non-productive cough (49%). At the time of diagnosis, 5.3% of cases reported no symptoms and 3.1% remained asymptomatic during follow-up. In addition, 216 patients (13.8%) and 349 patients (22.3%) did not meet the case definition of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, respectively. The majority (67.5%) of patients had mild symptoms throughout the course of the disease. Conclusion: In the setting of broad access to diagnostic testing, the majority of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients were found to have mild symptoms. Fever and dyspnea were less common than previously reported. A substantial proportion of patients did not meet recommended case definitions at the time of diagnosis.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elias Eythorsson","author_inst":"Landspitali - The National University Hospital of Iceland"},{"author_name":"Dadi Helgason","author_inst":"Landspitali - The National University Hospital of Iceland"},{"author_name":"Ragnar Freyr Ingvarsson","author_inst":"Landspitali - The National University Hospital of Iceland"},{"author_name":"Helgi K Bjornsson","author_inst":"Landspitali - The National University Hospital of Iceland"},{"author_name":"Lovisa Bjork Olafsdottir","author_inst":"Landspitali - The National University Hospital of Iceland"},{"author_name":"Valgerdur Bjarnadottir","author_inst":"Landspitali - The National University Hospital of Iceland"},{"author_name":"Hrafnhildur Linnet Runolfsdottir","author_inst":"Landspitali - The National University Hospital of Iceland"},{"author_name":"Solveig Bjarnadottir","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, School of Health Sciences, University of Iceland"},{"author_name":"Arnar Snaer Agustsson","author_inst":"Landspitali - The National University Hospital of Iceland"},{"author_name":"Kristin Oskarsdottir","author_inst":"Landspitali - The National University Hospital of Iceland"},{"author_name":"Hrafn Hliddal Thorvaldsson","author_inst":"Landspitali - The National University Hospital of Iceland"},{"author_name":"Gudrun Kristjansdottir","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, School of Health Sciences, University of Iceland"},{"author_name":"Brynja Armannsdottir","author_inst":"Landspitali - The National University Hospital of Iceland"},{"author_name":"Agnar Bjarnason","author_inst":"Landspitali - The National University Hospital of Iceland"},{"author_name":"Birgir Johannsson","author_inst":"Landspitali - The National University Hospital of Iceland"},{"author_name":"Olafur Gudlaugsson","author_inst":"Landspitali - The National University Hospital of Iceland"},{"author_name":"Magnus Gottfredsson","author_inst":"Landspitali - The National University Hospital of Iceland"},{"author_name":"Martin I Sigurdsson","author_inst":"Landspitali - The National University Hospital of Iceland"},{"author_name":"Olafur S Indridason","author_inst":"Landspitali - The National University Hospital of Iceland"},{"author_name":"Runolfur Palsson","author_inst":"Landspitali - The National University Hospital of Iceland"},{"author_name":"Nick S Oliver","author_inst":"Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Vasiliki Bravis","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Shivani Misra","author_inst":"Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Tricia M Tan","author_inst":"Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Neil Hill","author_inst":"Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Victoria Salem","author_inst":"Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Dario S Zamboni","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, School of Medicine Ribeirao Preto"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo C Santana","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Fernando C Vilar","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Paulo Louzada-Junior","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Rene D R Oliveira","author_inst":"Hospital das Clinicas de Ribeirao Preto"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.07.20170456","rel_title":"Considering indirect benefits is critical when evaluating SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates","rel_date":"2020-08-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.07.20170456","rel_abs":"Significant progress has already been made in development and testing of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, and Phase III clinical trials have begun for 6 novel vaccine candidates to date. These Phase III trials seek to demonstrate direct benefits of a vaccine on vaccine recipients. However, vaccination is also known to bring about indirect benefits to a population through the reduction of virus circulation. The indirect effects of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination can play a key role in reducing case counts and COVID-19 deaths. To illustrate this point, we show through simulation that a vaccine with strong indirect effects has the potential to reduce SARS-CoV-2 circulation and COVID-19 deaths to a greater extent than an alternative vaccine with stronger direct effects but weaker indirect effects. Protection via indirect effects may be of particular importance in the context of this virus, because elderly individuals are at an elevated risk of death but are also less likely to be directly protected by vaccination due to immune senescence. We therefore encourage ongoing data collection and model development aimed at evaluating the indirect effects of forthcoming SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Molly E.

This study aimed to assess the sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive value (PPV and NPV) of molecular and serological tests for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A total of 346 consenting, adult patients were enrolled at the emergency room of IRCCS Sacro Cuore Don Calabria Hospital, Negrar, Italy. We evaluated three RT-PCR methods including six different gene targets; five serologic rapid diagnostic tests (RDT); one ELISA test. The final classification of infected\/not infected patients was performed using Latent Class Analysis in combination with clinical re-assessment of incongruous cases and was the basis for the main analysis of accuracy. Of 346 patients consecutively enrolled, 85 (24.6%) were classified as infected. The molecular test with the highest sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV was RQ-SARS-nCoV-2 with 91.8% (C.I. 83.8-96.6), 100% (C.I. 98.6-100.0), 100.0% (C.I. 95.4-100.0) and 97.4% (C.I. 94.7-98.9) respectively, followed by CDC 2019-nCoV with 76.2% (C.I. 65.7-84.8), 99.6% (C.I. 97.9-100.0), 98.5% (C.I. 91.7-100.0) and 92.9% (C.I. 89.2-95.6) and by in-house test targeting E-RdRp with 61.2% (C.I. 50.0-71.6), 99.6% (C.I. 97.9-100.0), 98.1% (C.I. 89.9-100.0) and 88.7% (C.I. 84.6-92.1). The analyses on single gene targets found the highest sensitivity for S and RdRp of the RQ-SARS-nCoV-2 (both with sensitivity 94.1%, C.I. 86.8-98.1). The in-house RdRp had the lowest sensitivity (62.4%, C.I. 51.2-72.6). The specificity ranged from 99.2% (C.I. 97.3-99.9) for in-house RdRp and N2 to 95.0% (C.I. 91.6-97.3) for E. The PPV ranged from 97.1% (C.I. 89.8-99.6) of N2 to 85.4% (C.I. 76.3-92.00) of E, and the NPV from 98.1% (C.I. 95.5-99.4) of gene S to 89.0% (C.I. 84.8-92.4) of in-house RdRp. All serological tests had <50% sensitivity and low PPV and NPV. One RDT (VivaDiag IgM) had high specificity (98.5%, with PPV 84.0%), but poor sensitivity (24.7%). Molecular tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection showed excellent specificity, but significant differences in sensitivity. As expected, serological tests have limited utility in a clinical context.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zeno Bisoffi","author_inst":"IRCCS Sacro Cuore Don Calabria Hospital"},{"author_name":"ELENA POMARI","author_inst":"IRCCS Sacro Cuore Don Calabria Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michela Deiana","author_inst":"IRCCS Sacro Cuore Don Calabria Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chiara Piubelli","author_inst":"IRCCS Sacro Cuore Don Calabria Hospital"},{"author_name":"Niccolo Ronzoni","author_inst":"IRCCS Sacro Cuore Don Calabria Hospital"},{"author_name":"Anna Beltrame","author_inst":"IRCCS Sacro Cuore Don Calabria Hospital"},{"author_name":"Giulia Bertoli","author_inst":"IRCCS Sacro Cuore Don Calabria Hospital"},{"author_name":"Niccolo Riccardi","author_inst":"IRCCS Sacro Cuore Don Calabria Hospital"},{"author_name":"Francesca Perandin","author_inst":"IRCCS Sacro Cuore Don Calabria Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fabio Formenti","author_inst":"IRCCS Sacro Cuore Don Calabria Hospital"},{"author_name":"Federico Gobbi","author_inst":"IRCCS Sacro Cuore Don Calabria Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dora Buonfrate","author_inst":"IRCCS Sacro Cuore Don Calabria Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ronaldo Silva","author_inst":"IRCCS Sacro Cuore Don Calabria Hospital"},{"author_name":"Agnar Bjarnason","author_inst":"Landspitali - The National University Hospital of Iceland"},{"author_name":"Birgir Johannsson","author_inst":"Landspitali - The National University Hospital of Iceland"},{"author_name":"Olafur Gudlaugsson","author_inst":"Landspitali - The National University Hospital of Iceland"},{"author_name":"Magnus Gottfredsson","author_inst":"Landspitali - The National University Hospital of Iceland"},{"author_name":"Martin I Sigurdsson","author_inst":"Landspitali - The National University Hospital of Iceland"},{"author_name":"Olafur S Indridason","author_inst":"Landspitali - The National University Hospital of Iceland"},{"author_name":"Runolfur Palsson","author_inst":"Landspitali - The National University Hospital of Iceland"},{"author_name":"Nick S Oliver","author_inst":"Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Vasiliki Bravis","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Shivani Misra","author_inst":"Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Tricia M Tan","author_inst":"Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Neil Hill","author_inst":"Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Victoria Salem","author_inst":"Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Dario S Zamboni","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, School of Medicine Ribeirao Preto"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo C Santana","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Fernando C Vilar","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Paulo Louzada-Junior","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Rene D R Oliveira","author_inst":"Hospital das Clinicas de Ribeirao Preto"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"}]}
