Here, we developed a blood test to broadly quantify cell, tissue, and organ specific injury due to COVID-19, using genome-wide methylation profiling of circulating cell-free DNA in plasma. We assessed the utility of this test to identify subjects with severe disease in two independent, longitudinal cohorts of hospitalized patients. Cell-free DNA profiling was performed on 104 plasma samples from 33 COVID-19 patients and compared to samples from patients with other viral infections and healthy controls. We found evidence of injury to the lung and liver and involvement of red blood cell progenitors associated with severe COVID-19. The concentration of cfDNA correlated with the WHO ordinal scale for disease progression and was significantly increased in patients requiring intubation. This study points to the utility of cell-free DNA as an analyte to monitor and study COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexandre Pellan Cheng","author_inst":"Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Matthew Pellan Cheng","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Wei Gu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Joan Sesing Lenz","author_inst":"Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Elaine Hsu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Erwin Schurr","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Guillaume Bourque","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Mathieu Bourgey","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Jerome Ritz","author_inst":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Francisco M Marty","author_inst":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Charles Y Chiu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Donald Cuong Vinh","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Iwijn De Vlaminck","author_inst":"Cornell University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"genetic and genomic medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.27.20163204","rel_title":"Examining Australian's beliefs, misconceptions, and sources of information for COVID-19: A national online survey","rel_date":"2020-07-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.27.20163204","rel_abs":"Objective: Public cooperation to practice preventive health behaviours is essential to manage the transmission of infectious diseases such as COVID-19. We aimed to investigate beliefs about COVID-19 diagnosis, transmission and prevention that have the potential to impact the uptake of recommended public health strategies. Design: An online cross-sectional survey conducted May 8 to May 11 2020. Participants: A national sample of 1500 Australian adults with representative quotas for age and gender provided by online panel provider. Main outcome measure: Proportion of participants with correct\/incorrect knowledge of COVID-19 preventive behaviours and reasons for misconceptions. Results: Of the 1802 potential participants contacted, 289 were excluded, 13 declined, and 1500 participated in the survey (response rate 83%). Most participants correctly identified washing your hands regularly with soap and water (92%) and staying at least 1.5m away from others (90%) could help prevent COVID-19. Over 40% (incorrectly) considered wearing gloves outside of the home would prevent them contracting COVID-19. Views about face masks were divided. Only 66% of participants correctly identified that regular use of antibiotics would not prevent COVID-19. Most participants (90%) identified fever, fatigue and cough as indicators of COVID-19. However, 42% of participants thought that being unable to hold your breath for 10 seconds without coughing was an indicator of having the virus. The most frequently reported sources of COVID-19 information were commercial television channels (56%), the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (43%), and the Australian Government COVID-19 information app (31%). Conclusions: Public messaging about hand hygiene and physical distancing to prevent transmission appear to have been effective. However, there are clear, identified barriers for many individuals that have the potential to impede uptake or maintenance of these behaviours in the long-term. Currently these non-drug interventions are our only effective strategy to combat this pandemic. Ensuring ongoing adherence to is critical.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rae Thomas","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Hannah Greenwood","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Zoe A Michaleff","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Eman Abukmail","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Tammy Hoffmann","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Kirsten J McCaffery","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Leah Hardiman","author_inst":"Consumer representative"},{"author_name":"Paul Glasziou","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Jerome Ritz","author_inst":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Francisco M Marty","author_inst":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Charles Y Chiu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Donald Cuong Vinh","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Iwijn De Vlaminck","author_inst":"Cornell University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.28.20163022","rel_title":"Eleven Routine Clinical Features Predict COVID-19 Severity","rel_date":"2020-07-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.28.20163022","rel_abs":"Severity prediction of COVID-19 remains one of the major clinical challenges for the ongoing pandemic. Here, we have recruited a 144 COVID-19 patient cohort consisting of training, validation, and internal test sets, longitudinally recorded 124 routine clinical and laboratory parameters, and built a machine learning model to predict the disease progression based on measurements from the first 12 days since the disease onset when no patient became severe. A panel of 11 routine clinical factors, including oxygenation index, basophil counts, aspartate aminotransferase, gender, magnesium, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase, platelet counts, activated partial thromboplastin time, oxygen saturation, body temperature and days after symptom onset, constructed a classifier for COVID-19 severity prediction, achieving accuracy of over 94%. Validation of the model in an independent cohort containing 25 patients achieved accuracy of 80%. The overall sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were 0.70, 0.99, 0.93 and 0.93, respectively.

Host immunity has come out as a determinant for COVID-19 clinical outcome, and several studies investigated the immune profiling of SARS-CoV-2 infected people to properly direct the clinical management of the disease. Thus, lymphopenia, T-cell exhaustion, and the increased levels of inflammatory mediators have been described in COVID-19 patients, in particular in severe cases1. Age represents a key factor in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality2. Understanding age-associated immune signatures of patients is therefore important to identify preventive and therapeutic strategies. In this study, we investigated the immune profile of COVID-19 hospitalized patients identifying a distinctive age-dependent immune signature associated with disease severity. Indeed, defined circulating factors - CXCL8, IL-10, IL-15, IL-27 and TNF- - positively correlate with older age, longer hospitalization, and a more severe form of the disease and may thus represent the leading signature in critical COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Roberta Angioni","author_inst":"Fondazione Istituto di Ricerca Pediatrica - Citta della Speranza, Padova, Italy"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Sanchez-Rodriguez","author_inst":"Fondazione Istituto di Ricerca Pediatrica - Citta della Speranza, Padova, Italy"},{"author_name":"Fabio Munari","author_inst":"Fondazione Istituto di Ricerca Pediatrica - Citta della Speranza, Padova, Italy"},{"author_name":"Nicole Bertoldi","author_inst":"Fondazione Istituto di Ricerca Pediatrica - Citta della Speranza, Padova, Italy"},{"author_name":"Diletta Arcidiacono","author_inst":"Istituto Oncologico Veneto- IOV-IRCCS, Padova, Italy"},{"author_name":"Silvia Cavinato","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Unit, Padova University Hospital, Padova, Italy"},{"author_name":"Davide Marturano","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Nephrology, Dialysis and Transplantation Unit, University of Padova, Padova, Italy;"},{"author_name":"Annamaria Cattelan","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Unit, Padova University Hospital, Padova, Italy"},{"author_name":"Antonella Viola","author_inst":"Fondazione Istituto di Ricerca Pediatrica - Citta della Speranza, Padova, Italy;"},{"author_name":"Barbara Molon","author_inst":"Fondazione Istituto di Ricerca Pediatrica - Citta della Speranza, Padova, Italy;"},{"author_name":"Hao Chen","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Structural Biology of Zhejiang Province, School of Life Sciences, Westlake University, Hangzhou, China;

CardioVascular Outcomes Trials (CVOTs) conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic are available. We aimed to estimate the effect of DPP4 inhibitors on the risk of respiratory infections. Methods We updated a previous systematic review and meta-analysis, searching for CVOTs assessing a DPP4 inhibitor in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. We focused on placebo-controlled CVOTs. Our primary outcome was 'any respiratory infection'. We added a sensitivity analysis integrating non-CVOTs and active-controlled CVOTs. Findings We included 47 714 patients in five placebo-controlled CVOTs. Median follow-up ranged from 1.5 years to 3 years. 4 369 events of overall respiratory infection were reported (rate of 9.2%). DPP4 inhibitors were not associated with a different risk compared to placebo (RR = 0.99 [95%CI: 0.93; 1.04]). The sensitivity analysis integrating the non-CVOTs studies and the active-controlled CVOT reached 11 349 events among 82 644 participants (rate of 13.7%). DPP4 inhibitors were not associated with a different risk of overall respiratory infection (RR = 1.00 [95% CI: 0.97; 1.03]). Interpretation Our up-dated meta-analysis provides the most powerful and least biased estimation of the association of DPP4 inhibitors and the risk of overall (non COVID-19) respiratory infection. We did not find any effect of the DPP4 inhibitors on the risk of respiratory infection. Our results support the recently published practical recommendations for the management of diabetes in patients with COVID-19, suggesting that DPP4 inhibitors should not be discontinued regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guillaume Grenet","author_inst":"Hospices Civils de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Samia Mekhaldi","author_inst":"Universite de Lyon, Universite Lyon 1, CNRS, Laboratoire de Biometrie et Biologie Evolutive UMR 5558, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France"},{"author_name":"Sabine MAINBOURG","author_inst":"Hospices Civils de Lyon, Hopital Lyon Sud, Service de Medecine Interne et Vasculaire, Lyon, France"},{"author_name":"Marine AUFFRET","author_inst":"Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pole Sante Publique, Service hospitalo-universitaire de pharmacotoxicologie, Lyon, France"},{"author_name":"Catherine Cornu","author_inst":"CIC1407 INSERM, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France"},{"author_name":"Jean-Luc Cracowski","author_inst":"Univ.

INO-4800 is an ID-delivered DNA vaccine currently being evaluated in clinical trials. Vaccination with INO-4800 induced T cell responses and neutralizing antibody responses against both the D614 and G614 SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. Several months after vaccination, animals were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 resulting in rapid recall of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein T and B cell responses. These responses were associated with lower viral loads in the lung and with faster nasal clearance of virus. These studies support the immune impact of INO-4800 for inducing both humoral and cellular arms of the adaptive immune system which are likely important for providing durable protection against

viral polypeptides, the main protease Mpro cleaves at eleven sites to release non-structural proteins required for viral replication. MPro is an attractive target for antiviral therapies to combat the coronavirus-2019 disease (COVID-19). Here, we have used native mass spectrometry (MS) to characterize the functional unit of Mpro. Analysis of the monomer-dimer equilibria reveals a dissociation constant of Kd = 0.14 {+\/-} 0.03 M, revealing MPro has a strong preference to dimerize in solution. Developing an MS-based kinetic assay we then characterized substrate turnover rates by following temporal changes in the enzyme-substrate complexes, which are effectively \"flash-frozen\" as they transition from solution to the gas phase. We screened small molecules, that bind distant from the active site, for their ability to modulate activity. These compounds, including one proposed to disrupt the catalytically active dimer, slow the rate of substrate processing by ~35%. This information was readily obtained and, together with analysis of the x-ray crystal structures of these enzyme-small molecule complexes, provides a starting point for the development of more potent molecules that allosterically regulate MPro activity.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tarick J El-Baba","author_inst":"Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory University of Oxford South Parks Rd.

A variety of mechanisms may underlie the observed gender-related disparities including differences in sex hormones. However, the precise mechanisms by which female sex hormones may provide protection against SARS-CoV-2 infectivity remains unknown. Here we report new insights into the molecular basis of the interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and the human ACE2 receptor. We further observed that glycosylation of the ACE2 receptor enhances SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Importantly estrogens can disrupt glycan-glycan interactions and glycan-protein interactions between the human ACE2 and the SARS-CoV2 thereby blocking its entry into cells. In a mouse model, estrogens reduced ACE2 glycosylation and thereby alveolar uptake of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. These results shed light on a putative mechanism whereby female sex hormones may provide protection from developing severe infection and could inform the development of future therapies against COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jorge Aguilar Pineda","author_inst":"Universidad Catolica de Santa Maria"},{"author_name":"Mazen Albaghdadi","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wanlin Jiang","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Karin Janneth Vera Lopez","author_inst":"Universidad Catolica de Santa Maria"},{"author_name":"Mark E Lindsay","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gonzalo Davila del-Carpio","author_inst":"Universidad Catolica de Santa Maria"},{"author_name":"Badhin Gomez Valdez","author_inst":"Universidad Catolica de Santa Maria"},{"author_name":"Rajeev Malhotra","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christian Lacks Lino Cardenas","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School-Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ioannis Vakonakis","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry University of Oxford South Parks Rd.

We directly exposed mucociliary air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures derived from primary human nonsmoker airway basal stem cells (ABSCs) to short term cigarette smoke and infected them with live SARS-CoV-2. We found an increase in the number of infected airway cells after cigarette smoke exposure as well as an increased number of apoptotic cells. Cigarette smoke exposure alone caused airway injury that resulted in an increased number of ABSCs, which proliferate to repair the airway. But we found that acute SARS-CoV-2 infection or the combination of exposure to cigarette smoke and SARS-CoV-2 did not induce ABSC proliferation. We set out to examine the underlying mechanism governing the increased susceptibility of cigarette smoke exposed ALI to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Single cell profiling of the cultures showed that infected airway cells displayed a global reduction in gene expression across all airway cell types. Interestingly, interferon response genes were induced in SARS-CoV-2 infected airway epithelial cells in the ALI cultures but smoking exposure together with SARS-CoV-2 infection reduced the interferon response. Treatment of cigarette smoke-exposed ALI cultures with Interferon {beta}-1 abrogated the viral infection, suggesting that the lack of interferon response in the cigarette smoke-exposed ALI cultures allows for more severe viral infection and cell death. In summary, our data show that acute smoke exposure allows for more severe proximal airway epithelial disease from SARS-CoV-2 by reducing the mucosal innate immune response and ABSC proliferation and has implications for disease spread and severity in people exposed to cigarette smoke.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arunima Purkayastha","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Chandani Sen","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Gustavo Garcia Jr.","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Justin Langerman","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Preethi Vijayaraj","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"David W.

In this study, SARS-CoV-2 infection of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was investigated both in vitro and in vivo. We found that in vitro infection of whole PBMCs from healthy donors was productive of virus progeny. Results revealed that monocytes, as well as B and T lymphocytes, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 active infection and viral replication was indicated by detection of double-stranded RNA. Moreover, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 was frequently detected in monocytes and B lymphocytes from COVID-19 patients, and less frequently in CD4+T lymphocytes. The rates of SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes in PBMCs from COVID-19 patients increased over time from symptom onset. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2-positive monocytes and B and CD4+T lymphocytes were detected by immunohistochemistry in post mortem lung tissue. SARS-CoV-2 infection of blood circulating leukocytes in COVID-19 patients may have important implications for disease pathogenesis, immune dysfunction, and virus spread within the host.","rel_num_authors":36,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marjorie C Pontelli","author_inst":"Virology Research Center, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Italo A Castro","author_inst":"Virology Research Center, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Ronaldo B Martins","author_inst":"Virology Research Center, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Flavio P Veras","author_inst":"Center of Research in Inflammatory Diseases (CRID), University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Leonardo La Serra","author_inst":"Virology Research Center, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Daniele C Nascimento","author_inst":"Center of Research in Inflammatory Diseases (CRID), University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Ricardo S Cardoso","author_inst":"Virology Research Center, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Roberta Rosales","author_inst":"Department of Cell and Molecular Biology and Pathogenic Bioagents, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Thais M Lima","author_inst":"Virology Research Center, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Juliano P Souza","author_inst":"Virology Research Center, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Diego B Caetite","author_inst":"Center of Research in Inflammatory Diseases (CRID), University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Mikhael HF Lima","author_inst":"Center of Research in Inflammatory Diseases (CRID), University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Juliana T Kawahisa","author_inst":"Center of Research in Inflammatory Diseases (CRID), University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Marcela C Giannini","author_inst":"Center of Research in Inflammatory Diseases (CRID), University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Leticia P Bonjorno","author_inst":"Center of Research in Inflammatory Diseases (CRID), University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Maria IF Lopes","author_inst":"Center of Research in Inflammatory Diseases (CRID), Divisions of Clinical Immunology;

Here we applied a novel, comprehensive bioinformatic strategy to public RNA sequencing and viral genome sequencing data, to better understand how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with human cells. To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to predict host factors that play a specific role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, distinct from other respiratory viruses. We identified differentially expressed genes, isoforms and transposable element families specifically altered in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Well-known immunoregulators including CSF2, IL-32, IL-6 and SERPINA3 were differentially expressed, while immunoregulatory transposable element families were overexpressed. We predicted conserved interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 genome and human RNA-binding proteins such as hnRNPA1, PABPC1 and eIF4b, which may play important roles in the viral life cycle.

At low pH, binding of SARS-CoV and its ACE2 receptor has a tight interaction that catalyzes the fusion of the spike and endosomal membranes followed by genome release. Largely overlooked has been the role of neutral pH in the respiratory tract, where we find that SARS-CoV stabilizes a transition state that enhances the off-rate from its receptor. An alternative pH-switch is found in CoV-2-like coronaviruses of tropical pangolins, but with a reversed phenotype where the tight interaction with ACE2 is at neutral pH. We show that a single point mutation in pangolin-CoV, unique to CoV-2, that deletes the last His residue in their receptor binding domain perpetuates this tight interaction independent of pH. This tight bond, not present in previous respiratory syndromes, implies that CoV-2 stays bound to the highly expressed ACE2 receptors in the nasal cavity about 100 times longer than CoV. This finding supports the unfamiliar pathology of CoV-2, observed virus retention in upper respiratory tract1, longer incubation times and extended periods of shedding. Implications to combat pandemics that, like SARS-CoV-2, export evolutionarily successful strains via higher transmission rates due to retention in nasal epithelium and their evolutionary origin are discussed.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kristina A Paris","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Ulises Santiago","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Carlos J.

Usually, viral protein targets host proteins in an organized fashion. The pathogen may target cell signaling pathways to disrupt the pathway genes regular activities, resulting in disease. Understanding the interaction mechanism of viral and host proteins involved in different signaling pathways may help decipher the attacking mechanism on the signal transmission during diseases, followed by discovering appropriate therapeutic solutions.\n\nThe expression of any viral gene depends mostly on the host translational machinery. Recent studies report the great significance of codon usage biases in establishing host-viral protein-protein interactions (PPI). Exploiting the codon usage patterns between a pair of co-evolved host and viral proteins may present novel insight into the host-viral protein interactomes during disease pathogenesis. Leveraging the codon usage pattern similarity (and dissimilarity), we propose a computational scheme to recreate the hostviral protein interaction network (HVPPI). We use seventeen (17) essential signaling pathways for our current work and study the possible targeting mechanism of SARS-CoV2 viral proteins on such pathway proteins. We infer both negatively and positively interacting edges in the network. We can find a relationship where one host protein may target by more than one viral protein.\n\nExtensive analysis performed to understand the network topologically and the attacking behavior of the viral proteins. Our study reveals that viral proteins, mostly utilize codons, rare in the targeted host proteins (negatively correlated interaction). Among non-structural proteins, NSP3 and structural protein, Spike (S) protein, are the most influential proteins in interacting multiple host proteins. In ranking the most affected pathways, MAPK pathways observe to be worst affected during the COVID-19 disease. A good number of targeted proteins are highly central in host protein interaction networks. Proteins participating in multiple pathways are also highly connected in their own PPI and mostly targeted by multiple viral proteins.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jayanta Das","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Maryland, USA"},{"author_name":"Subhadip Chakrobarty","author_inst":"Nabadwip Vidyasagar College, Nabadwip, India"},{"author_name":"Swarup Roy","author_inst":"Sikkim University"},{"author_name":"Andreas Gruber","author_inst":"Oxford Big Data Institute, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Andrea Guarracino","author_inst":"Centre for Molecular Bioinformatics, Department of Biology, University Of Rome Tor Vergata"},{"author_name":"Itziar Martinez Gonzalez","author_inst":"Netherlands\tAmsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Taylor Floyd","author_inst":"Center for Neurogenetics, Weill Cornell Medicine, Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Daniel Siqueira de Oliveira","author_inst":"Laboratoire de Biometrie et Biologie Evolutive, Universite de Lyon, CNRS"},{"author_name":"Justin Shanklin","author_inst":"Brigham Young University"},{"author_name":"Ethan Beausoleil","author_inst":"Brigham Young University"},{"author_name":"Taneli Pusa","author_inst":"Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine"},{"author_name":"Brett Pickett","author_inst":"Brigham Young University"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Aguiar-Pulido","author_inst":"Center for Neurogenetics, Weill Cornell Medicine, Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Marcela C Giannini","author_inst":"Center of Research in Inflammatory Diseases (CRID), University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Leticia P Bonjorno","author_inst":"Center of Research in Inflammatory Diseases (CRID), University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Maria IF Lopes","author_inst":"Center of Research in Inflammatory Diseases (CRID), Divisions of Clinical Immunology;

The objectives of this study were to characterize genomic variations, non-synonymous amino acid substitutions, especially in target proteins, mutation events per samples, mutation rate, and overall scenario of coronaviruses across the country. To investigate the genetic diversity, a total of 184 genomes of virus strains sampled from different divisions of Bangladesh with sampling dates between the 10th of May 2020 and the 27th of June 2020 were analyzed. To date, a total of 634 mutations located along the entire genome resulting in non-synonymous 274 amino acid substitutions in 22 different proteins were detected with nucleotide mutation rate estimated to be 23.715 substitutions per year. The highest non-synonymous amino acid substitutions were observed at 48 different positions of the papain-like protease (nsp3). Although no mutations were found in nsp7, nsp9, nsp10, and nsp11, yet orf1ab accounts for 56% of total mutations. Among the structural proteins, the highest non-synonymous amino acid substitution (at 36 positions) observed in spike proteins, in which 9 unique locations were detected relative to the global strains, including 516E>Q in the boundary of the ACE2 binding region. The most dominated variant G614 (95%) based in spike protein is circulating across the country with co-evolving other variants including L323 (94%) in RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), K203 (82%) and R204 (82%) in nucleocapsid, and F120 (78%) in NSP2.

Twitter is a popular social media platform with active discussions about the COVID-19 pandemic. The public reactions on Twitter about the COVID-19 pandemic in different countries have not been studied. This study aims to compare the public reactions towards the COVID-19 pandemic between the United Kingdom and the United States from March 6, 2020 to April 2, 2020. Data: The numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom and the United States were obtained from the 1Point3Acres website. Twitter data were collected using COVID-19 related keywords from March 6, 2020 to April 2, 2020. Methods: Temporal analyses were performed on COVID-19 related Twitter posts (tweets) during the study period to show daily trends and hourly trends. The sentiment scores of the tweets on COVID-19 were analyzed and associated with the policy announcements and the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Topic modeling was conducted to identify related topics discussed with COVID-19 in the United Kingdom and the United States. Results: The number of daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom was significantly lower than that in the United States during our study period. There were 3,556,442 COVID-19 tweets in the United Kingdom and 16,280,065 tweets in the United States during the study period. The number of COVID-19 tweets per 10,000 Twitter users in the United Kingdom was lower than that in the United States. The sentiment scores of COVID-19 tweets in the United Kingdom were less negative than those in the United States. The topics discussed in COVID-19 tweets in the United Kingdom were mostly about the gratitude to government and health workers, while the topics in the United States were mostly about the global COVID-19 pandemic situation. Conclusion: Our study showed correlations between the public reactions towards the COVID-19 pandemic on Twitter and the confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as the policies related to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom and the United States.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Canruo Zou","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Xueting Wang","author_inst":"Goergen Institute for Data Science, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Zidian Xie","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Dongmei Li","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Eshrar Osman","author_inst":"Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research"},{"author_name":"Md.

Traditional biostatistical methods require knowing both the number of infected people who were hospitalized and the number of infected people who were not hospitalized. However, the latter may be undercounted, as it is limited to only those who were tested for viral infection. In addition, comorbidity information for people not hospitalized may not always be readily available for traditional biostatistical analyses. To overcome these limitations, we developed a Bayesian approach that only requires the observed frequency of comorbidities in COVID-19 patients in hospitals and the prevalence of comorbidities in the general population. By applying our approach to two different large-scale datasets in the U.S., our results consistently indicated that cardiovascular diseases carried the highest hospitalization risk for COVID-19 patients, followed by diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, and obesity, respectively.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiang Gao","author_inst":"Loyola University Chicago"},{"author_name":"Qunfeng Dong","author_inst":"Loyola University Chicago"},{"author_name":"Zidian Xie","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Dongmei Li","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Eshrar Osman","author_inst":"Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research"},{"author_name":"Md.

Recently, saliva samples has been suggested as an alternative due to being fast, reliable and non-invasive, rather than nasopharyngeal samples. We compared RT-PCR results in nasopharyngeal, oro-nasopharyngeal and saliva samples of COVID-19 patients. 98 of 200 patients were positive in RT-PCR analysis performed before the hospitalization. In day 0, at least one sample was positive in 67% of 98 patients. Positivity rate was 83% for both oro-nasopharyngeal and nasopharyngeal samples, while it was 63% for saliva samples (p<0.001). On day 5, RT-PCR was performed in 59 patients, 34% had at least one positive result. The positivity rate was 55% for saliva and nasopharyngeal samples, while it was 60% for oro-nasopharyngeal samples. Our study shows that the sampling saliva does not increase the sensitivity of RT-PCR tests at early stages of infection. However, on 5th day, viral RNA detection rates in saliva were similar to nasopharyngeal and oro-nasopharyngeal samples. In conclusion, we suggest that, in patients receiving treatment, virus presence in saliva, in addition to the standard samples, is important to determine the isolation period and to control the transmission.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ozlem Akgun Dogan","author_inst":"Genomic Laboratory (GLAB), Umraniye Teaching and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Betsi Kose","author_inst":"Genomic Laboratory (GLAB), Umraniye Teaching and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Nihat Bugra Agaoglu","author_inst":"Genomic Laboratory (GLAB), Umraniye Teaching and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jale Yildiz","author_inst":"Genomic Laboratory (GLAB), Umraniye Teaching and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Gizem Alkurt","author_inst":"Genomic Laboratory (GLAB), Umraniye Teaching and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yasemin Kendir Demirkol","author_inst":"Genomic Laboratory (GLAB), Umraniye Teaching and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Arzu Irvem","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Umraniye Teaching and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Gizem Dinler-Doganay","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Istanbul Technical University"},{"author_name":"Levent Doganay","author_inst":"Genomic Laboratory (GLAB), Umraniye Teaching and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Iffat Jahan","author_inst":"Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research"},{"author_name":"Md.

We aim i) to characterise viral load dynamics, duration of viral RNA, and viable virus shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in various body fluids and ii) to compare SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics with SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. Methods: Medline, EMBASE, Europe PMC, preprint servers and grey literature were searched to retrieve all articles reporting viral dynamics and duration of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV shedding. We excluded case reports and case series with < 5 patients, or studies that did not report shedding duration from symptom onset. PROSPERO registration: CRD42020181914. Findings: Seventy-nine studies on SARS-CoV-2, 8 on SARS-CoV-1, and 11 on MERS-CoV were included. Mean SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding duration in upper respiratory tract, lower respiratory tract, stool and serum were 17.0, 14.6, 17.2 and 16.6 days, respectively. Maximum duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding reported in URT, LRT, stool and serum was 83, 59, 35 and 60 days, respectively. Pooled mean duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding was positively associated with age (p=0.002), but not gender (p = 0.277). No study to date has detected live virus beyond day nine of illness despite persistently high viral loads. SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the upper respiratory tract appears to peak in the first week of illness, while SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV peak later. Conclusion: Although SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in respiratory and stool can be prolonged, duration of viable virus is relatively short-lived. Thus, detection of viral RNA cannot be used to infer infectiousness. High SARS-CoV-2 titres are detectable in the first week of illness with an early peak observed at symptom onset to day 5 of illness. This review underscores the importance of early case finding and isolation, as well as public education on the spectrum of illness. However, given potential delays in the isolation of patients, effective containment of SARS-CoV-2 may be challenging even with an early detection and isolation strategy.

However, large-scale studies of COVID-19 mortality and new-onset comorbidity compared to influenza and individuals tested negative for COVID-19 are lacking. We aimed to investigate COVID-19 30-day mortality and newonset comorbidity compared to individuals with negative COVID-19 test results and individuals tested for influenza. Methods and findings This population-based cohort study utilized electronic health records covering roughly half (n=2,647,229) of Denmark's population, with nationwide linkage of microbiology test results and death records. All individuals [&ge;]18 years tested for COVID-19 and individuals tested for influenza were followed from November 1, 2017 to June 30, 2020. The main outcome was 30-day mortality after a test for either COVID-19 or influenza. Secondary outcomes were major comorbidity diagnoses 30-days after the test for either COVID-19 or influenza. In total, 224,639 individuals were tested for COVID-19. Among inpatients positive for COVID-19, 356 of 1657 (21%) died within 30 days, which was a 3.0 to 3.1-fold increased 30-day mortality rate, when compared to influenza and COVID-19-negative inpatients (all p<0.001). For outpatients, 128 of 6,263 (2%) COVID-19-positive patients died within 30 days, which was a 5.5 to 6.9-fold increased mortality rate compared to influenza and COVID-19-negative patients, respectively (all p<0.001). Compared to hospitalized patients with influenza, new-onset ischemic stroke, diabetes and nephropathy occurred more frequently in inpatients with COVID-19 (all p<0.05). Conclusions In this population-based study comparing COVID-19 with influenza, COVID-19 was associated with increased rates of major systemic and vascular comorbidity and substantially higher mortality, which is likely even higher than the stated 3.0 to 5.5-fold increase owing to more extensive testing for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vardan Nersesjan","author_inst":"Rigshospitalet"},{"author_name":"Moshgan Amiri","author_inst":"Rigshospitalet"},{"author_name":"Hanne Krarup Christensen","author_inst":"Bispebjerg Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michael E.

This systematic review and meta-analysis of either published or preprint observational or interventional studies were conducted to assess the cure rate, duration of hospital stay, radiological progression, clinical worsening, need for mechanical ventilation, the occurrence of side effects, and mortality. A search of the online database through June 2020 was performed and examined the reference lists of pertinent articles for in-vivo studies only. Pooled relative risks (RRs), standard mean, of 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with the random-effects model. Results: The duration of hospital stay was shorter in the standard care in comparison with HCQ group, the standard mean of hospital stay was 0.57, 95% CI, and 0.20-0.94. Overall virological cure, or more specifically at day 4, 10, and 14 among patients exposed to HCQ did not differ significantly from the standard care [(RR=0.92, 95% CI 0.78-1.15), (RR=1.11, 95% CI 0.74-1.65), (RR=1.21, 95%CI 0.70-2.01), and (RR=0.98, 95% CI, 0.76-1.27)] respectively. Radiological improvement or clinical worsening was not statistically different between HCQ and standard care [(RR=1.11, 95% CI 0.64-1.65) and (RR=1.28, 95% CI 0.33-4.99)]. The need for mechanical ventilation (MV) was not significant between the HCQ group and the standard care (RR= 1.5, 95%CI 0.78-2.89). Side effects were more reported in the HCQ group than the standard care (RR=3.14, 95% CI 1.58- 6.24). Mortality among HCQ was not affected by receiving HCQ (RR=3.14, 95% CI 1.58-6.24), meta-regression analysis revealed that country is a strong predictor of mortality. The duration of hospital stay among the HCQ and AZM didn not differ significantly from the standard care (standard mean= 0.77, 95% CI 0.46-1.08). Despite virological cure and need for MV did not differ significantly [(RR= 3.23, 95% CI 0.70-14.97) and (RR=1.27, 95%CI 0.7-2.13)] respectively. Mortality among the HCQ+AZM was more significantly higher than among the standard care (RR= 1.8, 95% CI 1.19-2.27). Conclusion: Despite the scarcity of published data of good quality, the effectiveness and safety of either HCQ alone or in combination with AZM in treating the pandemic of COVID-19 cannot be assured. Future randomized control trials need to be carried out to verify this conclusion.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ramy Mohamed Ghazy","author_inst":"High Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Abdallah Almaghraby","author_inst":"Alexandria Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ramy Shaaban","author_inst":"Utah State University"},{"author_name":"Ahmed Kamal","author_inst":"Alexandria Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hatem Beshir","author_inst":"Mansoura Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Amr Moursi","author_inst":"Ninewells University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sarah Hamed N.

We find that polio, Hemophilus influenzae type-B (HIB), measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), varicella, pneumococcal conjugate (PCV13), geriatric flu, and hepatitis A \/ hepatitis B (HepA-HepB) vaccines administered in the past 1, 2, and 5 years are associated with decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection rates, even after adjusting for geographic SARS-CoV-2 incidence and testing rates, demographics, comorbidities, and number of other vaccinations. Furthermore, age, race\/ethnicity, and blood group stratified analyses reveal significantly lower SARS-CoV-2 rate among black individuals who have taken the PCV13 vaccine, with relative risk of 0.45 at the 5 year time horizon (n: 653, 95% CI: (0.32, 0.64), p-value: 6.9e-05).

The assay detected bioavailable LIGHT unbound to the inhibitor Decoy receptor-3 (DcR3). Bioavailable LIGHT levels were elevated in patients both on and off ventilatory support, with a trend toward higher levels in patients requiring mechanical ventilation. In hospitalized patients over the age of 60, who exhibited a mortality rate of 82%, LIGHT levels were significantly higher (p=0.0209) in those who died compared to survivors. As previously reported, interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels were also elevated in these patients with significantly (p=0.0076) higher levels observed in patients who died vs. survivors, paralleling the LIGHT levels. Although attempts to block IL-6 binding to its receptor have shown limited effect in COVID-19 CRS, neutralization of LIGHT may prove to be more effective owing to its more central role in regulating antiviral immune responses.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David S Perlin","author_inst":"Hackensack Meridian Health, Center for Discovery and innovation, Nutley, NJ 07110"},{"author_name":"Inbal Zafir-Lavie","author_inst":"Cerecor Inc."},{"author_name":"Lori Roadcap","author_inst":"Cerecor Inc."},{"author_name":"Shane Raines","author_inst":"2b Analytics"},{"author_name":"Carl F Ware","author_inst":"Laboratory  of  Molecular  Immunology,  Sanford  Burnham  Prebys  Medical  Discovery  Institute"},{"author_name":"Garry A Neil","author_inst":"Cerecor Inc."},{"author_name":"John C O'Horo","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Gregory J Gores","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Amy W Williams","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"John Halamka","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Badley","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Venky Soundararajan","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Aguiar-Pulido","author_inst":"Center for Neurogenetics, Weill Cornell Medicine, Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Marcela C Giannini","author_inst":"Center of Research in Inflammatory Diseases (CRID), University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Leticia P Bonjorno","author_inst":"Center of Research in Inflammatory Diseases (CRID), University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Maria IF Lopes","author_inst":"Center of Research in Inflammatory Diseases (CRID), Divisions of Clinical Immunology;

In particular, the need for fine-grained predictions, based on real-time and fluctuating data, has highlighted the limitations of traditional SEIR models and parameter fitting, encouraging the study of new models for greater accuracy. In this paper we propose a novel approach to epidemiological parameter fitting and epidemic forecasting, based on an extended version of the SEIR compartmental model and on an auto-differentiation technique for partially observable ODEs (Ordinary Differential Equations). The results on publicly available data show that the proposed model is able to fit the daily cases curve with greater accuracy, obtaining also a lower forecast error. Furthermore, the forecast accuracy allows to predict the peak with an error margin of less than one week, up to 50 days before the peak happens.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stefano Giovanni Rizzo","author_inst":"Qatar Computing Reasearch Institute"},{"author_name":"Giovanna Vantini","author_inst":"Qatar Computing Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Mohamad Saad","author_inst":"Qatar Computing Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Chawla","author_inst":"Qatar Computing Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Carl F Ware","author_inst":"Laboratory  of  Molecular  Immunology,  Sanford  Burnham  Prebys  Medical  Discovery  Institute"},{"author_name":"Garry A Neil","author_inst":"Cerecor Inc."},{"author_name":"John C O'Horo","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Gregory J Gores","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Amy W Williams","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"John Halamka","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Badley","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Venky Soundararajan","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Aguiar-Pulido","author_inst":"Center for Neurogenetics, Weill Cornell Medicine, Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Marcela C Giannini","author_inst":"Center of Research in Inflammatory Diseases (CRID), University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Leticia P Bonjorno","author_inst":"Center of Research in Inflammatory Diseases (CRID), University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Maria IF Lopes","author_inst":"Center of Research in Inflammatory Diseases (CRID), Divisions of Clinical Immunology;

The symptoms of this disease vary widely. Depending on the symptoms an infected person is broadly classified into two categories namely, asymptomatic and symptomatic. Asymptomatic individuals display mild or no symptoms but continue to transmit the infection to otherwise healthy individuals. This particular aspect of asymptomatic infection poses a major obstacle in managing and controlling the transmission of the infectious disease. In this paper, we attempt to mathematically model the spread of COVID-19 in India under various intervention strategies. We consider SEIR type epidemiological models, incorporated with India specific social contact matrix representing contact structures among different age groups of the population. Impact of various factors such as presence of asymptotic individuals, lockdown strategies, social distancing practices, quarantine, and hospitalization on the disease transmission is extensively studied. Numerical simulation of our model is matched with the real COVID-19 data of India till May 15, 2020, for the purpose of estimating the model parameters. Our model with zone-wise lockdown is seen to give a decent prediction for July 20, 2020.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Madhab Barman","author_inst":"IIITDM Kancheepuram"},{"author_name":"Snigdhashree Nayak","author_inst":"IIITDM Kancheepuram"},{"author_name":"Manoj Kumar Yadav","author_inst":"Mahindra University, Hyderabad"},{"author_name":"Soumyendu Raha","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"},{"author_name":"Nachiketa Mishra","author_inst":"IIITDM Kancheepuram, Chennai, India"},{"author_name":"Garry A Neil","author_inst":"Cerecor Inc."},{"author_name":"John C O'Horo","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Gregory J Gores","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Amy W Williams","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"John Halamka","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Badley","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Venky Soundararajan","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Aguiar-Pulido","author_inst":"Center for Neurogenetics, Weill Cornell Medicine, Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Marcela C Giannini","author_inst":"Center of Research in Inflammatory Diseases (CRID), University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Leticia P Bonjorno","author_inst":"Center of Research in Inflammatory Diseases (CRID), University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Maria IF Lopes","author_inst":"Center of Research in Inflammatory Diseases (CRID), Divisions of Clinical Immunology;

The impacts on mortality are likely to vary across countries in magnitude, timing, and age and sex composition. Here, we applied an ensemble of 16 Bayesian probabilistic models to vital statistics data, by age group and sex, to consistently and comparably estimate the impacts of the first phase of the pandemic on all-cause mortality for 17 industrialised countries. The models accounted for factors that affect death rates including seasonality, temperature, and public holidays, as well as for medium-long-term secular trends and the dependency of death rates in each week on those in preceding week(s). From mid-February through the end of May 2020, an estimated 202,900 (95% credible interval 179,400-224,900) more people died in these 17 countries than would have had the pandemic not taken place. Nearly three quarters of these excess deaths occurred in England and Wales, Italy and Spain, where less than half of the total population of these countries live. When all-cause mortality is considered, the total number of deaths, deaths per 100,000 people, and relative increase in deaths were similar between men and women in most countries. Further, in many countries, the balance of excess deaths changed from male-dominated early in the pandemic to being equal or female-dominated later on. Taken over the entire first phase of the pandemic, there was no detectable rise in all-cause mortality in New Zealand, Bulgaria, Hungary, Norway, Denmark and Finland and for women in Austria and Switzerland (posterior probability of an increase in deaths <90%). Women in Portugal and men in Austria experienced relatively small increases in all-cause mortality, with posterior probabilities of 90-99%. For men in Switzerland and Portugal, and both sexes in the Netherlands, France, Sweden, Belgium, Italy, Scotland, Spain and England and Wales, all-cause mortality increased as a result of the pandemic with a posterior probability >99%. After accounting for population size, England and Wales and Spain experienced the highest death toll, nearly 100 deaths per 100,000 people; they also had the largest relative (percent) increase in deaths (37% (95% credible interval 30-44) in England and Wales; 38% (31-44) in Spain). New Zealand, Bulgaria, Hungary, Norway, Denmark and Finland experienced changes in deaths that ranged from possible slight declines to increases of no more than 5%. The large impact in England and Wales stems partly from having experienced (together with Spain) the highest weekly increases in deaths, more than doubling in some weeks, and having had (together with Sweden) the longest duration when deaths exceeded levels that would be expected in the absence of the pandemic. The heterogeneous magnitude and character of the excess deaths due to the Covid-19 pandemic reflect differences in how well countries have managed the pandemic (e.g., timing, extent and adherence to lockdowns and other social distancing measures; effectiveness of test, trace and isolate mechanisms), and the resilience and preparedness of the health and social care system (e.g., effective facility and community care pathways; minimising spread of infection within hospitals and care homes, and between them and the community).","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vasilis Kontis","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James E Bennett","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Theo Rashid","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Robbie M Parks","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Pearson-Stuttard","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Michel Guillot","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Perviz Asaria","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Bin Zhou","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Marco Battaglini","author_inst":"Italian National Institute of Statistics"},{"author_name":"Gianni Corsetti","author_inst":"Italian National Institute of Statistics"},{"author_name":"Martin McKee","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mariachiara Di Cesare","author_inst":"Middlesex University London"},{"author_name":"Colin D Mathers","author_inst":"Independent Researcher"},{"author_name":"Majid Ezzati","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Leticia P Bonjorno","author_inst":"Center of Research in Inflammatory Diseases (CRID), University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Maria IF Lopes","author_inst":"Center of Research in Inflammatory Diseases (CRID), Divisions of Clinical Immunology;

This outbreak represents a serious threat to the lives and health of people all around the world. The epidemic first broke out in Wuhan, where the Chinese government was unable to prevent the spread of the disease by implementing home quarantine measures. Mobile cabin hospitals were used to relieve pressure on hospitals due to the need for beds while also isolating the sources of the infection through a centralized quarantine and treatment of mild cases. Method: This paper reviewed and summarized the treatment of patients with mild illness and symptoms during the period from the construction to the closing of the Hanyang Mobile Cabin Hospital in Wuhan, China, and presented the operational elements and possible improvements of running this hospital. Results: Mobile cabin hospitals helped China to curb the epidemic in only 2 incubation periods in 28 days.The basic conditions required for a normal operation of mobile cabin hospitals included the selection of the environment, medical staff to patient ratio, organizational structure, management model, admission criteria, treatment approaches, discharge process, livelihood guarantee, security, and other safeguarding measures. All of these components were performed carefully in Wuhan Hanyang Mobile Cabin Hospital, without medical staff being infected.

Although diagnostic coding change in response to financial incentives is well documented, no study has examined the association of QM with SARS-CoV-2 cause-of-death attribution (CODA). Calculations of excess all-cause deaths overlook the importance of accurate CODA and of distinguishing policy-related from virus-related mortality. Objective: Examine CODA, overall and for QM and non-QM diagnoses, in 3 pandemic periods: awareness (January 19-March 14), height (March 15-May 16), and late (May 17-June 20). Methods: Retrospective analysis of publicly available national weekly COD data, adjusted for population growth and reporting lags, October 2014-June 20, 2020. CODA in 5 pre-pandemic influenza seasons was compared with 2019-20. Suitability of the data to distinguish policy-related from virus-related effects was assessed. Results: Following federal guidance permitting SARS-CoV-2 CODA without laboratory testing, mortality from the QM diagnoses cancer and chronic lower respiratory disease declined steadily relative to prior-season means, reaching 4.4% less and 12.1% less, respectively, in late pandemic. Deaths for non-QM diagnoses increased, by 21.0% for Alzheimers disease and 29.0% for diabetes during pandemic height. Increases in competing CODs over historical experience, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 underreporting, more than offset declines during pandemic height. However, in the late-pandemic period, declines slightly numerically exceeded increases, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 overreporting. In pandemic-height and late-pandemic periods, respectively, only 83.5% and 69.7% of increases in all-cause deaths were explained by changes in the reported CODs, including SARS-CoV-2, preventing assessment of policy-related mortality or of factors contributing to increased all-cause deaths. Conclusions: Substitution of SARS-CoV-2 for competing CODs may have occurred, particularly for QM diagnoses and late in the pandemic. Continued monitoring of these trends, qualitative research on pandemic CODA, and the addition of place-of-death data and psychiatric CODs to the file would facilitate assessment of policy-related and virus-related effects on mortality.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kathleen A.

Public health practices currently represent the primary interventions for managing the spread of the pandemic. We hypothesized that frequent, longitudinal workplace disease surveillance would represent an effective approach to controlling SARS-CoV-2 transmission among employees and their household members, reducing potential economic consequences and loss of productivity of standard isolation methods, while providing new insights into viral-host dynamics. Methodology and Findings On March 23, 2020 a clinical study (OCIS-05) was initiated at a small Southern California organization. Results from the first 3 months of the ongoing study are presented here. Study participants (27 employees and 27 household members) consented to provide frequent nasal or oral swab samples that were analyzed by RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using CDC protocols. Only participants testing negative were allowed to enter the \"safe zone\" workplace facility. Optional blood samples were collected at baseline and throughout the 3-month study. Serum virus-specific antibody concentrations (IgG, IgM, and IgA) were measured using a selective, sensitive, and quantitative ELISA assay developed in house. A COVID-19 infection model, based on traditional SEIR compartmental models combined with Bayesian non-linear mixed models and modern machine learning, was used to predict the number of employees and household members who would have become infected in the absence of workplace surveillance. Two study participants were found to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 during the study. One subject, a household member, tested positive clinically by RT-qPCR prior to enrollment and experienced typical COVID-19 symptoms that did not require hospitalization. While on study, the participant was SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive for at least 71 days and had elevated virus-specific antibody concentrations (medians: IgM, 9.83 ug mL-1; IgG, 11.5 ug mL-1; IgA, 1.29 ug mL-1) in serum samples collected at three timepoints. A single, unrelated employee became positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA over the course of the study, but remained asymptomatic with low associated viral RNA copy numbers. The participant did not have detectable serum IgM and IgG concentrations, and IgA concentrations decayed rapidly (half-life: 1.3 d). The employee was not allowed entry to the safe zone workplace until testing negative three consecutive times over 7 d. No other employees or household members contracted COVID-19 over the course of the study. Our model predicted that under the current prevalence in Los Angeles County without surveillance intervention, up to 7 employees (95% CI = 3-10) would have become infected with at most 1 of them requiring hospitalizations and 0 deaths. Conclusions Our clinical study met its primary objectives by using intense longitudinal testing to provide a safe work environment during the COVID-19 pandemic, and elucidating SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in recovering and asymptomatic participants. The surveillance plan outlined here is scalable and transferrable. The study represents a powerful example on how an innovative public health initiative can be dovetailed with scientific discovery.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Manjula Gunawardana","author_inst":"Oak Crest Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Jessica Breslin","author_inst":"Oak Crest Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"John M Cortez","author_inst":"Oak Crest Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Sofia Rivera","author_inst":"Oak Crest Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Simon Webster","author_inst":"Oak Crest Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"F Javier Ibarrondo","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Otto O Yang","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Richard B Pyles","author_inst":"UTMB"},{"author_name":"Christina M Ramirez","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Amy P Adler","author_inst":"Jumpstart Research Consulting"},{"author_name":"Peter A Anton","author_inst":"Oak Crest Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Marc M Baum","author_inst":"Oak Crest Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Xin Qian","author_inst":"Shengli Clinical Medical College of Fujian Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xinghai Yang","author_inst":"Hubei Women and Children hospital"},{"author_name":"Leticia P Bonjorno","author_inst":"Center of Research in Inflammatory Diseases (CRID), University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Maria IF Lopes","author_inst":"Center of Research in Inflammatory Diseases (CRID), Divisions of Clinical Immunology;
