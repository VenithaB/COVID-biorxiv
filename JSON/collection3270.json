Here we report the potential breath-borne volatile organic compound (VOC) biomarkers for COVID-19. Higher levels of ethyl butanoate were detected in exhaled breath of COVID-19 patients (N=10) than healthy controls\/health care workers (N=21), lung cancer (LC) patients (N=7) and backgrounds. In contrast, breath-borne butyraldehyde and isopropanol (an efficient SARS-CoV-2 inactivation agent) were significantly higher for non-COVID-19 respiratory infections (URTI) (N=22) than COVID-19, HC, LC patients and backgrounds. Breath-borne isopropanol emission from COVID-19 patients varied greatly up to ~100-fold difference. COVID-19 patients had lower acetone levels than other subjects, except LC patients. The monitoring of ethyl butanoate, butyraldehyde and isopropanol could lend considerable support in rapidly screening COVID-19; and alerting the presence of COVID-19 patient in particular environments.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Haoxuan Chen","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Xiao Qi","author_inst":"Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Chaoyang District of Beijing, Beijing, China."},{"author_name":"Jianxin Ma","author_inst":"Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Chaoyang District of Beijing, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Chunyang Zhang","author_inst":"Respiratory Department of the Sixth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huasong Feng","author_inst":"Respiratory Department of the Sixth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maosheng Yao","author_inst":"Peking University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.23.20138289","rel_title":"Longitudinal immunological analyses reveal inflammatory misfiring in severe COVID-19 patients","rel_date":"2020-06-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.23.20138289","rel_abs":"Recent studies have provided insights into the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)1-4. Yet, longitudinal immunological correlates of disease outcome remain unclear. Here, we serially analysed immune responses in 113 COVID-19 patients with moderate (non-ICU) and severe (ICU) disease. Immune profiling revealed an overall increase in innate cell lineages with a concomitant reduction in T cell number. We identify an association between early, elevated cytokines and worse disease outcomes. Following an early increase in cytokines, COVID-19 patients with moderate disease displayed a progressive reduction in type-1 (antiviral) and type-3 (antifungal) responses. In contrast, patients with severe disease maintained these elevated responses throughout the course of disease. Moreover, severe disease was accompanied by an increase in multiple type 2 (anti-helminths) effectors including, IL-5, IL-13, IgE and eosinophils. Unsupervised clustering analysis of plasma and peripheral blood leukocyte data identified 4 immune signatures, representing (A) growth factors, (B) type-2\/3 cytokines, (C) mixed type-1\/2\/3 cytokines, and (D) chemokines that correlated with three distinct disease trajectories of patients. The immune profile of patients who recovered with moderate disease was enriched in tissue reparative growth factor signature (A), while the profile for those with worsened disease trajectory had elevated levels of all four signatures. Thus, we identified development of a maladapted immune response profile associated with severe COVID-19 outcome and early immune signatures that correlate with divergent disease trajectories.","rel_num_authors":38,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carolina Lucas","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Patrick Wong","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Jon Klein","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Tiago Castro","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Julio Silva","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Maria Sundaram","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Mallory Ellingson","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Tianyang Mao","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Jieun Oh","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Israelow","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Maria Tokuyama","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Peiwen Lu","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Arvind Venkataraman","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Annsea Park","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Subhasis Mohanty","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Haowei Wang","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Anne Louise Wyllie","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Chantal B.F.

Our model demonstrates that effective containment of pandemic progression in densely populated cities is achieved only by combining social distancing and widespread testing for quarantining of infected subjects. Our results suggest that extreme social distancing without intensive testing is ineffective in extinguishing COVID-19. This finding has profound epidemiological significance and sheds light on the controversy regarding the relative effectiveness of widespread testing and social distancing. Our simple epidemiological simulator is also useful for assessing the efficacy of governmental\/societal responses to an outbreak.

University administrators are now facing decisions about how to safely return students, staff and faculty to campus. To provide a framework to evaluate various strategies, we developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) type of deterministic compartmental transmission model of SARS-CoV-2 among students, staff and faculty. Our goals were to support the immediate pandemic planning at our own university, and to provide a flexible modeling framework to inform the planning efforts at similar academic institutions. We parameterized the model for our institution, Emory University, a medium-size private university in Atlanta, Georgia. Control strategies of isolation and quarantine are initiated by screening (regardless of symptoms) or testing (of symptomatic individuals). We explore a range of screening and testing frequencies and perform a probabilistic sensitivity analysis of input parameters. We find that monthly and weekly screening can reduce cumulative incidence by 42% and 80% in students, respectively, while testing with a 2-, 4- and 7-day delay results in an 88%, 79% and 67% reduction in cumulative incidence in students over the semester, respectively. Similar reductions are observed among staff and faculty. A testing strategy requires far fewer diagnostic assays to be implemented than a screening assay. Our intervention model is conservative in that we assume a fairly high reproductive number that is not reduced through social distancing measures. We find that community-introduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection onto campus can be controlled with effective testing, isolation, contract tracing and quarantine, but that cases, hospitalization, and (in some scenarios) deaths may still occur. In addition to estimating health impacts, this model can help to predict the resource requirements in terms of diagnostic capacity and isolation\/quarantine facilities associated with different strategies.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Benjamin Lopman","author_inst":"Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University"},{"author_name":"Carol Liu","author_inst":"Emory University Rollins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Adrien Le Guillou","author_inst":"Emory University Rollins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Andreas Handel","author_inst":"University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Timothy L Lash","author_inst":"Emory University Rollins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Alexander Isakov","author_inst":"Emory University Rollins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Samuel Jenness","author_inst":"Emory University Rollins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Pallavi Bhargava","author_inst":"Henry Ford Hospital System"},{"author_name":"Tanu Singhal","author_inst":"Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital and Medical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Israelow","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Maria Tokuyama","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Peiwen Lu","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Arvind Venkataraman","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Annsea Park","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Subhasis Mohanty","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Haowei Wang","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Anne Louise Wyllie","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Chantal B.F.

With our study we aimed to understand the diffusion of the infection by mass seroprevalence screening. Methods We searched for SARS-CoV-2 IgGs in the entire voluntary population using lateral flow immune-cromatographic tests on capillary blood (rapid tests). We then performed chemioluminescent serological assays (CLIA) and naso-pharyngeal swabs in a randomized representative sample of 562 subjects and in every subject with a positive rapid test. Results Based on CLIA serologies on the representative random sample (509 subjects), we estimated a 23% IgG seroprevalence. We also found a strong correlation between age and prevalence, with the elderly showing the highest probability of a positive serological test. Conclusions In an area of unrestricted viral circulation less than one-fourth of the population tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Seroprevalence increased with increasing age, possibly suggesting differences in susceptibility to the infection.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gabriele Pagani","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Federico Conti","author_inst":"Universita' Degli Studi Di Milano"},{"author_name":"Andrea Giacomelli","author_inst":"ASST-FBF-Sacco, University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Dario Bernacchia","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Rossana Rondanin","author_inst":"Medispa"},{"author_name":"Andrea Prina","author_inst":"Medispa"},{"author_name":"Vittore Scolari","author_inst":"Institut Curie - Sorbonne Universite'"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Eugenia Gandolfi","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Silvana Castaldi","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Marano","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Cosimo Ottomano","author_inst":"Synlab Italia"},{"author_name":"Patrizia Boracchi","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Elia Mario Biganzoli","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Subhasis Mohanty","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Haowei Wang","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Anne Louise Wyllie","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Chantal B.F.

In this study we propose a birth-and-death model for predicting the number of COVID-19 active cases. It relation to the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model has been discussed. An explicit expression for the expected number of active cases helps us to identify a stationary point on the infection curve, where the infection ceases increasing. Parameters of the model are estimated by fitting the expressions for active and total reported cases simultaneously.

The spread of infectious viral diseases occur over a connected social network. Specifically, the goal was to understand the effect of network topology and lockdown strategies on disease spreading dynamics. To explore the effect of topology we assumed the social network over which the disease spreads to have small-world or scale-free properties characterized by a rewiring probability and degree distribution respectively. Lockdowns were simulated as intervention strategies that modified the spreading dynamics of infection over a given graph structure through changes in properties of agent interaction. Lockdown efficacy was assessed by the maximum number of infections recorded during a simulation run. Thereafter, lockdown efficacy was evaluated as a function of lockdown start times and duration. Thus, we propose that ABM approach can be used to assess various lockdown strategies that aim to prevent breakdown of medical infrastructure while accounting for realistic social network configurations specific to a local population.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anagh Pathak","author_inst":"National Brain Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Varun Madan Mohan","author_inst":"National Brain Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Arpan Banerjee","author_inst":"National Brain Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Thomas A Trikalinos","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Nikolaos K Trichakis","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Dimitris Bertsimas","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Vittore Scolari","author_inst":"Institut Curie - Sorbonne Universite'"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Eugenia Gandolfi","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Silvana Castaldi","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Marano","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Cosimo Ottomano","author_inst":"Synlab Italia"},{"author_name":"Patrizia Boracchi","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Elia Mario Biganzoli","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Subhasis Mohanty","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Haowei Wang","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Anne Louise Wyllie","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Chantal B.F.

This study explored the knowledge of the population of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) about COVID-19 preventive measures and their belief about the consumption of herbal products for the prevention of COVID-19 infection. A total of 5,258 individuals participated in this study. Participants knowledge about the appropriate COVID-19 preventive measures in terms of handwashing procedures, self-quarantine and social distancing was moderate, with a mean score of 5.5 (SD: 1.7) out of 10 (representing around 55.0% of the total score). About 22.1% (n= 1,161) of the participants reported that they have used herbal products or nutritional supplements during the pandemic period, to protect themselves from the disease. Social media and the Internet (39.4%, n= 372) were the main motivators for the participants to try herbal products. Vitamin C was the most commonly used food supplement to increase immunity and reduces the chance of contracting COVID-19. Our study demonstrated that the general population in Saudi Arabia has a moderate level of knowledge about COVID-19 transmission and preventive measures. A considerable proportion of the population reported the use of herbal products or food supplements in order to protect themselves from the disease. Policymakers are suggested to provide further educational campaigns that increase population knowledge about the disease transmission routes and preventive measures. In addition, the use of herbal products should be evidence-based to ensure patient safety.","rel_num_authors":0,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anagh Pathak","author_inst":"National Brain Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Varun Madan Mohan","author_inst":"National Brain Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Arpan Banerjee","author_inst":"National Brain Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Thomas A Trikalinos","author_inst":"Brown University"},{"author_name":"Nikolaos K Trichakis","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Dimitris Bertsimas","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Vittore Scolari","author_inst":"Institut Curie - Sorbonne Universite'"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Eugenia Gandolfi","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Silvana Castaldi","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Marano","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Cosimo Ottomano","author_inst":"Synlab Italia"},{"author_name":"Patrizia Boracchi","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Elia Mario Biganzoli","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Milano"},{"author_name":"Subhasis Mohanty","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Haowei Wang","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Anne Louise Wyllie","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Chantal B.F.

To estimate COVID-19 infection incidence rate with severe affectation (requiring hospitalization) in patients with biological treatment due to rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), spondyloarthritis (SpA), psoriasis (Ps), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and compare it with incidence rate in the general population. Methods: Retrospective observational study based on information provided by two administrative databases. One of these two databases contains information on all patients seen in our hospital and diagnosed with COVID-19 infection between March 4th 2020 and April 26th 2020. The other database contains data from patients seen at Rheumatology, Dermatology and Digestive Departments in our hospital who are currently receiving biological therapy. We calculated the crude and age and sex adjusted incidence in both groups. To compare both groups we calculated the Incidence Rate Ratio. Results: There was a total of 2,182 patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalization. Four patients out of a total of 797 patients receiving biological therapy had contracted COVID-19 and required hospital care. Crude incidence rate of COVID-19 requiring hospital care among the general population was 1.41%, and it was 0.50% among the group receiving biological therapy. Rates adjusted by age and sex in the biological group was 0.45% (CI95% 0.11-4.13). The IRR of the group receiving biological therapy compared to the general population was 0.39 (CI95% 0.14-1, p=0.049). Conclusion: Findings suggest that prior use of biological therapy does not associate with severe manifestations of COVID-19, and it is likely to have a protective effect against them when compared to the general population.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ramon Mazzucchelli","author_inst":"Rheumatology Unit.

In this meta-analysis, we studied the prevalence of cancer among patients with COVID-19 infection and their risks of severe events. Methods We searched the Pubmed, Embase and MedRxiv databases for studies between December 2019 and May 3, 2020 using the following key words and terms: sars-cov-2, covid-19, 2019-ncov, 2019 novel coronavirus, corona virus disease-2019, clinical, clinical characteristics, clinical course, epidemiologic features, epidemiology, and epidemiological characteristics. We extracted data following PICO (patient, intervention, comparison and outcome) chart. Statistical analyses were performed with R Studio (version 3.5.1) on the group-level data. We assessed the studies risk of bias in accordance to the adjusted Joanna Briggs Institute. We estimated the prevalence or risks for severe events including admission into intensive care unit or death using meta-analysis with random effects. Findings Out of the 2,551 studies identified, 32 studies comprising 21,248 participants have confirmed COVID-19. The total prevalence of cancer in COVID-19 patients was 3.97% (95% CI, 3.08% to 5.12%), higher than that of the total cancer rate (0.29%) in China. Stratification analysis showed that the overall cancer prevalence of COVID-19 patients in China was 2.59% (95% CI, 1.72% to 3.90%), and the prevalence reached 3.79% in Wuhan (95% CI, 2.51% to 5.70%) and 2.31% (95% CI, 1.16% to 4.57%) in other areas outside Wuhan in China. The incidence of ICU admission in cancer patients with COVID-19 was 26.80% (95% CI, 21.65% to 32.67%) and the mortality was 24.32% (95% CI, 13.95% to 38.91%), much higher than the overall rates of COVID-19 patients in China. The fatality in COVID patients with cancer was lower than those with cardiovascular disease (OR 0.49; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.71; p=0.39), but comparable with other comorbidities such as diabetes (OR 1.32; 95% CI, 0.42 to 4.11; p=0.19), hypertension (OR 1.27; 95% CI, 0.35 to 4.62; p=0.13), and respiratory diseases (OR 0.79; 95% CI, 0.47 to 1.33; p=0.45). Interpretation This comprehensive meta-analysis on the largest number of patients to date provides solid evidence that COVID-19 infection significantly and negatively affected the disease course and prognosis of cancer patients. Awareness of this could help guide clinicians and health policy makers in combating cancer in the context of COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qiang Su","author_inst":"Department of Oncology,Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jie-xuan Hu","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hai-shan Lin","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Gastroenterology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Emily C Zhu","author_inst":"McCoy College of Business, Texas State University, 601 University Dr."},{"author_name":"Chen-guang Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Di-ya Wang","author_inst":"Department of Radiation Oncology, University of California"},{"author_name":"Zu-hua Gao","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Research Institute of McGill University Health Center"},{"author_name":"Bang-wei Cao","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pilar Lopez-Serrano","author_inst":"Digestive Unit.

Speculations have circulated that exposure to major epidemics helped health systems respond more quickly to COVID-19. This study leverages organizational memory theory to test whether health systems with any, more severe, more recent exposure to major epidemics enacted timelier COVID-19 policy responses. Methods: A dataset was constructed cataloguing 719 policies across 177 health systems in total, 12 of which had major epidemics within the last twenty years. Hypotheses testing used cluster robust regressions with WHO region fixed effects, controlling for several health system expenditure and political variables. Results: Results show that exposure to any major epidemics was nearly significant (p = 0.07) with approximately 20 days earlier response. As the number of total cases from major epidemics increase by one, this was associated with 0.0028 day earlier response (p < 0.001). A decrease of one year from last major epidemics was also associated with 0.4020 day earlier response (p < 0.001). Conclusion: This study suggests that health systems do learn from past major epidemics. Policymakers ought to institutionalize lessons from COVID-19 to prevent erosion of organizational memory, and learn from other more severely affected health systems. Future studies can examine specific generalizable lessons and whether timelier responses correlated with lower health and economic impacts.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sian Hsiang-Te Tsuei","author_inst":"Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Jie-xuan Hu","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hai-shan Lin","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Gastroenterology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Emily C Zhu","author_inst":"McCoy College of Business, Texas State University, 601 University Dr."},{"author_name":"Chen-guang Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Di-ya Wang","author_inst":"Department of Radiation Oncology, University of California"},{"author_name":"Zu-hua Gao","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Research Institute of McGill University Health Center"},{"author_name":"Bang-wei Cao","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pilar Lopez-Serrano","author_inst":"Digestive Unit.

We consider preventive measures such as implementation of social distancing and lockdown in a city, as well as the effect of protective gears or practices. The chance of travelling to another city and within the city during lockdown, and initial percentage of exposed and infected individuals on both cities influence the increase in the number of newly-infected individuals on both models. Our simulations show that (i) increase in exposed individuals results in increase in number of new infections, hence the need for increased testing-isolation efforts; (ii) protection level of 75-100% effectiveness impedes disease transmission; (iii) travelling within city or to other city can be an option given that strict preventive measures (e.g., non-pharmaceutical interventions) are observed; and (iv) the ideal set-up for neighboring cities is to implement lockdown when there is high risk of disease local transmission while individuals observe social distancing, maximizing protective measures, and isolating those that are exposed. The results of the agent-based and compartmental models show similar qualitative dynamics; the differences are due to different spatio-temporal heterogeneity and stochasticity. These models can aid decision makers in designing infectious disease-related policies to protect individuals while continuing population movement.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christian Alvin H Buhat","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Destiny SM Lutero","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Yancee H Olave","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Monica C Torres","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Jomar F Rabajante","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Chen-guang Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Di-ya Wang","author_inst":"Department of Radiation Oncology, University of California"},{"author_name":"Zu-hua Gao","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Research Institute of McGill University Health Center"},{"author_name":"Bang-wei Cao","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pilar Lopez-Serrano","author_inst":"Digestive Unit.

A comprehensive review on this topic is important to highlight the areas for improvement and interventions to prevent COVID-19. Thus, the purpose of this study was to summarize the level of KAP about COVID-19 via a systematic review Methods: A systematic literature search was performed using a combination of selected keywords in four scientific databases to identify relevant literature published from January 1 to May 31, 2020. Nineteen articles were included in the systematic review, and sixteen studies in the meta-analysis. The data was analyzed using a random-effects model due to the heterogeneity between the studies. Results: Lack of COVID-19-related knowledge, positive perceptions, and preventive practices were detected and seems widespread. In particular, 56.6% (95%CI: 45.9-67%) of the health care workers (HCWs) and medical students had poor knowledge about COVID-19 and only 46% (95%CI: 15-77) of the total study sample had positive perceptions towards COVID-19. Besides, 81.7% of the sample prioritized practicing hand hygiene to prevent COVID-19, but wearing a face mask to prevent COVID-19 transmission was suboptimal (73.4%). Finally, around eighty percent of the subjects had good knowledge about COVID-19 symptoms (79%) and its transmission (82%) and reported that they avoided crowded places to prevent getting COVID-19 (89%). Conclusion: Evidence-based practices on risk communication and raising awareness should be planned by local governments in collaboration with healthcare organizations. Specifically, educational initiatives for HCWs to prioritize wearing a face mask and practicing hand hygiene should be considered a priority.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Akshaya Srikanth Bhagavathula","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, United Arab Emirates University"},{"author_name":"Wafa Ali Aldhaleei","author_inst":"Sheikh Shakhbout Medical City"},{"author_name":"Jamal Rahmani","author_inst":"Department of Community Nutrition, Faculty of Nutrition and Food Technology, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Jagdish Khubchandani","author_inst":"Department of Nutrition and Health Science, College of Health, Ball State University, Indiana, USA"},{"author_name":"Jomar F Rabajante","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Chen-guang Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Di-ya Wang","author_inst":"Department of Radiation Oncology, University of California"},{"author_name":"Zu-hua Gao","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Research Institute of McGill University Health Center"},{"author_name":"Bang-wei Cao","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pilar Lopez-Serrano","author_inst":"Digestive Unit.

In anticipation that the recurrence of outbreaks and the measures for lifting the lockdown worldwide may cause supply chain issues over the coming months, we assessed the sensitivity of a number of one-step retrotranscription and quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) solutions to detect SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We evaluated six different RT-qPCR alternatives for SARS-CoV-2\/COVID-19 diagnosis based on standard RNA extractions. That of best sensitivity was also assessed with direct nasopharyngeal swab viral transmission medium (VTM) heating, overcoming the RNA extraction step. Results: We found a wide variability in the sensitivity of RT-qPCR solutions that associated with a range of false negatives from as low as 2% (0.3-7.9%) to as much as 39.8% (30.2-50.2). Direct preheating of VTM combined with the best solution provided a sensitivity of 72.5% (62.5-81.0), in the range of some of the solutions based on standard RNA extractions. Conclusions: We evidenced sensitivity limitations of currently used RT-qPCR solutions. Our results will help to calibrate the impact of false negative diagnoses of COVID-19, and to detect and control new SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks and community transmissions.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julia Alcoba-Florez","author_inst":"Servicio de Microbiologia, Hospital Universitario N.

Objectives: To explore the associations of air pollutants and meteorological factors with COVID-19 confirmed cases across 31 Chinese provinces during the outbreak period. Methods: The number of COVID-19 confirmed cases, air pollutant concentrations and meteorological factors in 31 Chinese provinces from January 25 to February 29, 2020 were extracted from authoritative electronic databases. The associations were estimated for a single-day lag (lag0-lag6) as well as moving averages lag (lag01-lag05) using generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs), adjusted for time trends, day of the week, holidays and meteorological variables. Region-specific analyses and meta-analysis were conducted in five selected regions with diverse air pollution levels and weather conditions. Nonlinear exposure-response analyses were performed. Results: We examined 77,578 COVID-19 confirmed cases across 31 Chinese provinces during the study period. An increase of each interquartile range in PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, O3 and CO at lag4 corresponded to 1.40 (1.37-1.43), 1.35 (1.32-1.37), 1.01 (1.00-1.02), 1.08 (1.07-1.10), 1.28 (1.27-1.29) and 1.26 (1.24-1.28) odds ratios (ORs) of daily COVID-19 confirmed new cases, respectively. For 1 oc, 1% and 1 m\/s increase in temperature, relative humidity and wind velocity, the ORs were 0.97 (0.97-0.98), 0.96 (0.96-0.97), and 0.94 (0.92-0.95), respectively. The estimates of PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and all meteorological factors remained statistically significant after meta-analysis for the five selected regions. The exposure-response relationships showed that higher concentrations of air pollutants and lower meteorological factors were associated with daily COVID-19 confirmed new cases increasing. Conclusions: Higher air pollutant concentrations and lower temperature, relative humidity and wind velocity may favor COVID-19 transmission. As summer months are arriving in the Northern Hemisphere, the environmental factors and implementation of public health control measures may play an optimistic role in controlling COVID-19 epidemic.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Han Cao","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, and Beijing Municipal Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemio"},{"author_name":"Bingxiao Li","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, and Beijing Municipal Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemio"},{"author_name":"Tianlun Gu","author_inst":"Department of Customer Advisory, SAS institute, Inc., Beijing, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaohui Liu","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, and Beijing Municipal Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemio"},{"author_name":"Kai Meng","author_inst":"Department of Health Management and Policy, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."},{"author_name":"Ling ZHANG","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, and Beijing Municipal Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemio"},{"author_name":"Carlos Flores","author_inst":"Research Unit, Hospital Universitario N.S. de Candelaria"},{"author_name":"Zu-hua Gao","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Research Institute of McGill University Health Center"},{"author_name":"Bang-wei Cao","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pilar Lopez-Serrano","author_inst":"Digestive Unit.

Despite the strict lockdown measures in several developing countries, the number of newly infected cases is getting unbridled as time progresses. This anomaly ignites questions about the effectiveness of the prolonged strict confinement measures. In light of the above view, with an aim to find the answer to this question, trends of four epidemiological parameters: growth factor of daily reported COVID-19 cases, daily incidence proportion, daily cumulative index and effective reproduction number in five developing countries named Bangladesh, Brazil, Chile, Pakistan and South Africa have been analysed meticulously considering the different phases of their national lockdowns. Any compelling evidence has not been found in favor of country-wide lockdown effectiveness in the above-mentioned countries. Numerical results illustrate that stringent nationwide lockdown measures have failed bringing the epidemic threshold (Re) of COVID-19 under unity. In addition, citizens of the aforementioned countries have been struggling with catastrophic socio-economic consequences due to prolonged confinement measures.

Based on the simulations, approaches are proposed at this more advanced phase of the pandemic, which might generate effectiveness at the actions of society in general, in a way that those actions could generate effective and efficient results, and this means a more organized war against this pandemic, a better way to induce the economy resumption, and also to create a more intense public awareness on the contamination hubs and surges that may emerge due to the reduction of social isolation.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"ALTAIR SOUZA DE ASSIS","author_inst":"Private Investigator (Fluminense Federal University - retired) - Doctor of Science"},{"author_name":"Vinicius JOW de Carvalho","author_inst":"Private Investigator"},{"author_name":"Tianlun Gu","author_inst":"Department of Customer Advisory, SAS institute, Inc., Beijing, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaohui Liu","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, and Beijing Municipal Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemio"},{"author_name":"Kai Meng","author_inst":"Department of Health Management and Policy, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."},{"author_name":"Ling ZHANG","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, and Beijing Municipal Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemio"},{"author_name":"Carlos Flores","author_inst":"Research Unit, Hospital Universitario N.S. de Candelaria"},{"author_name":"Zu-hua Gao","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Research Institute of McGill University Health Center"},{"author_name":"Bang-wei Cao","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pilar Lopez-Serrano","author_inst":"Digestive Unit.

Accordingly, it has been hypothesized that it may have a protective effect against COVID-19. Recent research found that countries with universal BCG childhood vaccination policies tend to be less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, such ecological studies are biased by numerous confounders. Instead, this paper takes advantage of a rare nationwide natural experiment that took place in Sweden in 1975, where discontinuation of newborns BCG vaccination led to a dramatic fall of the BCG coverage rate from 92% to 2% , thus allowing us to estimate the BCG's effect without all the biases associated with cross-country comparisons. Methods Numbers of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations were recorded for birth cohorts born just before and just after that change, representing 1,026,304 and 1,018,544 individuals, respectively. We used regression discontinuity to assess the effect of BCG vaccination on Covid-19 related outcomes. This method used on such a large population allows for a high precision that would be hard to achieve using a classical randomized controlled trial. Results The odds ratio for Covid-19 cases and Covid-19 related hospitalizations were 0.9997 (CI95: [0.8002-1.1992]) and 1.1931 (CI95: [0.7558-1.6304]), respectively. We can thus reject with 95% confidence that universal BCG vaccination reduces the number of cases by more than 20% and the number of hospitalizations by more than 24% Conclusions While the effect of a recent vaccination must be evaluated, we provide strong evidence that receiving the BCG vaccine at birth does not have a protective effect against COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Clement de Chaisemartin","author_inst":"UC Santa Barbara"},{"author_name":"Luc de Chaisemartin","author_inst":"Immunology Department, APHP Nord-Universite de Paris, Bichat Hospital, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Tianlun Gu","author_inst":"Department of Customer Advisory, SAS institute, Inc., Beijing, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaohui Liu","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, and Beijing Municipal Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemio"},{"author_name":"Kai Meng","author_inst":"Department of Health Management and Policy, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."},{"author_name":"Ling ZHANG","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, and Beijing Municipal Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemio"},{"author_name":"Carlos Flores","author_inst":"Research Unit, Hospital Universitario N.S. de Candelaria"},{"author_name":"Zu-hua Gao","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Research Institute of McGill University Health Center"},{"author_name":"Bang-wei Cao","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pilar Lopez-Serrano","author_inst":"Digestive Unit.

Here we present a rapid, robust, highly sensitive and versatile RT-LAMP based SARS-CoV-2 detection assay. Our forty-minute procedure bypasses a dedicated RNA isolation step, is insensitive to carry-over contamination, and uses a hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB)-based colorimetric readout, which allows robust SARS-CoV-2 detection from various sample types. Based on this assay we have substantially increased sensitivity and scalability by a simple nucleic acid enrichment step (bead-LAMP), established a pipette-free version for home testing (HomeDip-LAMP), and developed a version with open source enzymes that could be produced in any molecular biology setting. Our advanced, universally applicable RT-LAMP assay is a major step towards population-scale SARS-CoV-2 testing.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Max J Kellner","author_inst":"IMP, IMBA and LMB"},{"author_name":"James J Ross","author_inst":"IMBA, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Jakob Schnabl","author_inst":"IMBA, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Marcus P.S.

There is a hyperinflammatory response involved in the clinical course of patients with pneumonia due to SARS-CoV2. To date, there has been no definite therapy for COVID-19. We reviewed the charts of SARS-CoV2 patients with pneumonia and moderate to severely elevated CRP and worsening hypoxemia who were treated with early, short-term dexamethasone. Methods: We describe a series of 21 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV2 and were admitted to The Miriam Hospital in Providence and were treated with a short course of dexamethasone, either alone or in addition to current investigative therapies. Results: CRP levels decreased significantly following the start of dexamethasone from mean initial levels of 129.52 to 40.73 mg\/L at time of discharge. 71% percent of the patients were discharged home with a mean length of stay of 7.8 days. None of the patients had escalation of care, leading to mechanical ventilation. Two patients were transferred to inpatient hospice facilities on account of persistent hypoxemia, in line with their documented goals of care. Conclusions: A short course of systemic corticosteroids among inpatients with SARS-CoV2 with hypoxic respiratory failure was well tolerated, and most patients had improved outcomes. This limited case series may not offer concrete evidence towards the benefit of corticosteroids in COVID-19. However, patients positive response to short-term corticosteroids demonstrates that they may help blunt the severity of inflammation and prevent a severe hyperinflammatory phase, in turn reducing the length of stay, ICU admissions, and healthcare costs.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vijairam Selvaraj","author_inst":"The Miriam Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kwame Dapaah-Afriyie","author_inst":"The Miriam Hospital"},{"author_name":"Arkadiy Finn","author_inst":"The Miriam Hospital"},{"author_name":"Timothy Flanigan","author_inst":"Warren Alpert School of Medicine at Brown University"},{"author_name":"Robert Heinen","author_inst":"IMP, IMBA, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Irina Grishkovskaya","author_inst":"IMP"},{"author_name":"Benedikt Bauer","author_inst":"IMP"},{"author_name":"Johannes Stadlmann","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna"},{"author_name":"Luis Menendez-Arias","author_inst":"Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa, Spain"},{"author_name":"Robert Fritsche-Polanz","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Diagnostics, Klinik Favoriten, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Marianna Traugott","author_inst":"4th Medical Department with Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, Klinik Favoriten, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Tamara Seitz","author_inst":"4th Medical Department with Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, Klinik Favoriten, 1100 Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Alexander Zoufaly","author_inst":"4th Medical Department with Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, Klinik Favoriten, 1100 Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Manuela Foedinger","author_inst":"Institute of Laboratory Diagnostics, Klinik Favoriten; Sigmund Freud Private University, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Christoph Wenisch","author_inst":"4th Medical Department with Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, Klinik Favoriten, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Johannes Zuber","author_inst":"IMP, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"- Vienna Covid-19 Diagnostics Initiative (VCDI)","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Andrea Pauli","author_inst":"IMP, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Julius Brennecke","author_inst":"IMBA, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Sarah Lapidus","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Isabel Ott","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Adam Moore","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Catherine Muenker","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"John Fournier","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Melissa Campbell","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Camila Odio","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Arnau Casanovas-Massana","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"- Yale IMPACT Team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Roy Herbst","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Albert Shaw","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Ruslan Medzhitov","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Wade L Schulz","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nathan Grubaugh","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Charles Dela Cruz","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Shelli Farhadian","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Albert Ko","author_inst":"Yale University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Saad Omer","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Akiko Iwasaki","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.15.20117747","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 titers in wastewater foreshadow dynamics and clinical presentation of new COVID-19 cases","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.15.20117747","rel_abs":"Current estimates of COVID-19 prevalence are largely based on symptomatic, clinically diagnosed cases. The existence of a large number of undiagnosed infections hampers population-wide investigation of viral circulation. Here, we use longitudinal wastewater analysis to track SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in wastewater at a major urban wastewater treatment facility in Massachusetts, between early January and May 2020. SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in wastewater on March 3. Viral titers in wastewater increased exponentially from mid-March to mid-April, after which they began to decline. Viral titers in wastewater correlated with clinically diagnosed new COVID-19 cases, with the trends appearing 4-10 days earlier in wastewater than in clinical data. We inferred viral shedding dynamics by modeling wastewater viral titers as a convolution of back-dated new clinical cases with the viral shedding function of an individual. The inferred viral shedding function showed an early peak, likely before symptom onset and clinical diagnosis, consistent with emerging clinical and experimental evidence. Finally, we found that wastewater viral titers at the neighborhood level correlate better with demographic variables than with population size. This work suggests that longitudinal wastewater analysis can be used to identify trends in disease transmission in advance of clinical case reporting, and may shed light on infection characteristics that are difficult to capture in clinical investigations, such as early viral shedding dynamics.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fuqing Wu","author_inst":"MIT"},{"author_name":"Amy Xiao","author_inst":"MIT"},{"author_name":"Jianbo Zhang","author_inst":"MIT"},{"author_name":"Katya Moniz","author_inst":"MIT"},{"author_name":"Noriko Endo","author_inst":"Biobot Analytics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Federica Armas","author_inst":"Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology"},{"author_name":"Richard Bonneau","author_inst":"New York University"},{"author_name":"Megan A Brown","author_inst":"New York University"},{"author_name":"Mary Bushman","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Peter R Chai","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Claire Duvallet","author_inst":"Biobot Analytics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Timothy B Erickson","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Katelyn Foppe","author_inst":"Biobot Analytics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Newsha Ghaeli","author_inst":"Biobot Analytics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Xiaoqiong Gu","author_inst":"Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology"},{"author_name":"William P Hanage","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Katherine H Huang","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Wei Lin Lee","author_inst":"Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology"},{"author_name":"Mariana Matus","author_inst":"Biobot Analytics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Kyle A McElroy","author_inst":"Biobot Analytics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jonathan Nagler","author_inst":"Center for Data Science NYU"},{"author_name":"Steven F Rhode","author_inst":"Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Mauricio Santillana","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Joshua A Tucker","author_inst":"Center for Data Science NYU"},{"author_name":"Stefan Wuertz","author_inst":"Nanyang Technological University"},{"author_name":"Shijie Zhao","author_inst":"MIT"},{"author_name":"Janelle Thompson","author_inst":"Nanyang Technological University"},{"author_name":"Eric J Alm","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Roy Herbst","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Albert Shaw","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Ruslan Medzhitov","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Wade L Schulz","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nathan Grubaugh","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Charles Dela Cruz","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Shelli Farhadian","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Albert Ko","author_inst":"Yale University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Saad Omer","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Akiko Iwasaki","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.22.20132910","rel_title":"Insufficient social distancing may be related to a future COVID-19 outbreak in Ijui-Brazil: Predictions of further social interventions.","rel_date":"2020-06-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.22.20132910","rel_abs":"The coronavirus disease initiated in 2019 (COVID-19) has proven to be highly contagious and quickly became a pandemic. Nowadays, it presents higher transmission rates worldwide, chiefly in small Brazilian cities, as Ijui. Located in the northwestern of the State of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) with 83,475 inhabitants, Ijui was selected to receive a population-based survey organized in five steps, involving 2,222 subjects. Subjects were tested for the presence of antibodies against coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and answered questions regarding social distance adherence (SDA), daily preventive routine (DPR), comorbidities, and sociodemographic characteristics. In parallel, the local government registered the official COVID-19 cases in Ijui, and the mobile social distancing index (MSDI) was also registered. In this study, we demonstrate the decrease in the levels of SDA, DPR and MSDI before the beginning of COVID-19 community transmission in Ijui. Also, we provide predictions for cases, hospitalization, and deaths in the city. We concluded that the insufficient social distancing, evidenced by different methods, might have a strong relationship with the rapid increase of COVID-19 cases in Ijui.

Although there is a significant correlation between blood biomarkers and CT radiological findings, a potential correlation between biochemical parameters and LUS images is still unknown. Our purpose was to evaluate a potential association between lung lesions visualised by LUS and blood biomarkers as well as the ability to predict mortality from two different lung ultrasound scoring systems (LUSS). We performed a retrospective observational study on 45 patients aged >70 years with SARS-CoV-2 infection who required hospitalisation. LUS was carried out at admission and on day 7, when the clinical course was favourable or earlier in case of worsening. Disease severity was scored by means of LUSS in 8 (LUSS8) and in 12 (LUSS12) quadrants. LUS and blood draw for inflammatory marker analysis were performed at the same time. The correlation between biochemical parameters and either LUSS score was significant for ferritin levels. It was 0.486 (p=0.001) for LUSS8 and 0.458 (p=0.002) for LUSS12. Using a threshold score of 15 with LUSS12 predicted mortality in 86.7% of cases (ORcrude 31, CI 95% 4.79-200.51). Applying a threshold of 10 with LUSS8 predicted mortality in 88.9% (ORcrude 69.75, CI 95% 6.90-705.20). There is a correlation between ferritin levels and LUSS. The prognostic capacity of LUSS12 does not surpass that of LUSS8.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aurelio Luis Wanguemert Perez","author_inst":"Pneumology Service, San Juan de Dios Hospital, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain"},{"author_name":"Juan Marco Figueira Goncalvez","author_inst":"Pneumology and Thoracic Surgery Service, University Hospital Nuestra Senora de Candelaria, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain"},{"author_name":"Jose Maria Hernandez Perez","author_inst":"Pneumology and Thoracic Surgery Service, University Hospital Nuestra Senora de Candelaria, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain"},{"author_name":"Yolanda Ramallo Farina","author_inst":"Foundation of the Canary Islands Health Research Institute (FIISC), Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain.

Given the effects of COVID-19 in pulmonary tissues, chest radiography imaging plays an important role for the screening, early detection and monitoring of the suspected individuals. Hence, as the pandemic of COVID-19 progresses, there will be a greater reliance on the use of portable equipment for the acquisition of chest X-Ray images due to its accessibility, widespread availability and benefits regarding to infection control issues, minimizing the risk of cross contamination. This work presents novel fully automatic approaches specifically tailored for the classification of chest X-Ray images acquired by portable equipment into 3 different clinical categories: normal, pathological and COVID-19. For this purpose, two complementary deep learning approaches based on a densely convolutional network architecture are herein presented. The joint response of both approaches allows to enhance the differentiation between patients infected with COVID-19, patients with other diseases that manifest characteristics similar to COVID-19 and normal cases. The proposed approaches were validated over a dataset provided by the Radiology Service of the Complexo Hospitalario Universitario A Coru&ntildea (CHUAC) specifically retrieved for this research. Despite the poor quality of chest X-Ray images that is inherent to the nature of the portable equipment, the proposed approaches provided satisfactory results, allowing a reliable analysis of portable radiographs, to support the clinical decision-making process.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joaquim de Moura","author_inst":"University of A Coruna"},{"author_name":"Lucia Ramos","author_inst":"University of A Coruna"},{"author_name":"Placido L.

Opaganib is a selective sphingosine-kinase (SK)-2 inhibitor with anti-inflammatory and anti-viral properties. Methods. We provided opaganib on a compassionate-use basis to patients with severe COVID-19. Patients who required oxygen support via high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) were offered the treatment. For comparison, we used a control group with same-sex, same-severity patients. Results. Seven patients received at least one dose of opaganib since April 2, 2020. One patient, who received both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, developed diarrhea and all his medications were stopped. This was the only adverse effect possibly related to opaganib. A second patient was weaned of oxygen and discharged after receiving two doses of opaganib. Therefore, five patients were included in this analysis. Baseline characteristics were not significantly different between cases and controls. Patients treated with opaganib had significantly faster increase in lymphocyte count. All other clinical outcomes had a non-statistically significant trend in favor of the treatment group: median time to weaning from HFNC was 10 and 15 days in cases vs. controls (HR= 0.3, 95% CI: 0.07-1.7, p=0.2) ,time to ambient air was 13 vs.14.5 days (HR=0.4, 95% CI: 0.15-1.5), none of the cases required mechanical ventilation compared with 33% of controls. Conclusion. In this small cohort of severe COVID-19 patients, opaganib was safe and well tolerated with improvement in both clinical and laboratory parameters in all treated patients. The efficacy of opaganib for COVID-19 infection should be further tested in randomized placebo-controlled trials.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ramzi Kurd","author_inst":"Shaare-Zedek Medical center"},{"author_name":"Eli Ben-Chetrit","author_inst":"Shaare-Zedek Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Hani Karameh","author_inst":"Shaare-Zedek medical Center"},{"author_name":"Maskit Bar-Meir","author_inst":"Shaare-Zedek Medical center"},{"author_name":"Laura Abelairas","author_inst":"Complexo Hospitalario Universitario de A Coruna (CHUAC)"},{"author_name":"Eva Castro","author_inst":"Complexo Hospitalario Universitario de A Coruna (CHUAC)"},{"author_name":"Jorge Novo","author_inst":"University of A Coruna"},{"author_name":"Marcos Ortega","author_inst":"University of A Coruna"},{"author_name":"Evelise Moraes Berlezi","author_inst":"Universidade Regional do Noroeste do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul (Uniju\u00ed)"},{"author_name":"Peter R Chai","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Claire Duvallet","author_inst":"Biobot Analytics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Timothy B Erickson","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Katelyn Foppe","author_inst":"Biobot Analytics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Newsha Ghaeli","author_inst":"Biobot Analytics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Xiaoqiong Gu","author_inst":"Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology"},{"author_name":"William P Hanage","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Katherine H Huang","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Wei Lin Lee","author_inst":"Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology"},{"author_name":"Mariana Matus","author_inst":"Biobot Analytics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Kyle A McElroy","author_inst":"Biobot Analytics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jonathan Nagler","author_inst":"Center for Data Science NYU"},{"author_name":"Steven F Rhode","author_inst":"Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Mauricio Santillana","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Joshua A Tucker","author_inst":"Center for Data Science NYU"},{"author_name":"Stefan Wuertz","author_inst":"Nanyang Technological University"},{"author_name":"Shijie Zhao","author_inst":"MIT"},{"author_name":"Janelle Thompson","author_inst":"Nanyang Technological University"},{"author_name":"Eric J Alm","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Roy Herbst","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Albert Shaw","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Ruslan Medzhitov","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Wade L Schulz","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nathan Grubaugh","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Charles Dela Cruz","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Shelli Farhadian","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Albert Ko","author_inst":"Yale University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Saad Omer","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Akiko Iwasaki","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"}]}
