We analyzed the three metagenomic datasets that sampled this batch of pangolins and found that the two complete pangolin CoV genomes, GD_1 by Xiao et al. Nature and MP789 by Liu et al. PLoS Pathogens, were both built primarily using the 2019 dataset first described by Liu et al. Viruses. Other publications, such as Zhang et al. Current Biology and Lam et al. Nature, have also relied on this same dataset by Liu et al. Viruses for their assembly of pangolin CoV sequences and comparisons to SARS-CoV-2. To our knowledge, all of the published pangolin CoV genome sequences that share a nearly identical Spike receptor binding domain with SARS-CoV-2 originate from this single batch of smuggled pangolins. This raises the question of whether pangolins are truly reservoirs or hosts of SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses in the wild, or whether the pangolins may have contracted the CoV from another host species during trafficking. Our observations highlight the importance of requiring authors to publish their complete genome assembly pipeline and all contributing raw sequence data, particularly those supporting epidemiological investigations, in order to empower peer review and independent analysis of the sequence data.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yujia Alina Chan","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT & Harvard"},{"author_name":"Shing Hei Zhan","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"contradictory results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.07.192203","rel_title":"A rapidly adaptable biomaterial vaccine for SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-07-07","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.07.192203","rel_abs":"ABSTRACTThe global COVID-19 pandemic motivates accelerated research to develop safe and efficacious vaccines. To address this need, we leveraged a biomaterial vaccine technology that consists of mesoporous silica rods (MSRs) that provide a sustained release of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and adjuvants to concentrate and mature antigen-presenting cells at the vaccine site. Here we explored the humoral responses resulting from the use of monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) as the adjuvant and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins S1, S2, the nucleocapsid (N) protein, and receptor binding domain (RBD) as the target antigens. The dose of antigen and impact of pre-manufacturing of vaccines as versus loading antigen just-in-time was explored in these studies. Single shot MSR vaccines induced rapid and robust antibody titers to the presented antigens, even without the use of a boost, and sera from vaccinated animals demonstrated neutralizing activity against a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. Overall, these results suggest the MSR vaccine system may provide potent protective immunity when utilized to present SARS-CoV-2 antigens.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fernanda Langellotto","author_inst":"Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, Harvard University, Boston, Massachusetts, 02115, USA"},{"author_name":"Benjamin T.

The high transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been attributed to environmental, immunological, and molecular factors. The Spike protein is the foremost molecular factor responsible for virus fusion, entry and spread in the host, and thus holds clues for the rapid viral spread. The dense glycosylation of Spike, its high affinity of binding to the human ACE2 receptor, and the efficient priming by cleavage have already been proposed for driving efficient virus-host entry, but these do not explain its unusually high transmission rate. I have investigated the Spike from six {beta}-coronaviruses, including the SARS-CoV-2, and find that their surface-exposed fusion peptides constituting the defined fusion loop are spatially organized contiguous to each other to work synergistically for triggering the virus-host membrane fusion process. The architecture of the Spike quaternary structure ensures the participation of the fusion peptides in the initiation of the host membrane contact for the virus fusion process. The SARS-CoV-2 fusion peptides have unique physicochemical properties, accrued in part from the presence of consecutive prolines that impart backbone rigidity which aids the virus fusogenicity. The specific contribution of these prolines shows significantly diminished fusogenicity in vitro and associated pathogenesis in vivo, inferred from comparative studies of their deletion-mutant in a fellow murine {beta}-coronavirus MHV-A59. The priming of the Spike by its cleavage and subsequent fusogenic conformational transition steered by the fusion loop may be critical for the SARS-CoV-2 spread.\n\nSignificance StatementThe three proximal fusion peptides constituting the fusion loop in Spike protein are the membranotropic segments most suitable for engaging the host membrane surface for its disruption. Spikes unique quaternary structure architecture drives the fusion peptides to initiate the protein host membrane contact. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike trimer surface is relatively more hydrophobic among other human coronavirus Spikes, including the fusion peptides that are structurally more rigid owing to the presence of consecutive prolines, aromatic\/hydrophobic clusters, a stretch of consecutive {beta}-branched amino acids, and the hydrogen bonds. The synergy accrued from the location of the fusion peptides, their physicochemical features, and the fusogenic conformational transition appears to drive the virus fusion process and may explain the high spread of the SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Debnath Pal","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Benjamin T.

However, a broad societal discourse and a participatory decision-making process on the criteria underpinning the decision was often not feasible within the time constraints imposed on by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. While evidence-to-decision frameworks are not able or intended to replace stakeholder participation, they can serve as a tool to approach relevancy and comprehensiveness of the criteria considered. Objective: To develop a decision-making framework adapted to the challenges of decision-making on national and sub-national level implementation of non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) measures to contain the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods: We employed the best-fit framework synthesis technique and used the WHO-INTEGRATE framework Version 1.0 as a starting point. In a first phase adapted the framework through brainstorming exercises and application to exemplary case studies (e.g. school reopening). In a second phase we conducted a content analysis of comprehensive strategy documents intended to guide policymakers on the phasing out of applied lockdown measures in Germany. Based on factors and criteria identified in this process, we adapted previous framework versions into the WICID (WHO-INTEGRATE COVID-19) framework Version 1.0. Results: Twelve comprehensive strategy documents were included in the content analysis. The revised WICID framework consists of eleven criteria, supported by 48 aspects, the metacriterion quality of evidence and embraces a complexity and systems-perspective. The criteria cover implications for the health of individuals and populations due to and beyond COVID-19, infringement on liberties and fundamental human rights, acceptability and equity considerations, societal, environmental, and economic implications, as well as resource and feasibility considerations. Discussion: In a third phase, the proposed framework will be expanded through a comprehensive document analysis focusing on key-stakeholder groups across the society. The WICID framework can be a tool to support comprehensive evidence-informed decision-making processes.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jan M Stratil","author_inst":"Institute for Medical Information Processing, Biometry, and Epidemiology IBE, LMU Munich, Marchioninistr. 17, 81377 Munich    and   Pettenkofer School of Public"},{"author_name":"Maike Voss","author_inst":"German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP), Global Issues Division, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Laura Arnold","author_inst":"Academy of Public Health Services, Kanzlerstrasse 4, 40472 Duesseldorf, Germany"},{"author_name":"Mark J.

Among the extensive and crucial research that has been carried out in the last few months, the analysis of the virus-host relationship plays an important role in drug discovery. Virus-host protein-protein interactions are the active agents in virus replication, and the analysis of virus-host protein-protein interaction networks is fundamental to the study of the virus-host relationship. We have adapted and implemented a recent integer linear programming model for protein-protein interaction network alignment to virus-host networks, and obtained a consensus alignment of the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 virus-host protein-protein interaction networks. Despite the lack of shared human proteins in these virus-host networks and the low number of preserved virus-host interactions, the consensus alignment revealed aligned human proteins that share a function related to viral infection, as well as human proteins of high functional similarity that interact with SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 proteins, whose alignment would preserve these virus-host interactions.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Merc\u00e8 Llabr\u00e9s","author_inst":"University of the Balearic Islands"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Valiente","author_inst":"Technical University of Catalonia"},{"author_name":"Laura Arnold","author_inst":"Academy of Public Health Services, Kanzlerstrasse 4, 40472 Duesseldorf, Germany"},{"author_name":"Mark J.

RNASeq data were compared between five young (19-25yr) and five older (63-78yr) Caucasian males who had not been on medication or exhibited evidence of cardiovascular disease post-mortem.Expression of relevant genes encoding ACE2, TMPRSS2, TMPRS11D, TMPRS11E, FURIN, CTSL, CTSB and B0AT1\/SLC6A19 were upregulated in aged cardiomyocytes and the combined relative cardiomyocyte expression of these genes correlated positively with age. Genes encoding proteins in the RAAS and interferon\/interleukin pathways were also upregulated such as ACE, AGTR1, MAS1 and IL6R.Our results highlight SARS-CoV-2 related genes that have higher expression in aged compared with young adult cardiomyocytes. These data may inform studies using selective enzyme inhibitors\/antagonists, available as experimental compounds or clinically approved drugs e.g. remdesivir that has recently been rapidly accepted for compassionate use, to further understand the contribution of these pathways in human cardiomyocytes to disease outcome in COVID-19 patients.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emma L Robinson","author_inst":"Maastricht University"},{"author_name":"Kanar Alkass","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Olaf Bergmann","author_inst":"TU-Dresden"},{"author_name":"Janet J Maguire","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Llewelyn Roderick","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Anthony P Davenport","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Michael Super","author_inst":"Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, Harvard University, Boston, Massachusetts, 02115, USA"},{"author_name":"Edward J.

SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the host ACE2 receptor for infection. Whether ACE2 abundance in the lung contributes to age-associated vulnerability is currently unknown. We set out to characterize the RNA and protein expression profiles of ACE2 in aging human lung in the context of phenotypic parameters likely to affect lung physiology. Examining publicly available RNA sequencing data, we discovered that mechanical ventilation is a critical variable affecting lung ACE2 levels. Therefore, we investigated ACE2 protein abundance in patients either requiring mechanical ventilation or spontaneously breathing. ACE2 distribution and expression were determined in archival lung samples by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Tissues were selected from the specimen inventory at a large teaching hospital collected between 2010-2020. Twelve samples were chosen from patients receiving mechanical ventilation for acute hypoxic respiratory failure (AHRF). Twenty samples were selected from patients not requiring ventilation. We compared samples across age, ranging from 40-83 years old in the ventilated cohort and 14-80 years old in the non-ventilated cohort. Within the alveolated parenchyma, ACE2 expression is predominantly observed in type II pneumocytes (or alveolar type II \/ AT2 cells) and alveolar macrophages. All 12 samples from our ventilated cohort showed histologic features of diffuse alveolar damage including reactive, proliferating AT2 cells. In these cases, ACE2 was strongly upregulated with age when normalized to lung area (p = 0.004) or cellularity (p = 0.003), associated with prominent expression in AT2 cells. In non-ventilated individuals, AT2 cell reactive changes were not observed and ACE2 expression did not change with age when normalized to lung area (p = 0.231) or cellularity (p = 0.349). Additionally, we observed prominent pulmonary endothelial ACE2 expression in 2 patients on either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). In summary, ACE2 expression increases with age in the setting of alveolar damage observed in patients on mechanical ventilation, providing a potential mechanism for higher Covid-19 mortality in the elderly.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Steven A Baker","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Shirley Kowk","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Gerald J Berry","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Thomas J Montine","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Llewelyn Roderick","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Anthony P Davenport","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Michael Super","author_inst":"Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, Harvard University, Boston, Massachusetts, 02115, USA"},{"author_name":"Edward J.

This cascade affects drug concentrations in the plasma. We investigated the association between lopinavir (LPV) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) plasma concentrations and the values of acute phase inflammation marker C-reactive protein (CRP). Methods: LPV plasma concentrations were prospectively collected in 92 patients hospitalized at our institution. Lopinavir\/ritonavir was administered 12 hourly, 800\/200 mg on day 1, and 400\/100 mg on day 2 until day 5 or 7. HCQ was given at 800 mg, followed by 400 mg after 6, 24 and 48 hours. Hematological, liver, kidney, and inflammation laboratory values were analyzed on the day of drug level determination. Results: The median age of study participants was 59 (range 24 up to 85) years, and 71% were male. The median duration from symptom onset to hospitalization and treatment initiation was 7 days (IQR 4;10) and 8 days (IQR 5;10), respectively.

No correlation was found between HCQ concentrations and CRP values. Conclusions: High LPV plasma concentrations were observed in COVID-19 patients. The ratio of calculated unbound drug fraction to published SARS-CoV2 EC50 values indicated insufficient LPV concentrations in the lung.

Because rats vector a number of pathogens transmissible to people, changes in their behavior has consequences for human health risks. To determine the extent of how stay-at-home measures influenced patterns of rat sightings we: 1) examined the number of rat-related public service requests before and during the period of lockdown in New York City (NYC) and Tokyo, Japan; 2) examined reports made in proximity to closed food service establishments in NYC; and 3) surveyed pest control companies in the United States, Canada, Japan, and Poland. During the month following lockdown, the overall number of reports decreased by 30% in NYC, while increasing 24% in Tokyo. However, new hotspots of 311 calls were observed in proximity of closed food service establishments in NYC; and there was a consistent positive association between kernel density estimates of food service establishments and location of 311 calls (r = 0.33 to 0.45). Similarly, more reports were observed in the restaurant-dense eastern side of Tokyo. Changes in clientele for pest control companies varied geographically, with 37% of pest-management companies surveyed in North America reporting 50-100% of their post-lockdown rat-related requests coming from new clients. In Warsaw, where there are no clusters of restaurants in densely-populated areas, there were no changes. In Tokyo, there were no changes in clients. We conclude that changes in public service calls are region-specific and localized, with increases in rat sightings more likely near restaurant-dense regions. Pest control companies surveyed in North America either lost much of their business or shifted clientele from old to new locations. We discuss possible mitigation measures including ramping up pest control during re-opening of food-related establishments and the need for citywide rodent surveillance and disease monitoring.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael H Parsons","author_inst":"Fordham University"},{"author_name":"Yasushi Kiyokawa","author_inst":"University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Jonathan L Richardson","author_inst":"University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Rafal Stryjek","author_inst":"Polish Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Kaylee A.

This study examines whether there was an increase in the prevalence and incidence of Common Mental Disorders (CMD) in the UK adult population during the first few months of lockdown related to the coronavirus pandemic and whether changes in CMD were associated with an increase in stressors related to lockdown and the pandemic. Methods: Longitudinal data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (wave 9: 2017-2019 and waves 1 and 2 of the Coronavirus survey in April and May 2020 respectively), a representative sample of UK population, were analysed. Common mental disorders (CMD) were measured using the GHQ-12 (cut off >2) at all waves. The difference in the GHQ-12 (using Likert scores) between waves measured changes in psychological well-being. The incidence of CMD and changes in psychological well-being were analysed in relation to pandemic specific stressors and changes in economic, financial, household and psychosocial stressors. Findings: Around 30% of UKHLS adults without CMD in 2017\/9 had a CMD in April 2020. However from April to May 2020, the incidence reduced considerably to below 13%. Much of the increase in incident CMD between April and May was associated with an increase in feelings of loneliness, but some of this increase was also associated with increasing domestic work demands (arising out of childcare and home-schooling), working from home, and the receipt of care from outside the home. The reduction in the incidence of many of these stressors in May (compared to April) coincided with a reduction in the incidence of CMD in May. Conclusion: The pandemic and resultant lockdown were associated with an increase in the incidence of CMD in the UK adult population initially in April 2020. These changes were associated with increases in feelings of loneliness and stressors related to work and domestic life and receipt of care. There was some evidence of adaptation to many of these stressors over the lockdown period by May 2020. However, if levels of unemployment and redundancy increase in the near future, the implications for the mental health of the population need careful thought and monitoring.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tarani Chandola","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Meena Kumari","author_inst":"University of Essex"},{"author_name":"Cara L Booker","author_inst":"University of Essex"},{"author_name":"Michaela J Benzeval","author_inst":"University of Essex"},{"author_name":"Kaylee A.

The case and death rates are, for example, significantly positively associated with early cases from the beginning of the epidemic, the average age, the population density and the number of people employed in elderly care. By contrast, they are significantly negatively associated with the density of schoolchildren and infant care as well as the density of doctors. In addition, for individual variables significant spillover effects on the case numbers of neighbouring regions could be identified, which have a different sign than the overall effects and thus give cause for further analyses of the mechanisms of action of COVID-19 infections. The results complement the knowledge about COVID-19 infection beyond the clinical risk factors discussed so far by a socio-economic perspective. The findings can contribute to the targeted derivation of political measures and their review, as is currently being discussed in particular for the tourism and education sectors.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andree Ehlert","author_inst":"HWWI"},{"author_name":"Meena Kumari","author_inst":"University of Essex"},{"author_name":"Cara L Booker","author_inst":"University of Essex"},{"author_name":"Michaela J Benzeval","author_inst":"University of Essex"},{"author_name":"Kaylee A.

Massachusetts has been in the leading position of total cases since the outbreak in the U.S. Racial residential segregation is a fundamental cause of racial disparities in health. Moreover, disparities of access to health care have a large impact on COVID-19 cases. Thus, this study estimates racial segregation and disparities in testing sites access and employs economic, demographic, and transportation variables at the city\/town level in Massachusetts. Spatial regression models are applied to evaluate the relationships between COVID-19 incidence rate and related variables. This is the first study to apply spatial analysis methods across neighborhoods in the U.S. to examine the COVID-19 incidence rate. The findings are: 1) residential segregations of Hispanic and Non-Hispanic Black\/African Americans have a significantly positive association with COVID-19 incidence rate, indicating the higher susceptibility of COIVD-19 infections among minority; 2) The Black has the shortest drive time to testing sites, followed by Hispanic, Asian, and Whites. The drive time to testing sites is significantly negatively associated with the COVID-19 incidence rate, implying the importance of testing location being accessed by all populations; 3) Poverty rate and road density are significant explanatory variables. Importantly, overcrowding represented by more than one person per room is a significant variable found to be positively associated with COVID-19 incidence rate, suggesting the effectiveness of social distancing for reducing infection; 4) Different from previous studies, elderly population rate is not statistically significant with incidence rate because the elderly population in Massachusetts is less distributed in the hot spot regions of COVID-19 infections. The findings in this study provide useful insights for policymakers to propose new strategies to contain the COVID-19 transmissions in Massachusetts.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tao Hu","author_inst":"Center for Geographic Analysis, Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Han Yue","author_inst":"Geocomputation Center for Social Science, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Changzhen Wang","author_inst":"Department of Geography and Anthropology, Louisiana State University"},{"author_name":"Bing She","author_inst":"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor"},{"author_name":"Xinyue Ye","author_inst":"Department of Landscape Architecture and Urban Planning, Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Regina Liu","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Mercer University"},{"author_name":"Xinyan Zhu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Shuming Bao","author_inst":"China Data Institute, Ann Arbor"},{"author_name":"Masato Ootaki","author_inst":"University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Tsutomu Tanikawa","author_inst":"Tokyo Pest Control Association"},{"author_name":"Faith E Parsons","author_inst":"CareSet Systems"},{"author_name":"Jason Munch-South","author_inst":"Fordham University"},{"author_name":"Nina Khanna","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Sarah Tschudin-Sutter","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Daniel Mueller","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Hans Hirsch","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Manuel Battegay","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Parham Sendi","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.06.20147009","rel_title":"Impact of COVID-19 Attributable Deaths on Longevity, Premature Mortality and DALY: Estimates of USA, Italy, Sweden and Germany","rel_date":"2020-07-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.06.20147009","rel_abs":"In a short span of four months, the COVID-19 pandemic has added over 0.4 million deaths worldwide, which are untimely, premature and unwarranted.

Methods: Two laboratory ELISA assays measuring IgA & IgG (Euroimmun), and IgM & IgG (Epitope Diagnostics) were used to characterise the biobank collected from 349 re- and convalescent patients from the canton of Basel-Landschaft. Findings: The antibody response in terms of recognized epitopes is diverse, especially in oligosymptomatic patients, while the average strength of the antibody response of the population does correlate with the severity of the disease at each time point. Interpretation: The diverse immune response presents a challenge when conducting epidemiological studies as the used assays only detect 90% of the oligosymptomatic cases.

This is in contrast to conventional group testing schemes where the measurements are Boolean. The proposed schemes provide higher testing throughput than the popularly used Dorfman's scheme. They also provide higher testing throughput, sensitivity and specificity than the state-of-the-art non-adaptive Tapestry scheme. The number of pipetting operations is lower than state-of-the-art non-adaptive pooling schemes, and is higher than that for the Dorfman's scheme. The proposed schemes can work with substantially smaller group sizes than non-adaptive schemes and are simple to describe. Monte-Carlo simulations using the statistical model in the work of Ghosh et al.

Little to no work has been done to establish optimal design strategies and implementation plans to ease surge capacity and expand isolation capacity over long periods in congregate living facilities. The COVID-19 pandemic has an airborne transmission component and requires isolation, which is difficult to accomplish in skilled nursing facilities. Purpose: In this study we designed, implemented, and validated an isolation space at a skilled nursing facility in Lancaster, PA. The overall goal was to minimize disease transmission between residents and staff within the facility. Basic Procedures: We created an isolation space by modifying an existing HVAC system of the SNF. We measured pressure on-site and performed computational fluid dynamics and Lagrangian particle-based modeling to test containment and possible transmission extent given the isolation space is considered negative rather than individual rooms. Main Findings: Pressure data shows the isolation space maintained an average hourly value of (standard deviation) -2.3 Pa (0.12 Pa) pressure differential between it and the external hallway connected to the rest of the facility.

This lethality seems to be very low in Africa and Asia, but exceedingly high in western Europe and North America. Many factors could have a role in this disparity such as comorbidities. Advanced age, obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer were the most frequently cited in the reported COVID-19 data. The main objective was to analyse the association between the COVID-19 mortality and the mentioned factors in 164 countries. Methods: The Data of COVID-19 deaths, latitude degrees, population age distribution, cardiovascular diseases, obesity, diabetes and cancer were extracted from different online sources. For the statistical analysis, we used Spearman to measure the correlation coefficient between numbers of deaths and the mentioned factors until June 29, 2020. Results: The correlation between COVID-19 mortality and latitude, high age, obesity, CVD and number of cancer patients per 100,000 is significant at 0.01 level with r = 0.489, r=0.511, r=0.489, r=0.561 and r=0.536 respectively. The correlation between the number of deaths and diabetes is less strong than the previous ones, and the correlation coefficient is r= 0.154. Conclusion: The great lethality of COVID-19 in western Europe and North America can be explained in part by the highest of age, cancer and CVD percentage in these regions. It seems also plausible that the increased obesity in the USA and vitamin D deficiency in Europe may contribute to increasing the number of COVID-19 deaths.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ouail Ouchetto","author_inst":"Hassan II University - Casablanca"},{"author_name":"Asmaa Drissi Bourhanbour","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy, Hassan II University of Casablanca"},{"author_name":"Joseph Wilson","author_inst":"University of Colorado Boulder"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Clements","author_inst":"Well Living Lab, Rochester, Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Cedric Steiner","author_inst":"Eastern University, St. Davids, Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Won Jun Kimn","author_inst":"Korea University, College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Sung Kyu Park","author_inst":"Korea Workers Compensation  Welfare Services Daegu Hospital, 515 Hakjeong-ro, Buk-gu, Daegu, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Hea-Woon Park","author_inst":"Korea Workers Compensation  Welfare Services Daegu Hospital, 515 Hakjeong-ro, Buk-gu, Daegu, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Wonjong Yang","author_inst":"Korea Workers Compensation  Welfare Services Daegu Hospital, 515 Hakjeong-ro, Buk-gu, Daegu, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Joonyoung Jang","author_inst":"Korea Workers Compensation  Welfare Services Daegu Hospital, 515 Hakjeong-ro, Buk-gu, Daegu, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Soonwoo Jang","author_inst":"Pusan National University"},{"author_name":"Tae-Ho Hwang","author_inst":"Director of Gene and Cell Therapy Research Center for Vessel-associated Diseases, School of Medicine, Pusan National University, Yangsan, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Christina Krebs","author_inst":"Swiss TPH"},{"author_name":"Tanja Renz","author_inst":"Canton Basel-Landschaft Medical Association"},{"author_name":"Thomas Hochueli","author_inst":"Office for Military Affairs and Civil Protection Canton Basel-Landschaft"},{"author_name":"Sergio Haymoz","author_inst":"Office for Military Affairs and Civil Protection Canton Basel-Landschaft"},{"author_name":"Markus Hosch","author_inst":"Department of Health, Economics and Health Directorate Canton Basel-Landschaft"},{"author_name":"Nadine Periat","author_inst":"Department of Health, Economics and Health Directorate Canton Basel-Landschaft"},{"author_name":"Michele Richert","author_inst":"Department of Health, Economics and Health Directorate Canton Basel-Landschaft"},{"author_name":"Sergio Sesia","author_inst":"University Berne"},{"author_name":"Daniel Paris","author_inst":"Swiss TPH"},{"author_name":"Carlos Beat Quinto","author_inst":"Swiss TPH"},{"author_name":"Nicole Probst-Hensch","author_inst":"Swiss TPH"},{"author_name":"Christoph Niederhauser","author_inst":"Interregional Blood Transfusion SRC"},{"author_name":"Sai Reddy","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Beatrice Nickel","author_inst":"Swiss TPH"},{"author_name":"Miodrag Savic","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.28.20141911","rel_title":"Characteristics and outcomes of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome related to COVID-19 in Belgian and French Intensive Care Units according to antiviral strategies.

Methods Observational multicenter cohort of patients with moderate to severe Covid-19 ARDS, comparing antiviral strategies (none, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), lopinavir\/ritonavir (L\/R), others (combination or remdesivir). The primary end-point was the day-28 ventilator free days (VFD), patients which died before d28 were considered as having 0 VFD. The variable was dichotomized in patients still ventilated or dead at day 28 vs patients being extubated and alive at day 28 (VFD = or > 0). Results We analyzed 376 patients (80 with standard of care (SOC), 49 treated with L\/R, 197 with HCQ, and 50 others). The median number of d28-VFD was 0 (IQR 0-13) and was different across the different groups (P=0.01), the SOC patients having the highest d28-VFD. A multivariate logistic regression including antiviral strategies, showed that age (OR 0.95 CI95%:0.93-0.98), male gender (OR 0.53 CI95%:0.31-0.93), Charlson score (OR 0.85 CI95%:0.73-0.99) and plateau pressure (OR 0.94 CI95%:0.88-0.99) were associated with having 0 d28-VFD whereas P\/F ratio (OR 1.005 CI95%:1.001-1.010) was associated with having > or = 1 d28-VFD (ie. being extubated and alive). Acute kidney injury (AKI) was frequent (64%), its incidence was different across the patients groups (P=0.01). In a post-hoc logistic multivariate regression apart from demographics characteristics and comorbidities, the use of L\/R (administered to 81 of 376 patients) was associated with occurrence of AKI (OR 2.07 CI95%:1.17-3.66) and need for renal replacement therapy (RRT). Conclusion In this observational study of moderate to severe Covid-19 ARDS patients, we did not observed a benefit of treating patients with any specific antiviral treatment. We observed an association between L\/R treatment and occurrence of AKI and need for RRT.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Grimaldi","author_inst":"ERASME"},{"author_name":"Nadia Aissaoui","author_inst":"HEGP"},{"author_name":"Gauthier Blonz","author_inst":"CHD Vendee"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Carbutti","author_inst":"Jolimont"},{"author_name":"Romain Courcelle","author_inst":"La Louviere"},{"author_name":"Stephane Gaudry","author_inst":"CHU Avicenne"},{"author_name":"Julien Higny","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Geoffrey Horlait","author_inst":"Louvain"},{"author_name":"Sami Hraiech","author_inst":"APHM"},{"author_name":"Laurent Lefebvre","author_inst":"Aix En Provence"},{"author_name":"Francois Lejeune","author_inst":"Gosselies"},{"author_name":"Andre Ly","author_inst":"CHU Creteil"},{"author_name":"Michael Piagnerelli","author_inst":"Charleroi"},{"author_name":"Bertrand Sauneuf","author_inst":"CH Cherbourg en Cotentin"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Serck","author_inst":"Clinique Saint Pierre"},{"author_name":"Thibaud Soumagne","author_inst":"CHU Besancon"},{"author_name":"Piotr Szychowiak","author_inst":"CHRU Tours"},{"author_name":"Julien Textoris","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Benoit Vandenbunder","author_inst":"HPA"},{"author_name":"Christophe Vinsonneau","author_inst":"CH Bethune"},{"author_name":"Jean Baptiste Lascarrou","author_inst":"CHU Nantes"},{"author_name":"Carlos Beat Quinto","author_inst":"Swiss TPH"},{"author_name":"Nicole Probst-Hensch","author_inst":"Swiss TPH"},{"author_name":"Christoph Niederhauser","author_inst":"Interregional Blood Transfusion SRC"},{"author_name":"Sai Reddy","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Beatrice Nickel","author_inst":"Swiss TPH"},{"author_name":"Miodrag Savic","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.06.20147223","rel_title":"Predicting the second wave of COVID-19 in Washtenaw County, MI","rel_date":"2020-07-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.06.20147223","rel_abs":"Marissa Renardy and Denise Kirschner University of Michigan Medical School The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the patchwork nature of disease epidemics, with infection spread dynamics varying wildly across countries and across states within the US. These heteroge- neous patterns are also observed within individual states, with patches of concentrated outbreaks. Data is being generated daily at all of these spatial scales, and answers to questions regarded re- opening strategies are desperately needed. Mathematical modeling is useful in exactly these cases, and using modeling at a county scale may be valuable to further predict disease dynamics for the purposes of public health interventions. To explore this issue, we study and predict the spread of COVID-19 in Washtenaw County, MI, the home to University of Michigan, Eastern Michigan University, and Google, as well as serving as a sister city to Detroit, MI where there has been a serious outbreak. Here, we apply a discrete and stochastic network-based modeling framework allowing us to track every individual in the county. In this framework, we construct contact net- works based on synthetic population datasets specific for Washtenaw County that are derived from US Census datasets. We assign individuals to households, workplaces, schools, and group quarters (such as prisons). In addition, we assign casual contacts to each individual at random. Using this framework, we explicitly simulate Michigan-specific government-mandated workplace and school closures as well as social distancing measures. We also perform sensitivity analyses to identify key model parameters and mechanisms contributing to the observed disease burden in the three months following the first observed cases on COVID-19 in Michigan. We then consider several scenarios for relaxing restrictions and reopening workplaces to predict what actions would be most prudent. In particular, we consider the effects of 1) different timings for reopening, and 2) different levels of workplace vs. casual contact re-engagement. Through simulations and sensitivity analyses, we explore mechanisms driving magnitude and timing of a second wave of infections upon re-opening. This model can be adapted to other US counties using synthetic population databases and data specific to those regions.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marissa Renardy","author_inst":"University of Michigan Medical School"},{"author_name":"Denise E.

Public debates question its impact ompared with reliance on individual responsibility. We aim at understanding how rationally chosen self-protective behavior impacts the spread of the epidemics. We want to, first, assess the value of lockdown compared to a counterfactual that incorporates self-protection efforts under unknown disease prevalence; and second, assess how individual behavior modify the epidemic dynamics when mandatory policies are relaxed. We couple an SLIAR model, that includes asymptomatic transmission, with utility maximization: Individuals trade off economic and wellbeing costs from physical distancing with a lower infection risk. Effort depends on risk aversion, perceptions, and the value of contacts. In a Nash equilibrium, individual uncoordinated efforts yield average contact intensity, which drives epidemic transmission. Equilibrium effort differs markedly from constant, stochastic or proportional contacts reduction. It adjusts to reported cases in a way that creates a slightly decreasing plateau in epidemic prevalence. Calibration on French data shows that the number of deaths with no lockdown but equilibrium efforts is only 1\/6 to 1\/10 of the number predicted with business-as-usual. However, lockdown saves at least 50% more lives than individual efforts alone. Prolonged weaker restrictions prevent an exponential rebound. Public policies post-lockdown have a limited impact as they partly crowd out individual efforts. Compulsory mask wearing helps resume activity but has no impact on the epidemic. Communication that increases risk salience is more effective.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cecile Aubert","author_inst":"University of Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Emmanuelle Augeraud-Veron","author_inst":"University of Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Gauthier Blonz","author_inst":"CHD Vendee"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Carbutti","author_inst":"Jolimont"},{"author_name":"Romain Courcelle","author_inst":"La Louviere"},{"author_name":"Stephane Gaudry","author_inst":"CHU Avicenne"},{"author_name":"Julien Higny","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Geoffrey Horlait","author_inst":"Louvain"},{"author_name":"Sami Hraiech","author_inst":"APHM"},{"author_name":"Laurent Lefebvre","author_inst":"Aix En Provence"},{"author_name":"Francois Lejeune","author_inst":"Gosselies"},{"author_name":"Andre Ly","author_inst":"CHU Creteil"},{"author_name":"Michael Piagnerelli","author_inst":"Charleroi"},{"author_name":"Bertrand Sauneuf","author_inst":"CH Cherbourg en Cotentin"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Serck","author_inst":"Clinique Saint Pierre"},{"author_name":"Thibaud Soumagne","author_inst":"CHU Besancon"},{"author_name":"Piotr Szychowiak","author_inst":"CHRU Tours"},{"author_name":"Julien Textoris","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Benoit Vandenbunder","author_inst":"HPA"},{"author_name":"Christophe Vinsonneau","author_inst":"CH Bethune"},{"author_name":"Jean Baptiste Lascarrou","author_inst":"CHU Nantes"},{"author_name":"Carlos Beat Quinto","author_inst":"Swiss TPH"},{"author_name":"Nicole Probst-Hensch","author_inst":"Swiss TPH"},{"author_name":"Christoph Niederhauser","author_inst":"Interregional Blood Transfusion SRC"},{"author_name":"Sai Reddy","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Beatrice Nickel","author_inst":"Swiss TPH"},{"author_name":"Miodrag Savic","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.05.20146647","rel_title":"An SEIR Model with Contact Tracing and Age-Structured Social Mixing for COVID-19 outbreak","rel_date":"2020-07-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.05.20146647","rel_abs":"In December 2019 a severe acute respiratory syndrome now known as SARS-CoV-2 began to surge in Wuhan, China.

More fake news takes the forms of text & video (47.2%), while the main types of content are less popular. Third, the two main sources of fake news are online media and mainstream media, where online-produced fake news (94.4%) prevails. Fourth, the main two types of coverages are international and national, and more fake news has an international connection (54.4%). Fifth, the intention of fake news has three types: positive, negative, and unknown. Most of the COVID-19-related fake news is negative (63.2%). Although fake news cases are unevenly distributed and repeatedly fluctuates during the period, a slow decrease of daily cases is noticed toward the end.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Md.

Some of the countries with a low COVID-19 mortality are those with a relatively high consumption of traditional fermented foods. To test the potential role of fermented foods in COVID-19 mortality in Europe, we performed an ecological study. Methods The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database was used to study the country consumption of fermented vegetables, pickled\/marinated vegetables, fermented milk, yoghurt and fermented sour milk. We obtained the COVID-19 mortality per number of inhabitants from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. EuroStat data were used for data on potential confounders at the country level including Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (2019), population density (2018), percentage of people older than 64 years (2019), unemployment rate (2019) and percentage obesity (2014, to avoid missing values). Mortality counts were analyzed with quasi-Poisson regression models - with log of population as an offset - to model the death rate while accounting for over-dispersion. Results Of all the variables considered, including confounders, only fermented vegetables reached statistical significance with the COVID-19 death rate per country. For each g\/day increase in the average national consumption of fermented vegetables, the mortality risk for COVID-19 decreased by 35.4% (95% CI: 11.4%, 35.5%). Adjustment did not change the point estimate and results were still significant. Discussion The negative ecological association between COVID-19 mortality and consumption of fermented vegetables supports the a priory hypothesis previously reported. The hypothesis needs to be tested in individual studies performed in countries where the consumption of fermented vegetables is common.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Susana Fonseca","author_inst":"University of Porto"},{"author_name":"Ioar Rivas","author_inst":"ISGlobAL"},{"author_name":"Dora Romaguera","author_inst":"ISGlobAL"},{"author_name":"Marcos Quijal","author_inst":"ISGlobAL"},{"author_name":"Wienczyslawa Czarlewski","author_inst":"MASK-air"},{"author_name":"Alain Vidal","author_inst":"Paris Institute of Technology for Life, Food and Environmental Sciences"},{"author_name":"Joao Fonseca","author_inst":"CINTESIS"},{"author_name":"Joan Ballester","author_inst":"ISGlobAL"},{"author_name":"Josep Anto","author_inst":"ISGlobAL"},{"author_name":"Xavier Basagana","author_inst":"ISGlobAL"},{"author_name":"Luis M Cunha","author_inst":"University of Porto"},{"author_name":"Jean Bousquet","author_inst":"Macvia France"},{"author_name":"Michael Piagnerelli","author_inst":"Charleroi"},{"author_name":"Bertrand Sauneuf","author_inst":"CH Cherbourg en Cotentin"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Serck","author_inst":"Clinique Saint Pierre"},{"author_name":"Thibaud Soumagne","author_inst":"CHU Besancon"},{"author_name":"Piotr Szychowiak","author_inst":"CHRU Tours"},{"author_name":"Julien Textoris","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Benoit Vandenbunder","author_inst":"HPA"},{"author_name":"Christophe Vinsonneau","author_inst":"CH Bethune"},{"author_name":"Jean Baptiste Lascarrou","author_inst":"CHU Nantes"},{"author_name":"Carlos Beat Quinto","author_inst":"Swiss TPH"},{"author_name":"Nicole Probst-Hensch","author_inst":"Swiss TPH"},{"author_name":"Christoph Niederhauser","author_inst":"Interregional Blood Transfusion SRC"},{"author_name":"Sai Reddy","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Beatrice Nickel","author_inst":"Swiss TPH"},{"author_name":"Miodrag Savic","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"nutrition"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.06.20147637","rel_title":"Evaluation of a genetic risk score for severity of COVID-19 using human chromosomal-scale length variation.","rel_date":"2020-07-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.06.20147637","rel_abs":"The course of COVID-19 varies from asymptomatic to severe in patients. The basis for this range in symptoms is unknown. One possibility is that genetic variation is partly responsible for the highly variable response. We evaluated how well a genetic risk score based on chromosomal-scale length variation and machine learning classification algorithms could predict severity of response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We compared 981 patients from the UK Biobank dataset who had a severe reaction to SARS-CoV-2 infection before 27 April 2020 to a similar number of age matched patients drawn for the general UK Biobank population. For each patient, we built a profile of 88 numbers characterizing the chromosomal-scale length variability of their germ line DNA. Each number represented one quarter of the 22 autosomes. We used the machine learning algorithm XGBoost to build a classifier that could predict whether a person would have a severe reaction to COVID-19 based only on their 88-number classification. We found that the XGBoost classifier could differentiate between the two classes at a significant level (p=2*10^(-11)) as measured against a randomized control and (p=3*10^(-14)) as measured against the expected value of a random guessing algorithm (AUC=0.5). However, we found that the AUC of the classifier was only 0.51, too low for a clinically useful test. Genetics play a role in the severity of COVID-19, but we cannot yet develop a useful genetic test to predict severity.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chris Toh","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"James P Brody","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Dora Romaguera","author_inst":"ISGlobAL"},{"author_name":"Marcos Quijal","author_inst":"ISGlobAL"},{"author_name":"Wienczyslawa Czarlewski","author_inst":"MASK-air"},{"author_name":"Alain Vidal","author_inst":"Paris Institute of Technology for Life, Food and Environmental Sciences"},{"author_name":"Joao Fonseca","author_inst":"CINTESIS"},{"author_name":"Joan Ballester","author_inst":"ISGlobAL"},{"author_name":"Josep Anto","author_inst":"ISGlobAL"},{"author_name":"Xavier Basagana","author_inst":"ISGlobAL"},{"author_name":"Luis M Cunha","author_inst":"University of Porto"},{"author_name":"Jean Bousquet","author_inst":"Macvia France"},{"author_name":"Michael Piagnerelli","author_inst":"Charleroi"},{"author_name":"Bertrand Sauneuf","author_inst":"CH Cherbourg en Cotentin"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Serck","author_inst":"Clinique Saint Pierre"},{"author_name":"Thibaud Soumagne","author_inst":"CHU Besancon"},{"author_name":"Piotr Szychowiak","author_inst":"CHRU Tours"},{"author_name":"Julien Textoris","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Benoit Vandenbunder","author_inst":"HPA"},{"author_name":"Christophe Vinsonneau","author_inst":"CH Bethune"},{"author_name":"Jean Baptiste Lascarrou","author_inst":"CHU Nantes"},{"author_name":"Carlos Beat Quinto","author_inst":"Swiss TPH"},{"author_name":"Nicole Probst-Hensch","author_inst":"Swiss TPH"},{"author_name":"Christoph Niederhauser","author_inst":"Interregional Blood Transfusion SRC"},{"author_name":"Sai Reddy","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Beatrice Nickel","author_inst":"Swiss TPH"},{"author_name":"Miodrag Savic","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"genetic and genomic medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.06.20147751","rel_title":"COVID-19 presenting as anosmia and dysgeusia in New York City emergency departments, March - April, 2020","rel_date":"2020-07-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.06.20147751","rel_abs":"Background: Increasing evidence has been emerging of anosmia and dysgeusia as frequently reported symptoms in COVID-19. Improving our understanding of these presenting symptoms may facilitate the prompt recognition of the disease in emergency departments and prevent further transmission. Methods: We examined a cross-sectional cohort using New York City emergency department syndromic surveillance data for March and April 2020. Emergency department visits for anosmia and\/or dysgeusia were identified and subsequently matched to the Electronic Clinical Laboratory Reporting System to determine testing results for SARS-CoV-2. Results: Of the 683 patients with anosmia and\/or dysgeusia included, SARS-CoV-2 testing was performed for 232 (34%) and 168 (72%) were found to be positive. Median age of all patients presenting with anosmia and\/or dysgeusia symptoms was 38, and 54% were female. Anosmia and\/or dysgeusia was the sole complaint of 158 (23%) patients, of whom 35 were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and 23 (66%) were positive. While the remaining patients presented with at least one other symptom, nearly half of all patients (n=334, 49%) and more than a third of those who tested positive (n=62, 37%) did not have any of the CDC-established symptoms used for screening of COVID-19 such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, or sore throat. Conclusions and Relevance: Anosmia and\/or dysgeusia have been frequent complaints among patients presenting to emergency departments during the COVID-19 pandemic, and, while only a small proportion of patients ultimately underwent testing for SARS-CoV-19, the majority of patients tested have been positive. Anosmia and dysgeusia likely represent underrecognized symptoms of COVID-19 but may have important future implications in disease diagnosis and surveillance.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tina Z.

Objective: To define SARS-CoV-2 screening performance standards that would permit the safe return of students to campus for the Fall 2020 semester. Design: Decision and cost-effectiveness analysis linked to a compartmental epidemic model to evaluate campus screening using tests of varying frequency (daily-weekly), sensitivity (70%-99%), specificity (98%-99.7%), and cost ($10-$50\/test). Reproductive numbers Rt = {1.5, 2.5, 3.5} defined three epidemic scenarios, with additional infections imported via exogenous shocks. We generally adhered to US government guidance for parameterization data. Participants: A hypothetical cohort of 5000 college-age, uninfected students. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Cumulative tests, infections, and costs; daily isolation dormitory census; incremental cost-effectiveness; and budget impact. All measured over an 80-day, abbreviated semester. Results: With Rt = 2.5, daily screening with a 70% sensitive, 98% specific test produces 85 cumulative student infections and isolation dormitory daily census averaging 108 (88% false positives). Screening every 2 (7) days nets 135 (3662) cumulative infections and daily isolation census 66 (252) with 73% (4%) false positives. Across all scenarios, test frequency exerts more influence on outcomes than test sensitivity. Cost-effectiveness analysis selects screening every {2, 1, 7} days with a 70% sensitive test as the preferred strategy for Rt = {2.5, 3.5, 1.5}, implying a screening cost of {$470, $920, $120} per student per semester. Conclusions & Relevance: Rapid, inexpensive and frequently conducted screening (even if only 70% sensitive) would be cost-effective and produce a modest number of COVID-19 infections. While the optimal screening frequency hinges on the success of behavioral interventions to reduce the base severity of transmission (Rt), this could permit the safe return of student to campus.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"A David Paltiel","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Amy Zheng","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Rochelle P Walensky","author_inst":"Medical Practice Evaluation Center, Division of Infectious Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Ramona Lall","author_inst":"New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene"},{"author_name":"Wienczyslawa Czarlewski","author_inst":"MASK-air"},{"author_name":"Alain Vidal","author_inst":"Paris Institute of Technology for Life, Food and Environmental Sciences"},{"author_name":"Joao Fonseca","author_inst":"CINTESIS"},{"author_name":"Joan Ballester","author_inst":"ISGlobAL"},{"author_name":"Josep Anto","author_inst":"ISGlobAL"},{"author_name":"Xavier Basagana","author_inst":"ISGlobAL"},{"author_name":"Luis M Cunha","author_inst":"University of Porto"},{"author_name":"Jean Bousquet","author_inst":"Macvia France"},{"author_name":"Michael Piagnerelli","author_inst":"Charleroi"},{"author_name":"Bertrand Sauneuf","author_inst":"CH Cherbourg en Cotentin"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Serck","author_inst":"Clinique Saint Pierre"},{"author_name":"Thibaud Soumagne","author_inst":"CHU Besancon"},{"author_name":"Piotr Szychowiak","author_inst":"CHRU Tours"},{"author_name":"Julien Textoris","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Benoit Vandenbunder","author_inst":"HPA"},{"author_name":"Christophe Vinsonneau","author_inst":"CH Bethune"},{"author_name":"Jean Baptiste Lascarrou","author_inst":"CHU Nantes"},{"author_name":"Carlos Beat Quinto","author_inst":"Swiss TPH"},{"author_name":"Nicole Probst-Hensch","author_inst":"Swiss TPH"},{"author_name":"Christoph Niederhauser","author_inst":"Interregional Blood Transfusion SRC"},{"author_name":"Sai Reddy","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Beatrice Nickel","author_inst":"Swiss TPH"},{"author_name":"Miodrag Savic","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"}]}
