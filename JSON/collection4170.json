Among them, neutralizing antibodies play crucial roles for preventing viral infections and contribute to resolution of infection. Here, we describe the generation of antibody libraries from 17 different COVID-19 recovered patients and screening of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. After 3 rounds of panning, 456 positive phage clones were obtained with high affinity to RBD (receptor binding domain). Then the positive clones were sequenced and reconstituted into whole human IgG for epitope binning assays. After that, all 19 IgG were classified into 6 different epitope groups or Bins. Although all these antibodies were shown to have ability to bind RBD, the antibodies in Bin2 have more superiority to inhibit the interaction between spike protein and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2). Most importantly, the antibodies from Bin2 can also strongly bind with mutant RBDs (W463R, R408I, N354D, V367F and N354D\/D364Y) derived from SARS-CoV-2 strain with increased infectivity, suggesting the great potential of these antibodies in preventing infection of SARS-CoV-2 and its mutations. Furthermore, these neutralizing antibodies strongly restrict the binding of RBD to hACE2 overexpressed 293T cells. Consistently, these antibodies effectively neutralized pseudovirus entry into hACE2 overexpressed 293T cells. In Vero-E6 cells, these antibodies can even block the entry of live SARS-CoV-2 into cells at only 12.5 nM. These results suggest that these neutralizing human antibodies from the patient-derived antibody libraries have the potential to become therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2 and its mutants in this global pandemic.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yan Lou","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases, Key Laboratory for Drug Evaluation and Clinical Research of Zhejiang Province, The Firs"},{"author_name":"Wenxiang Zhao","author_inst":"Shanghai Key Laboratory of Regulatory Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences and School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200241, Chin"},{"author_name":"Haitao Wei","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Min Chu","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Ruihua Chao","author_inst":"Shanghai Key Laboratory of Regulatory Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences and School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200241, Chin"},{"author_name":"Hangping Yao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases, Key Laboratory for Drug Evaluation and Clinical Research of Zhejiang Province, The Firs"},{"author_name":"Junwei Su","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases, Key Laboratory for Drug Evaluation and Clinical Research of Zhejiang Province, The Firs"},{"author_name":"Yanan Li","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Xiulan Li","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Yu Cao","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Yanyan Feng","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Ping Wang","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Yongyang Xia","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Yushuan Shang","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Fengping Li","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Pingju Ge","author_inst":"Acrobiosystems Inc., Beijing 100176, China"},{"author_name":"Xinglin Zhang","author_inst":"Acrobiosystems Inc., Beijing 100176, China"},{"author_name":"Wenjing Gao","author_inst":"Acrobiosystems Inc., Beijing 100176, China"},{"author_name":"Bing Du","author_inst":"Shanghai Key Laboratory of Regulatory Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences and School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200241, Chin"},{"author_name":"Tingbo Liang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, 79 Qingchun Road, Hangzhou 310003, China"},{"author_name":"Yunqing Qiu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases, Key Laboratory for Drug Evaluation and Clinical Research of Zhejiang Province, The Firs"},{"author_name":"Minyao Liu","author_inst":"The Institute of Biomedical Sciences and School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.03.20120337","rel_title":"Belief of Previous COVID-19 Infection and Unclear Government Policy are Associated with Reduced Willingness to Participate in App-Based Contact Tracing: A UK-Wide Observational Study of 13,000 Patients","rel_date":"2020-06-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.03.20120337","rel_abs":"Background: Contact tracing and lockdown are health policies being used worldwide to combat the coronavirus (COVID-19). While easing lockdown, the UK National Health Service (NHS) launched its Track and Trace Service at the end of May 2020, and aims by end of June 2020 also to include app-based notification and advice to self-isolate for those who have been in contact with a person known to have COVID-19. To be successful, such an app will require high uptake, the determinants and willingness for which are unclear but essential to understand for effective public health benefit. Objectives: To measure the determinants of willingness to participate in an NHS app-based contact tracing programme using a questionnaire within the Care Information Exchange (CIE) - the largest patient-facing electronic health record in the NHS. Methods: Observational study of 47,708 registered NHS users of the CIE, 27% of whom completed a novel questionnaire asking about willingness to participate in app-based contact tracing, understanding of government advice, mental and physical wellbeing and their healthcare utilisation -- related or not to COVID-19. Descriptive statistics are reported alongside univariate and multivariable logistic regression models, with positive or negative responses to a question on app-based contact tracing as the dependent variable. Results: 26.1% of all CIE participants were included in the analysis (N = 12,434, 43.0% male, mean age 55.2). 60.3% of respondents were willing to participate in app-based contact tracing. Out of those who responded \"no\", 67.2% stated that this was due to privacy concerns. In univariate analysis, worsening mood, fear and anxiety in relation to changes in government rules around lockdown were associated with lower willingness to participate. Multivariable analysis showed that difficulty understanding government rules was associated with a decreased inclination to download the app, with those scoring 1-2 and 3-4 in their understanding of the new government rules being 45% and 27% less inclined to download the contact tracing app, respectively; when compared to those who rated their understanding as 5-6\/10 (OR for 1-2\/10 = 0.57 [CI 0.48 - 0.67]; OR for 3-4\/10 = 0.744 [CI 0.64 - 0.87]), whereas scores of 7-8 and 9-10 showed a 43% and 31% respective increase. Those reporting an unconfirmed belief of having previously had and recovered from COVID-19 were 27% less likely to be willing to download the app; belief of previous recovery from COVID-19 infection OR 0.727 [0.585 - 0.908]). Conclusions: In this large UK-wide questionnaire of wellbeing in lockdown, a willingness for app-based contact tracing is 60% - close to the estimated 56% population uptake, and substantially less than the smartphone-user uptake considered necessary for an app-based contact-tracing to be an effective intervention to help suppress an epidemic. Given this marginal level of support over an appropriate age range, the impacts of difficulty comprehending government advice and a policy of not testing to confirm self-reported COVID-19 infection during lockdown indicate that uncertainty in communication and diagnosis in adopted public health policies will negatively impact the effectiveness of a government contact tracing app.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patrik Bachtiger","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Alexander Adamson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jennifer K Quint","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Nicholas S Peters","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ruihua Chao","author_inst":"Shanghai Key Laboratory of Regulatory Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences and School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200241, Chin"},{"author_name":"Hangping Yao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases, Key Laboratory for Drug Evaluation and Clinical Research of Zhejiang Province, The Firs"},{"author_name":"Junwei Su","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases, Key Laboratory for Drug Evaluation and Clinical Research of Zhejiang Province, The Firs"},{"author_name":"Yanan Li","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Xiulan Li","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Yu Cao","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Yanyan Feng","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Ping Wang","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Yongyang Xia","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Yushuan Shang","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Fengping Li","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Pingju Ge","author_inst":"Acrobiosystems Inc., Beijing 100176, China"},{"author_name":"Xinglin Zhang","author_inst":"Acrobiosystems Inc., Beijing 100176, China"},{"author_name":"Wenjing Gao","author_inst":"Acrobiosystems Inc., Beijing 100176, China"},{"author_name":"Bing Du","author_inst":"Shanghai Key Laboratory of Regulatory Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences and School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200241, Chin"},{"author_name":"Tingbo Liang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, 79 Qingchun Road, Hangzhou 310003, China"},{"author_name":"Yunqing Qiu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases, Key Laboratory for Drug Evaluation and Clinical Research of Zhejiang Province, The Firs"},{"author_name":"Minyao Liu","author_inst":"The Institute of Biomedical Sciences and School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.26.20114009","rel_title":"How Should Clinicians Interpret Imprecise Trials Assessing Drugs for COVID-19 Patients?","rel_date":"2020-06-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.26.20114009","rel_abs":"As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, researchers are reporting findings of randomized trials comparing standard care with care augmented by experimental drugs. The trials have small sample sizes, so estimates of treatment effects are imprecise. Seeing imprecision, clinicians reading research articles may find it difficult to decide when to treat patients with experimental drugs. Whatever decision criterion one uses, there is always some probability that random variation in trial outcomes will lead to prescribing sub-optimal treatments. A conventional practice when comparing standard care and an innovation is to choose the innovation only if the estimated treatment effect is positive and statistically significant. This practice defers to standard care as the status quo. To evaluate decision criteria, we use the concept of near-optimality, which jointly considers the probability and magnitude of decision errors. An appealing decision criterion from this perspective is the empirical success rule, which chooses the treatment with the highest observed average patient outcome in the trial. Considering the design of recent and ongoing COVID-19 trials, we show that the empirical success rule yields treatment results that are much closer to optimal than those generated by prevailing decision criteria based on hypothesis tests.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Charles F.

Methods: We developed a case registry of successive patients admitted with suspected covid-19 infection to our hospital (n=501). Covid-19 was diagnosed using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Demographic, clinical, investigations details and outcomes were recorded. Descriptive statistics are presented. Results: Covid-19 was diagnosed in 234 (46.7%) and data compared with 267 (53.3%) negative controls. Mean age of covid-9 patients was 35.1+16.6y, 59.4% were <40y and 64% men. Symptoms were in less than 10% and comorbidities were in 4-8%. History of BCG vaccination was in 49% cases vs 10% controls. Cases compared to controls had significantly greater white cell (6.96+1.89 vs 6.12+1.69x109 cells\/L) and lower lymphocyte count (1.98+0.79 vs 2.32+0.91x109 cells\/L). No radiological and electrocardiographic abnormality was observed. All these were isolated or quarantined in the hospital and observed. Covid-19 patients received hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin according to prevalent guidelines. One patient needed oxygen support while hospital course was uncomplicated in the rest. All were discharged alive. Conversion to virus negative status was in 10.2+6.4 days and was significantly lower in age >40y (9.1+5.2) compared to 40-59y (11.3+6.1) and >60y (16.4+13.3) (p=0.001).

We aimed to explore the impact on the epidemic curve of fewer contacts when individuals reduce the time they spend on selected daily activities. Methods: We combined the large-scale empirical data of a social contact survey and a time-use survey to estimate contact matrices by age group (0-15, 16-24, 25-44, 45-64, 65+) and daily activity (work, schooling, transportation, and four leisure activities: social visits, bar\/cafe\/restaurant visits, park visits, and non-essential shopping). We assumed that reductions in time are proportional to reductions in contacts. The derived matrices were then applied in an age-structured dynamic-transmission model of COVID-19 to explore the effects. Findings: The relative reductions in the derived contact matrices were highest when closing schools (in ages 0-14 years), workplaces (15-64 years), and stopping social visits (65+ years). For COVID-19, the closure of workplaces, schools, and stopping social visits had the largest impact on reducing the epidemic curve and delaying its peak, while the predicted impact of fewer contacts in parks, bars\/cafes\/restaurants, and non-essential shopping were minimal. Interpretation: We successfully augmented contact matrices with time-use data to predict the highest impact of social distancing measures from reduced contacts when spending less time at work, school, and on social visits. Although the predicted impact from other leisure activities with potential for close physical contact were minimal, changes in mixing patterns and time-use immediately after re-allowing social activities may pose increased short-term transmission risks, especially in potentially crowded environments indoors.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Edwin van Leeuwen","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"- PHE Joint modelling group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Frank Sandmann","author_inst":"Public Health England; London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Prahalad Dhakad","author_inst":"RUHS College of Medical Sciences, Rajasthan University of Health Sciences, Jaipur 302033 India"},{"author_name":"Gaurav Dalela","author_inst":"RUHS College of Medical Sciences, Rajasthan University of Health Sciences, Jaipur 302033 India"},{"author_name":"Sudhanshu Kacker","author_inst":"RUHS College of Medical Sciences, Rajasthan University of Health Sciences, Jaipur 302033 India"},{"author_name":"Vasim Raja Panwar","author_inst":"Rajasthan Dental College, Bagru, Jaipur 302026 India"},{"author_name":"Raja Babu Panwar","author_inst":"Rajasthan University of Health Sciences, Jaipur 302033 India"},{"author_name":"Rajeev Gupta","author_inst":"Eternal Heart Care Centre & Research Institute, Jaipur 302017 India"},{"author_name":"Yu Cao","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Yanyan Feng","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Ping Wang","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Yongyang Xia","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Yushuan Shang","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Fengping Li","author_inst":"SymRay Biopharma Inc., Shanghai 200241, China"},{"author_name":"Pingju Ge","author_inst":"Acrobiosystems Inc., Beijing 100176, China"},{"author_name":"Xinglin Zhang","author_inst":"Acrobiosystems Inc., Beijing 100176, China"},{"author_name":"Wenjing Gao","author_inst":"Acrobiosystems Inc., Beijing 100176, China"},{"author_name":"Bing Du","author_inst":"Shanghai Key Laboratory of Regulatory Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences and School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200241, Chin"},{"author_name":"Tingbo Liang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, 79 Qingchun Road, Hangzhou 310003, China"},{"author_name":"Yunqing Qiu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases, Key Laboratory for Drug Evaluation and Clinical Research of Zhejiang Province, The Firs"},{"author_name":"Minyao Liu","author_inst":"The Institute of Biomedical Sciences and School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.02.20114967","rel_title":"Paediatric Dentistry and the coronavirus (COVID-19) response in the North East of England and North Cumbria","rel_date":"2020-06-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.02.20114967","rel_abs":"Introduction: Coronavirus (COVID-19) has dramatically changed the landscape of dentistry including Paediatric Dentistry.

Methods: A multicentre, single-arm, hypothesis-driven phase 2 trial was planned to study the effect of Tocilizumab on lethality rates at 14 and 30 days (co-primary endpoints). A cohort of patients consecutively enrolled after phase 2 was used as a validation dataset. A multivariable logistic regression was performed to generate hypotheses, while controlling for possible confounders. Results: out of 301 patients in phase 2 intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, 180 (59.8%) received tocilizumab. With 67 death events, lethality rates were 18.4% (97.5%CI: 13.6-24.0, P=0.52) and 22.4% (97.5%CI: 17.2-28.3, P<0.001) at 14 and 30 days.

Also, it supports a positive effect on lethality rate of the use of corticosteroids. Conclusions: Tocilizumab reduced lethality rate at 30 days compared with null hypothesis, without significant toxicity. Such result support the use of tocilizumab while waiting for ongoing phase 3 trials.","rel_num_authors":36,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Francesco Perrone","author_inst":"Clinical Trial Unit, Istituto Nazionale Tumori, IRCCS, Fondazione G.

Study design: National cross sectional community survey. Setting: Australian general public. Participants: Adults aged over 18 years (n=4362). Main outcome measures: Knowledge, attitudes and behaviours related to COVID-19; health literacy and socio-demographic factors. Results: People with inadequate health literacy had poorer understanding of COVID-19 symptoms (49% vs 68%; p<0.001), were less able to identify behaviours to prevent infection (59% vs 72%; p<0.001), and experienced more difficulty finding information and understanding government messaging about COVID-19 than people with adequate health literacy. They were less likely to rate social distancing as important (6.1 vs 6.5, p<0.001) and reported more difficulty remembering\/accessing medication since lockdown (3.6 vs 2.7, p<0.001). Importantly there was higher endorsement of misinformation beliefs related to COVID-19 and vaccination in people with lower health literacy. Similar results were observed among people who primarily speak a language other than English at home. Conclusion: Our findings show important disparities by health literacy and language in COVID-19 related knowledge, attitudes and behaviours that have the potential to undermine efforts to reduce viral transmission and may lead to social inequalities in health outcomes in Australia. Those with the greatest burden of chronic disease are most disadvantaged, and most likely to experience severe disease and die from COVID-19. Addressing the health literacy needs of the community in public health messaging about COVID-19 must now be a priority in Australia.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kirsten McCaffery","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Rachael H Dodd","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Erin Cvejic","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Julie Ayre","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Carys Batcup","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Jennifer MJ Isautier","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Tessa Copp","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Carissa Bonner","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Kristen Pickles","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Brooke Nickel","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Thomas Dakin","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Samuel Cornell","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Michael S Wolf","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Francesco Castelli","author_inst":"University of Brescia and ASST Spedali Civili, Brescia"},{"author_name":"Maria Lorenza Muiesan","author_inst":"University of Brescia and ASST Spedali Civili, Brescia"},{"author_name":"Miriam Lichtner","author_inst":"Sapienza University of Rome, Santa Maria Goretti Hospital, Latina"},{"author_name":"Carlo Calzetti","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases and Hepatology Unit AOU Parma"},{"author_name":"Nicola Duccio Salerno","author_inst":"UOC Malattie Infettive e Tropicali, AOUI, Verona"},{"author_name":"Luigi Atripaldi","author_inst":"Cotugno Hospital, AORN Ospedali dei Colli, Napoli"},{"author_name":"Marco Cascella","author_inst":"Anesthesia and Resuscitation Unit, Istituto Nazionale Tumori, IRCCS, Fondazione G.

SENA is highly sensitive, with its limit of detection being at least 2 copies\/reaction lower than that of the corresponding rRT-PCR, and highly specific, which identifies both false-negative and false-positive cases in clinic applications. SENA provides effective confirmation for nucleic acid amplification-based molecular diagnosis, and may immediately eliminate the uncertainty problems of rRT-PCR in SARS-CoV-2 clinic

Syndrome - Coronavirus-2' (SARS-CoV-2) infection causes Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), a mild to moderate respiratory tract infection in the majority of patients. A subset of patients, however, progresses to severe disease and respiratory failure with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Severe COVID-19 has been associated with increased neutrophil counts and dysregulated immune responses. The mechanisms of protective immunity in mild forms and the pathogenesis of dysregulated inflammation in severe courses of COVID-19 remain largely unclear. Here, we combined two single-cell RNA-sequencing technologies and single-cell proteomics in whole blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to determine changes in immune cell composition and activation in two independent dual-center patient cohorts (n=46 + n=54 COVID-19 samples), each with mild and severe cases of COVID-19. We observed a specific increase of HLA-DR high CD11c high inflammatory monocytes that displayed a strong interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene signature in patients with mild COVID-19, which was absent in severe disease. Instead, we found evidence of emergency myelopoiesis, marked by the occurrence of immunosuppressive pre-neutrophils and immature neutrophils and populations of dysfunctional and suppressive mature neutrophils, as well as suppressive HLA-DR low monocytes in severe COVID-19. Our study provides detailed insights into systemic immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and it reveals profound alterations in the peripheral myeloid cell compartment associated with severe courses of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":63,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jonas Schulte-Schrepping","author_inst":"Life & Medical Sciences (LIMES) Institute, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Nico Reusch","author_inst":"Life & Medical Sciences (LIMES) Institute, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Daniela Paclik","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Immunology, Charit\u00e9, Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Kevin Ba\u00dfler","author_inst":"Life & Medical Sciences (LIMES) Institute, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Stephan Schlickeiser","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Immunology, Charit\u00e9, Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany; BIH Center for Regenerative Therapies, Charit\u00e9 and  Berlin Institute of H"},{"author_name":"Bowen Zhang","author_inst":"Centre for Individualised Infection Medicine (CiiM) & TWINCORE, joint ventures between the Helmholtz-Centre for Infection Research (HZI) and the Hannover Medica"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Kr\u00e4mer","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn Germany"},{"author_name":"Tobias Krammer","author_inst":"Helmholtz Institute for RNA-based Infection Research (HIRI), Helmholtz-Center for Infection Research (HZI), W\u00fcrzburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Sophia Brumhard","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, Charit\u00e9 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Bonaguro","author_inst":"Life & Medical Sciences (LIMES) Institute, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Elena De Domenico","author_inst":"PRECISE Platform for Single Cell Genomics and Epigenomics, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Bonn, Germany and University of Bonn, Bonn Germany"},{"author_name":"Daniel Wendisch","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, Charit\u00e9 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Martin Grasshoff","author_inst":"Centre for Individualised Infection Medicine (CiiM) & TWINCORE, joint ventures between the Helmholtz-Centre for Infection Research (HZI) and the Hannover Medica"},{"author_name":"Theodore S.

Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive sense, single-stranded RNA viruses and employ a complicated pattern of virus genome length RNA replication as well as transcription of genome length and leader containing subgenomic RNAs. Although not fully understood, both replication and transcription are thought to take place in so-called double-membrane vesicles in the cytoplasm of infected cells. We here describe detection of SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic RNAs in diagnostic samples up to 17 days after initial detection of infection, provide evidence for their nuclease resistance and likely protection by cellular membranes consistent with being part of virus-induced replication organelles. Furthermore, we show that the ratios of genomic to subgenomic RNA as well as the ratios of plus to negative strand RNA of genomic and subgenomic RNA are consistent with what have been detected for other coronaviruses in cell culture; albeit with the caveat that in vivo diagnostic samples, even in relatively early infection, the ratios of these RNAs are most reminiscent of late culture, semi-purified virus preparations shown to have a relatively constant ratio of genomic to subgenomic RNAs of around 5-10 or higher, while the ratios of positive to negative strands are more than 100 for the genomic RNA and around 20 for the subgenomic RNAs. Overall, our results may help explain the extended PCR positivity of some samples, and may also, at least in part, help explain discrepancies in results of different diagnostic PCR methods described by others; in particular for samples with a low virus load or of poor quality. Overall, we present evidence that subgenomic RNAs may not be an indicator of active coronavirus replication\/infection, but that these RNAs, similar to the virus genome RNA, may be rather stable, and thus detectable for an extended period, most likely due to their close association with cellular membranes.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Soren Alexandersen","author_inst":"Deakin University"},{"author_name":"Anthony Chamings","author_inst":"Deakin University"},{"author_name":"Tarka Raj Bhatta","author_inst":"Deakin University"},{"author_name":"Kevin Ba\u00dfler","author_inst":"Life & Medical Sciences (LIMES) Institute, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Stephan Schlickeiser","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Immunology, Charit\u00e9, Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany; BIH Center for Regenerative Therapies, Charit\u00e9 and  Berlin Institute of H"},{"author_name":"Bowen Zhang","author_inst":"Centre for Individualised Infection Medicine (CiiM) & TWINCORE, joint ventures between the Helmholtz-Centre for Infection Research (HZI) and the Hannover Medica"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Kr\u00e4mer","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn Germany"},{"author_name":"Tobias Krammer","author_inst":"Helmholtz Institute for RNA-based Infection Research (HIRI), Helmholtz-Center for Infection Research (HZI), W\u00fcrzburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Sophia Brumhard","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, Charit\u00e9 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Bonaguro","author_inst":"Life & Medical Sciences (LIMES) Institute, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Elena De Domenico","author_inst":"PRECISE Platform for Single Cell Genomics and Epigenomics, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Bonn, Germany and University of Bonn, Bonn Germany"},{"author_name":"Daniel Wendisch","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, Charit\u00e9 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Martin Grasshoff","author_inst":"Centre for Individualised Infection Medicine (CiiM) & TWINCORE, joint ventures between the Helmholtz-Centre for Infection Research (HZI) and the Hannover Medica"},{"author_name":"Theodore S.

To address this issue, re-use of surgical face masks and filtering facepiece respirators has been recommended; prior decontamination is paramount to their re-use. Aim We aim to provide information on the effects of three decontamination procedures on porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV)-contaminated masks and respirators, presenting a stable model for infectious coronavirus decontamination of these typically single-use-only products. Methods Surgical masks and filtering facepiece respirator coupons and straps were inoculated with infectious PRCV and submitted to three decontamination treatments, UV irradiation, vaporised H2O2, and dry heat treatment. Viruses were recovered from sample materials and viral titres were measured in swine testicle cells. Findings UV irradiation, vaporised H2O2 and dry heat reduced infectious PRCV by more than three orders of magnitude on mask and respirator coupons and rendered it undetectable in all decontamination assays. Conclusion This is the first description of stable disinfection of face masks and filtering facepiece respirators contaminated with an infectious SARS-CoV-2 surrogate using UV irradiation, vaporised H2O2 and dry heat treatment. The three methods permit demonstration of a loss of infectivity by more than three orders of magnitude of an infectious coronavirus in line with the FDA policy regarding face masks and respirators. It presents advantages of uncomplicated manipulation and utilisation in a BSL2 facility, therefore being easily adaptable to other respirator and mask types.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Louisa F Ludwig-Begall","author_inst":"Veterinary Virology and Animal Viral Diseases, Department of Infectious and Parasitic Diseases, FARAH Research Centre, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Liege Uni"},{"author_name":"Constance Wielick","author_inst":"Veterinary Virology and Animal Viral Diseases, Department of Infectious and Parasitic Diseases, FARAH Research Centre, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Liege Uni"},{"author_name":"Lorene Dams","author_inst":"Veterinary Virology and Animal Viral Diseases, Department of Infectious and Parasitic Diseases, FARAH Research Centre, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Liege Uni"},{"author_name":"Hans Nauwynck","author_inst":"Laboratory of Virology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University, Merelbeke, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Pierre-Francois Demeuldre","author_inst":"Department of Hospital Pharmacy, The University Hospital Center, University of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Aurore Napp","author_inst":"Department of Hospital Pharmacy, The University Hospital Center, University of Liege, Liege, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Jan Laperre","author_inst":"Centexbel Textile Research Centre, Grace-Hollogne, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Eric Haubruge","author_inst":"TERRA Research Centre, Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech, University of Liege, Gembloux, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Etienne Thiry","author_inst":"Veterinary Virology and Animal Viral Diseases, Department of Infectious and Parasitic Diseases, FARAH Research Centre, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Liege Uni"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Bonaguro","author_inst":"Life & Medical Sciences (LIMES) Institute, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Elena De Domenico","author_inst":"PRECISE Platform for Single Cell Genomics and Epigenomics, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Bonn, Germany and University of Bonn, Bonn Germany"},{"author_name":"Daniel Wendisch","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, Charit\u00e9 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Martin Grasshoff","author_inst":"Centre for Individualised Infection Medicine (CiiM) & TWINCORE, joint ventures between the Helmholtz-Centre for Infection Research (HZI) and the Hannover Medica"},{"author_name":"Theodore S.

The country has 27 federative units, with wide regional differences related to climate, lifestyle habits, socioeconomic characteristics and population density. Therefore, we aimed to document and monitor the increase in COVID 19 cases across each federative unit in Brazil, by tracking its progression from inception to 15 May 2020. Methods: Observational study. Results: The first confirmed COVID 19 case in the country was notified in Sao Paulo on 26 February, while the first death occurred on 17 March, in Rio de Janeiro. Since then, there has been a dramatic increase in both confirmed cases and deaths from the disease. Sao Paulo, in the Southeast region, was initially considered the COVID 19 epidemic epicentre in Brazil. However, 10 states in the North and Northeast regions were ranked among the 14 highest incidences (over 100 cases per 100,000 people) observed on 15 May. Higher incidence rates (>100 cases per 100,000) were associated to higher rates of inadequate water supply and sewerage (OR, 5.83 (95% CI, 1.08 to 29.37, P=0.041)). North and Northeast states with the highest social vulnerability index scores had higher increases in the incidence rate between 14 April and 15 May. States with medium human development index (HDI) showed higher incidence increases from 14 April to 15 May, being seven of them with ratios in the range from 27.49 to 63.73 times. Conclusion: Spreading of COVID 19 in Brazil differs across both regions and federative units, being influenced by different socioeconomic contexts.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elvira Maria Guerra-Shinohara","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Simone Schneider Weber","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Clovis Paniz","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Santa Maria, Santa Maria , RS, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Guilherme Wataru Gomes","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Jun Shinohara","author_inst":"Companhia Ambiental do Estado de Sao Paulo, CETESB, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Tiago Borges Ribeiro Gandra","author_inst":"Instituto Federal de Educacao Ciencia e Tecnologia do Rio Grande do Sul, Rio Grande, RS, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Indiara Correia Pereira","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Karine Gomes Jarcem","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Renato Ferreira de Almeida Zanre","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Acacia Gimenez Barreto","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Diogo De Carli","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Daniel Wendisch","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, Charit\u00e9 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Martin Grasshoff","author_inst":"Centre for Individualised Infection Medicine (CiiM) & TWINCORE, joint ventures between the Helmholtz-Centre for Infection Research (HZI) and the Hannover Medica"},{"author_name":"Theodore S.

Since its emergence in December 2019, the virus has infected millions of people, caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands and resulted in incalculable social and economic damage. Understanding the infectivity and transmission dynamics of the virus is essential for understanding how best to reduce mortality whilst ensuring minimal social restrictions to the lives of the general population. Anecdotal evidence is available, but detailed studies have not yet revealed whether infection with the virus results in immunity. Objective: The objective of the study was to use mathematical modelling to investigate the reinfection frequency of COVID-19. Methods: We have used the SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) framework and random processing based on empirical SARS-CoV-2 infection and fatality data from different regions to calculate the number of reinfections that would be expected to occur if no immunity to the disease occurred. Results: Our model predicts that cases of reinfection should have been observed by now if primary SARS-CoV-2 infection did not protect from subsequent exposure in the short term, however, no such cases have been documented. Conclusions: This work concludes that infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus provides short-term immunity to reinfection and therefore provides a useful insight for serological testing strategies, lockdown easing and vaccine design.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew McMahon","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Nicole C.

However, the clinical performance of many of them is still insufficiently described. Therefore we compared three commercial, CE-marked, SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays side by side. Methods: We included a total of 1,154 specimens from pre-COVID-19 times and 65 samples from COVID-19 patients ([&ge;]14 days after symptom onset) to evaluate the test performance of SARS-CoV-2 serological assays by Abbott, Roche, and DiaSorin. Results: All three assays presented with high specificities: 99.2% (98.6-99.7) for Abbott, 99.7% (99.2-100.0) for Roche, and 98.3% (97.3-98.9) for DiaSorin. In contrast to the manufacturers' specifications, sensitivities only ranged from 83.1% to 89.2%. Although the three methods were in good agreement (Cohen's Kappa 0.71-0.87), McNemar's test revealed significant differences between results obtained from Roche and DiaSorin. However, at low seroprevalences, the minor differences in specificity resulted in profound discrepancies of positive predictability at 1% seroprevalence: 52.3% (36.2-67.9), 77.6% (52.8-91.5), and 32.6% (23.6-43.1) for Abbott, Roche, and DiaSorin, respectively. Conclusion: We find diagnostically relevant differences in specificities for the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays by Abbott, Roche, and DiaSorin that have a significant impact on the positive predictability of these tests.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas Perkmann","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Nicole Perkmann-Nagele","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Marie-Kathrin Breyer","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine and Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for COPD and Respiratory Epidemiology, Otto Wagner Hospital, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Robab Breyer-Kohansal","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine and Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for COPD and Respiratory Epidemiology, Otto Wagner Hospital, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Otto C Burghuber","author_inst":"Sigmund Freud University, Medical School and Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for COPD and Respiratory Epidemiology, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Sylvia Hartl","author_inst":"Otto Wagner Hospital, Vienna, Austria and Sigmund Freud University, Medical School and Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for COPD and Respiratory Epidemiology, Vienna,"},{"author_name":"Daniel Aletaha","author_inst":"Divison of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Daniela Sieghart","author_inst":"Divison of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Peter Quehenberger","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Rodrig Marculescu","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Patrick Mucher","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Robert Strassl","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Oswald F Wagner","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Christoph J Binder","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Helmuth Haslacher","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Tal Pecht","author_inst":"Life & Medical Sciences (LIMES) Institute, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Adem Saglam","author_inst":"PRECISE Platform for Single Cell Genomics and Epigenomics, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Bonn, Germany and University of Bonn, Bonn Germany"},{"author_name":"Oliver Dietrich","author_inst":"Helmholtz Institute for RNA-based Infection Research (HIRI), Helmholtz-Center for Infection Research (HZI), W\u00fcrzburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Henrik E.

We aim to investigate the therapeutic effect of arbidol and moxifloxacin in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods We collected and analyzed data on 94 patients with COVID-19 including 27 severe patients at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and 74 ordinary patients at general isolation ward in Wuhan Xiehe Hospital, from February 15, 2020 to March 15, 2020. All patients were treated with arbidol (100mg each time, three times a day for 14 days) and moxifloxacin (0.4g each time, once a day for 7-14 days). Other data was also collected including demographic data, symptoms, laboratory findings, treatments and clinical outcomes. Results In basic characteristics, compared with the ordinary patients, the severe patients were older (median age was 63.0 years V.S 57.0 years, p=0.03), had higher proportion of hypertension (30% V.S 9%, p=0.03), higher possibility of getting fatigue and\/or myalgia (26% V.S 6%, p=0.03), and had more obvious dyspnea symptom (26% V.S 3%, p=0.006). In regarding to laboratory results, we found the severe patients have higher white blood cell counts (p=0.003), neutrophil counts (p=0.007), higher levels of D-dimer (p<0.001), ALT (p<0.001) and AST (p=0.013) than the ordinary patients. After treatment of arbidol and moxifloxacin for one week, the rates of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid turning negative were 69.2% in the severe group and 77.8% in the ordinary group. A peculiar phenomenon was that IL-6 stands out among the cytokines in both groups, and higher in severe group than the ordinary one (p=0.011). After treating with arbidol and moxifloxacin for one week, IL-6 decreased significantly in severe group (p=0.023). Conclusion In summary, we proved the treatment of arbidol and moxifloxacin could be helpful in reducing viral load and inflammation during SARS-CoV2 infection, especially for negatively regulating fatal inflammation in severe COVID-19 patients. However, more evidence awaits further clinical verification.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"DONGSHAN YU","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"SHUILIN SUN","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"YANHUA LI","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"WENNA XI","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"DI JIN","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"KE SUN","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"RONGYAN YU","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"XUEBING YAO","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"ZHIYING SONG","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"AOYU YANG","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"RUIXIA LUO","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"BIAOSHU ZOU","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"YUN LIU","author_inst":"Central Sterile Supply Department, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"Christoph J Binder","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Helmuth Haslacher","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Tal Pecht","author_inst":"Life & Medical Sciences (LIMES) Institute, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Adem Saglam","author_inst":"PRECISE Platform for Single Cell Genomics and Epigenomics, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Bonn, Germany and University of Bonn, Bonn Germany"},{"author_name":"Oliver Dietrich","author_inst":"Helmholtz Institute for RNA-based Infection Research (HIRI), Helmholtz-Center for Infection Research (HZI), W\u00fcrzburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Henrik E.

Different groups of COVID-19 patients may be identified on the basis of clinical behavior and a strong correlation between groups and age and comorbidities as well as with the immune profile is demonstrated. A lower age correlates with a lower severity of the disease differentiating between patients who may be quarantined at home and those requiring hospitalization. An older age (>82 years) together with a higher number of comorbidities is associated to a very severe prognosis. The absolute number of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T lymphocytes was progressively decreasing according to the severity of the disease and a CD3+ and CD8+ threshold indicating very severe cases is suggested.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nathalie Santoro","author_inst":"Laboratory of Immunopathology, Division of Pathology, Azienda Ospedaliera Ordine Mauriziano, Turin, Italy."},{"author_name":"Alessandro Cignetti","author_inst":"Division of Hematology and Cell Therapy, Azienda Ospedaliera Ordine Mauriziano, Turin, Italy."},{"author_name":"Valerio Tenace","author_inst":"Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Utah, USA"},{"author_name":"Ines Clotilde Casonato","author_inst":"Clinical Chemistry and Microbiology Laboratory, Azienda Ospedaliera Ordine Mauriziano, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Domenico Cosseddu","author_inst":"Clinical Chemistry and Microbiology Laboratory, Azienda Ospedaliera Ordine Mauriziano, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Margherita Vizzini","author_inst":"Laboratory of Immunopathology, Division of Pathology, Azienda Ospedaliera Ordine Mauriziano, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giovanni De Rosa","author_inst":"Division of Pathology, Azienda Ospedaliera Ordine Mauriziano, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Massimo Geuna","author_inst":"Laboratory of Immunopathology, Division of Pathology, Azienda Ospedaliera Ordine Mauriziano, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"ZHIYING SONG","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"AOYU YANG","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"RUIXIA LUO","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"BIAOSHU ZOU","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"YUN LIU","author_inst":"Central Sterile Supply Department, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"Christoph J Binder","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Helmuth Haslacher","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Tal Pecht","author_inst":"Life & Medical Sciences (LIMES) Institute, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Adem Saglam","author_inst":"PRECISE Platform for Single Cell Genomics and Epigenomics, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Bonn, Germany and University of Bonn, Bonn Germany"},{"author_name":"Oliver Dietrich","author_inst":"Helmholtz Institute for RNA-based Infection Research (HIRI), Helmholtz-Center for Infection Research (HZI), W\u00fcrzburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Henrik E.

At the beginning of the epidemic, a confluence of factors resulted in delayed deployment of PCR-based diagnostic tests, resulting in lack of testing of individuals with symptoms of the disease. Although these tests are now more widely available, it is estimated that a three- to ten-fold increase in testing capacity will be required to ensure adequate surveillance as communities reopen(1). In response to these challenges, we evaluated potential roles of host-response based screening in the diagnosis of COVID-19. Previous work from our group showed that the nasopharyngeal (NP) level of CXCL10, a protein produced as part of the host response to viral infection, is a sensitive predictor of respiratory virus infection across a wide spectrum of viruses(2). Here, we show that NP CXCL10 is elevated during SARS-CoV-2 infection and use a CXCL10-based screening strategy to identify four undiagnosed cases of COVID-19 in Connecticut in early March. In a second set of samples tested at the Yale New Haven Hospital, we show that NP CXCL10 had excellent performance as a rule-out test (NPV 0.99, 95% C.I. 0.985-0.997). Our results demonstrate how biomarker-based screening could be used to leverage existing PCR testing capacity to rapidly enable widespread testing for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nagarjuna R.

In particular, population use of BCG vaccine has been associated with improved outcomes. This study sought to determine the association of population use of BCG, adult pneumococcal and adult seasonal influenza vaccination with Covid-19 mortality when adjusted for a number of confounding variables. Methods: Using publicly available data, mortality adjusted for the timeframe of crisis, population size and population characteristics was calculated. The primary analysis was the relationship between each of the day 15 and day 30 standardised mortality rates and BCG, adult pneumococcal and influenza vaccination scores using unadjusted measures and with adjustment for population structure and case fatality rates. Secondary analyses were measures of case increases and mortality increases from day 15 to day 30 for each of the relative vaccination scores. Finally, we also analysed the peak Z score reflecting increases in total mortality from historical averages reported by EuroMOMO (Euromomo.eu), Results: Following adjustment for the effects of population size, median age, population density, the proportion of population living in an urban setting, life-expectancy, the elderly dependency ratio (or proportion over 65 years), net migration, days from day 1 to lockdown and case-fatality rate, only BCG vaccination score remained significantly associated with Covid-19 mortality at day 30. In the best fit model, BCG vaccination score was associated with a 64% reduction in log(10) mortality per 10 million population (OR 0.362 reduction [95% CI 0.188 to 0.698]), following adjustment for population size, median age, density, urbanization, elderly dependency ratio, days to lockdown, yearly migration and case fatality rate. Conclusion BCG vaccine was associated with reduced mortality rates in level 4 countries while adult pneumococcal and adult seasonal influenza vaccines were not when adjusted for a number of confounding variables. A number of trials are ongoing to determine if BCG is protective against severe Covid-19 infection.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joe Gallagher","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Chris Watson","author_inst":"Queens University Belfast"},{"author_name":"Mark Ledwidge","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Tara Alpert","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Chantal B.F.

Methods: In the Ile-de-France region, from February 20 to May 5, 2020, emergency medical service (EMS) calls and the response provided (ambulances) together the percentage of positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests, general practitioner (GP) and emergency department (ED) visits, and hospital admissions of COVID-19 patients were recorded daily and compared to the number of COVID-19 ICU patients. Correlation curve analysis was performed to determine the best correlation coefficient (R), depending on the number of days the indicator has been shifted. A delay [&ge;]7 days was considered as an early alert, and a delay [&ge;]14 days a very early alert. Findings: EMS calls, percentage of positive RT-PCR tests, ambulances used, ED and GP visits of COVID-19 patients were strongly associated with COVID-19 ICU patients with an anticipation delay of 23, 15, 14, 13, and 12 days respectively. Hospitalization did not anticipate ICU bed requirement. Interpretation: The daily number of COVID19-related telephone calls received by the EMS and corresponding dispatch ambulances, and the proportion of positive RT-PCR tests were the earliest indicators of the number of COVID19 patients requiring ICU care during the epidemic crisis in the Ile-de-France region, rapidly followed by ED and GP visits. This information may help health authorities to anticipate a future epidemic, including a second wave of COVID19 or decide additional social measures.

One is the existence of asymptomatic carriers which is the hidden variable in the problem. The other is the issue of latency which means that among the symptomatic carriers there could be a fraction whose symptoms develop after a couple of days. We write down a Henon-like map to take these effects into account and find that the map has an unusual fixed point which corresponds to a very high ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic infected persons. This fixed point has its own stability zone and influences the dynamics overall. Although a rather elementary model, we show that it is not totally devoid of reality.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Akshay Pal","author_inst":"Indian Association for the cultivation of science"},{"author_name":"Jayanta Bhattacharjee","author_inst":"Indian Association for the cultivation of science"},{"author_name":"Mark Ledwidge","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Tara Alpert","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Chantal B.F.

This strategy was effective in preventing epidemic growth and reducing the incidence of COVID-19 to low levels. In this report, we present the first epidemiological and statistical analysis of the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in Hungary. Then, we establish an age-structured compartmental model to explore alternative post-lockdown scenarios. We incorporate various factors, such as age-specific measures, seasonal effects, and spatial heterogeneity to project the possible peak size and disease burden of a COVID-19 epidemic wave after the current measures are relaxed.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gergely R\u00f6st","author_inst":"Bolyai Institute, University of Szeged, Hungary"},{"author_name":"Ferenc A.

The potential for racial-justice interventions, including reparations payments, to ameliorate these disparities has not been adequately explored. Methods We compared the COVID-19 time-varying Rt curves of relatively disparate polities in terms of social equity (South Korea vs. Louisiana). Next, we considered a range of reproductive ratios to back-calculate the transmission rates {beta}i[-&gt;]j for 4 cells of the simplified next-generation matrix (from which R0 is calculated for structured models) for the outbreak in Louisiana. Lastly, we modeled the effect that monetary payments as reparations for Black American descendants of persons enslaved in the U.S. would have had on pre-intervention {beta}i[-&gt;]j. Results Once their respective epidemics begin to propagate, Louisiana displays Rt values with an absolute difference of 1.3 to 2.5 compared to South Korea. It also takes Louisiana more than twice as long to bring Rt below 1. We estimate that increased equity in transmission consistent with the benefits of a successful reparations program (reflected in the ratio {beta}b[-&gt;]b \/ {beta}w[-&gt;]w) could reduce R0 by 31 to 68%. Discussion While there are compelling moral and historical arguments for racial injustice interventions such as reparations, our study describes potential health benefits in the form of reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk. As we demonstrate, a restitutive program targeted towards Black individuals would not only decrease COVID-19 risk for recipients of the wealth redistribution; the mitigating effects would be distributed across racial groups, benefitting the population at large.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eugene T Richardson","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Momin M Malik","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"William A Darity Jr.","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"A Kirsten Mullen","author_inst":"Artefactual"},{"author_name":"Maya Malik","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Adia Benton","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Mary T Bassett","author_inst":"Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Paul E.

Methods: Assuming PCR to be the gold standard, we used a convenience sampling of mostly symptomatic COVID-19 suspect hospital patients who had already been tested for internal validation and guideline development purposes by both PCR and POCT to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of POCT with Clopper-Pearson 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: During the study period, 113 paired patient samples met eligibility criteria. The sensitivity of POCT in this population was calculated to be 94.1% [CI 71.31-99.85%] and the specificity was 99.0% [CI 94.33-99.97%]. Conclusions: Based on the lower sensitivity of POCT and the estimated prevalence of COVID-19 in our symptomatic and asymptomatic hospital patients, we recommend a two-pronged testing approach in which COVID-19 suspect patients are tested by the more sensitive PCR, while asymptomatic patients with a low pre-test probability of infection are tested with POCT supplemented by PCR confirmation of positive results. Furthermore, isolation decisions should not be based on POCT results alone.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohiedean Ghofrani","author_inst":"PeaceHealth"},{"author_name":"Mary T Casas","author_inst":"PeaceHealth"},{"author_name":"Robert K Pelz","author_inst":"PeaceHealth"},{"author_name":"Catherine Kroll","author_inst":"PeaceHealth"},{"author_name":"Natalie Blum","author_inst":"PeaceHealth"},{"author_name":"Scott D Foster","author_inst":"PeaceHealth"},{"author_name":"Mary T Bassett","author_inst":"Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Paul E.

The objective of this study was to investigate potential county-level disparities among racial\/ethnic and economic groups in COVID-19 burden which was measured using confirmed cases and deaths in 100,000 population. Design. Secondary data analysis Using county-level data for 3,142 US counties was conducted in 2020. Hierarchical linear regression and concentration curve analyses were performed. The combined association of COVID-19 cases and deaths was examined separately by sociodemographic and economic characteristics of the county population. Data from the American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates (2014-2018), Area Health Resources File (AHRF) 2018-2019, and 2020 COVID-19 data from Johns Hopkins University were used in this study. Results. After adjusting for covariates, US counties with a higher proportion of the black population, and a higher proportion of adults with less than high school diploma had disproportionately higher COVID-19 cases and deaths ({beta}>0, p<0.05). A higher proportion of the Hispanic population was associated with higher confirmed cases ({beta}= 1.03, 95% CI= 0.57-1.5), and higher housing cost to household income ratio was associated with higher deaths ({beta}= 3.74, 95% CI= 2.14-5.37). This can potentially aggravate the existing health disparities among these population groups. Conclusions. Identification of disproportionately impacted population groups can pave the way towards narrowing the disparity gaps and guide policymakers and stakeholders in designing and implementing population group-specific interventions to mitigate the negative consequences of COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ahmad Khanijahani","author_inst":"Duquesne University"},{"author_name":"Mary T Casas","author_inst":"PeaceHealth"},{"author_name":"Robert K Pelz","author_inst":"PeaceHealth"},{"author_name":"Catherine Kroll","author_inst":"PeaceHealth"},{"author_name":"Natalie Blum","author_inst":"PeaceHealth"},{"author_name":"Scott D Foster","author_inst":"PeaceHealth"},{"author_name":"Mary T Bassett","author_inst":"Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Paul E.

Recommendations to prevent infection include appropriate and frequent handwashing plus physical and social distancing. We conducted an exploratory observational study to assess compliance with these recommendations in selected transportation stations in Ghana. A one-hour audit of 45 public transport stations in the Greater Accra region was carried out between 27th and 29th March 2020. Using an adapted World Health Organization (WHO) hand hygiene assessment scale, the availability and use of handwashing facilities, social distancing, and ongoing public education on COVID-19 prevention measures were assessed, weighted and scored to determine the level of compliance of stations. Compliance with recommendations was categorized as 'inadequate', 'basic', 'intermediate' and 'advanced', based on the overall score. Majority (80%) of stations in Accra have at least one Veronica Bucket with flowing water and soap, but the number of washing places at each station is not adequate. Only a small minority (18%) of stations were communicating the need to wash hands frequently and appropriately, and to practice social\/physical distancing while at the station. In most stations (95%), hand washing practice was either not observed, or only infrequently. Almost all stations (93%) did not have alcohol-based hand sanitizers available for public use, while social distancing was rarely practiced (only 2%). In over 90% of the stations, face masks were either not worn or only worn by a few passengers. Compliance with COVID-19 prevention measures was inadequate in 13 stations, basic in 16 stations, intermediate in 7 stations, and advanced in 9 stations. Compliance with COVID-19 prevention measures in public transportation stations in the Greater Accra region remains a challenge. Awareness creation should aim to elevate COVID-19 risk perception of transportation operators and clients. Transport operators and stations need support and guidance to enforce hand washing and social distancing.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Harriet Bonful","author_inst":"University of Ghana"},{"author_name":"Adolphina Addo-Lartey","author_inst":"University of Ghana"},{"author_name":"Justice Aheto","author_inst":"University of Ghana"},{"author_name":"john Ganle","author_inst":"University of Ghana"},{"author_name":"Bismark Sarfo","author_inst":"Unviersity of Ghana"},{"author_name":"Richmond Aryeetey","author_inst":"University of Ghana"},{"author_name":"Mary T Bassett","author_inst":"Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Paul E.

This paper assesses the likely consequences for medical schools in particular, beginning with an overview of the research literature on predicted grades, concluding that calculated grades are likely to correlate strongly with the predicted grades that schools currently provide on UCAS applications. A notable absence from the literature is evidence on whether predicted grades are better or worse than actual grades in predicting university outcomes. This paper provides such evidence on the reduced predictive validity of predicted A-level grades in comparison with actual A-level grades. The present study analyses the extensive data on predicted and actual grades which are available in UKMED (United Kingdom Medical Education Database), a large-scale administrative dataset containing longitudinal data from medical school application, through undergraduate and then postgraduate training. In particular, predicted A-level grades as well as actual A-level grades are available, along with undergraduate outcomes and postgraduate outcomes which can be used to assess predictive validity of measures collected at selection. This study looks at two UKMED datasets. In the first dataset we compare actual and predicted A-level grades in 237,030 A-levels taken by medical school applicants between 2010 and 2018. 48.8% of predicted grades were accurate, grades were over-predicted in 44.7% of cases and under-predicted in 6.5% of cases. Some A-level subjects, General Studies in particular, showed a higher degree of over-estimation. Similar over-prediction was found for Extended Project Qualifications, and for SQA Advanced Highers. The second dataset considered 22,150 18-year old applicants to medical school in 2010 to 2014, who had both predicted and actual A-level grades. 12,600 students entered medical school and had final year outcomes available. In addition there were postgraduate outcomes for 1,340 doctors. Undergraduate outcomes are predicted significantly better by actual, attained A-level grades than by predicted A-level grades, as is also the case for postgraduate outcomes. Modelling the effect of selecting only on calculated grades suggests that because of the lesser predictive ability of predicted grades, medical school cohorts for the 2020 entry year are likely to under-attain, with 13% more gaining the equivalent of the current lowest decile of performance, and 16% fewer gaining the equivalent of the current top decile, effects which are then likely to follow through into postgraduate training. The problems of predicted\/calculated grades can to some extent, although not entirely, be ameliorated, by taking U(K)CAT, BMAT, and perhaps other measures into account to supplement calculated grades. Medical schools will probably also need to consider whether additional teaching is needed for entrants who are struggling, or might have missed out on important aspects of A-level teaching, with extra support being needed, so that standards are maintained.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ian Christopher McManus","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Katherine Woolf","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Dave Harrison","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Paul Tiffin","author_inst":"University of York"},{"author_name":"Lewis Paton","author_inst":"University of York"},{"author_name":"Kevin Yet Fong Cheung","author_inst":"Cambridge Assessment"},{"author_name":"Daniel Smith","author_inst":"General Medical Council, UK"},{"author_name":"Paul E.

To understand how applicants from diverse social backgrounds might differ in these regards. Design Cross-sectional questionnaire study forming part of the longitudinal United Kingdom Medical Applicant Cohort Study (UKMACS). Setting United Kingdom medical school admissions. Participants 2887 participants (68% female; 64% with at least one degree-educated parent; 63% with at least one parent in the highest socioeconomic group) completed an online questionnaire between 8th and 22nd April 2020. To be invited to complete the questionnaire, participants had to have registered to take the University Clinical Admissions Test (UCAT) in 2019 and to have agreed to be invited to take part in the study, or they needed to have completed one or more previous UKMACS questionnaires. They also need to have been seriously considering applying to study medicine in the UK for entry in 2020 between May and October 2019, and be resident in the UK or Islands\/Crown Dependencies. Main outcome measures Views on calculated grades, views on potential changes to medical school admissions and teaching in 2020 and 2021, reported experiences of education following the closure of educational institutions in March 2020. Results Respondents had concerns about the calculated grades that will replace A-level examinations, especially female applicants and applicants from Black Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) backgrounds who felt teachers would find it difficult to grade and rank students accurately, as well as those from non-selective state schools and those living in deprived areas who had some concerns about the grade standardisation process. Calculated grades were not considered fair enough by a majority to use in the acceptance or rejection of medical offer-holders, but several measures - including interview and aptitude test scores - were considered fair enough to use in combination. Respondents from non-selective state (public) schools reported less use of and less access to educational resources compared to their counterparts at private\/selective schools. In particular they reported less online teaching in real time, and reported spending less time studying during the lockdown. Conclusions The coronavirus pandemic will have significant and long term impacts on the selection, education and performance of our future medical workforce. It is important that the views and experiences of medical applicants from diverse backgrounds are taken into consideration in decisions affecting their futures and the future of the profession.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Katherine Woolf","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Dave Harrison","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"I.C.

Design: Retrospective clinical audit and simulation model. Setting: Multiple UK NHS ophthalmology centres. Participants: Data on the reduction in new nAMD referrals was obtained from four NHS Trusts in England comparing April 2020 to April 2019. To estimate the potential impact on one-year visual outcomes, a stratified bootstrap simulation model was developed drawing on an electronic medical records dataset of 20,825 nAMD eyes from 27 NHS Trusts. Main outcome measures: Simulated mean visual acuity and proportions of eyes with vision [&le;]6\/60, [&le;]6\/24 and [&ge;]6\/12 at one year under four hypothetical scenarios: no treatment delay, 3, 6 and 9-month treatment delays. Estimated additional number of eyes with vision [&le;]6\/60 at one year nationally. Results: The number of nAMD referrals at four major eye treatment hospital groups based in England dropped on average by 72% (range 65 to 87%) in April 2020 compared to April 2019. Simulated one-year visual outcomes for 1000 nAMD eyes with a 3-month treatment delay suggested an increase in the proportion of eyes with vision [&le;]6\/60 from 15.5% (13.2 to 17.9) to 23.3% (20.7 to25.9), and a decrease in the proportion of eyes with vision [&ge;]6\/12 (driving vision) from 35.1% (32.1 to 38.1) to 26.4% (23.8 to29.2). Outcomes worsened incrementally with longer modelled delays. Assuming nAMD referrals are reduced to this level at the national level for only one month, these simulated results suggest an additional 186-365 eyes with vision [&le;]6\/60 at one-year with even a short treatment delay. Conclusions: We report a large decrease in nAMD referrals during the first month of COVID-19 lockdown and provide an important public health message regarding the risk of delayed treatment. As a conservative estimate, a treatment delay of 3 months could lead to a >50% relative increase in the number of eyes with vision [&le;]6\/60 and 25% relative decrease in the number of eyes with driving vision at one year.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Darren S Thomas","author_inst":"Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Alasdair Warwick","author_inst":"Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London, London, UK & Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK."},{"author_name":"Abraham Olvera-Barrios","author_inst":"Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Turst & Institute of Ophthalmology UCL"},{"author_name":"Catherine Egan","author_inst":"Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK & Institute of Ophthalmology, UCL"},{"author_name":"Roy Schwartz","author_inst":"Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK & Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Sudeshna Patra","author_inst":"Bart's Health NHS Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Haralabos Eleftheriadis","author_inst":"King's College Hospital NHS Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Anthony P Khawaja","author_inst":"Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK & Institute of Ophthalmology, UCL"},{"author_name":"Andrew Lotery","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Philipp L Mueller","author_inst":"Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Robin Hamilton","author_inst":"Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK & Institute of Ophthalmology, UCL"},{"author_name":"Ella Preston","author_inst":"Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Paul Taylor","author_inst":"Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Adnan Tufail","author_inst":"Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Trust & Institute of Ophthalmology UCL"},{"author_name":"- UK EMR Users Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Tal Pecht","author_inst":"Life & Medical Sciences (LIMES) Institute, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Adem Saglam","author_inst":"PRECISE Platform for Single Cell Genomics and Epigenomics, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Bonn, Germany and University of Bonn, Bonn Germany"},{"author_name":"Oliver Dietrich","author_inst":"Helmholtz Institute for RNA-based Infection Research (HIRI), Helmholtz-Center for Infection Research (HZI), W\u00fcrzburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Henrik E.
