An understanding of the utility of LUS in COVID-19 is crucial to determine its most suitable role based on local circumstances. A scoping review was thus undertaken to explore the utility of LUS in COVID-19 and guide future research. 33 studies were identified which represent a rapidly expanding evidence base for LUS in COVID-19 however the quality of the included studies was relatively low. LUS certainly appears to be a highly sensitive and fairly specific test for COVID-19 in all ages and in pregnancy, however its accuracy may be influenced by various factors including disease severity, pre-existing lung disease, scanning protocol, operator experience, disease prevalence and the reference standard. High quality research is needed in various fields including: diagnostic accuracy in undifferentiated patients; triage and prognostication; monitoring progression and guiding interventions; persistence of residual LUS findings; inter-observer agreement; and the role of contrast-enhanced LUS.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael Trauer","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ashley Matthies","author_inst":"Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Nick Mani","author_inst":"4.\tLeeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Cian Brendan McDermott","author_inst":"Mater University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Robert Jarman","author_inst":"Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"emergency medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.13.20130468","rel_title":"Random time transformation analysis of Covid19 2020","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.13.20130468","rel_abs":"The SIR epidemiological equations model new affected and removed cases as roughly proportional to the current number of infected cases.

A tightly controlled, extended laboratory validation was performed at our medical center to determine the negative test agreement of the Abbott ID NOW compared with the BD MAX analyzer, a laboratory-based, two target, molecular analyzer with a sensitive cycle threshold (Ct) positive cutoff value of 42. There was strict adoption of the procedures listed in the Abbott ID NOW Instruction for Use (IFU)1 insert delineating preferred practices for optimal test performance. Under these conditions, our institution demonstrated a significant negative percent agreement with 116 out of 117 patients correlating, which equates to a 99.1% concordance similar to a recently reported correlation study2.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stewart W.

A positive safety culture is associated with improved patient safety and in turn patient outcomes. To date, no study has evaluated the impact of Covid-19 on safety culture. Methods The Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ) was used to investigate safety culture at a large UK teaching hospital during Covid-19. Findings were compared with baseline data from 2017. Incident reporting from the year preceding the pandemic was also examined. Results Significant increased were seen in SAQ scores of doctors and 'other clinical staff', there was no change in the nursing group. During Covid-19, on univariate regression analysis, female gender, age 40-49 years, non-white ethnicity, and nursing job role were all associated with lower SAQ scores. Training and support for redeployment were associated with higher SAQ scores. On multivariate analysis, non-disclosed gender (-0.13), non-disclosed ethnicity (-0.11), nursing role (-0.15), and support (0.29) persisted to significance. A significant decrease (p<0.003) was seen in error reporting after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Discussion This is the first study to report SAQ during Covid-19 and compare with baseline. Differences in SAQ scores were observed during Covid-19 between professional groups and compared to baseline. Reductions in incident reporting were also seen. These changes may reflect perception of risk, changes in volume or nature of work. High-quality support for redeployed staff may be associated with improved safety perception during future pandemics.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Max Denning","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ee Teng Goh","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Alasdair Scott","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Guy Martin","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sheraz Markar","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Kelsey Flott","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sam Mason","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jan Przybylowicz","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Melanie Almonte","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Clarke","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jasmine Winter-Beatty","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Swathikan Chidambaram","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Seema Yalamanchili","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Tan","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Abhiram Kanneganti","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, National University Hospital (NUH), Singapore"},{"author_name":"Viknesh Sounderajah","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Mary Wells","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Purkayastha","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health systems and quality improvement"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.14.20130815","rel_title":"Assessing the burden of COVID-19 in Canada","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.14.20130815","rel_abs":"Background: The burden of COVID-19 in Canada is unequally distributed geographically, with the largest number of cases and fatalities recorded in Quebec and Ontario while other provinces experienced limited outbreaks. To date, however, no study has assessed how provincial epidemics have unfolded in a comparative perspective. This is essential to calibrate projections of the future course of the epidemic and plan health care resources for the second wave of infections. Methods: Using newly released individual-level data collected by the Public Health Agency of Canada, we assess COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality across age and gender groups at the provincial level through a combination of demographic and survival analyses. Results: Quebec has the highest absolute and per capita number of COVID-19 confirmed positive cases, hospitalizations and fatalities in all age groups. In each province, a higher number of women than men test positive for the disease, especially above age 80. Yet consistently across age groups, infected men are more likely to be hospitalized and enter intensive care than women do. These gender differences in hospitalisation rates account for the higher case fatality risk due to COVID-19 among men compared to women. Interpretation: Although health care capacity across provinces has been sufficient to treat severe cases, we find that the main factor accounting for gender differences in COVID-19-related mortality is the need for hospitalization and intensive care, especially above age 80. This suggests a selection effect of severe cases requiring to be treated in a hospital setting that needs to be further investigated.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Simona Bignami","author_inst":"Universite de Montreal"},{"author_name":"Ari Van Assche","author_inst":"HEC Montreal"},{"author_name":"Alasdair Scott","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Guy Martin","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sheraz Markar","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Kelsey Flott","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sam Mason","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jan Przybylowicz","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Melanie Almonte","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Clarke","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jasmine Winter-Beatty","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Swathikan Chidambaram","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Seema Yalamanchili","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Tan","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Abhiram Kanneganti","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, National University Hospital (NUH), Singapore"},{"author_name":"Viknesh Sounderajah","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Mary Wells","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Purkayastha","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.14.20130740","rel_title":"Air Quality and COVID-19 Prevalence\/Fatality","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.14.20130740","rel_abs":"To investigate the association of real-time\/observed ozone\/PM2.5 levels with COVID-19 prevalence\/fatality, meta-regression of data from the Northeast megalopolis was conducted.

Methods Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the Wuhan Leishenshan Hospital from February 13 to March 14 was retrospectively analyzed. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values at baseline, comorbidities, treatments and clinical outcomes were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between patients with and without critical-ill events. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multivariate logistic regression models were developed to explore the risk factors for critical-ill events. A risk nomogram was established to predict the probability for the critical-ill events. Survival analysis of patients with critical-ill events was performed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Results 463 COVID-19 patients were included in this study, of whom 397 were non-critically ill and 66 were critically ill (all from the intensive care unit). The LASSO regression identified four variables (hypersensitive cardiac troponin I, blood urea nitrogen , haemoglobin, and interleukin-6) contributing to the critical-ill events. Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital critical-ill events associated with hypersensitive cTnI greater than 0.04 ng\/mL (OR 20.98,95% CI 3.51-125.31), blood urea nitrogen greater than 7.6 mmol\/L (OR 5.22, 95% CI 1.52-17.81, decreased haemoglobin (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.04-1.10), and higher interleukin-6 (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.08) on admission. Conclusions Hypersensitive cTnI greater than 0.04 ng\/mL, blood urea nitrogen greater than 7.6 mmol\/L, decreased haemoglobin, and high IL-6 were risk factors of critical-ill events in patients with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sen Yang","author_inst":"Department of General Practice, Yangpu Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200090, China"},{"author_name":"Le Ma","author_inst":"andyma2015@tongji.edu.cn"},{"author_name":"Yu-Lan Wang","author_inst":"Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory of Cancer Center, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Qian Wang","author_inst":"Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai, 200333, China"},{"author_name":"Qiang Tong","author_inst":"jasontong1985@163.com"},{"author_name":"Miao Chen","author_inst":"Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai, 200333, China"},{"author_name":"Hua Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai, 200333, China"},{"author_name":"De-Hua Yu","author_inst":"Department of General Practice, Yangpu Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200090, China"},{"author_name":"Sheng-Ming Dai","author_inst":"Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai, 200333, China"},{"author_name":"Ran Cui","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jasmine Winter-Beatty","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Swathikan Chidambaram","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Seema Yalamanchili","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Tan","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Abhiram Kanneganti","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, National University Hospital (NUH), Singapore"},{"author_name":"Viknesh Sounderajah","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Mary Wells","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Purkayastha","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.13.20130484","rel_title":"Double COVID-19 Confirmed Case Fatality Rate in Countries with High Elderly Female Vitamin D Deficiency Prevalence","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.13.20130484","rel_abs":"A number of clues point to a possible role of vitamin D in fighting COVID-19: a reduction in case growth speed with solar zenith angle, higher fatality rate in black people, lower fatality rate in populations that spend more time outdoors.

In 7 patients with dynamic changes of thyroid function, we observed the levels of TT3 and TSH gradually increased and reached normal range without thyroid hormone replacement at Day 30 post-admission. The correlation between TT3 and TSH level seemed to be positive rather than negative in the early stage, and gradually turned to be negatively related over time. Interpretations: Thyroid function abnormalities are common in COVID-19 patients, especially in severe cases. This might be caused by virus attack and damage to the thyroid-pituitary axis. Therefore, more attention should be paid to thyroid function during treatment of COVID-19, and close follow-up is also needed after discharge.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Weibin Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xingyun Su","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yongfeng Ding","author_inst":"the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Weina Fan","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Junwei Su","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Zhendong Chen","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hong Zhao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Kaijin Xu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Qin Ni","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Xiaowei Xu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Yunqing Qiu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Lisong Teng","author_inst":"the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Seema Yalamanchili","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Tan","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Abhiram Kanneganti","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, National University Hospital (NUH), Singapore"},{"author_name":"Viknesh Sounderajah","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Mary Wells","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Purkayastha","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"endocrinology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.13.20130625","rel_title":"Modeling the dynamics of COVID19 spread during and after social distancing","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.13.20130625","rel_abs":"Non-pharmaceutical intervention measures, such as social distancing, have so far been the only means to slow the spread of COVID19. In the United States, strict social distancing has resulted in different types infection dynamics. In some states, such as New York, extensive infection spread was followed by a pronounced decline of infection levels. In other states, such as California, less infection spread occurred before strict social distancing, and a different pattern was observed. Instead of a pronounced infection decline, a long-lasting plateau is evident, characterized by similar daily new infection levels. While these plateau dynamics cannot be readily reproduced with standard SIR infection models, we show that network models, in which individuals and their social contacts are explicitly tracked, can reproduce the plateau if network connections are cut due to social distancing measures. The reason is that in networks characterized by a 2D spatial structure, infection tends to spread quadratically with time, but as edges are randomly removed, the infection spreads along nearly one-dimensional infection \"corridors\", resulting in plateau dynamics. Interestingly, the plateau dynamics are predicted to eventually transition into an infection decline phase without any further increase in social distancing measures. Additionally, the models suggest that a potential second wave becomes significantly less pronounced if social distancing is only relaxed once the dynamics have transitioned to the decline phase. The network models analyzed here allow us to interpret and reconcile different infection dynamics during social distancing observed in various US states.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Natalia L.

Similarly to the actual spread of the disease, the dynamics of the contention patterns emerging from the application of NPIs are complex and depend on interactions between people within a specific region as well as other stochastic factors associated to demographic, geographic, political and economical conditions. Agent-based models simulate microscopic rules of simultaneous spatial interactions between multiple agents within a population, in an attempt to reproduce the complex dynamics of the effect of the contention measures. In this way, it is possible to design individual behaviours along with NPI scenarios, measuring how the simulation dynamics is affected and therefore, yielding rapid insights to perform a broad assessment of the potential of composite interventions at different stages of the epidemic. In this paper we describe a model and a tool to experiment with such kind of analysis applied to a conceptual city, considering a number of widely-applied NPIs such as social distancing, case isolation, home quarantine, total lockdown, sentinel testing, mask wearing and a distinctive \"zonal\" enforcement measure, requiring these interventions to be applied gradually to separated enclosed districts (zones). We find that the model is able to capture emerging dynamics associated to these NPIs; besides, the zonal contention strategy yields an improvement on the mitigation impact across all scenarios of combination with individual NPIs. The model and tool are open to extensions to account for omitted or newer factors affecting the planning and design of NPIs intended to counter the late stages or forthcoming waves of the COVID-19 crisis.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sergio Rojas-Galeano","author_inst":"Universidad Distrital Francisco Jose de Caldas"},{"author_name":"Lindsay Alvarez","author_inst":"Universidad Distrital Francisco Jose de Caldas"},{"author_name":"Yongfeng Ding","author_inst":"the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Weina Fan","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Junwei Su","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Zhendong Chen","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hong Zhao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Kaijin Xu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Qin Ni","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Xiaowei Xu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Yunqing Qiu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Lisong Teng","author_inst":"the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Seema Yalamanchili","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Tan","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Abhiram Kanneganti","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, National University Hospital (NUH), Singapore"},{"author_name":"Viknesh Sounderajah","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Mary Wells","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Purkayastha","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.14.20130823","rel_title":"Publish or perish: Reporting Characteristics of Peer-reviewed publications, pre-prints and registered studies on the COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.14.20130823","rel_abs":"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a mass of academic papers being published in a very brief span of time. Our aim was to compare the amount and reporting characteristics of COVID-19 related peer-reviewed and pre-prints publications. We also investigated the amount of ongoing trials and systematic reviews. Methods and findings A cross-sectional study of publications covering the COVID-19 pandemic time frame, up to May 20, 2020 was conducted. PubMed with appropriate combinations of Medical Subject Headings and COVID-19 section of MedRxiv and BioRxiv archives were searched. We examined Clinicaltrial.gov, Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, EU Register and 15 other trial registers as well as the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO). Characteristics of each publication source were extracted. Regression analyses and Z tests were used to analyze publication trends over the weeks and compare their relative proportions. We found 3635 peer-reviewed publications and 3805 pre-prints, of which 8.6% (n=329) were published in indexed journals. Peer-reviewed and pre-print publications amount both increased significantly over time (p<0.001). Case reports (peer-reviewed: 6% vs pre-prints: 0.9%, p<0.001) and letters (17.4% vs 0.5%, p<0.001) accounted for a greater share of the peer-reviewed compared to pre-print publications. In turn, randomized controlled trials (0.22% vs 0.63% p<0.001) and systematic reviews (0.08% vs 5%) accounted for a significantly greater share of the pre-print publications. Clinicaltrials.gov, Chinese Clinical Trial Registry and EU register included 57.9%, 49.5 % and 98.9% trials mostly still 'recruiting'. PROSPERO amounted to 962 systematic review protocols. Conclusion Pre-prints were slightly more prevalent than peer-reviewed publications, yet both are growing. To fill the void given by the absence of published primary studies, immediate opinions (i.e., letters) has virulently been published in PubMed. However, preprints has been promoted as rapid responses to give direct and promptly access at scientific findings in this pandemic.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Silvia Gianola","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Galeazzi"},{"author_name":"Tiago S Jesus","author_inst":"Global Health and Tropical Medicine (GHTM), WHO Collaborating Centre for Health Workforce Policy and Planning, Institute of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - NOVA"},{"author_name":"Silvia Bargeri","author_inst":"Universita' Vita-Salute San Raffaele"},{"author_name":"Greta Castellini","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Galeazzi"},{"author_name":"Junwei Su","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Zhendong Chen","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hong Zhao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Kaijin Xu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Qin Ni","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Xiaowei Xu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Yunqing Qiu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Lisong Teng","author_inst":"the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Seema Yalamanchili","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Tan","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Abhiram Kanneganti","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, National University Hospital (NUH), Singapore"},{"author_name":"Viknesh Sounderajah","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Mary Wells","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Purkayastha","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.13.20130658","rel_title":"Global and local mobility as a barometer for COVID-19 dynamics","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.13.20130658","rel_abs":"Abstract. The spreading of infectious diseases including COVID-19 depends on human interactions. In an environment where behavioral patterns and physical contacts are constantly evolving according to new governmental regulations, measuring these interactions is a major challenge. Mobility has emerged as an indicator for human activity and, implicitly, for human interactions. Here we study the coupling between mobility and COVID-19 dynamics and show that variations in global air traffic and local driving mobility can be used to stratify different disease phases. For ten European countries, our study shows maximal correlation between driving mobility and disease dynamics with a time lag of 14.6 +\/- 5.6 days. Our findings suggests that local mobility can serve as a quantitative metric to forecast future reproduction numbers and identify the stages of the pandemic when mobility and reproduction become decorrelated.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kevin Linka","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Alain Goriely","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Ellen Kuhl","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Greta Castellini","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Galeazzi"},{"author_name":"Junwei Su","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Zhendong Chen","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hong Zhao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Kaijin Xu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Qin Ni","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Xiaowei Xu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Yunqing Qiu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Lisong Teng","author_inst":"the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Seema Yalamanchili","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Tan","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Abhiram Kanneganti","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, National University Hospital (NUH), Singapore"},{"author_name":"Viknesh Sounderajah","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Mary Wells","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Purkayastha","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.13.20130575","rel_title":"Seroprevalence against COVID-19 and follow-up of suspected cases in primary health care in Spain","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.13.20130575","rel_abs":"Background During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic little information has been available about patients with mild or moderate symptoms attended and followed in the primary care setting, most of whom had an unknown status for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Objectives We aim to measure the seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a community sample of asymptomatic individuals and among symptomatic patients (without confirmed diagnosis) followed in a primary care setting. As a secondary objective, we estimated the proportions of symptomatic patients seeing at an emergency department (ED), hospitalized or dying, and identified the most important clinical symptoms associated with a positive infection. Methods From April 21 to April 24 2020, we selected a random sample of 600 individuals stratified by age groups, from a total population of 19,899 individuals from a community area in Barcelona (study population 1). From April 29 to May 5 2020, we also invited all the patients that had been followed by general practitioners (GPs) (study population 2). We used for both populations COVID-19 Rapid lateral flow immunoassay which qualitatively assesses the presence of patient-generated IgG and IgM in approximately 10-15 minutes. The prevalence (95% confidence intervals [CI]) of infection (past and current) was defined as the proportion of individuals with antibody seropositivity. Odds ratios (ORs) for a positive test result were estimated using logistic regression analysis. Results Three hundred and eleven asymptomatic individuals from the randomly selected sample accepted to participate in the study. The overall mean age was 43.7 years (SD 21.79, range 1-94) and 55% were women. Seventeen individuals were seropositive for IgM and\/or IgG, resulting an overall prevalence of 5,47% (95% CI, 3.44-8.58). Six-hundred and thirty-four symptomatic patients were followed by GPs. The overall mean age was 46.97 years (SD 20.05, range 0-92) and 57.73% were women. Of these, 244 patients (38.49%) were seropositive for IgM and\/or IgG. During the follow-up period, 27.13% of symptomatic patients attended the ED, 11.83% were hospitalized and about 2% died. Results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the OR for a positive test was significantly increased in patients who had fever (>38{degrees}C), ageusia and contact with a patient diagnosed with COVID-19. Conclusions The seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among asymptomatic individuals in the general population was lower than expected. Approximately 40% of the symptomatic patients followed by GPs during the peak months of the pandemic in Barcelona, were positive. Fever (>38{degrees}C), anosmia, ageusia and contact with a patient diagnosed with COVID-19 were associated with a positive test result.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carlos Brotons","author_inst":"Sardenya Primary Health Care Center"},{"author_name":"Jordi Serrano","author_inst":"UniversalDoctor"},{"author_name":"Diana Fernandez","author_inst":"Sardenya Primary Health Care Center"},{"author_name":"Carlos Garcia-Ramos","author_inst":"UniversalDoctor"},{"author_name":"Begona Ichazo","author_inst":"Sardenya Primary Health Care Center"},{"author_name":"Jeannine Lemaire","author_inst":"UniversalDoctor"},{"author_name":"Patricia Montenegro","author_inst":"Sardenya Primary Health Care Center"},{"author_name":"Irene Moral","author_inst":"Sardenya Primary Health Care Center"},{"author_name":"Ricky Perez- Wienese","author_inst":"UniversalDoctor"},{"author_name":"Marc Pitarch","author_inst":"Sardenya Primary Health Care Center"},{"author_name":"Mireia Puig","author_inst":"Sardenya Primary Health Care Center"},{"author_name":"Maria Teresa Vilella","author_inst":"Sardenya Primary Health Care Center"},{"author_name":"Jaume Sellares","author_inst":"Sardenya Primary Health Care Center"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Tan","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Abhiram Kanneganti","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, National University Hospital (NUH), Singapore"},{"author_name":"Viknesh Sounderajah","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Mary Wells","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Purkayastha","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"primary care research"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.14.20130682","rel_title":"Development and validation of a tool to appraise guidelines on SARS-CoV-2 infection prevention strategies in healthcare workers","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.14.20130682","rel_abs":"Background: Clinical guidelines on infection prevention strategies in healthcare workers (HCWs) play an important role in protecting them during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Poorly constructed guidelines that are not comprehensive and are ambiguous may compromise HCWs safety. We aimed to develop and validate a tool to appraise guidelines on infection prevention strategies in HCWs. Methods: A 3-stage, web-based, Delphi consensus-building process among a panel of diverse HCWs and healthcare managers was utilised. We validated the tool by appraising 40 international, specialty-specific and procedure-specific guidelines along with national guidelines from countries with a wide range of gross national income. Results: Overall consensus (>75%) was reached at the end of three rounds for all six domains included in the tool. The chosen domains allowed appraisal of guidelines in relation to general characteristics (domain-1), recommendations on engineering (domain-2) and administrative aspects (domain 4-6) of infection prevention, as well as personal protection equipment (PPE) use (domain-3). The appraisal tool performed well across all domains and inter-rater agreement was excellent. All included guidelines performed relatively better in domains 1-3 compared with domains 4-6 and this was more evident in guidelines originating from lower income countries. Conclusion: The guideline appraisal tool was robust and easy to use. Recommendations on engineering aspects of infection prevention, administrative measures that promote optimal PPE use and HCW wellbeing were generally lacking in assessed guidelines. This tool may enable health systems to adopt high quality HCW infection prevention guidelines during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and may also provide a framework for future guideline development.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ashwin Subramaniam","author_inst":"Peninsula Health"},{"author_name":"Mallikarjuna Reddy","author_inst":"Peninsula Health, Calvary Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alexander Zubarev","author_inst":"Peninsula Health"},{"author_name":"Umesh Kadam","author_inst":"Werribee Hospital, Casey Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zheng Jie Lim","author_inst":"Ballarat Base Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chris Anstey","author_inst":"Griffith University University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Shailesh Bihari","author_inst":"Flinders University andMedical Centre"},{"author_name":"Jumana Haji","author_inst":"Aster CMI Hospital Bangalore"},{"author_name":"Subhathra Karunanithi","author_inst":"Valley Medical Group, New Jersey"},{"author_name":"Jinghang Luo","author_inst":"Western Health"},{"author_name":"Neil Mara","author_inst":"NHS"},{"author_name":"Saikat Mitra","author_inst":"National University Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Kollengode Ramanathan","author_inst":"National University Hospital Singapore"},{"author_name":"Arvind Rajamani","author_inst":"Nepean Clinical School University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Francesca Rubulotta","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Erik Svensk","author_inst":"Sundsvall hospital, Sundsvall, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Kiran Shekar","author_inst":"The Prince Charles Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Purkayastha","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.13.20130294","rel_title":"Impact of social distancing measures for preventing coronavirus disease 2019 : A systematic review and meta-analysis protocol","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.13.20130294","rel_abs":"Abstract Introduction: Social distancing measures (SDMs) protect public health from the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Methods and analysis: We will conduct a systematic review meta-analysis research of both randomised controlled trials and non-randomised controlled trials. We will search MEDLINE, EMBASE, Allied & Complementary Medicine, COVID-19 Research and WHO database on COVID-19 for primary studies assessing the enablers and barriers associated with SDMs, and will be reported in accordance with PRISMA statement. The PRISMA-P checklist will be used while preparing this protocol. We will use Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines (JBI Critical Appraisal Checklists) to assess the methodological qualities and synthesised performing thematic analysis. Two reviewers will independently screen the papers and extracted data. If sufficient data are available, the random-effects model for meta-analysis will be performed to measure the effect size of SDMs or the strengths of relationships. To assess the heterogeneity of effects, I2 together with the observed effects (Q-value, with degrees of freedom) will be used to provide the true effects in the analysis. Ethics and dissemination: Ethics approval and consent will not be required for this systematic review of the literature as it does not involve human participation. We will be able to disseminate the study findings using the following strategies: we will be publishing at least one paper in peer-reviewed journals, and an abstract will be presented at suitable national\/international conferences or workshops.

Interviews on COVID-19 experiences were administered in the second wave. Multiple regression models examined relationships between perceived COVID-19 risk and depression. Full data on perceived COVID-19 risk, depression, and covariates were available in 221 adults. 14.5% of adults were at risk for depression. Higher perceived COVID-19 risk predicted greater depressive symptoms (p < 0.001) particularly among adults with histories of childhood trauma, though this effect was marginally significant (p = 0.062). Adults were two times more likely to experience significant depressive symptoms for every one unit increase in perceived COVID-19 risk (p = 0.016; 95% CI [1.14, 3.49]). Qualitative data identified potent experiences of anxiety, financial insecurity, fear of infection, and rumination. Higher perceived risk of COVID-19 infection is associated with greater depressive symptoms among adults with histories of childhood trauma during the first six weeks of quarantine. High rates of severe mental illness and low availability of mental healthcare amidst COVID-19 emphasize the need for immediate and accessible psychological resources in South Africa.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew Wooyoung Kim","author_inst":"Department of Anthropology, Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Tawanda Nyengerai","author_inst":"School of Public Health, University of the Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Emily Mendenhall","author_inst":"Edmund A.

Many ecological factors are proven to influence the transmission and survival of the virus. In this study, we aim to determine the association of different climate factors with the spread and mortality due to COVID-19. Methods: The climate indicators included in the study were duration of sunshine, average minimum temperature and average maximum temperature, with cumulative confirmed cases, deceased and recovered cases. The data was performed for 138 different countries of the world, between January 2020 to May 2020. Both univariate and multivariate was performed for cumulative and month-wise analysis using SPSS software. Results: The average maximum temperature, and sunshine duration was significantly associated with COVID-19 confirmed cases, deceased and recovered. For every one degree increase in mean average temperature, the confirmed, deceased and recovered cases decreased by 2047(p=0.03), 157(p=0.016), 743 (p=0.005) individuals. The association remained significant even after adjusting for environmental such as sunshine duration as well as non-environmental variables. Average sunshine duration was inversely correlated with increase in daily new cases ({rho}= -2261) and deaths ({rho}= -0.2985). Conclusion: Higher average temperature and longer sunshine duration was strongly associated with COVID-19 cases and deaths in 138 countries. Hence the temperature is an important factor in SARS CoV-2 survival and this study will help in formulating better preventive measures to combat COVID-19 based on their climatic conditions.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Swati Thangriyal","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Aayushi Rastogi","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Arvind Tomar","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Scinces, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Sukriti Baweja","author_inst":"Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Zheng Jie Lim","author_inst":"Ballarat Base Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chris Anstey","author_inst":"Griffith University University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Shailesh Bihari","author_inst":"Flinders University andMedical Centre"},{"author_name":"Jumana Haji","author_inst":"Aster CMI Hospital Bangalore"},{"author_name":"Subhathra Karunanithi","author_inst":"Valley Medical Group, New Jersey"},{"author_name":"Jinghang Luo","author_inst":"Western Health"},{"author_name":"Neil Mara","author_inst":"NHS"},{"author_name":"Saikat Mitra","author_inst":"National University Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Kollengode Ramanathan","author_inst":"National University Hospital Singapore"},{"author_name":"Arvind Rajamani","author_inst":"Nepean Clinical School University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Francesca Rubulotta","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Erik Svensk","author_inst":"Sundsvall hospital, Sundsvall, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Kiran Shekar","author_inst":"The Prince Charles Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Purkayastha","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.14.20130880","rel_title":"Predictors of CPAP outcome in hospitalised COVID-19 patients","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.14.20130880","rel_abs":"Introduction: Throughout March - April 2020, many patients with COVID-19 presented to Southend University Hospital with Acute Hypoxaemic Respiratory Failure (AHRF). Patients were managed in a Specialist Respiratory High Dependency Unit. We present our experience on the usage of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy and possible indicators of its success in this patient group. Methods: Data from patients (n=89) requiring mechanical ventilation during the months of March to April 2020, were retrospectively collected and analysed. 37 patients received IMV (Invasive Mechanical Ventilation) without a CPAP trial beforehand. 52 patients underwent a CPAP trial, of which 21 patients successfully avoided intubation and ITU admission. Results: The 52 patients, prior to receiving CPAP had significant respiratory failure as evidenced by a low PaO2: FiO2 (PFR) (mean +\/- SD 123 +\/- 60 mmHg) and mean SpO2:FiO2 (SFR) (mean +\/- SD: 140+\/- 50). The main indicators of CPAP success were: higher SFR before and after CPAP, lower respiratory rate (RR) , lower Neutrophil to Lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and higher PFR prior to CPAP. Discussion: CPAP proved successful in 40% of COVID-19 patients presenting with AHRF. SFR, PFR, RR and NLR are predictors of such success. SFR can be used for effective real time monitoring of patients before and after CPAP to identify likelihood of success. Based on our results, we have suggested a modified CPAP management protocol in COVID-19. These findings can guide future studies and will allow improved triage of patients to either CPAP or IMV, in the event of a future COVID peak.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yasser Noeman Ahmed","author_inst":"Southend University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Respiratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sriya Gokaraju","author_inst":"Southend University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Respiratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Duncan Powrie","author_inst":"Southend University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Respiratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Dora Amran","author_inst":"Southend University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Respiratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Iman El Sayed","author_inst":"Alexandria University Faculty of Medicine, Biomedical Informatics and Medical Statistics Department, Medical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Ashraf Roshdy","author_inst":"Whipps Cross University Hospital, Critical Care Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shailesh Bihari","author_inst":"Flinders University andMedical Centre"},{"author_name":"Jumana Haji","author_inst":"Aster CMI Hospital Bangalore"},{"author_name":"Subhathra Karunanithi","author_inst":"Valley Medical Group, New Jersey"},{"author_name":"Jinghang Luo","author_inst":"Western Health"},{"author_name":"Neil Mara","author_inst":"NHS"},{"author_name":"Saikat Mitra","author_inst":"National University Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Kollengode Ramanathan","author_inst":"National University Hospital Singapore"},{"author_name":"Arvind Rajamani","author_inst":"Nepean Clinical School University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Francesca Rubulotta","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Erik Svensk","author_inst":"Sundsvall hospital, Sundsvall, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Kiran Shekar","author_inst":"The Prince Charles Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Purkayastha","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.14.20129957","rel_title":"Age-dependent assessment of genes involved in cellular senescence, telomere and mitochondrial pathways in human lung tissue of smokers, COPD and IPF: Associations with SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 ACE2-TMPRSS2-Furin-DPP4 axis","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.14.20129957","rel_abs":"Aging is one of the key contributing factors for chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) and other chronic inflammatory lung diseases. Cigarette smoke is a major etiological risk factor that has been shown to alter cellular processes involving mitochondrial function, cellular senescence and telomeric length. Here we determined how aging contribute to the alteration in the gene expression of above mentioned cellular processes that play an important role in the progression of COPD and IPF. We hypothesized that aging may differentially alter the expression of mitochondrial, cellular senescence and telomere genes in smokers and patients with COPD and IPF compared to non-smokers. Total RNA from human lung tissues from non-smokers, smokers, and patients with COPD and IPF were processed and analyzed based on their ages (younger: <55 yrs and older: >55 yrs). NanoString nCounter panel was used to analyze the gene expression profiles using a custom designed codeset containing 112 genes including 6 housekeeping controls (mitochondrial biogenesis and function, cellular senescence, telomere replication and maintenance). mRNA counts were normalized, log2 transformed for differential expression analysis using linear models in the limma package (R\/Bioconductor). Data from non-smokers, smokers and patients with COPD and IPF were analyzed based on the age groups (pairwise comparisons between younger vs. older groups). Several genes were differentially expressed in younger and older smokers, and patients with COPD and IPF compared to non-smokers which were part of the mitochondrial biogenesis\/function (HSPD1, FEN1, COX18, COX10, UCP2 & 3), cellular senescence (PCNA, PTEN, KLOTHO, CDKN1C, TNKS2, NFATC1 & 2, GADD45A) and telomere replication\/maintenance (PARP1, SIRT6, NBN, TERT, RAD17, SLX4, HAT1) target genes. Interestingly, NOX4 and TNKS2 were increased in the young IPF as compared to the young COPD patients. Genes in the mitochondrial dynamics and other quality control mechanisms like FIS1 and RHOT2 were decreased in young IPF compared to their age matched COPD subjects. ERCC1 (Excision Repair Cross-Complementation Group 1) and GADD45B were higher in young COPD as compared to IPF. Aging plays an important role in various infectious diseases. Elderly patients with chronic lung disease and smokers were found to have high incidence and mortality rates in the current pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Immunoblot analysis in the lung homogenates of smokers, COPD and IPF subjects revealed increased protein abundance of important proteases and spike proteins like TMPRSS2, furin and DPP4 in association with a slight increase in SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 levels. This may further strengthen the observation that smokers, COPD and IPF subjects are more prone to COVID-19 infection. Overall, these findings suggest that altered transcription of target genes that regulate mitochondrial function, cellular senescence, and telomere attrition add to the pathobiology of lung aging in COPD and IPF and other smoking-related chronic lung disease in associated with alterations in SARS-CoV-2 ACE2-TMPRSS2-Furin-DPP4 axis for COVID-19 infection.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Krishna P Maremanda","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Isaac Kirubakaran Sundar","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Dongmei Li","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Irfan Rahman","author_inst":"University of Rochester"},{"author_name":"Iman El Sayed","author_inst":"Alexandria University Faculty of Medicine, Biomedical Informatics and Medical Statistics Department, Medical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Ashraf Roshdy","author_inst":"Whipps Cross University Hospital, Critical Care Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shailesh Bihari","author_inst":"Flinders University andMedical Centre"},{"author_name":"Jumana Haji","author_inst":"Aster CMI Hospital Bangalore"},{"author_name":"Subhathra Karunanithi","author_inst":"Valley Medical Group, New Jersey"},{"author_name":"Jinghang Luo","author_inst":"Western Health"},{"author_name":"Neil Mara","author_inst":"NHS"},{"author_name":"Saikat Mitra","author_inst":"National University Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Kollengode Ramanathan","author_inst":"National University Hospital Singapore"},{"author_name":"Arvind Rajamani","author_inst":"Nepean Clinical School University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Francesca Rubulotta","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Erik Svensk","author_inst":"Sundsvall hospital, Sundsvall, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Kiran Shekar","author_inst":"The Prince Charles Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Purkayastha","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.14.20130724","rel_title":"The inevitability of Covid-19 related distress among healthcare workers: findings from a low caseload country under lockdown","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.14.20130724","rel_abs":"Objectives: To characterize psychological distress and factors associated with distress in healthcare practitioners working during a stringent lockdown in a country (Jordan) with one of the lowest incidence rates of Covid-19 globally. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey sent to physicians, nurses and technicians, and pharmacists working in various hospitals and community pharmacies. Demographic, professional and psychological characteristics (distress using Kessler-6 questionnaire, anxiety, depression, burnout, sleep issues, exhaustion) were measured as were potential sources of fear. Descriptive and multivariable statistics were performed using level of distress as the key outcome. Results: We surveyed 1,006 practitioners (55.3% females). Approximately 63%, 13%, 17% and 7% were nurses\/technicians, physicians, pharmacists, and other nonmedical personnel (respectively). 32% suffered from high distress while 20% suffered from severe distress. Exhaustion, anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances were reported (in past seven days) by approximately 34%, 34%, 19%, and 29% of subjects (respectively). Being older or male, perception of effective protective institutional measures, and being satisfied at work, were significantly associated with lower distress. Conversely, suffering burnout; reporting sleep-related functional problems; exhaustion; being a pharmacist (relative to a physician) and working in a cancer center; harboring fear about virus spreading; fear that the virus threatened life; fear of alienation from family\/friends; and fear of workload increases, were significantly associated with higher distress. Conclusion: Despite low caseloads, Jordanian practitioners still experienced high levels of distress. Identified demographic, professional and psychological factors influencing distress should inform interventions to improve medical professional resilience and distress likelihood, regardless of the variable Covid-19 situation.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Feras Ibrahim Hawari","author_inst":"King Hussein Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Nour A Obeidat","author_inst":"King Hussein Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Yasmeen I Dodin","author_inst":"King Hussein Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Asma S Albtoosh","author_inst":"The University of Jordan"},{"author_name":"Rasha M Manasrah","author_inst":"King Hussein Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Ibrahim O Alaqeel","author_inst":"Ibn Alhaytham Hospital"},{"author_name":"Asem H Mansour","author_inst":"King Hussein Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Jumana Haji","author_inst":"Aster CMI Hospital Bangalore"},{"author_name":"Subhathra Karunanithi","author_inst":"Valley Medical Group, New Jersey"},{"author_name":"Jinghang Luo","author_inst":"Western Health"},{"author_name":"Neil Mara","author_inst":"NHS"},{"author_name":"Saikat Mitra","author_inst":"National University Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Kollengode Ramanathan","author_inst":"National University Hospital Singapore"},{"author_name":"Arvind Rajamani","author_inst":"Nepean Clinical School University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Francesca Rubulotta","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Erik Svensk","author_inst":"Sundsvall hospital, Sundsvall, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Kiran Shekar","author_inst":"The Prince Charles Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Purkayastha","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Kinross","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"occupational and environmental health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.14.20130898","rel_title":"Covid-19 in Chile.

Aim: To report clinical features and outcomes associated to Covid-19 in a group of patients admitted during the first wave in a regional reference Center in southern Chile designated to severe and critical cases. Methods: Cases were identified by a compatible clinical picture associated to positive RT-PCR or serological testing. A standard protocol was applied. Results: 21 adult patients (20 diagnosed by PCR, one by serology) were admitted between epidemiological weeks 13 to 20, involving 8.8% of total regional cases. Hospitalization occurred at a median of 11 days after symptoms onset. Patients [&ge;]60 years old predominated (57.1%). Hypertension (61.9%), obesity (57.1%) and diabetes mellitus 2 (38.1%) were prevalent but 19% had no comorbid conditions nor were elderly. Two cases involved second-trimester pregnant women. Positive IgM or IgM\/IgG results obtained by rapid serological testing were limited (19% at 1st week; 42.9% at 2nd week). Nine patients (42.9%, critical group) were transferred to ICU and connected to mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. By univariate analysis admission to ICU was significantly associated to tachypnea and higher plasmatic LDH values. One pregnant woman required urgent cesarean section given birth to a premature neonate without vertical transmission. Two patients died (in-hospital mortality 9.5%) and length of stay was equal or higher than 14 days in 57.9% of patients.

However, there is no data about the best moment for its administration along the course of the disease. Methods We provided tocilizumab on a compassionate-use basis to patients with SSP hospitalized (excluding intensive care and intubated cases) who required oxygen support to have a saturation >93%. Primary endpoint was intubation or death after 24 hours of its administration. Patients received at least one dose of 400 mg intravenous tocilizumab during March 8-2020, through April 20-2020. Findings A total of 207 patients were studied and 186 analysed. The mean age was 65 years and 68% were male. A co-existing condition was present in 68 % of cases. At baseline, 114 (61%) required oxygen support with FiO2 >0.5 % and 72 (39%) <0.5%. Early administration of tocilizumab, when the need of oxygen support was still below FiO2 <0.5%, was significantly more effective than given it in advanced stages (FiO2 >0.5 %), achieving lower rates of intubation or death (13% vs 37% repectively, p<0.001).

In this regard, we compiled a daily dataset including confirmed case counts, Recovered case counts, Deceased cases, Average Temperature, Maximum Relative Humidity, Maximum Wind Speed for six most affected states of India during the period of March 25, 2020 to April 24, 2020. We investigated that the average Humidity and Average Temperature seven days ago play a significant role in the recovery of coronavirus cases. The rise in average temperature will improve the recovery rate in the days to come. The cities with very high humidity levels or dry weather conditions have high probabilities of recovery from COVID-19. The findings of this research will help the policymakers to identify risky geographic areas and enforce timely preventive measures.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kuldeep Singh","author_inst":"Malaviya National Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Aryan Agarwal","author_inst":"Malaviya National Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Laura Prieto Perez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Felipe Villar Alvarez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Beatriz Alvarez Alvarez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Maria Jesus Rodriguez Nieto","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Irene Carrillo Acosta","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Itziar Fernandez Ormaechea","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Aws Al-Hayani","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Pilar Carballosa","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Silvia Calpena Martinez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Farah Ezzine de Blas","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Marina Castellanos Gonzalez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Alba Naya Prieto","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Marta Lopez de las Heras","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Marcel Jose Rodriguez Guzman","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Ana Cordero Guijarro","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Antonio Broncano Lavado","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Alicia Macias Valcayo","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Marta Martin Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Javier Becares Martinez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Fernandez Roblas","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Miguel A Piris Pinilla","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Jose Fortes Alen","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Olga Sanchez Pernaute","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Fredeswinda Romero Bueno","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Sarah Heili Frades","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"German Peces Barba Romero","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.14.20131201","rel_title":"First SARS-CoV-2 detection in river water: implications in low sanitation countries","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.14.20131201","rel_abs":"Since the beginning of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic studies on viral shedding have reported that this virus is excreted in feces in most patients. High viral loads are found at the sewage pipeline or at the entrance of wastewater treatment plants from cities where the number of COVID-19 cases are significant. In Quito (Ecuador) as in many other cities worldwide, wastewater is directly discharged into natural waters. The aim of this study was to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 presence in urban streams from a low sanitation context. Three river locations along the urban rivers of Quito were sampled on the 5th of June during a peak of COVID-19 cases. River samples were evaluated for water quality parameters and afterwards, concentrated for viral analysis using skimmed milk flocculation method. The viral concentrates were quantified for SARS-CoV-2 (N1 and N2 genes) and Human Adenovirus as a human viral indicator. The results showed that SARS-CoV-2 was detected for both target genes in all samples analyzed in a range of 2,91E+05 to 3,19E+06 GC\/L for N1 and from 2,07E+05 to 2,22E+06 GC\/L for N2. The high values detected in natural waters from a low sanitation region have several implications in health and ecology that should be further assessed.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Laura Guerrero-Latorre","author_inst":"Grupo de Investigacion en Biodiversidad, Medio Ambiente y Salud (BIOMAS), Universidad de Las Americas, Ecuador"},{"author_name":"Isabel Ballesteros","author_inst":"Grupo de Investigacion en Biodiversidad, Medio Ambiente y Salud (BIOMAS)- Universidad de Las Americas"},{"author_name":"Irina Villacres","author_inst":"Laboratorios de Investigacion, Universidad de Las Americas, Ecuador"},{"author_name":"Maria Genoveva Granda-Albuja","author_inst":"Laboratorios de Investigacion, Universidad de Las Americas, Ecuador"},{"author_name":"Byron Freire","author_inst":"Laboratorios de Investigacion, Universidad de Las Americas, Ecuador"},{"author_name":"Blanca Rios-Touma","author_inst":"Grupo de Investigacion en Biodiversidad, Medio Ambiente y Salud (BIOMAS), Universidad de Las Americas, Ecuador"},{"author_name":"Irene Carrillo Acosta","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Itziar Fernandez Ormaechea","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Aws Al-Hayani","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Pilar Carballosa","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Silvia Calpena Martinez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Farah Ezzine de Blas","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Marina Castellanos Gonzalez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Alba Naya Prieto","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Marta Lopez de las Heras","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Marcel Jose Rodriguez Guzman","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Ana Cordero Guijarro","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Antonio Broncano Lavado","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Alicia Macias Valcayo","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Marta Martin Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Javier Becares Martinez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Fernandez Roblas","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Miguel A Piris Pinilla","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Jose Fortes Alen","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Olga Sanchez Pernaute","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Fredeswinda Romero Bueno","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Sarah Heili Frades","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"German Peces Barba Romero","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz - Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"occupational and environmental health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.12.20129056","rel_title":"Symptom clusters in Covid19: A potential clinical prediction tool from the COVID Symptom study app","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.12.20129056","rel_abs":"As no one symptom can predict disease severity or the need for dedicated medical support in COVID-19, we asked if documenting symptom time series over the first few days informs outcome. Unsupervised time series clustering over symptom presentation was performed on data collected from a training dataset of completed cases enlisted early from the COVID Symptom Study Smartphone application, yielding six distinct symptom presentations. Clustering was validated on an independent replication dataset between May 1- May 28th, 2020. Using the first 5 days of symptom logging, the ROC-AUC of need for respiratory support was 78.8%, substantially outperforming personal characteristics alone (ROC-AUC 69.5%).

We performed a comprehensive systematic review to investigate the latest clinical evidence on the treatment efficacy and safety of Remdesivir in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods: We performed a systematic search of the Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, Google scholar, and MedRxiv for relevant observational and interventional studies. Measured outcomes were mortality rates, improvement rates, time to clinical improvement, all adverse event rates and severe adverse event rates. Results: 3 RCTs and 2 cohorts were included in our study. In 2 cohort studies, patients received Remdesivir for 10 days. 2 RCTs evaluated 10-day treatment of Remdesivir efficacy versus placebo group and the other RCT compared its 5-day regimen versus 10-day regimen. Visual inspection of the forest plots revealed that Remdesivir efficacy was not much different in reducing 28-day mortality versus 14-day mortality rates. Besides, 10-day treatment regimen overpowers 5-day treatment and placebo in decreasing time to clinical improvement. All adverse event rates did not have significant difference; however, severe adverse event rate was lower in 5-day Remdesivir group compared to 10-day and placebo groups. Conclusion: 5-day course of Remdesivir therapy in COVID-19 patients is probably efficacious and safe and patients without invasive mechanical ventilation benefit the most. Treatment can be extended to 10 days if satisfactory improvement is not seen by day 5. Most benefits from Remdesivir therapy take place in the first 14 days of the start of the treatment.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amirhossein Roshanshad","author_inst":"Shiraz University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Alireza Kamalipour","author_inst":"Hamilton Glaucoma Center, Shiley Eye Institute, Department of Ophthalmology, University of California, San Diego, CA, United States"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Ali Ashraf","author_inst":"Shiraz University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Romina Roshanshad","author_inst":"Shiraz University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mohammadreza Akbari","author_inst":"Shiraz University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mark S.
