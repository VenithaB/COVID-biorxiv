Appropriate countermeasures mean thoughtful and educated choice of viral targets (epitopes). There are several articles that discuss such choices in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, other focus on phylogenetic traits and history of the Coronaviridae genome\/proteome. However none consider viral protein low complexity regions (LCRs). Recently we created the first methods that are able to compare such fragments. We show that five low complexity regions (LCRs) in three proteins (nsp3, S and N) encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome are highly similar to regions from human proteome. As many as 21 predicted T-cell epitopes and 27 predicted B-cell epitopes overlap with the five SARS-CoV-2 LCRs similar to human proteins. Interestingly, replication proteins encoded in the central part of viral RNA are devoid of LCRs. Similarity of SARS-CoV-2 LCRs to human proteins may have implications on the ability of the virus to counteract immune defenses. The vaccine targeted LCRs may potentially be ineffective or alternatively lead to autoimmune diseases development. These findings are crucial to the process of selection of new epitopes for drugs or vaccines which should omit such regions.\n\nAuthor summaryThe outbreak of the COVID-19 disease affects humans all over the globe. More and more people get sick and many die because of the deadly SARS-CoV-2 virus. The whole machinery of this pathogen is enclosed in a short sequence of nucleotides, building blocks for both RNA and DNA strands. This RNA virus encodes less than 30 protein sequences that change the fate of our societies. Its proteins are composed of 20 amino acids (building bricks) that are usually used quite freely by proteins. However, there are fragments where only one or a few amino acids are used. We name those low complexity regions (LCRs). We invented the first programmes able to compare such LCRs. Using this new methodology we were able to show similarity of some viral proteins to human ones. This discovery has a serious implication when designing vaccines or drugs. It means that companies should not use these very LCRs as targets because it may trigger an autoimmune disease. On the other hand this specific similarity may suggest some kind of disguise of viral proteins into the machinery of human cells.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aleksandra Gruca","author_inst":"Politechnika Slaska"},{"author_name":"Joanna Ziemska-Legiecka","author_inst":"Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics"},{"author_name":"Patryk Jarnot","author_inst":"Politechnika Slaska"},{"author_name":"Elzbieta Sarnowska","author_inst":"Centrum Onkologii-Instytut im Marii Sklodowskiej-Curie w Warszawie"},{"author_name":"Tomasz Sarnowski","author_inst":"Polska Akademia Nauk Instytut Biochemii i Biofizyki"},{"author_name":"Marcin Grynberg","author_inst":"Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.11.246678","rel_title":"Opposing activities of IFITM proteins in SARS-CoV-2 infection","rel_date":"2020-08-11","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.11.246678","rel_abs":"Interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) restrict infections by many viruses, but a subset of IFITMs enhance infections by specific coronaviruses through currently unknown mechanisms. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 Spike-pseudotyped virus and genuine SARS-CoV-2 infections are generally restricted by expression of human IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3, using both gain- and loss-of-function approaches. Mechanistically, restriction of SARS-CoV-2 occurred independently of IFITM3 S-palmitoylation sites, indicating a restrictive capacity that is distinct from reported inhibition of other viruses. In contrast, the IFITM3 amphipathic helix and its amphipathic properties were required for virus restriction. Mutation of residues within the human IFITM3 endocytosis-promoting Yxx{Phi} motif converted human IFITM3 into an enhancer of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and cell-to-cell fusion assays confirmed the ability of endocytic mutants to enhance Spike-mediated fusion with the plasma membrane. Overexpression of TMPRSS2, which reportedly increases plasma membrane fusion versus endosome fusion of SARS-CoV-2, attenuated IFITM3 restriction and converted amphipathic helix mutants into strong enhancers of infection. In sum, these data uncover new pro- and anti-viral mechanisms of IFITM3, with clear distinctions drawn between enhancement of viral infection at the plasma membrane and amphipathicity-based mechanisms used for endosomal virus restriction. Indeed, the net effect of IFITM3 on SARS-CoV-2 infections may be a result of these opposing activities, suggesting that shifts in the balance of these activities could be coopted by viruses to escape this important first line innate defense mechanism.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guoli Shi","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Adam D Kenney","author_inst":"The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Elena Kudryashova","author_inst":"The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Lizhi Zhang","author_inst":"The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Luanne Hall-Stoodley","author_inst":"The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Richard Robinson","author_inst":"The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Dmitri Kudryashov","author_inst":"The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Alex A.

The immense damage done to public health and economies has prompted a global race for cures and vaccines. In developing a COVID-19 vaccine, we applied technology previously used for MERS-CoV to produce a prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by adding two proline substitutions at the top of the central helix (S-2P). To enhance immunogenicity and mitigate the potential vaccine-induced immunopathology, CpG 1018, a Th1-biasing synthetic toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist was selected as an adjuvant candidate. S-2P was combined with various adjuvants, including CpG 1018, and administered to mice to test its effectiveness in eliciting anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. S-2P in combination with CpG 1018 and aluminum hydroxide (alum) was found to be the most potent immunogen and induced high titer of spike-specific antibodies in sera of immunized mice. The neutralizing abilities in pseudotyped lentivirus reporter or live wild-type SARS-CoV-2 were measured with reciprocal inhibiting dilution (ID50) titers of 5120 and 2560, respectively. In addition, the antibodies elicited were able to cross-neutralize pseudovirus containing the spike protein of the D614G variant, indicating the potential for broad spectrum protection. A marked Th-1 dominant response was noted from cytokines secreted by splenocytes of mice immunized with CpG 1018 and alum. No vaccine-related serious adverse effects were found in the dose-ranging study in rats administered single- or two-dose regimens with up to 50 g of S-2P combined with CpG 1018 alone or CpG 1018 with alum. These data support continued development of CHO-derived S-2P formulated with CpG 1018\/alum as a candidate vaccine to prevent COVID-19 disease.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tsun-Yung Kuo","author_inst":"Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corporation, Taipei City, Taiwan; Department of Biotechnology and Animal Science, National Ilan University, Yilan County, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Meei-Yun Lin","author_inst":"Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corporation, Taipei City, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Robert L Coffman","author_inst":"Dynavax Technologies, Emeryville, CA 94608, USA"},{"author_name":"John D Campbell","author_inst":"Dynavax Technologies, Emeryville, CA 94608, USA"},{"author_name":"Paula Traquina","author_inst":"Dynavax Technologies, Emeryville, CA 94608, USA"},{"author_name":"Yi-Jun Lin","author_inst":"Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corporation, Taipei City, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Luke Tzu Chi Liu","author_inst":"Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corp, Taipei City, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Jinyi Cheng","author_inst":"Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corporation, Taipei City, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Yu-Chi Wu","author_inst":"Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corporation, Taipei City, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Chung-Chin Wu","author_inst":"Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corporation, Taipei City, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Wei-Hsuan Tang","author_inst":"Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corporation, Taipei City, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Chung-Guei Huang","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan City, Taiwan; Research Center for Emerging Viral Infections, College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kuo-Chien Tsao","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan City, Taiwan; Research Center for Emerging Viral Infections, College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shin-Ru Shih","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan City, Taiwan; Research Center for Emerging Viral Infections, College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Charles Chen","author_inst":"Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corporation, Taipei City, Taiwan; Adjunct Professor of College of Science and Technology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA 19122, U"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.10.244632","rel_title":"Bioinformatic Analysis Reveals That Some Mutations May Affect On Both Spike Structure Damage and Ligand Binding Site","rel_date":"2020-08-10","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.10.244632","rel_abs":"There are some mutations are known related to SARS-CoV-2.

Especially in Asia, more than one mutation(three different mutations are found in QLA46612 isolated from South Korea) was seen in the same sequence. Although I detected a huge number of mutations (more than seventy in Asia) by regions, some of them were predicted that damage spikes protein structure by using bioinformatic tools.The predicted results are G75V(isolated from North America), T95I(isolated from South Korea), G143V(isolated from North America), M177I(isolated Asia), L293M(isolated from Asia), P295H(isolated from Asia), T393P(isolated from Europe), P507S(isolated from Asia), D614G(isolated from all regions) respectively.

To address the ongoing pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 and expand the known sequence diversity of viruses, we aligned pangenomes for coronaviruses (CoV) and other viral families to 5.6 petabases of public sequencing data from 3.8 million biologically diverse samples. To implement this strategy, we developed a cloud computing architecture, Serratus, tailored for ultra-high throughput sequence alignment at the petabase scale. From this search, we identified and assembled thousands of CoV and CoV-like genomes and genome fragments ranging from known strains to putatively novel genera. We generalise this strategy to other viral families, identifying several novel deltaviruses and huge bacteriophages. To catalyse a new era of viral discovery we made millions of viral alignments and family identifications freely available to the research community. Expanding the known diversity and zoonotic reservoirs of CoV and other emerging pathogens can accelerate vaccine and therapeutic developments for the current pandemic, and help us anticipate and mitigate future ones.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robert C Edgar","author_inst":"Independent Scientist"},{"author_name":"Jeff Taylor","author_inst":"Independent Scientist"},{"author_name":"Tomer Altman","author_inst":"Altman Analytics LLC"},{"author_name":"Pierre Barbera","author_inst":"Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies"},{"author_name":"Dmitry Meleshko","author_inst":"St. Petersburg State University"},{"author_name":"Victor Lin","author_inst":"Independent Scientist"},{"author_name":"Dan Lohr","author_inst":"Independent Scientist"},{"author_name":"Gherman Novakovsky","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Basem Al-Shayeb","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Jill Banfield","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Anton Korobeynikov","author_inst":"St. Petersburg State University"},{"author_name":"Rayan Chikhi","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur, CNRS"},{"author_name":"Artem Babaian","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Shin-Ru Shih","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan City, Taiwan; Research Center for Emerging Viral Infections, College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Charles Chen","author_inst":"Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corporation, Taipei City, Taiwan; Adjunct Professor of College of Science and Technology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA 19122, U"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.02.20129767","rel_title":"A Classification Approach for Predicting COVID-19 Patient Survival Outcome with Machine Learning Techniques","rel_date":"2020-08-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.02.20129767","rel_abs":"COVID-19 is an infectious disease discovered after the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. COVID-19 is still becoming an increasing global threat to public health. The virus has been escalated to many countries across the globe. This paper analyzed and compared the performance of three different supervised machine learning techniques; Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) on COVID-19 dataset. The best level of accuracy between these three algorithms was determined by comparison of some metrics for assessing predictive performance such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F-score, Kappa index, and ROC. From the analysis results, RF was found to be the best algorithm with 100% prediction accuracy in comparison with LDA and SVM with 95.2% and 90.9% respectively. Our analysis shows that out of these three classification models RF predicts COVID-19 patient's survival outcome with the highest accuracy. Chi-square test reveals that all the seven features except sex were significantly correlated with the COVID-19 patient's outcome (P-value < 0.005). Therefore, RF was recommended for COVID-19 patient outcome prediction that will help in early identification of possible sensitive cases for quick provision of quality health care, support and supervision.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abdulhameed Ado Osi","author_inst":"Kano University of Science and Technology, Wudil"},{"author_name":"Hussaini Garba Dikko","author_inst":"Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria"},{"author_name":"Mannir Abdu","author_inst":"Kano University of Science and Technology, Wudil"},{"author_name":"Auwalu Ibrahim","author_inst":"Kano University of Science and Technology, Wudil"},{"author_name":"Lawan Adamu Isma'il","author_inst":"Kano University of Science and Technology, Wudil"},{"author_name":"Hassan Sarki","author_inst":"Kano University of Science and Technology, Wudil"},{"author_name":"Usman Muhammad","author_inst":"Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria"},{"author_name":"Ahmad Abubakar Suleiman","author_inst":"Kano University of Science and Technology, Wudil"},{"author_name":"Safiya Sada Sani","author_inst":"Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria"},{"author_name":"Muftahu Zubairu Ringim","author_inst":"Kano University of Science and Technology, Wudil"},{"author_name":"Anton Korobeynikov","author_inst":"St. Petersburg State University"},{"author_name":"Rayan Chikhi","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur, CNRS"},{"author_name":"Artem Babaian","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Shin-Ru Shih","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan City, Taiwan; Research Center for Emerging Viral Infections, College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Charles Chen","author_inst":"Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corporation, Taipei City, Taiwan; Adjunct Professor of College of Science and Technology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA 19122, U"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.10.242677","rel_title":"High throughput detection and genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 using COVIDSeq next generation sequencing","rel_date":"2020-08-10","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.10.242677","rel_abs":"The rapid emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a global pandemic affecting millions of individuals globally has necessitated sensitive and high-throughput approaches for the diagnosis, surveillance and for determining the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we used the COVIDSeq protocol, which involves multiplex-PCR, barcoding and sequencing of samples for high-throughput detection and deciphering the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. We used the approach on 752 clinical samples in duplicates, amounting to a total of 1536 samples which could be sequenced on a single S4 sequencing flow cell on NovaSeq 6000. Our analysis suggests a high concordance between technical duplicates and a high concordance of detection of SARS-CoV-2 between the COVIDSeq as well as RT-PCR approaches. An in-depth analysis revealed a total of six samples in which COVIDSeq detected SARS-CoV-2 in high confidence which were negative in RT-PCR. Additionally, the assay could detect SARS-CoV-2 in 21 samples and 16 samples which were classified inconclusive and pan-sarbeco positive respectively suggesting that COVIDSeq could be used as a confirmatory test. The sequencing approach also enabled insights into the evolution and genetic epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 samples. The samples were classified into a total of 3 clades. This study reports two lineages B.1.112 and B.1.99 for the first time in India. This study also revealed 1,143 unique single nucleotide variants and added a total of 73 novel variants identified for the first time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the COVIDSeq approach for detection and genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. Our analysis suggests that COVIDSeq could be a potential high sensitivity assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2, with an additional advantage of enabling genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":57,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rahul C.

identified coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, emerged in December 2019 in Hubei Province, China, and quickly spread throughout the world; so far, it has caused more than 18 million cases of disease and 700,000 deaths. The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is currently based on the detection of viral RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs by means of molecular-based assays, such as real-time RT-PCR. Furthermore, serological assays aimed at detecting different classes of antibodies constitute the best surveillance strategy for gathering information on the humoral immune response to infection and the spread of the virus through the population, in order to evaluate the immunogenicity of novel future vaccines and medicines for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 disease. The aim of this study was to determine SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in human serum samples by means of different commercial and in-house ELISA kits, in order to evaluate and compare their results first with one another and then with those yielded by functional assays using wild-type virus. It is important to know the level of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies in order to predict population immunity and possible cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses and to identify potentially infectious subjects. In addition, in a small sub-group of samples, we performed a subtyping Immunoglobulin G ELISA. Our data showed an excellent statistical correlation between the neutralization titer and the IgG, IgM and IgA ELISA response against the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein, confirming that antibodies against this portion of the virus spike protein are highly neutralizing and that the ELISA Receptor-Binding Domain-based assay can be used as a valid surrogate for the neutralization assay in laboratories which do not have Biosecurity level-3 facilities.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Livia Mazzini","author_inst":"Vismederi S.r.l."},{"author_name":"Donata

Despite early identification of ACE2 as the receptor for viral spike protein, much remains to be understood about the molecular events behind viral dissemination. We evaluated the contribution of C-type lectin receptors (CLRS) of antigen-presenting cells, widely present in air mucosa and lung tissue. DC-SIGN, L-SIGN, Langerin and MGL bind to diverse glycans of the spike using multiple interaction areas. Using pseudovirus and cells derived from monocytes or T-lymphocytes, we demonstrate that while virus capture by the CLRs examined does not allow direct cell infection, DC\/L-SIGN, among these receptors, promote virus transfer to permissive ACE2+ cells. A glycomimetic compound designed against DC-SIGN, enable inhibition of this process. Thus, we described a mechanism potentiating viral capture and spreading of infection.

a rising death toll. The causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), uses its nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) to redirect host translation machinery to the viral RNA by binding to the ribosome and suppressing cellular, but not viral, protein synthesis through yet unknown mechanisms. We show here that among all viral proteins, Nsp1 has the largest impact on host viability in the cells of human lung origin. Differential expression analysis of mRNA-seq data revealed that Nsp1 broadly alters the transcriptome in human cells. The changes include repression of major gene clusters in ribosomal RNA processing, translation, mitochondria function, cell cycle and antigen presentation; and induction of factors in transcriptional regulation. We further gained a mechanistic understanding of the Nsp1 function by determining the cryo-EM structure of the Nsp1-40S ribosomal subunit complex, which shows that Nsp1 inhibits translation by plugging the mRNA entry channel of the 40S. We also determined the cryo-EM structure of the 48S preinitiation complex (PIC) formed by Nsp1, 40S, and the cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) internal ribosome entry site (IRES) RNA, which shows that this 48S PIC is nonfunctional due to the incorrect position of the 3 region of the mRNA. Results presented here elucidate the mechanism of host translation inhibition by SARS-CoV-2, provide insight into viral protein synthesis, and furnish a comprehensive understanding of the impacts from one of the most potent pathogenicity factors of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nHighlightsORF screen identified Nsp1 as a major cellular pathogenicity factor of SARS-CoV-2\n\nNsp1 broadly alters the gene expression programs in human cells\n\nNsp1 inhibits translation by blocking mRNA entry channel\n\nNsp1 prevents physiological conformation of the 48S PIC","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shuai Yuan","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Lei Peng","author_inst":"Department of Genetics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA; Systems Biology Institute, Yale University, West Haven, CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Jonathan J.

from SARS-CoV-2 continue to rise worldwide with devastating health and economic costs. SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into host cells via an interaction between its Spike protein and the host cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Disruption of this interaction confers potent neutralization of viral entry, providing an avenue for vaccine design and for therapeutic antibodies. Here, we develop single-domain antibodies (nanobodies) that potently disrupt the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and ACE2. By screening a yeast surface-displayed library of synthetic nanobody sequences, we identified a panel of nanobodies that bind to multiple epitopes on Spike and block ACE2 interaction via two distinct mechanisms. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) revealed that one exceptionally stable nanobody, Nb6, binds Spike in a fully inactive conformation with its receptor binding domains (RBDs) locked into their inaccessible down-state, incapable of binding ACE2. Affinity maturation and structure-guided design of multivalency yielded a trivalent nanobody, mNb6-tri, with femtomolar affinity for SARS-CoV-2 Spike and picomolar neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 infection. mNb6-tri retains stability and function after aerosolization, lyophilization, and heat treatment. These properties may enable aerosol-mediated delivery of this potent neutralizer directly to the airway epithelia, promising to yield a widely deployable, patient-friendly prophylactic and\/or early infection therapeutic agent to stem the worst pandemic in a century.","rel_num_authors":57,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael Schoof","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Bryan Faust","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Reuben A Saunders","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Smriti Sangwan","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Veronica V Rezelj","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Nick Hoppe","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Morgane Boone","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Christian Billesboelle","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Cristina Puchades","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Caleigh M Azumaya","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Huong T Kratochvil","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Marcell Zimanyi","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Ishan Deshpande","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Jiahao Liang","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Sasha Dickinson","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Henry C Nguyen","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Cynthia M Chio","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Gregory E Merz","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Michael C Thompson","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Devan Diwanji","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Kaitlin Schaefer","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Aditya A Anand","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Niv Dobzinski","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Beth Shoshana Zha","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Camille R.

Here, we present a strategy to rapidly identify and assemble synthetic human variable heavy (VH) domain binders with high affinity toward neutralizing epitopes without the need for high-resolution structural information. We constructed a VH-phage library and targeted a known neutralizing site, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding interface of the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor-binding domain (Spike-RBD). Using a masked selection approach, we identified 85 unique VH binders to two non-overlapping epitopes within the ACE2 binding site on Spike-RBD. This enabled us to systematically link these VH domains into multivalent and bi-paratopic formats. These multivalent and bi-paratopic VH constructs showed a marked increase in affinity to Spike (up to 600-fold) and neutralization potency (up to 1400-fold) on pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus when compared to the standalone VH domains. The most potent binder, a trivalent VH, neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 with half-minimal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 4.0 nM (180 ng\/mL). A cryo-EM structure of the trivalent VH bound to Spike shows each VH domain bound an RBD at the ACE2 binding site, explaining its increased neutralization potency and confirming our original design strategy. Our results demonstrate that targeted selection and engineering campaigns using a VH-phage library can enable rapid assembly of highly avid and potent molecules towards therapeutically important protein interfaces.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Colton J.

After examining the molecular structures and activities of hepatitis C viral inhibitors and comparing hepatitis C virus and coronavirus replication, we previously postulated that the FDA-approved hepatitis C drug EPCLUSA (Sofosbuvir\/Velpatasvir) might inhibit SARS-CoV-2.1 We subsequently demonstrated that Sofosbuvir triphosphate is incorporated by the relatively low fidelity SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps), serving as an immediate polymerase reaction terminator, but not by a host-like high fidelity DNA polymerase.2,3 Other investigators have since demonstrated the ability of Sofosbuvir to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung and brain cells;4,5 additionally, COVID-19 clinical trials with EPCLUSA6 and with Sofosbuvir plus Daclatasvir7 have been initiated in several countries. SARS-CoV-2 has an exonuclease-based proofreader to maintain the viral genome integrity.8 Any effective antiviral targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp must display a certain level of resistance to this proofreading activity. We report here that Sofosbuvir terminated RNA resists removal by the exonuclease to a substantially higher extent than RNA terminated by Remdesivir, another drug being used as a COVID-19 therapeutic.

A phase 2 trial conducted to further evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of a SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine (CoronaVac). METHODS We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the optimal dose, immunogenicity and safety of the CoronaVac. A total of 600 healthy adults aged 18-59 years were randomly assigned to receive 2 injections of the trial vaccine at a dose of 3 g\/0.5 mL or 6 g \/0.5mL, or placebo on Day 0,14 schedule or Day 0,28 schedule. For safety evaluation, solicited and unsolicited adverse events were collected after each vaccination within 7 days and 28 days, respectively. Blood samples were taken for antibody assay. RESULTS CoronaVac was well tolerated, and no dose-related safety concerns were observed. Most of the adverse reactions fell in the solicited category and were mild in severity. Pain at injection site was the most frequently reported symptoms. No Grade 3 adverse reaction or vaccine related SAEs were reported. CoronaVac showed good immunogenicity with the lower 3 g dose eliciting 92.4% seroconversion under Day 0,14 schedule and 97.4% under Day 0,28 schedule. 28 days after two-dose vaccination, the Nab levels of individual schedules range from 23.8 to 65.4 among different dosage and vaccination schedules. CONCLUSIONS Favorable safety and immunogenicity of CoronaVac was demonstrated on both schedules and both dosages, which support the conduction of phase 3 trial with optimum schedule\/dosage per different scenarios.","rel_num_authors":30,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yan-Jun Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Gang Zeng","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd."},{"author_name":"Hong-Xing Pan","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chang-Gui Li","author_inst":"National Institutes for Food and Drug Control"},{"author_name":"Biao Kan","author_inst":"National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Ya-Ling Hu","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd."},{"author_name":"Hai-Yan Mao","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Qian-Qian Xin","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd."},{"author_name":"Kai Chu","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Wei-Xiao Han","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd."},{"author_name":"Zhen Chen","author_inst":"National Institutes for Food and Drug Control"},{"author_name":"Rong Tang","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Wei-Dong Yin","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd."},{"author_name":"Xin Chen","author_inst":"Suining County Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xue-Jie Gong","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd."},{"author_name":"Chuan Qin","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Human Disease Comparative Medicine, Chinese Ministry of Health, Beijing Key Laboratory for Animal Models of Emerging and Remerging Infectious "},{"author_name":"Yuan-Sheng Hu","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd."},{"author_name":"Xiao-Yong Liu","author_inst":"Suining County Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Guo-Liang Cui","author_inst":"Sinovac Life Sciences Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Cong-Bing Jiang","author_inst":"Suining County Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Suining"},{"author_name":"Heng-Ming Zhang","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd."},{"author_name":"Jing-Xin Li","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Min-Nan Yang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, National Laboratory of Macromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Juan Lian","author_inst":"Sinovac Life Sciences Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Yan Song","author_inst":"Suining County Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jin-Xing Lu","author_inst":"National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changping"},{"author_name":"Xiang-Xi Wang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, National Laboratory of Macromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Miao Xu","author_inst":"National Institutes for Food and Drug Control"},{"author_name":"Qiang Gao","author_inst":"Sinovac Life Sciences Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Feng-Cai Zhu","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Fei Li","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Yanxin Liu","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Kaihua Zhang","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"David Bulkley","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Ming Sun","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Amber M Smith","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Alexandrea N.

Furthermore, seven Nbs were shown to block interaction of human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with SARS-CoV-2-RBD-variants, bat-SL-CoV-WIV1-RBD and SARS-CoV-1-RBD. Among the seven candidates, Nb11-59 exhibited the highest activity against authentic SARS-CoV-2 with ND50 of 0.55 g\/mL. Nb11-59 can be produced on a large-scale in Pichia pastoris, with 20 g\/L titer and 99.36% purity. It also showed good stability profile, and nebulization did not impact its stability.

SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the feces of some Covid-19 patients which suggests the possibility that the virus could additionally be transmitted via the orofecal route. Methods This review is part of an Open Evidence Review on Transmission Dynamics of Covid-19. We conduct ongoing searches using LitCovid, medRxiv, Google Scholar and Google for Covid-19; assess study quality based on five criteria and report important findings on an ongoing basis. Where necessary authors are contacted for further details or clarification on the content of their articles. Results We found 59 studies: nine reviews and 51 primary studies or reports (one cohort study also included a review) examining the potential role of orofecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Half (n=29) were done in China. Thirty seven studies reported positive fecal samples for SARS-CoV-2 based on RT-PCR results (n=1,034 patients). Six studies reported isolating the virus from fecal samples of nine patients, one study isolated the virus from rectal tissue and one laboratory study found that SARS-CoV-2 productively infected human small intestinal organoids. Eleven studies report on fecal samples found in sewage, and two sampled bathrooms and toilets. Conclusions Various observational and mechanistic evidence support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 can infect and be shed from the human gastrointestinal tract. Policy should emphasize the importance of strict personal hygiene measures, and chlorine-based disinfection of surfaces in locations where there is presumed or known SARS-CoV-2 activity.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carl Heneghan","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Spencer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jon Brassey","author_inst":"Trip Database"},{"author_name":"Tom Jefferson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peng Qiao","author_inst":"Shanghai Novamab Biopharmaceuticals Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Xiaofei Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Novamab Biopharmaceuticals Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Haiwei Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology,  Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yanmin Zhang","author_inst":"School of Science, China Pharmaceutical University"},{"author_name":"Yadong Chen","author_inst":"School of Science, China Pharmaceutical University"},{"author_name":"Weiwei Ji","author_inst":"Shanghai Novamab Biopharmaceuticals Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Hao Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Novamab Biopharmaceuticals Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Huanhuan Cao","author_inst":"Shanghai Novamab Biopharmaceuticals Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Xionghui Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Novamab Biopharmaceuticals Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Rui Gong","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yakun Wan","author_inst":"Shanghai Novamab Biopharmaceuticals Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Chuan Qin","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Human Disease Comparative Medicine, Chinese Ministry of Health, Beijing Key Laboratory for Animal Models of Emerging and Remerging Infectious "},{"author_name":"Yuan-Sheng Hu","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd."},{"author_name":"Xiao-Yong Liu","author_inst":"Suining County Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Guo-Liang Cui","author_inst":"Sinovac Life Sciences Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Cong-Bing Jiang","author_inst":"Suining County Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Suining"},{"author_name":"Heng-Ming Zhang","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd."},{"author_name":"Jing-Xin Li","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Min-Nan Yang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, National Laboratory of Macromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Juan Lian","author_inst":"Sinovac Life Sciences Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Yan Song","author_inst":"Suining County Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jin-Xing Lu","author_inst":"National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changping"},{"author_name":"Xiang-Xi Wang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, National Laboratory of Macromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Miao Xu","author_inst":"National Institutes for Food and Drug Control"},{"author_name":"Qiang Gao","author_inst":"Sinovac Life Sciences Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Feng-Cai Zhu","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Fei Li","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Yanxin Liu","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Kaihua Zhang","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"David Bulkley","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Ming Sun","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Amber M Smith","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Alexandrea N.

The potential of SARS-CoV-2 evolution to create novel dangerous variants remains underexplored. Thus, we passaged SARS-CoV-2 in defined conditions and determined its genomic adaptation dynamics. We demonstrate the presence of remarkably stable SARS-CoV-2 quasispecies. We further show that the quasispecies nature of the virus population ensured rapid adaptation of the spike PRRARS motif upon passaging in Vero cells. On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 replication in TMPRSS2 expressing cells led to a reverse mutation at the same site. We observed the emergence of novel mutations in envelope protein upon virus culture in Calu-3 and Caco-2 cells. Finally, we show that the heparan sulfate-binding motif (PRRARS) of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein acted as a determinant of negative growth selection. Overall, our research has far-reaching implications for development of antiviral strategies, suggesting viral quasispecies may facilitate rapid emergence of escape mutants under selection pressure, such as the treatment with antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"M.

While much has been learned in the first months of the pandemic, many features of COVID-19 pathogenesis remain to be determined. For example, anosmia is a common presentation and many patients with this finding show no or only minor respiratory signs. Studies in animals experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, provide opportunities to study aspects of the disease not easily investigated in human patients. COVID-19 severity ranges from asymptomatic to lethal. Most experimental infections provide insights into mild disease. Here, using K18-hACE2 mice that we originally developed for SARS studies, we show that infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes severe disease in the lung, and in some mice, the brain. Evidence of thrombosis and vasculitis was detected in mice with severe pneumonia. Further, we show that infusion of convalescent plasma (CP) from a recovered COVID-19 patient provided protection against lethal disease. Mice developed anosmia at early times after infection. Notably, while treatment with CP prevented significant clinical disease, it did not prevent anosmia. Thus K18-hACE2 mice provide a useful model for studying the pathological underpinnings of both mild and lethal COVID-19 and for assessing therapeutic interventions.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stanley Perlman","author_inst":"University of Iowa"},{"author_name":"Jian Zheng","author_inst":"University of Iowa"},{"author_name":"LOK YIN ROY WONG","author_inst":"University of Iowa"},{"author_name":"Kun Li","author_inst":"University of Iowa"},{"author_name":"Abhishek K Verma","author_inst":"University of Iowa"},{"author_name":"Miguel E Ortiz Bezara","author_inst":"University of Iowa"},{"author_name":"Christine Wohlford-Lenane","author_inst":"University of Iowa"},{"author_name":"Mariah R.

While the 26-nucleotide deletion variant was only found in one sample in March 2020, the 34-nucleotide deletion variant was found within a single geriatric hospital unit in 5\/9 patients sequenced and one health care worker with samples collected between April 2nd and 9th, 2020. Both the presence of the 34-nucleotide deletion variant limited to this unit and the clustering of the corresponding whole genome sequences by phylogeny analysis strongly suggested a nosocomial transmission between patients. Interestingly, prolonged viral excretion of the 34-nucleotide deletion variant was identified in a stool sample 14 days after initial diagnosis for one patient. Clinical data revealed no significant difference in disease severity between patients harboring the wild-type or the 34-nucleotide deletion variants. The in vitro infection of the two deletion variants on primate endothelial kidney cells (BGM) and human lung adenocarcinoma cells (Calu-3) yielded comparable replication kinetics with the wild-type strain. Furthermore, high viral loads were found in vivo regardless of the presence or absence of the ORF6 deletion. Our study highlights the transmission and replication capacity of two newly described deletion variants in the same ORF6 region.\n\nImportanceWhile the SARS-CoV-2 genome has remained relatively stable since its emergence in the human population, genomic deletions are an evolutionary pattern previously described for the related SARS-CoV. Real-time genomic monitoring of the circulating variants is paramount to detect strain prevalence and transmission dynamics. Given the role of ORF6 in interferon modulation, further characterization, such as mechanistic interactions and interferon monitoring in patients, is crucial in understanding the viral-host factors driving disease evolution.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gregory Queromes","author_inst":"CIRI (Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie)"},{"author_name":"Gregory Destras","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Antonin Bal","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Hadrien Regue","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Gwendolyne Burfin","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Solenne Brun","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Remi Fanget","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Florence Morfin","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Martine Valette","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Bruno Lina","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Emilie Frobert","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Laurence Josset","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Luka Cicin-Sain","author_inst":"Department of Vaccinology and applied Microbiology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Studies"},{"author_name":"Rui Gong","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yakun Wan","author_inst":"Shanghai Novamab Biopharmaceuticals Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Chuan Qin","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Human Disease Comparative Medicine, Chinese Ministry of Health, Beijing Key Laboratory for Animal Models of Emerging and Remerging Infectious "},{"author_name":"Yuan-Sheng Hu","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd."},{"author_name":"Xiao-Yong Liu","author_inst":"Suining County Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Guo-Liang Cui","author_inst":"Sinovac Life Sciences Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Cong-Bing Jiang","author_inst":"Suining County Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Suining"},{"author_name":"Heng-Ming Zhang","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd."},{"author_name":"Jing-Xin Li","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Min-Nan Yang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, National Laboratory of Macromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Juan Lian","author_inst":"Sinovac Life Sciences Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Yan Song","author_inst":"Suining County Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jin-Xing Lu","author_inst":"National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changping"},{"author_name":"Xiang-Xi Wang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, National Laboratory of Macromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Miao Xu","author_inst":"National Institutes for Food and Drug Control"},{"author_name":"Qiang Gao","author_inst":"Sinovac Life Sciences Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Feng-Cai Zhu","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Fei Li","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Yanxin Liu","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Kaihua Zhang","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"David Bulkley","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Ming Sun","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Amber M Smith","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Alexandrea N.

COVID-19 has also had a severe impact on the quality of life and mental health. While different health authorities such as WHO and CDC are encouraging adoption of strategies including hand washing and use of facemasks to reduce the spread of the pathogens and infections, adoption of these approaches requires substantial commitment. Current hand sanitizers based on ethanol provide immediate protection, however, the protection rendered by such sanitizers is very short-lived due to their rapid evaporation. A long-lasting sanitizing skin protectant that can effectively inactivate SARS-CoV-2 and provide persistent efficacy over several hours will provide people the freedom to carry on with their activities without constant concerns about the cleanliness of their hands. Herein, we describe a skin protectant, IonLASTTM, based on an ionic liquid\/deep eutectic solvent, formed by GRAS materials, choline and geranic acid (CAGE, CG-101), that provides protection for at least 4h after a single application. IonLASTTM was formulated as a gel that facilitates easy application on the skin. Tolerance of CG-101 was substantiated through a study in human volunteers. In vitro studies confirmed that IonLASTTM effectively inactivates a human coronavirus hCoV229E. A second human clinical study established that a single application of IonLASTTM imparts protection against microbes that lasts up to several hours.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marina Shevachman","author_inst":"CAGE Bio Inc."},{"author_name":"Abhirup Mandal","author_inst":"CAGE Bio Inc."},{"author_name":"Samir Mitragotri","author_inst":"John A.

This comparison was done between local cases and imported cases. There have been no prior studies on COVID-19 in the Caribbean and as such this paper attempts to discuss the patterns associated with COVID-19 patients in the Caribbean. Methods: This study determined the epidemiology of COVID-19 in a Caribbean territory using retrospective data. Analysis was performed using Excel and SPSS v23. Results: The majority of patients were female (61.9%) vs male (38.0%). The majority of the population were between 45 -64 yrs (43.4%) followed by above 65 at 28.8%. Cough was the most common presenting complaint at 44.9%, with fever being second 37.1%. The majority of female participants had a travel history at 61.9%, while males were 38.0 %. The occurrence of cough was high among both local cases (46.4%) and imported cases (47.6%).

Study design: This retrospective analysis of children tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and IgG antibody at a quaternary-care, free-standing pediatric hospital between March 13th, 2020 to June 21st, 2020 included 6369 patients who underwent PCR testing and 215 patients who underwent antibody testing. During the initial study period, testing focused primarily on symptomatic children; the later study period included asymptomatic patients who underwent testing as preadmission or preprocedural screening. We report the proportion of positive and negative tests, time to viral clearance, and time to seropositivity. Results: The rate of positivity varied over time due to viral circulation in the community and transition from targeted testing of symptomatic patients to more universal screening of hospitalized patients. Median duration of viral shedding (RT-PCR positivity) was 19.5 days and RT-PCR negativity from positivity was 25 days. Of note, patients aged 6 to 15 years demonstrated a longer period of RT-PCR negativity from positivity, compared to patients aged 16 to 22 years (median=32 versus 18 days, p=0.015). Median time to seropositivity from RT-PCR positivity was 18 days while median time to reach adequate levels of neutralizing antibodies (defined as equivalent to 160 titer) was 36 days. Conclusions: The majority of patients demonstrated a prolonged period of viral shedding after infection with SARS CoV-2. Whether this correlates with persistent infectivity is unknown. Only 17 of 33 patients demonstrated neutralizing antibodies, suggesting that some patients may not mount significant immune responses to infection. It remains unknown if IgG antibody production correlates with immunity and how long measurable antibodies persist and protect against future infection.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Burak Bahar","author_inst":"Children's National Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cyril Jacquot","author_inst":"Children's National Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yunchuan Delores Mo","author_inst":"Children's National Hospital"},{"author_name":"Roberta DeBiasi","author_inst":"Children's National Hospital"},{"author_name":"Meghan Delaney","author_inst":"Children's National Hospital"},{"author_name":"Solenne Brun","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Remi Fanget","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Florence Morfin","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Martine Valette","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Bruno Lina","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Emilie Frobert","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Laurence Josset","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Luka Cicin-Sain","author_inst":"Department of Vaccinology and applied Microbiology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Studies"},{"author_name":"Rui Gong","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yakun Wan","author_inst":"Shanghai Novamab Biopharmaceuticals Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Chuan Qin","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Human Disease Comparative Medicine, Chinese Ministry of Health, Beijing Key Laboratory for Animal Models of Emerging and Remerging Infectious "},{"author_name":"Yuan-Sheng Hu","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd."},{"author_name":"Xiao-Yong Liu","author_inst":"Suining County Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Guo-Liang Cui","author_inst":"Sinovac Life Sciences Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Cong-Bing Jiang","author_inst":"Suining County Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Suining"},{"author_name":"Heng-Ming Zhang","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd."},{"author_name":"Jing-Xin Li","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Min-Nan Yang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, National Laboratory of Macromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Juan Lian","author_inst":"Sinovac Life Sciences Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Yan Song","author_inst":"Suining County Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jin-Xing Lu","author_inst":"National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changping"},{"author_name":"Xiang-Xi Wang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, National Laboratory of Macromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Miao Xu","author_inst":"National Institutes for Food and Drug Control"},{"author_name":"Qiang Gao","author_inst":"Sinovac Life Sciences Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Feng-Cai Zhu","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Fei Li","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Yanxin Liu","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Kaihua Zhang","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"David Bulkley","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Ming Sun","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Amber M Smith","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Alexandrea N.

Methods: We investigated GT online searches for the search term   within the past five years. The time frame for data gathering was considered as the initiation and end dates of lockdown in Iran. Relative search volumes (RSVs) for online Google Search queries in 2019 was considered as the control. We performed one-way ANOVA statistical test to identify whether there is a statistical difference for RSV scores between the year 2020 and 2016-2019 for the whole country. Then we investigated the possible association of RSVs in provinces with dentists density, prevalence of current daily smokers, Human Development Index (HDI), Internet access, and fluoride concentration in water with linear regression. A p-value<0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: When comparing 2020 with previous four years, there is a statistically significant difference between RSVs of 2020 with all previous years combined and each of these years (P<0.001 for all of them). In the linear model for the year 2020, HDI (B=-3.29, 95% CI: (-5.80, -0.78), P=0.012), fluoride concentration (B=-0.13, 95% CI: (-0.24, -0.03), P=0.017), and prevalence of daily smokers (B=0.33, 95% CI: (0.13, 0.53), P=0.002) were significantly associated with RSVs. These covariates were not statistically significant for other years, except for Internet access in 2016 (B=-1.13, 95% CI: (-2.26, 0.00), P=0.050). Conclusion: The RSVs for toothache in 2020 have significantly increased due to COVID-19-imposed lockdowns compared to the same period of the year in the past four years. knowing that this period mostly overlaps with the national holidays of Nowruz in Iran, reinforces the impacts of lockdowns on people CSB about toothache. In the subnational scale, the RSVs were significantly correlated with HDI, fluoride concentration, and number of daily smokers which emphasizes the role of socioeconomic factors in dental health and care-seeking behaviour.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ahmad Sofi-Mahmudi","author_inst":"Cochrane Iran Associate Centre, National Institute for Medical Research Development (NIMAD), Tehran, Iran."},{"author_name":"Erfan Shamsoddin","author_inst":"National Institute for Medical Research Development (NIMAD), Tehran, Iran."},{"author_name":"Peyman Ghasemi","author_inst":"Department of Health Economics, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."},{"author_name":"Ali Mehrabi Bahar","author_inst":"Department of Health Policy and Management, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."},{"author_name":"Mansour Shaban Azad","author_inst":"Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Shahid Chamran Heart Educational, Medical and Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran."},{"author_name":"Ghasem Sadeghi","author_inst":"Bureau of Dentistry, Vice Chancellery for Treatment, Ministry of Health and Education, Tehran, Iran."},{"author_name":"Remi Fanget","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Florence Morfin","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Martine Valette","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Bruno Lina","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Emilie Frobert","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Laurence Josset","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Luka Cicin-Sain","author_inst":"Department of Vaccinology and applied Microbiology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Studies"},{"author_name":"Rui Gong","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yakun Wan","author_inst":"Shanghai Novamab Biopharmaceuticals Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Chuan Qin","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Human Disease Comparative Medicine, Chinese Ministry of Health, Beijing Key Laboratory for Animal Models of Emerging and Remerging Infectious "},{"author_name":"Yuan-Sheng Hu","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd."},{"author_name":"Xiao-Yong Liu","author_inst":"Suining County Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Guo-Liang Cui","author_inst":"Sinovac Life Sciences Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Cong-Bing Jiang","author_inst":"Suining County Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Suining"},{"author_name":"Heng-Ming Zhang","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd."},{"author_name":"Jing-Xin Li","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Min-Nan Yang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, National Laboratory of Macromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Juan Lian","author_inst":"Sinovac Life Sciences Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Yan Song","author_inst":"Suining County Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jin-Xing Lu","author_inst":"National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changping"},{"author_name":"Xiang-Xi Wang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, National Laboratory of Macromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Miao Xu","author_inst":"National Institutes for Food and Drug Control"},{"author_name":"Qiang Gao","author_inst":"Sinovac Life Sciences Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Feng-Cai Zhu","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Fei Li","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Yanxin Liu","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Kaihua Zhang","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"David Bulkley","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Ming Sun","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Amber M Smith","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Alexandrea N.

A two-parameter model based on social distance index (SDI) and disease transmission efficiency (G) parameters is used to characterize SARS-CoV-2 disease spread. Current lack of coherent and coordinated US policy causes the US to follow a linear infection growth path with a limit cycle behavior that modulates the US between accelerating and decaying infection growth on either side of a linear growth path boundary. Four prediction cases are presented: 1) No school re-openings; fall season temperature effect 2) No school re-openings; no fall season temperature effect 3) School re-openings; fall season temperature effect 4) School re-openings; no fall season temperature effect Fall outdoor temperatures, in contrast to the 1918 pandemic, are predicted to be beneficial for dampening SARS-CoV-2 transmission in States as they pass through swing season temperature range of 70F to 50F. Physical re-opening of schools in September are predicted to accelerate infections. States with low current infectious case numbers (eg, NY) are predicted to be minimally impacted while States with high current infectious case numbers (eg, CA and FL) will be significantly impacted by school re-openings. Updated infection predictions will be posted monthly (Sept, Oct, Nov, Dec) with adjustments based on actual trends in SDI and G. Assessments related to outdoor temperature impact, school re-openings, and other public gathering re-openings will be discussed in updated reports.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ty A Newell","author_inst":"University of Illinois"},{"author_name":"Erfan Shamsoddin","author_inst":"National Institute for Medical Research Development (NIMAD), Tehran, Iran."},{"author_name":"Peyman Ghasemi","author_inst":"Department of Health Economics, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."},{"author_name":"Ali Mehrabi Bahar","author_inst":"Department of Health Policy and Management, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."},{"author_name":"Mansour Shaban Azad","author_inst":"Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Shahid Chamran Heart Educational, Medical and Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran."},{"author_name":"Ghasem Sadeghi","author_inst":"Bureau of Dentistry, Vice Chancellery for Treatment, Ministry of Health and Education, Tehran, Iran."},{"author_name":"Remi Fanget","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Florence Morfin","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Martine Valette","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Bruno Lina","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Emilie Frobert","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Laurence Josset","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Luka Cicin-Sain","author_inst":"Department of Vaccinology and applied Microbiology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Studies"},{"author_name":"Rui Gong","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yakun Wan","author_inst":"Shanghai Novamab Biopharmaceuticals Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Chuan Qin","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Human Disease Comparative Medicine, Chinese Ministry of Health, Beijing Key Laboratory for Animal Models of Emerging and Remerging Infectious "},{"author_name":"Yuan-Sheng Hu","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd."},{"author_name":"Xiao-Yong Liu","author_inst":"Suining County Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Guo-Liang Cui","author_inst":"Sinovac Life Sciences Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Cong-Bing Jiang","author_inst":"Suining County Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Suining"},{"author_name":"Heng-Ming Zhang","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd."},{"author_name":"Jing-Xin Li","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Min-Nan Yang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, National Laboratory of Macromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Juan Lian","author_inst":"Sinovac Life Sciences Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Yan Song","author_inst":"Suining County Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jin-Xing Lu","author_inst":"National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changping"},{"author_name":"Xiang-Xi Wang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, National Laboratory of Macromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Miao Xu","author_inst":"National Institutes for Food and Drug Control"},{"author_name":"Qiang Gao","author_inst":"Sinovac Life Sciences Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Feng-Cai Zhu","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Fei Li","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Yanxin Liu","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Kaihua Zhang","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"David Bulkley","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Ming Sun","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Amber M Smith","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Alexandrea N.

No versatile web app exists that allows epidemiologists and managers around the world to fully analyze the impacts of COVID-19 mitigation. The NMB-DASA web app presented here fills this gap. Methods. Our web app uses a model that explicitly identifies a contact class of individuals, symptomatic and asymptomatic classes and a parallel set of response class, subject to lower contact pathogen contact rates. The user inputs a CSV file containing incidence and mortality time series. A default set of parameters is available that can be overwritten through input or online entry, and a subset of these can be fitted to the model using an MLE algorithm. The end of model-fitting and forecasting intervals are specifiable and changes to parameters allows counterfactual and forecasted scenarios to be explored. Findings. We illustrate the app in the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak in Israel, which can be divided into four distinct phases: an initial outbreak; a social distancing, a social relaxation, and a second wave mitigation phase. Our projections beyond the relaxation phase indicate that an 85% drop in social relaxation rates are needed just to stabilize the current incidence rate and that at least a 95% drop is needed to quell the outbreak. Interpretation. Our analysis uses only incidence and mortality rates. In the hands of policy makers and health officers, we believe our web app provides an invaluable tool for evaluating the impacts of different outbreak mitigation policies and measures.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wayne M.

Hematochezia is an uncommon clinical presentation of COVID-19 disease and we hypothesize that older patients with significant comorbidites (obesity and cardiovascular) and prolonged hospitalization are suspectible to ischemic injury to the bowel. We reviewed the clinical course, key laboratory data including acute phase reactants, drug\/medication history in two elderly male patients admitted for COVID-19 respiratory failure. Both patients had a complicated clinical course and suffered from hematochezia and acute blood loss anemia requiring blood transfusion around day 40 of their hospitalization. Colonoscopic impressions were correlated with the histopathological findings in the colonic biopies and changes compatible with ischemia to nonspecific acute inflammation, edema and increased eosinophils in the lamina propria were noted.Both patients were on anticoagulants, multiple antibiotics and antifungal agents due to respiratory infections at the time of lower GI bleeding. Hematochezia resolved spontaneously with supportive care. Both patients eventually recovered and were discharged. Elderly patients with significant comorbid conditions are uniquely at risk for ischemic injury to the bowel. Hypoxic conditions due to COVID-19 pneumonia and respiratory failure, compounded by preexisting cardiovascular complications, and\/or cytokine storm orchestrated by the viral infection leading to alteration in coagulation profile and\/or drug\/medication injury can be difficult to distinguish in these critically ill patients. Presentation of hematochezia may further increase the mortality and morbidity of COVID-19 patients, and prompt consultation and management by gastroenterology is therefore warranted.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Margaret Cho","author_inst":"NYU Lngone Health"},{"author_name":"Weiguo Liu","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Sophie Balzora","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Yvelisse Suarez","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Deepthi Hoskoppal","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Neil D Theise","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Wenqing Cao","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Suparna A Sarkar","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Martine Valette","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Bruno Lina","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Emilie Frobert","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Laurence Josset","author_inst":"Infectious Agents Institute"},{"author_name":"Luka Cicin-Sain","author_inst":"Department of Vaccinology and applied Microbiology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Studies"},{"author_name":"Rui Gong","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yakun Wan","author_inst":"Shanghai Novamab Biopharmaceuticals Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Chuan Qin","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Human Disease Comparative Medicine, Chinese Ministry of Health, Beijing Key Laboratory for Animal Models of Emerging and Remerging Infectious "},{"author_name":"Yuan-Sheng Hu","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd."},{"author_name":"Xiao-Yong Liu","author_inst":"Suining County Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Guo-Liang Cui","author_inst":"Sinovac Life Sciences Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Cong-Bing Jiang","author_inst":"Suining County Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Suining"},{"author_name":"Heng-Ming Zhang","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Ltd."},{"author_name":"Jing-Xin Li","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Min-Nan Yang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, National Laboratory of Macromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Juan Lian","author_inst":"Sinovac Life Sciences Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Yan Song","author_inst":"Suining County Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jin-Xing Lu","author_inst":"National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Changping"},{"author_name":"Xiang-Xi Wang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, National Laboratory of Macromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Miao Xu","author_inst":"National Institutes for Food and Drug Control"},{"author_name":"Qiang Gao","author_inst":"Sinovac Life Sciences Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Feng-Cai Zhu","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Fei Li","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Yanxin Liu","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Kaihua Zhang","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"David Bulkley","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Ming Sun","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Amber M Smith","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Alexandrea N.
