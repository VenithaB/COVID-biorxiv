The sequences of the surface protein of SARS-CoV-2 and its proximal sequences were obtained by BLAST, the sequences of the whole genome of SARS-CoV-2 were obtained from the GenBank. Based on the NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_045512.2, the conformational and linear B cell epitopes of the surface protein were predicted separately by various prediction methods. Furthermore, the conservation of the epitopes, the adaptability and other evolutionary characteristics were also analyzed. 7 epitopes were predicted, including 5 linear epitopes and 2 conformational epitopes, one of the linear and one of the conformational were coincide. The epitope D mutated easily, but the other epitopes were very conservative and the epitope C was the most conservative. It is worth mentioning that all of the 6 dominated epitopes were absolutely conservative in nearly 1000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, and they deserved further study. The findings would facilitate the vaccine development, had the potential to be directly applied on the treatment in this disease, but also have the potential to prevent the possible threats caused by other types of coronavirus.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jerome R Lon","author_inst":"South China University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Yunmeng Bai","author_inst":"South China University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Bingxu Zhong","author_inst":"South China University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Fuqiang Cai","author_inst":"South China University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Hongli Du","author_inst":"South China University of Technology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.03.024257","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV differ in their cell tropism and drug sensitivity profiles","rel_date":"2020-04-05","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.03.024257","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus currently causing a pandemic. We show that the majority of amino acid positions, which differ between SARS-CoV-2 and the closely related SARS-CoV, are differentially conserved suggesting differences in biological behaviour. In agreement, novel cell culture models revealed differences between the tropism of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Moreover, cellular ACE2 (SARS-CoV-2 receptor) and TMPRSS2 (enables virus entry via S protein cleavage) levels did not reliably indicate cell susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV further differed in their drug sensitivity profiles. Thus, only drug testing using SARS-CoV-2 reliably identifies therapy candidates. Therapeutic concentrations of the approved protease inhibitor aprotinin displayed anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. The efficacy of aprotinin and of remdesivir (currently under clinical investigation against SARS-CoV-2) were further enhanced by therapeutic concentrations of the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole (aprotinin 2.7-fold, remdesivir 10-fold). Hence, our study has also identified anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy candidates that can be readily tested in patients.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Denisa Bojkova","author_inst":"Goethe-University"},{"author_name":"Jake E McGreig","author_inst":"University of Kent"},{"author_name":"Katie-May McLaughlin","author_inst":"University of Kent"},{"author_name":"Stuart G Masterson","author_inst":"University of Kent"},{"author_name":"Marek Widera","author_inst":"Goethe-University"},{"author_name":"Verena Kraehling","author_inst":"University of Marburg"},{"author_name":"Sandra Ciesek","author_inst":"Goethe-University"},{"author_name":"Mark N Wass","author_inst":"University of Kent"},{"author_name":"Martin Michaelis","author_inst":"University of Kent"},{"author_name":"Jindrich N Cinatl Jr.","author_inst":"Klinikum der Goethe-Universitaet"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.02.022764","rel_title":"Potent Antiviral Activities of Type I Interferons to SARS-CoV-2 Infection","rel_date":"2020-04-05","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.02.022764","rel_abs":"The historical outbreak of COVID-19 disease not only constitutes a global public health crisis, but also has a devastating social and economic impact. The disease is caused by a newly identified coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). There is an urgent need to identify antivirals to curtail the COVID-19 pandemic. Herein, we report the remarkable sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 to recombinant human interferons  and {beta} (IFN\/{beta}). Treatment with IFN- or IFN-{beta} at a concentration of 50 international units (IU) per milliliter drastically reduce viral titers by 3.4 log or 4.5 log, respectively in Vero cells. The EC50 of IFN- and IFN-{beta} treatment is 1.35 IU\/ml and 0.76 IU\/ml, respectively, in Vero cells. These results suggested that SARS-CoV-2 is more sensitive to many other human pathogenic viruses, including the SARS-CoV. Overall, our results demonstrate the potent efficacy of human Type I IFN in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication, a finding which could inform future treatment options for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emily K.

The CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time Diagnostic Panel uses a real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) consisting of two TaqMan probe and primer sets specific for the 2019-nCoV N gene, which codes for the nucleocapsid structural protein that encapsulates viral RNA, for the qualitative detection of 2019-nCoV viral RNA in respiratory samples. To isolate RNA from respiratory samples, the CDC lists RNA extraction kits from three manufacturers. In anticipation of a limited supply chain of RNA extraction kits and the need for test scalability, we sought to identify alternative RNA extraction methods.

Knowledge of the interplay between molecular-scale virus-receptor interactions, single-cell viral replication, intracellular-scale viral transport, and emergent tissue-scale viral propagation is limited. Moreover, little is known about immune system-virus-tissue interactions and how these can result in low-level (asymptomatic) infections in some cases and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in others, particularly with respect to presentation in different age groups or pre-existing inflammatory risk factors like diabetes. Given the nonlinear interactions within and among each of these processes, multiscale simulation models can shed light on the emergent dynamics that lead to divergent outcomes, identify actionable \"choke points\" for pharmacologic interventions, screen potential therapies, and identify potential biomarkers that differentiate patient outcomes. Given the complexity of the problem and the acute need for an actionable model to guide therapy discovery and optimization, we introduce and iteratively refine a prototype of a multiscale model of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in lung tissue. The first prototype model was built and shared internationally as open source code and an online interactive model in under 12 hours, and community domain expertise is driving rapid refinements with a two-to-four week release cycle. In a sustained community effort, this consortium is integrating data and expertise across virology, immunology, mathematical biology, quantitative systems physiology, cloud and high performance computing, and other domains to accelerate our response to this critical threat to international health.","rel_num_authors":30,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael Getz","author_inst":"Indiana University"},{"author_name":"Yafei Wang","author_inst":"Indiana University"},{"author_name":"Gary An","author_inst":"University of Vermont Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Andrew Becker","author_inst":"University of Vermont Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Chase Cockrell","author_inst":"University of Vermont Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Nicholson Collier","author_inst":"Argonne National Laboratory, University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Morgan Craig","author_inst":"University of Montreal, CHU Sainte-Justine Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Courtney L.

Molecular assays are the preferred method to detect a broad range of pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity. The implementation of molecular assay testing in a rapidly evolving public health emergency can be hindered by resource availability or technical constraints. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the applicability of a pooled-sample testing protocol to screen large populations more rapidly and with limited resources is discussed. A Bayesian inference analysis in which hierarchical testing stages can have different sensitivities is implemented and benchmarked against early COVID-19 testing data. Optimal pool size and increases in throughput and case detection are calculated as a function of disease prevalence. Even for moderate losses in test sensitivity upon pooling, substantial increases in testing throughput and detection efficiency are predicted, suggesting that sample pooling is a viable avenue to circumvent current testing bottlenecks for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rodrigo Noriega","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Matthew Samore","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Gary An","author_inst":"University of Vermont Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Andrew Becker","author_inst":"University of Vermont Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Chase Cockrell","author_inst":"University of Vermont Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Nicholson Collier","author_inst":"Argonne National Laboratory, University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Morgan Craig","author_inst":"University of Montreal, CHU Sainte-Justine Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Courtney L.

The identification of clinically approved drugs to be repurposed to combat 2019 CoV disease (COVID-19) would allow the rapid implementation of potentially life-saving procedures. The major protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is considered a promising target, based on previous results from related CoVs with lopinavir (LPV), an HIV protease inhibitor. However, limited evidence exists for other clinically approved antiretroviral protease inhibitors, such as atazanavir (ATV). ATV is of high interest because of its bioavailability within the respiratory tract. Our results show that ATV could dock in the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, with greater strength than LPV. ATV blocked Mpro activity. We confirmed that ATV inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication, alone or in combination with ritonavir (RTV) in Vero cells, human pulmonary epithelial cell line and primary monocytes, impairing virus-induced enhancement of IL-6 and TNF- levels. Together, our data strongly suggest that ATV and ATV\/RTV should be considered among the candidate repurposed drugs undergoing clinical trials in the fight against COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Natalia Fintelman-Rodrigues","author_inst":"Fiocruz"},{"author_name":"Carolina Q Sacramento","author_inst":"Fiocruz"},{"author_name":"Carlyle Ribeiro Lima","author_inst":"Fiocruz"},{"author_name":"Franklin Souza da Silva","author_inst":"Fiocruz"},{"author_name":"Andre Ferreira","author_inst":"Fiocruz"},{"author_name":"Mayara Mattos","author_inst":"Fiocruz"},{"author_name":"Caroline S. de Freitas","author_inst":"Fiocruz"},{"author_name":"Vinicius Cardoso Soares","author_inst":"Fiocruz"},{"author_name":"Suelen da Silva Gomes Dias","author_inst":"Fiocruz"},{"author_name":"Jairo R.

We fortuitously found that C3A was more susceptible to human coronavirus HCoV-OC43 infection than HepG2, which was attributed to the increased efficiency of virus entry into C3A cells. In an effort to search for the host cellular protein(s) mediating the differential susceptibility of the two cell lines to HCoV-OC43 infection, we found that ADAP2, GILT and LY6E, three cellular proteins with known activity of interfering virus entry, expressed at significantly higher levels in HepG2 cells. Functional analyses revealed that ectopic expression of LY6E, but not GILT or ADAP2, in HEK 293 cells inhibited the entry of HCoV-OC43. While overexpression of LY6E in C3A and A549 cells efficiently inhibited the infection of HCoV-OC43, knockdown of LY6E expression in HepG2 significantly increased its susceptibility to HCoV-OC43 infection. Moreover, we found that LY6E also efficiently restricted the entry mediated by the envelope spike proteins of other human coronaviruses, including the currently pandemic SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, overexpression of serine protease TMPRSS2 or amphotericin treatment significantly neutralized the IFITM3 restriction of human coronavirus entry, but did not compromise the effect of LY6E on the entry of human coronaviruses. The work reported herein thus demonstrates that LY6E is a critical antiviral immune effector that controls CoV infection and pathogenesis via a distinct mechanism.\n\nImportanceVirus entry into host cells is one of the key determinants of host range and cell tropism and is subjected to the control by host innate and adaptive immune responses. In the last decade, several interferon inducible cellular proteins, including IFITMs, GILT, ADAP2, 25CH and LY6E, had been identified to modulate the infectious entry of a variety of viruses. Particularly, LY6E was recently identified as host factors to facilitate the entry of several human pathogenic viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus, influenza A virus and yellow fever virus. Identification of LY6E as a potent restriction factor of coronaviruses expands the biological function of LY6E and sheds new light on the immunopathogenesis of human coronavirus infection.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xuesen Zhao","author_inst":"Institute of Infectious disease, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100015, China."},{"author_name":"Shuangli Zheng","author_inst":"Institute of Infectious disease, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100015, China."},{"author_name":"Danying Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Infectious disease, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100015, China."},{"author_name":"Mei Zheng","author_inst":"Institute of Infectious disease, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100015, China"},{"author_name":"Xinglin Li","author_inst":"Institute of Infectious disease, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100015, China."},{"author_name":"Guoli Li","author_inst":"Institute of Infectious disease, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100015, China."},{"author_name":"Hanxin Lin","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Western University, 1151 Richmond Street, London, Ontario, Canada."},{"author_name":"Jinhong Chang","author_inst":"Baruch S.

The mechanisms of disruption include: decreasing expression of CTSL, direct inhibition of CTSL activity and affecting the conditions of CTSL environment (increase pH in lysosomes).\n\nWe have conducted a high throughput drug screen gene expression analysis to identify compounds that would downregulate the expression of CTSL\/CTSB. One of the top significant results shown to downregulate the expression of the CTSL gene is Amantadine. Amantadine was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1968 as a prophylactic agent for influenza and later for Parkinsons disease. It is available as a generic drug..\n\nAmantadine in addition to downregulating CTSL appears to further disrupt lysosomal pathway, hence interfering with the capacity of the virus to replicate. It acts as a lysosomotropic agent altering the CTSL functional environment. We hypothesize that Amantadine could decrease the viral load in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and as such it may serve as a potent therapeutic decreasing the replication and infectivity of the virus likely leading to better clinical outcomes. Clinical studies will be needed to examine the therapeutic utility of amantadine in COVID-19 infection.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sandra Smieszek","author_inst":"Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc."},{"author_name":"Bart Przychodzen","author_inst":"Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc."},{"author_name":"Mihael H Polymeropoulos","author_inst":"Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc."},{"author_name":"Douglas W.

Since SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences show similarity with those of SARS, we sought to analyze all the available SARS-CoV-2 genomes based on the insights obtained from SARS genome specifically focusing on non-coding RNAs. Here, results are presented from the dual approach i.e identifying host encoded miRNAs that might regulate viral pathogenesis as well as identifying viral encoded miRNAs that might regulate host cell signaling pathways and aid in viral pathogenesis. Analysis utilizing first approach resulted in the identification of 10 host encoded miRNAs that could target the genome of both the viruses (SARS-CoV-2 and SARS reference genome). Interestingly our analysis revealed that there is significantly higher number of host miRNAs that could target SARS-CoV-2 genome as compared to the SARS reference genome. Results from second approach involving SARS-CoV-2 and SARS reference genome identified a set of virus encoded miRNAs which might regulate host signaling pathways. Our analysis further identified a similar \"GA\" rich motif in SARS-CoV-2 genome that was shown to play a vital role in lung pathogenesis during severe SARS infections. Hence, we successfully identified human and virus encoded miRNAs that might regulate pathogenesis of both these coronaviruses and the fact that more number of host miRNAs could target SARS-CoV-2 genomes possibly reveal as to why this virus follows mild pathogenesis in healthy individuals. We identified non-coding sequences in SARS-CoV-2 genomes that were earlier reported to contribute towards SARS pathology. The study provides insights into the overlapping sequences among these viruses for their effective inhibition as well as identifying new drug targets that could be used for development of new antivirals.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Neha Periwal","author_inst":"Jamai Hamdard"},{"author_name":"Sankritya Sarma","author_inst":"Hansraj College, University of Delhi"},{"author_name":"Pooja Arora","author_inst":"Hansraj College, University of Delhi"},{"author_name":"Vikas Sood","author_inst":"Jamia Hamdard"},{"author_name":"Zichen Zhou","author_inst":"United Animal Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guoli Li","author_inst":"Institute of Infectious disease, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100015, China."},{"author_name":"Hanxin Lin","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Western University, 1151 Richmond Street, London, Ontario, Canada."},{"author_name":"Jinhong Chang","author_inst":"Baruch S.

We aimed to evaluate the correlation of ARBs\/ACEIs usage with the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in a retrospective, single-center study. 126 COVID-19 patients with preexisting hypertension at Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine (HPHTCM) in Wuhan from January 5 to February 22, 2020 were retrospectively allocated to ARBs\/ACEIs group (n=43) and non-ARBs\/ACEIs group (n=83) according to their antihypertensive medication. 125 age- and sex-matched COVID-19 patients without hypertension were randomly selected as non-hypertension controls. In addition, the medication history of 1942 hypertension patients that were admitted to HPHTCM from November 1 to December 31, 2019 before COVID-19 outbreak were also reviewed for external comparison. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected, analyzed and compared between these groups. The frequency of ARBs\/ACEIs usage in hypertension patients with or without COVID-19 were comparable. Among COVID-19 patients with hypertension, those received either ARBs\/ACEIs or non-ARBs\/ACEIs had comparable blood pressure. However, ARBs\/ACEIs group had significantly lower concentrations of CRP (p=0.049) and procalcitonin (PCT, p=0.008). Furthermore, much lower proportion of critical patients (9.3% vs 22.9%; p=0.061), and a lower death rate (4.7% vs 13.3%; p=0.216) were observed in ARBs\/ACEIs group than non-ARBs\/ACEIs group, although these differences failed to reach statistical significance. Our findings thus support the use of ARBs\/ACEIs in COVID-19 patients with preexisting hypertension.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guang Yang","author_inst":"Department of Geriatrics, Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Hubei Provincial Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine."},{"author_name":"Zihu Tan","author_inst":"Department of Geriatrics, Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Hubei Provincial Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ling Zhou","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Min Yang","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, School of Basic Medicine, Hubei University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lang Peng","author_inst":"Department of Geriatrics, Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Hubei Provincial Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jinjin Liu","author_inst":"Department of Geriatrics, Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Hubei Provincial Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jingling Cai","author_inst":"Department of Geriatrics, Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Hubei Provincial Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ru Yang","author_inst":"Wuhan Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Junyan Han","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yafei Huang","author_inst":"Department of Pathogen Biology, School of Basic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Shaobin He","author_inst":"Department of Geriatrics, Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Hubei Provincial Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Aline R.

Along with the anxiety scores, limited personal information such as age, gender, region, education, occupation and specifically, the type and duration of quarantine were collected for analysis. For a total number of 992 valid questionnaires, clinical significance of anxiety symptoms was observed in 9.58% respondents according to clinical diagnostic standards in China. Statistical results showed population with different age, education level, health status and personnel category responded differently. Other characteristics such as gender, marital status, region, and acquaintance with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 did not affect anxiety levels significantly. Respondents experienced different forms of quarantine showed different anxiety levels. Unexpectedly, longer durations of quarantine did not lead to significant increase of anxiety level.

However, infection with COVID-19 is currently rare in children. Objective To discuss the latest findings and research focus on the basis of characteristics of children confirmed with COVID-19, and provide an insight into the future treatment and research direction. Methods: We searched the terms \"COVID-19 OR coronavirus OR SARS-CoV-2\" AND \"Pediatric OR children\" on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library, NIH, CDC, and CNKI. The authors also reviewed the guidelines published on Chinese CDC and Chinese NHC. Results: We included 25 published literature references related to the epidemiology, clinical manifestation, accessary examination, treatment, and prognosis of pediatric patients with COVID-19. Conclusion: The numbers of children with COVID-19 pneumonia infection are small, and most of them come from family aggregation. Symptoms are mainly mild or even asymptomatic, which allow children to be a risk factor for transmission. Thus, strict epidemiological history screening is needed for early diagnosis and segregation. This holds especially for infants, who are more susceptible to infection than other age groups in pediatric age, but have most likely subtle and unspecific symptoms. They need to be paid more attention to. CT examination is a necessity for screening the suspected cases, because most of the pediatric patients are mild cases, and plain chest X-ray do not usually show the lesions or the detailed features. Therefore, early chest CT examination combined with pathogenic detection is a recommended clinical diagnosis scheme in children. The risk factors which may suggest severe or critical progress for children are: Fast respiratory rate and\/or; lethargy and drowsiness mental state and\/or; lactate progressively increasing and\/or; imaging showed bilateral or multi lobed infiltration, pleural effusion or rapidly expending of lesions in a short period of time and\/or; less than 3 months old or those who underly diseases. For those critical pediatric patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, polypnea may be the most common symptom. For treatment, the elevated PCT seen in children in contrast to adults suggests that the underlying coinfection\/secondary infection may be more common in pediatric patients and appropriate antibacterial treatment should be considered. Once cytokine storm is found in these patients, anti-autoimmune or blood-purifying therapy should be given in time. Furthermore, effective isolation measures and appropriate psychological comfort need to be provided timely.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiao Li","author_inst":"Childrens Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, China International Science and Tec"},{"author_name":"Kun Qian","author_inst":"The University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Ling-ling Xie","author_inst":"Childrens Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, China International Science and Tec"},{"author_name":"Xiu-juan Li","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, China International Science and Te"},{"author_name":"Min Cheng","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, China International Science and Te"},{"author_name":"Li Jiang","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, China International Science and Te"},{"author_name":"Bjoern W.

While most patients experience only mild symptoms, a relevant proportion develop severe disease progression with increasing hypoxia up to acute respiratory distress syndrome. The substantial number of patients with severe disease have strained intensive care capacities to an unprecedented level. Owing to the highly variable course and lack of reliable predictors for deterioration, we aimed to identify variables that allow the prediction of patients with a high risk of respiratory failure and need of mechanical ventilation Patients with PCR proven symptomatic COVID-19 infection hospitalized at our institution from 29th February to 27th March 2020 (n=40) were analyzed for baseline clinical and laboratory findings. Patients requiring mechanical ventilation 13\/40 (32.5%) did not differ in age, comorbidities, radiological findings, respiratory rate or qSofa score. However, elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) was strongly associated with the need for mechanical ventilation (p=1.2.10-5). In addition, the maximal IL-6 level (cutoff 80 pg\/ml) for each patient during disease predicted respiratory failure with high accuracy (p=1.7.10-8, AUC=0.98). The risk of respiratory failure for patients with IL-6 levels of [&ge;] 80 pg\/ml was 22 times higher compared to patients with lower IL-6 levels. In the current situation with overwhelmed intensive care units and overcrowded emergency rooms, correct triage of patients in need of intensive care is crucial. Our study shows that IL-6 is an effective marker that might be able to predict upcoming respiratory failure with high accuracy and help physicians correctly allocate patients at an early stage.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tobias Herold","author_inst":"University Hospital, LMU Munich"},{"author_name":"Vindi Jurinovic","author_inst":"Institute for Medical Information Processing, Biometry and Epidemiology, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Chiara Arnreich","author_inst":"Department of Medicine III, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Johannes C Hellmuth","author_inst":"Department of Medicine III, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Michael von Bergwelt-Baildon","author_inst":"Department of Medicine III, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Matthias Klein","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Tobias Weinberger","author_inst":"Department of Medicine I, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ru Yang","author_inst":"Wuhan Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Junyan Han","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yafei Huang","author_inst":"Department of Pathogen Biology, School of Basic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Shaobin He","author_inst":"Department of Geriatrics, Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Hubei Provincial Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Aline R.

A cost effective and efficient diagnostic tool as near to the point of care (PoC) as possible would be a game changer in current testing. We tested reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), a method which can produce results in under 30 minutes, alongside standard methods in a real-life clinical setting. Methods: This service improvement project piloted a research RT-LAMP method on nasal and pharyngeal swabs on 21 residents in an NHS Category 1 care home, with two index COVID-19 cases, and compared it to multiplex tandem reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of a single RT-LAMP swab compared to RT-PCR, as per STARD guidelines. We also recorded vital signs of patients to correlate clinical and laboratory information. Findings: The novel method accurately detected 8\/10 PCR positive cases and identified a further 3 positive cases. Eight further cases were negative using both methods. Using repeated RT-PCR as a 'gold standard', the sensitivity and specificity of the novel test were 80% and 73% respectively. Positive predictive value (PPV) was 73% and negative predictive value (NPV) was 83%. We also observed hypothermia to be a significant early clinical sign in a number of COVID-19 patients in this setting. Interpretation: RT-LAMP testing for SARS-CoV-2 was found to be promising, fast, easy to use and to work equivalently to RT-PCR methods. Definitive studies to evaluate this method in larger cohorts are underway. RT-LAMP has the potential to transform COVID-19 detection, bringing rapid and accurate testing to the point of care. This method could be deployed in mobile testing units in the community, care homes and hospitals to detect disease early and prevent spread.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marc F Osterdahl","author_inst":"Department of Ageing & Health, Guys and St Thomas NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Karla A Lee","author_inst":"Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, Kings College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Mary Ni Lochlainn","author_inst":"Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, Kings College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Stuart Wilson","author_inst":"MicrosensDx Ltd, 2 Royal College Street, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Sam Douthwaite","author_inst":"Department of Infection, Guys and St Thomas NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Rachel Horsfall","author_inst":"Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, Kings College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Alyce Sheedy","author_inst":"Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, Kings College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Simon D Goldenberg","author_inst":"Department of Infection, Guys and St Thomas NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Christoper J Stanley","author_inst":"MicrosensDx Ltd, 2 Royal College Street, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Tim D Spector","author_inst":"Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, Kings College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Claire Steves","author_inst":"Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, Kings College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Aline R.

Extensive molecular surveillance in Guangdong, China's most populous province, during early 2020 resulted in 1,388 reported RNA positive cases from 1.6 million tests. In order to understand the molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in China we generated 53 genomes from infected individuals in Guangdong using a combination of metagenomic sequencing and tiling amplicon approaches. Combined epidemiological and phylogenetic analyses indicate multiple independent introductions to Guangdong, although phylogenetic clustering is uncertain due to low virus genetic variation early in the pandemic. Our results illustrate how the timing, size and duration of putative local transmission chains were constrained by national travel restrictions and by the province's large-scale intensive surveillance and intervention measures. Despite these successes, COVID-19 surveillance in Guangdong is still required as the number of cases imported from other countries is increasing.","rel_num_authors":41,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jing Lu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institution of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and

Methods: From January 31 to March 14, 2020, 12 patients in recovery and one patient died of COVID-19 were included in this descriptive study. The clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, chest CT scans and outcome data were recorded. To examine whether there is sexual transmission from male, we employed realtime polymerase chain reaction testing (RT-PCR) to detect 2019-nCov in semen or testicular biopsy specimen. Findings: The age range of the 12 patients in recovery was 22-38 years. None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia. As of March 14, 2020, ten patients discharged from the hospital while the rest 2 had developed into recovery stage. All of the patients in recovery tested negative for 2019-nCoV RNA in semen samples. Another died patient was 67 years old, who died in March 10, 2020 and tissue sample via testicular biopsy was tested negative for viral RNA.

led a global pandemic cross the world. Most countries took two main interventions: suppression like immediate lockdown cities at epicentre or mitigation that slows down but not stopping epidemic for reducing peak healthcare demand. Both strategies have their apparent merits and limitations; it becomes extremely hard to conduct one intervention as the most feasible way to all countries. Targeting at this problem, this paper conducted a feasibility study by defining a mathematical model named SEMCR that can access effectiveness of mitigation, suppression and hybrid interventions for controlling COVID-19 outbreaks in London and Wuhan. It extended traditional SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed Infectious-Recovered) model by adding two key features: a direct connection between Exposed and Recovered populations, and separating infections into mild and critical cases. It defined parameters to classify two stages of COVID-19 control: active contain by isolation of cases and contacts, passive contain by suppression or mitigation. The model was fitted and evaluated with public dataset containing daily number of confirmed active cases including Wuhan and London during January, 2020 and March 2020. The simulated results showed that 1) Immediate suppression taken in Wuhan significantly reduced the total exposed and infectious populations to 119610, but it has to be consistently maintained at least 90 days (by the middle of April 2020). Its success heavily relied on sufficiently external support from other places of China. This mode were not suitable to other countries that have no sufficient health resources. 2) In London, it is possible to take a hybrid intervention of suppression and mitigation for every 2 or 3 weeks over a longer period to balance the total infections and economic loss. While the total infectious populations in this scenario would be possibly 2 times than the one taking suppression, economic loss and recovery of London would be less affected. 3) Both in Wuhan and London cases, one important issue of fitting practical data was that there were a large portion (probably 62.9% in Wuhan) of self-recovered populations that were asymptomatic or mild symptomatic. These people might think they have been healthy at home and did not go to hospital for COVID-19 tests. Early release of intervention intensity potentially increased a risk of the second outbreak. One limitation of our model was that our prediction of infections and deaths depended on a parameter estimation of intervention intensity that presented by average number contacts with susceptible individuals as infectious individuals in a certain region. It assumed that each intervention had equivalent effects on the reproduction number R in different regions over time. Practical effectiveness of implementing intervention intensity might be varied with respect to cultures or other issues of certain county.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Po

Recent studies have found that the pathogen of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, shares the same cell receptor Angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) with SARS-CoV. The pathological investigation of COVID-19 death showed that the lung had the characteristics of pulmonary fibrosis. However, how SARS-CoV-2 spreads from the lungs to other organs has not yet been determined. Here, we performed an unbiased evaluation of cell-type specific expression of ACE2 in healthy and fibrotic lungs, as well as in normal and failed adult human hearts, using published single-cell RNA-seq data. We found that ACE2 expression in fibrotic lungs mainly locates in arterial vascular cells, which might provide the route for bloodstream spreading of SARS-CoV-2. The failed human hearts have a higher percentage of ACE2-expressing cardiomyocytes, and SARS-CoV-2 might attack cardiomyocytes through the bloodstream in patients with heart failure. Moreover, ACE2 was highly expressed in cells infected by RSV or MERS-CoV and in mice treated by LPS. Our findings indicate that patients with pulmonary fibrosis, heart failure, and virus infection have a higher risk and are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 might attack other organs by getting into the bloodstream. This work provides new insights into SARS-CoV-2 blood entry and heart injury and might propose a therapeutic strategy to prevent patients from developing severe complications.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jieyu Guo","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xiangxiang Wei","author_inst":"School

declared the COVID-19 outbreak, originally started in China, a global pandemic. Since then, the outbreak has indeed spread across all continents, threatening the public health of numerous countries. Although the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of COVID-19 is relatively low when optimal level of healthcare is granted to the patients, the high percentage of severe cases developing severe pneumonia and thus requiring respiratory support is worryingly high, and could lead to a rapid saturation of Intensive Care Units (ICUs). To overcome this risk, most countries enacted COVID-19 containment measures. In this study, we use a Bayesian SEIR epidemiological model to perform a parametric regression over the COVID-19 outbreaks data in China, Italy, Belgium, and Spain, and estimate the effect of the containment measures on the basic reproduction ratio R_0. We find that the effect of these measures is detectable, but tends to be gradual, and that a progressive strengthening of these measures usually reduces the R_0 below 1, granting a decay of the outbreak. We also discuss the biases and inconsistencies present in the publicly available data on COVID-19 cases, providing an estimate for the actual number of cases in Italy on March 12, 2020. Lastly, despite the data and model's limitations, we argue that the idea of \"flattening the curve\" to reach herd immunity is likely to be unfeasible.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Edward De Brouwer","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Daniele Raimondi","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Yves

respiratory complications and death. Patients with a compromised immune system are expected to be more susceptible to a severe disease course. In this report we suggest that patients with systemic lupus erythematous might be especially prone to severe COVID-19 independent of their immunosuppressed state from lupus treatment. Specially, we provide evidence in lupus to suggest hypomethylation and overexpression of ACE2, which is located on the X chromosome and encodes a functional receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. Oxidative stress induced by viral infections exacerbates the DNA methylation defect in lupus, possibly resulting in further ACE2 hypomethylation and enhanced viremia. In addition, demethylation of interferon-regulated genes, NF{kappa}B, and key cytokine genes in lupus patients might exacerbate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and increase the likelihood of cytokine storm. These arguments suggest that inherent epigenetic dysregulation in lupus might facilitate viral entry, viremia, and an excessive immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Further, maintaining disease remission in lupus patients is critical to prevent a vicious cycle of demethylation and increased oxidative stress, which will exacerbate susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection during the current pandemic. Epigenetic control of the ACE2 gene might be a target for prevention and therapy in COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amr H Sawalha","author_inst":"University of

current emergence of the novel coronavirus pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 demands the development of new therapeutic strategies to prevent rapid progress of mortalities. The coronavirus spike (S) protein, which facilitates viral attachment, entry and membrane fusion is heavily glycosylated and plays a critical role in the elicitation of the host immune response. The spike protein is comprised of two protein subunits (S1 and S2), which together possess 22 potential N-glycosylation sites. Herein, we report the glycosylation mapping on spike protein subunits S1 and S2 expressed on human cells through high resolution mass spectrometry. We have characterized the quantitative N-glycosylation profile on spike protein and interestingly, observed unexpected O-glycosylation modifications on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein subunit S1. Even though O-glycosylation has been predicted on the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, this is the first report of experimental data for both the site of O-glycosylation and identity of the O-glycans attached on the subunit S1. Our data on the N- and O-glycosylation is strengthened by extensive manual interpretation of each glycopeptide spectra in addition to using bioinformatics tools to confirm the complexity of glycosylation in the spike protein. The elucidation of the glycan repertoire on the spike protein provides insights into the viral binding studies and more importantly, propels research towards the development of a suitable vaccine candidate.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Asif Shajahan","author_inst":"University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Nitin T Supekar","author_inst":"University of

The effective counter measures against SARS-CoV-2 infection require the design and development of specific and effective vaccine candidate. In the present study, we have screened and shortlisted 38 CTL, 33 HTL and 12 B cell epitopes from the eleven Protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 by utilizing different in silico tools. The screened epitopes were further validated for their binding with their respective HLA allele binders and TAP (Transporter associated with antigen processing) molecule by molecular docking. The shortlisted screened epitopes were further utilized to design novel two multi-epitope vaccines (MEVs) composed of CTL, HTL and B cell epitopes overlaps with potential to elicit humoral as well as cellular immune response against SARS-CoV-2. To enhance the immune response for our vaccine design, truncated (residues 10-153) Onchocerca volvulus activation-associated secreted protein-1 (Ov-ASP-1) has been utilized as an adjuvant at N terminal of both the MEVs. Further molecular models for both the MEVs were prepared and validated for their stable molecular interactions with Toll-Like Receptor 3 (TLR 3). The codon-optimized cDNA of both the MEVs were further analyzed for their potential of high level of expression in a human cell line. The present study is very significant in terms of molecular designing of prospective CTL and HTL vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection with the potential to elicit cellular as well as humoral immune response.

respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ failure that are largely attributed to the cytokine storm. The surface coronavirus spike (S) glycoprotein is considered as a key factor in host specificity because it mediates infection by receptor-recognition and membrane fusion. Here, the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 S protein revealed two B56-binding LxxIxE-like motifs in S1 and S2 subunits that could recruit the host protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). The motif in S1 subunit is absent in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Phosphatases and kinases are major players in the regulation of pro-inflammatory responses during pathogenic infections. Moreover, studies have shown that viruses target PP2A in order to manipulate hosts antiviral responses. Recent researches have indicated that SARS-CoV-2 is involved in sustained host inflammation. Therefore, by controlling acute inflammation, it is possible to eliminate its dangerous effects on the host. Among efforts to fight COVID-19, the interaction between LxxIxE-like motif and the PP2A-B56-binding pocket could be a target for the discovery and\/or development of a bioactive ligand inhibitor for therapeutic purposes. Indeed, a small molecule called Artepillin C (ArtC), a main compound in Brazilian honeybee green propolis, mimics the side chains of LxxLxE motif. Importantly, ArtC is known, among other effects, to have anti-inflammatory activity that makes it an excellent candidate for future clinical trials in COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Halim Maaroufi","author_inst":"Institut de Biologie Int\u00e9grative et des Syst\u00e8mes (IBIS) Universit\u00e9 Laval, Quebec,

novel Coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) has now become a global pandemic. Considering the severity of infection and the associated mortalities, there is an urgent need to develop an effective preventive measure against this virus. In this study, we have designed a novel vaccine construct using computational strategies. Spike (S) glycoprotein is the major antigenic component that trigger the host immune responses. Detailed investigation of S protein with various immunoinformatics tools enabled us to identify 5 MHC I and 5 MHC II B-cell derived T-cell epitopes with VaxiJen score > 1 and IC50 value < 100nM. These epitopes were joined with a suitable adjuvant and appropriate linkers to form a multi-epitope based vaccine construct. Further, in silico testing of the vaccine construct for its antigenicity, allergenicity, solubility, and other physicochemical properties showed it to be safe and immunogenic. Suitable tertiary structure of the vaccine protein was generated using 3Dpro of SCRATCH suite, refined with GalaxyRefine, and validated with ProSA, PROCHECK, and ERRAT server. Finally, molecular docking studies were performed to ensure a favorable binding affinity between the vaccine construct and TLR3 receptor. The designed multi-epitope vaccine showed potential to elicit specific immune responses against the SARS-COV-2. However, further wet lab validation is necessary to confirm the actual effectiveness, safety and immunogenic potency of the vaccine construct against derived in this study.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ratnadeep Saha","author_inst":"Central Institute of Fisheries Education"},{"author_name":"Burra VLS Prasad","author_inst":"Koneru Lakshmaiah

pandemic, with the potential to infect nearly 60% of the population. The anticipated spread of the virus requires an urgent appraisal of the capacity of US healthcare services and the identification of states most vulnerable to exceeding their capacity Methods: In the American Hospital Association survey for 2018, a database of US community hospitals, we identified total inpatient beds, adult intensive care unit (ICU) beds, and airborne isolation rooms across all hospitals in each state of continental US. The burden of COVID-19 hospitalizations was estimated based on a median hospitalization duration of 12 days and was evaluated for a 30-day reporting period. Results: At 5155 US community hospitals across 48 states in the contiguous US and Washington DC, there were a total of 788,032 inpatient beds, 68,280 adult ICU beds, and 44,222 isolation rooms. The median daily bed occupancy was 62.8% (IQR 58.1%, 66.6%) across states. Nationally, for every 10,000 individuals, there are 24.2 inpatient beds, 2.8 adult ICU beds, and 1.4 isolation beds. There is a 3-fold variation in the number of inpatient beds available across the US, ranging from 16.4 per 10,000 in Oregon to 47 per 10,000 in South Dakota. There was also a similar 3-fold variation in available or non-occupied beds, ranging from 4.7 per 10,000 in Connecticut through 18.3 per 10,000 in North Dakota. The availability of ICU beds is low nationally, ranging from 1.4 per 10,000 in Nevada to 4.7 per 10000 in Washington DC. Hospitalizations for COVID-19 in a median 0.2% (IQR 0.2 %, 0.3%) of state population, or 1.4% of state's older adults (1.0%, 1.9%) will require all non-occupied beds. Further, a median 0.6% (0.5%, 0.8%) of state population, or 3.9% (3.1%, 4.6%) of older individuals would require 100% of inpatient beds. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to overwhelm the limited number of inpatient and ICU beds for the US population. Hospitals in half of US states would exceed capacity if less than 0.2% of the state population requires hospitalization in any given month.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rohan Khera","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Snigdha Jain","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Zhenqiu Lin","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Joseph S.

Despite the epidemiological importance, clinical patterns of children with COVID-19 remain unclear. Objective: To describe the clinical, laboratorial and radiological characteristics of children with COVID-19. Data Sources: The Medline database was searched between December 1st 2019 and March 30th 2020. Study Selection: Inclusion criteria were: (1) studied patients younger than 18 years old; (2) presented original data from cases of COVID-19 confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction; and (3) contained descriptions of clinical manifestations, laboratory tests or radiological examinations. Data Extraction: Number of cases, gender, age, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, radiological examinations and outcomes. Results: A total of 34 studies (1,118 cases) were included. From all the cases, 1,111 had their severity classified: 14.3% were asymptomatic, 36.4% were mild, 46.0% were moderate, 2.2% were severe and 1.2% were critical. The most prevalent symptom was fever (16.3%), followed by cough (14.4%), nasal symptoms (3.6%), diarrhea (2.7%) and nausea\/vomiting (2.5%). One hundred forty-five (12.9%) children were diagnosed with pneumonia and 43 (3.8%) upper airway infections were reported. Reduced lymphocyte count were reported in 13.1% of cases. Abnormalities on computed tomography was reported in 62.7% of cases. The most prevalent abnormalities reported were ground glass opacities, patchy shadows and consolidations. Only one death was reported. Conclusions: Clinical manifestations of children with COVID-19 differ widely from adults cases. Fever and respiratory symptoms should not be considered a hallmark of COVID-19 in children.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tiago Henrique de Souza","author_inst":"State University
