Control measures, based on isolation and quarantine, have been shown to decrease and delay the burden of the ongoing epidemic. With respect to the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, recent modelling work shows that this intervention technique may be inadequate to control local outbreaks, even when perfect isolation is assumed. Furthermore, the effect of infectiousness prior to symptom onset combined with a significant proportion of asymptomatic infectees further complicates the use of contact tracing. Antivirals, which decrease the viral load and reduce the infectiousness, could be integrated in the control measures in order to augment the feasibility of controlling the epidemic. Methods: Using a simulation-based model of viral transmission we tested the efficacy of different intervention measures for the control of COVID-19. For individuals that were identified through contact tracing, we evaluate two procedures: monitoring individuals for symptoms onset and testing of individuals. Moreover, we investigate the effect of a potent antiviral compound on the contact tracing process. Findings: The use of an antiviral drug, in combination with contact tracing, quarantine and isolation, results in a significant decrease of the final size, the peak incidence, and increases the probability that the outbreak will fade out. Interpretation: For an infectious disease in which presymptomatic infections are plausible, an intervention measure based on contact tracing performs better when realized together with testing instead of monitoring, provided that the test is able to detect infections during the incubation period. In addition, in all tested scenarios, the model highlights the benefits of the administration of an antiviral drug in addition to quarantine, isolation and contact tracing. The resulting control measure, could be an effective strategy to control local and re-emerging outbreaks of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrea Torneri","author_inst":"Centre for Health Economic Research and Modelling Infectious Diseases, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Pieter Jules Karel Libin","author_inst":"Artificial intelligence lab, Department of computer science, Vrije Universiteit Brussel"},{"author_name":"Joris Vanderlocht","author_inst":"Interuniversity Institute of Biostatistics and statistical Bioinformatics, Data Science Institute,Hasselt University, Hasselt, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Anne-Mieke Vandamme","author_inst":"KU Leuven - University of Leuven, Department of Microbiology and ImmunologyRega Institute for Medical Research, Clinical and epidemiological virology, Leuven, B"},{"author_name":"Johan Neyts","author_inst":"KU Leuven - University of Leuven, Department of Microbiology and ImmunologyRega Institute for Medical Research, Clinical and epidemiological virology, Leuven, B"},{"author_name":"Niel Hens","author_inst":"Hasselt University and University of Antwerp"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.18.20038513","rel_title":"Dynamic profile of severe or critical COVID-19 cases","rel_date":"2020-03-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.18.20038513","rel_abs":"In December 2019, a cluster of acute respiratory illness, now known as SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, occurred in Wuhan, China.

We developed and validated a diagnosis aid model without CT images for early identification of suspected COVID-19 pneumonia (S-COVID-19-P) on admission in adult fever patients and made the validated model available via an online triage calculator. Patients admitted from Jan 14 to Feb 26, 2020 with the epidemiological history of exposure to COVID-19 were included [Model development (n = 132) and validation (n = 32)]. Candidate features included clinical symptoms, routine laboratory tests and other clinical information on admission. Features selection and model development were based on Lasso regression. The primary outcome is the development and validation of a diagnosis aid model for S-COVID-19-P early identification on admission. The development cohort contains 26 S-COVID-19-P and 7 confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia cases. The model performance in held-out testing set and validation cohort resulted in AUCs of 0.841 and 0.938, F-1 score of 0.571 and 0.667, recall of 1.000 and 1.000, specificity of 0.727 and 0.778, and the precision of 0.400 and 0.500. Based on this model, an optimized strategy for S-COVID-19-P early identification in fever clinics has also been designed. S-COVID-19-P could be identified early by a machine-learning model only used collected clinical information without CT images on admission in fever clinics with 100% recall score.

As transmission intensifies in other countries, the interplay between age, contact patterns, social distancing, susceptibility to infection and disease, and COVID-19 dynamics remains unclear. To answer these questions, we analyze contact surveys data for Wuhan and Shanghai before and during the outbreak and contact tracing information from Hunan Province. Daily contacts were reduced 7-9 fold during the COVID-19 social distancing period, with most interactions restricted to the household. Children 0-14 years were 59% (95% CI 7-82%) less susceptible than individuals 65 years and over. A transmission model calibrated against these data indicates that social distancing alone, as implemented in China during the outbreak, is sufficient to control COVID-19. While proactive school closures cannot interrupt transmission on their own, they reduce peak incidence by half and delay the epidemic. These findings can help guide global intervention policies.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Juanjuan Zhang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Maria Litvinova","author_inst":"ISI Foundation"},{"author_name":"Yuxia Liang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yan Wang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Shanlu Zhao","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Qianhui Wu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Stefano Merler","author_inst":"Bruno Kessler Foundation"},{"author_name":"Cecile Viboud","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Vespignani","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"Bruno Kessler Foundation"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Wenzheng Sun","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Liping Zhang","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Qingru Han","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Juan Zhang","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Fei Pan","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Li Chen","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Zhihong Zhu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Hongju Xiao","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Yu Liu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Gang Liu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Tanshi Li","author_inst":"PLAGH"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.17.20037663","rel_title":"Simple Mathematics on Covid-19 Expansion","rel_date":"2020-03-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.17.20037663","rel_abs":"We review the Kermack and McKendrick model of epidemics and apply it to Covid-19.

Moreover, as of the 13th of March 2020, the WHO has announced that the European continent is now the main centre of the pandemic. Many European governments have already implemented harsh measures to attempt to contain the spread of the virus. In Portugal, there are, as of the 20th of March 2020, 1020 confirmed cases. One of the questions many policy makers, and governments are asking themselves is how the spread is going to evolve in time. A timely idea of the amount of cases that will exist in a near future can allow governments and policy makers to act accordingly. In this study, I applied an adapted SIR model previously used in South Korea to model the MERS outbreak, which is also caused by a coronavirus, to estimate the evolution of the curve of active cases in the case of the Portuguese situation. As some of the parameters were unknown, and the data for Portugal is still scarce, given that the outbreak started later (first case on the 2nd of March) I used Italian data (first reported case in Italy on the 31st of January) to predict them. I then construct two or three different scenarios for the evolution of covid-19 in Portugal, considering both the effectiveness of the mitigation measurements implemented by the government, and the self-protective measures taken by the population, as explained in the South Korean model. In the out of control scenario, the number of active cases could reach as much as ~40,000 people by the beginning of April. If measures are appropriately taken this number can be reduced to about 800 cases. In case that some measures are taken, but their implementation is not done appropriately, the active cases could reach circa 7,000 people. The actual figures probably lie between the interval (~800-7,000) and the peak will be reached between 9th and the 20nd of April 2020. Without control and self-protective measures, this model predicts that the figures of active cases of SARS-covid-2 would reach a staggering ~40,000 people It shows the importance of control and self-protecting measure to bring down the number of affected people by following the recommendations of the WHO and health authorities. With the appropriate measures, this number can be brought down to ~800-7,000 people. Hopefully that will be the case not just in Portugal, but in the rest of the World.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pedro Teles","author_inst":"Faculdade de Ciencias da Universidade do Porto"},{"author_name":"Maria Litvinova","author_inst":"ISI Foundation"},{"author_name":"Yuxia Liang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yan Wang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Shanlu Zhao","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Qianhui Wu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Stefano Merler","author_inst":"Bruno Kessler Foundation"},{"author_name":"Cecile Viboud","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Vespignani","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"Bruno Kessler Foundation"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Wenzheng Sun","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Liping Zhang","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Qingru Han","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Juan Zhang","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Fei Pan","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Li Chen","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Zhihong Zhu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Hongju Xiao","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Yu Liu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Gang Liu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Tanshi Li","author_inst":"PLAGH"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.18.20038570","rel_title":"Extended SIR prediction of the epidemics trend of COVID-19 in Italy and compared with Hunan, China","rel_date":"2020-03-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.18.20038570","rel_abs":"Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID19) is currently a global public health threat. Outside of China, Italy is one of the most suffering countries with the COVID19 epidemic. It is important to predict the epidemics trend of COVID19 epidemic in Italy to help develop public health strategies. Methods: We used time series data of COVID 19 from Jan 22,2020 to Mar 16,2020. An infectious disease dynamic extended susceptible infected removed (eSIR) model, which covers the effects of different intervention measures in dissimilar periods, was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Italy. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credible interval (CI). Hunan, with similar total number of populations in Italy, was used as a comparative item. Results: In the eSIR model, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for COVID 19 was respectively 4.10 (95% CI: 2.15 to 6.77) in Italy and 3.15(95% CI: 1.71 to 5.21) in Hunan. There would be totally 30 086 infected cases (95%CI:7920-81 869) under the current country blockade and the endpoint would be Apr 25 (95%CI: Mar 30 to Aug 07) in Italy. If the country blockade is imposed 5 day later, the total number of infected cases would expand the infection scale 1.50 times. Conclusion: Italy's current strict measures can efficaciously prevent the further spread of COVID19 and should be maintained. Necessary strict public health measures be implemented as soon as possible in other European countries with a high number of COVID19 cases. The most effective strategy needs to be confirmed in further studies.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wangping Jia","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ke Han","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yang Song","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wenzhe Cao","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shengshu Wang","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shanshan Yang","author_inst":"Shanshan Yang"},{"author_name":"Jianwei Wang","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fuyin Kou","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Penggang Tai","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Miao Liu","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yao He","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wenzheng Sun","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Liping Zhang","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Qingru Han","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Juan Zhang","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Fei Pan","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Li Chen","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Zhihong Zhu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Hongju Xiao","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Yu Liu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Gang Liu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Tanshi Li","author_inst":"PLAGH"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.18.20038224","rel_title":"Assessing the Global Tendency of COVID-19 Outbreak","rel_date":"2020-03-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.18.20038224","rel_abs":"COVID-19 is now widely spreading around the world as a global pandemic.

These models and inferred results are then the basic tools used for public health planning: how many people expected to be infected, at what scales of time and space, and whether potential intervention strategies impact disease transmission and spread. An underlying assumption, however, is that the ability to observe new cases is either constant, or at least constant relative to diagnostic test availability. We present a demonstration, discussion, and mathematical analysis of how this assumption of predictable observability in disease incidence can drastically impact model accuracy. We also demonstrate how to tailor estimations of these parameters to a few examples of different types of shifting influences acting on detection, depending on the likely sensitivity of surveillance systems to errors from sources such as clinical testing rates and differences in healthcare-seeking behavior from the public over time.

Aim To examine preparedness for, and impact of, the COVID-19 pandemic on hospices in Italy to inform the response in other countries. Design Cross-sectional telephone survey, carried out in March 2020. Setting Sixteen Italian hospices, purposively sampled according to COVID-19 risk into high (more than 25 COVID-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants), medium (15-25 cases per 100,000), and low risk (fewer than 15 cases per 100,000) regions. A brief questionnaire was developed to guide the interviews. Descriptive analysis was undertaken. Results Seven high risk, five medium risk and four low risk hospices provided data. Two high risk hospices had experienced COVID-19 cases among both patients and staff. All hospices had implemented policy changes, and several had rapidly implemented changes in practice including transfer of staff from inpatient to community settings, change in admission criteria, and daily telephone support for families. Concerns included scarcity of personal protective equipment, a lack of hospice-specific guidance on COVID-19, anxiety about needing to care for children and other relatives, and poor integration of palliative care in the acute setting. Conclusion The hospice sector is capable of responding flexibly and rapidly to the COVID-19 pandemic. Governments must urgently recognise the essential contribution of hospice and palliative care to the COVID-19 pandemic, and ensure these services are integrated into the health care system response. Availability of personal protective equipment and setting-specific guidance is essential.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Massimo Costantini","author_inst":"Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia"},{"author_name":"Katherine E Sleeman","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Carlo Peruselli","author_inst":"SICP-Italian Society of Palliative Care"},{"author_name":"Irene J Higginson","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"David Weber","author_inst":"University of North Carolina, Gillings School of Global Public Health"},{"author_name":"Abdul-Aziz Yakubu","author_inst":"Howard University"},{"author_name":"Liuling Zhou","author_inst":"Southeast University, China"},{"author_name":"Yuanbo Tang","author_inst":"Southeast University, School of Information Science and Engineering"},{"author_name":"Xiang Zhang","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Junyan Yang","author_inst":"Southeast University, China"},{"author_name":"Qiao Wang","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Yao He","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wenzheng Sun","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Liping Zhang","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Qingru Han","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Juan Zhang","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Fei Pan","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Li Chen","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Zhihong Zhu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Hongju Xiao","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Yu Liu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Gang Liu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Tanshi Li","author_inst":"PLAGH"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"palliative medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.17.20037515","rel_title":"A Tool to Early Predict Severe 2019-Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (COVID-19) : A Multicenter Study using the Risk Nomogram in Wuhan and Guangdong, China","rel_date":"2020-03-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.17.20037515","rel_abs":"Background Severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rapidly develop acute respiratory distress leading to respiratory failure, with high short-term mortality rates. At present, there is no reliable risk stratification tool for non-severe COVID-19 patients at admission. We aimed to construct an effective model for early identifying cases at high risk of progression to severe COVID-19. Methods SARS-CoV-2 infected patients from one center in Wuhan city and two centers in Guangzhou city, China were included retrospectively. All patients with non-severe COVID-19 during hospitalization were followed for more than 15 days after admission. Patients who deteriorated to severe or critical COVID-19 and patients who kept non-severe state were assigned to the severe and non-severe group, respectively. We compared the demographic, clinical, and laboratory data between severe and non-severe group. Based on baseline data, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm and logistic regression model were used to construct a nomogram for risk prediction in the train cohort. The predictive accuracy and discriminative ability of nomogram were evaluated by area under the curve (AUC) and calibration curve. Decision curve analysis (DCA) and clinical impact curve analysis (CICA) were conducted to evaluate the clinical applicability of our nomogram. Findings The train cohort consisted of 189 patients, while the two independent validation cohorts consisted of 165 and 18 patients. Among all cases, 72 (19.35%) patients developed severe COVID-19 and 107 (28.76%) patients had one of the following basic disease, including hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, chronic respiratory disease, tuberculosis disease. We found one demographic and six serological indicators (age, serum lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, the coefficient of variation of red blood cell distribution width (RDW), blood urea nitrogen, albumin, direct bilirubin) are associated with severe COVID-19. Based on these features, we generated the nomogram, which has remarkably high diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing individuals who exacerbated to severe COVID-19 from non-severe COVID-19 (AUC 0.912 [95% CI 0.846-0.978]) in the train cohort with a sensitivity of 85.71 % and specificity of 87.58% ; 0.853 [0.790-0.916] in validation cohort with a sensitivity of 77.5 % and specificity of 78.4%. The calibration curve for probability of severe COVID-19 showed optimal agreement between prediction by nomogram and actual observation. DCA and CICA further indicated that our nomogram conferred significantly high clinical net benefit. Interpretation Our nomogram could help clinicians to early identify patients who will exacerbate to severe COVID-19. And this risk stratification tool will enable better centralized management and early treatment of severe patients, and optimal use of medical resources via patient prioritization and thus significantly reduce mortality rates. The RDW plays an important role in predicting severe COVID-19, implying that the role of RBC in severe disease is underestimated.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jiao Gong","author_inst":"Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jingyi Ou","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xueping Qiu","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yusheng Jie","author_inst":"Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yaqiong Chen","author_inst":"Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Lianxiong Yuan","author_inst":"Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jing Cao","author_inst":"Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Mingkai Tan","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wenxiong Xu","author_inst":"Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Fang Zheng","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yaling Shi","author_inst":"Clinical Laboratory of Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bo Hu","author_inst":"Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Wenzheng Sun","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Liping Zhang","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Qingru Han","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Juan Zhang","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Fei Pan","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Li Chen","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Zhihong Zhu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Hongju Xiao","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Yu Liu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Gang Liu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Tanshi Li","author_inst":"PLAGH"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.18.20038638","rel_title":"Spatial Visualization of Cluster-Specific COVID-19 Transmission Network in South Korea During the Early Epidemic Phase","rel_date":"2020-03-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.18.20038638","rel_abs":"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been rapidly spreading throughout China and other countries including South Korea. As of March 12, 2020, a total number of 7,869 cases and 66 deaths had been documented in South Korea. Although the first confirmed case in South Korea was identified on January 20, 2020, the number of confirmed cases showed a rapid growth on February 19, 2020 with a total number of 1,261 cases with 12 deaths based on the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).

Methods: We combine data from four countries to produce pooled age-banded Case Fatality Rates (CFRs), calculate the sex-difference in survival and use data from four recent studies to convert CFRs into age-sex stratified Infection Fatality Rates (IFRs). We estimate the additional risk of death in cancer patients, and in those receiving chemotherapy. We illustrate the impact of these by considering the impact on a national incident cancer cohort and present some clinical scenarios. Results: We obtained data based on 412,985 cases and 41,854 deaths. The pooled estimate for IFR was 0.92%. Age-related IFRs for patients with cancer range from 0.01% to 29%, and higher in patients receiving chemotherapy. The risk is significantly higher in men than women. 40% of all male and 32% of all female patients with a new diagnosis of cancer this year have an IFR of >= 5\\%. Conclusions: Older male patients are at a higher risk of death with COVID infection. Patients with cancer are also at higher risk, as are those who have recently received chemotherapy. We provide well-founded estimates to allow patients and clinicians to better balance these risks, and illustrate the wider impact in a national incident cohort.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matt Williams","author_inst":"Computational Oncology Group, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ella Mi","author_inst":"Department of Radiotherapy, Imperial College Healthcare Trust"},{"author_name":"Kerlann Le Calvez","author_inst":"Computational Oncology Group, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jiarong Chen","author_inst":"Computational Oncology Group, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Lillie Pakzad-Shahabi","author_inst":"John Fulcher Neuro-oncology Lab, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Seema Dadhania","author_inst":"Computational Oncology Group, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"James Wang","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Andrew LK Ho","author_inst":"Addenbrooke Hospital Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Simon Rabinowicz","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Fang Zheng","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yaling Shi","author_inst":"Clinical Laboratory of Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bo Hu","author_inst":"Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Wenzheng Sun","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Liping Zhang","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Qingru Han","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Juan Zhang","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Fei Pan","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Li Chen","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Zhihong Zhu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Hongju Xiao","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Yu Liu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Gang Liu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Tanshi Li","author_inst":"PLAGH"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"oncology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.18.20038026","rel_title":"Chinese Public Attention to COVID-19 Epidemic: Based on Social Media","rel_date":"2020-03-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.18.20038026","rel_abs":"Background: Since the new coronavirus epidemic in China in December 2019, information and discussions about COVID-19 have spread rapidly on the Internet and have quickly become the focus of worldwide attention, especially on social media. Objective: This study aims to investigate and analyze the public's attention to COVID-19-related events in China at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic in China (December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020) through the Sina Microblog hot search list. Methods: We collected topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic on the Sina Microblog hot search list from December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020 and described the trend of public attention on COVID-19 epidemic-related topics. ROST CM6.0 (ROST Content Mining System Version 6.0) was used to analyze the collected text for word segmentation, word frequency, and sentiment analysis. We further described the hot topic keywords and sentiment trends of public attention. We used VOSviewer to implement a visual cluster analysis of hot keywords and build a social network of public opinion content. Results: The study has four main findings. First, we analyzed the changing trend of the public's attention to the COVID-19 epidemic, which can be divided into three stages. Second, the hot topic keywords of public attention at each stage are slightly different. In addition, the emotional tendency of the public toward the COVID-19 epidemic-related hot topics has changed from negative to neutral, with negative emotions weakening and positive emotions increasing as a whole. Finally, we divided the COVID-19 topics with the most public concern into five categories: (1) new COVID-19 epidemics and their impact; (2) frontline reporting of the epidemic and prevention and control measures; (3) expert interpretation and discussion on the source of infection; (4) medical services on the frontline of the epidemic; and (5) focus on the global epidemic and the search for suspected cases. Conclusions: This is the first study of public attention on the COVID-19 epidemic using a Chinese social media platform (i.e., Sina Microblog). Our study found that social media (e.g., Sina Microblog) can be used to measure public attention to public health emergencies. During the epidemic of the novel coronavirus, a large amount of information about the COVID-19 epidemic was disseminated on Sina Microblog and received widespread public attention. We have learned about the hotspots of public concern regarding the COVID-19 epidemic. These findings can help the government and health departments better communicate with the public on health and translate public health needs into practice to create targeted measures to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19.

Rapid and precise diagnostic methods are thus immediately needed for diagnosing COVID-19, providing timely treatment and facilitating infection control. A one-step reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) coupled with nanoparticles-based biosensor (NBS) assay (RT-LAMP-NBS) was successfully established for rapidly and accurately diagnosing COVID-19. A simple equipment (such as heating block) was required for maintaining a constant temperature (63 C) for only 40 min. Using two designed LAMP primer sets, F1ab (opening reading frame 1a\/b) and np (nucleoprotein) genes of SARS-CoV-2 were simultaneously amplified and detected in a one-step and single-tube reaction, and the detection results were easily interpreted by NBS. The sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP-NBS was 12 copies (each of detection target) per reaction, and no cross-reactivity was generated from non-SARS-CoV-2 templates. Among clinically diagnosed COVID-19 patients, the analytical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 was 100% (33\/33) in the oropharynx swab samples, and the assay's specificity was also 100% (96\/96) when analyzed the clinical samples collected from non-COVID-19 patients. The total diagnosis test from sample collection to result interpretation only takes approximately 1 h. In sum, the RT-LAMP-NBS is a promising tool for diagnosing the current SARS-CoV-2 infection in first line field, public health and clinical laboratories, especially for resource-challenged regions.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiong Zhu","author_inst":"Sanya Peoples Hospital, Sanya, Hainan"},{"author_name":"Xiaoxia Wang","author_inst":"Sanya Peoples Hospital, Sanya, Hainan"},{"author_name":"Limei Han","author_inst":"Sanya Peoples Hospital, Sanya, Hainan"},{"author_name":"Ting Chen","author_inst":"Sanya Peoples Hospital, Sanya, Hainan"},{"author_name":"Licheng Wang","author_inst":"Sanya Peoples Hospital, Sanya, Hainan"},{"author_name":"Huan Li","author_inst":"Sanya Peoples Hospital, Sanya, Hainan"},{"author_name":"Sha Li","author_inst":"Sanya Peoples Hospital, Sanya, Hainan"},{"author_name":"Lvfen He","author_inst":"Sanya Peoples Hospital, Sanya, Hainan"},{"author_name":"Xiaoying Fu","author_inst":"Sanya Peoples Hospital, Sanya, Hainan"},{"author_name":"Shaojin Chen","author_inst":"Sanya Peoples Hospital, Sanya, Hainan"},{"author_name":"Xing Mei","author_inst":"Wenchang Peoples Hospital, Sanya, Hainan"},{"author_name":"Hai Chen","author_inst":"Sanya Peoples Hospital, Sanya, Hainan"},{"author_name":"Yi Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Childrens Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Center for Childrens Health"},{"author_name":"Liping Zhang","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Qingru Han","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Juan Zhang","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Fei Pan","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Li Chen","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Zhihong Zhu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Hongju Xiao","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Yu Liu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Gang Liu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Tanshi Li","author_inst":"PLAGH"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.17.20037689","rel_title":"Tracing DAY-ZERO and Forecasting the Fade out of the COVID-19 Outbreak in Lombardy, Italy: A Compartmental Modelling and Numerical Optimization Approach.","rel_date":"2020-03-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.17.20037689","rel_abs":"Italy became the second epicenter of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic after China, surpassing by far China's death toll. The disease swept through Lombardy, which remained in lockdown for about two months, starting from the 8th of March. As of that day, the isolation measures taken in Lombardy were extended to the entire country. Here, assuming that effectively there was one case ``zero\" that introduced the virus to the region, we provide estimates for: (a) the DAY-ZERO of the outbreak in Lombardy, Italy; (b) the actual number of asymptomatic infected cases in the total population until March 8; (c) the basic reproduction number Ro based on the estimation of the actual number of infected cases. To demonstrate the efficiency of the model and approach, we also provide a tentative forecast two months ahead of time, i.e. until May 4, the date on which relaxation of the measures commenced, on the basis of the COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports released by Google on March 29. Methods. To deal with the uncertainty in the number of actual asymptomatic infected cases in the total population, we address a modified compartmental Susceptible\/ Exposed\/ Infectious Asymptomatic\/ Infected Symptomatic\/ Recovered\/ Dead (SEIIRD) model with two compartments of infectious persons: one modelling the cases in the population that are asymptomatic or experience very mild symptoms and another modelling the infected cases with mild to severe symptoms. The parameters of the model corresponding to the recovery period, the time from the onset of symptoms to death and the time from exposure to the time that an individual starts to be infectious, have been set as reported from clinical studies on COVID-19. For the estimation of the DAY-ZERO of the outbreak in Lombardy, as well as of the \"effective\" per-day transmission rate for which no clinical data are available, we have used the proposed SEIIRD simulator to fit the numbers of new daily cases from February 21 to the 8th of March. This was accomplished by solving a mixed-integer optimization problem. Based on the computed parameters, we also provide an estimation of the basic reproduction number $R_0$. To examine the efficiency of the model and approach, we ran the simulator to forecast the epidemic two months ahead of time, i.e. from March 8 to May 4. For this purpose, we considered the reduction in mobility in Lombardy as released on March 29 by Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports, and the effects of social distancing and of the draconian measures taken by the government on March 20 and March 21, 2020. Results. Based on the proposed methodological procedure, we estimated that the expected DAY-ZERO was January 14 (min-max rage: January 5 to January 23, interquartile range: January 11 to January 18). The actual cumulative number of asymptomatic infected cases in the total population in Lombardy on March 8 was of the order of 15 times the confirmed cumulative number of infected cases, while the expected value of the basic reproduction number Ro was found to be 4.53 (min-max range: 4.40- 4.65). The model approximated adequately two months ahead of time the evolution of reported cases until May 4, the day on which the phase I of the relaxation of measures was implemented over all of Italy.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lucia Russo","author_inst":"Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche"},{"author_name":"Cleo Anastassopoulou","author_inst":"Medical School of Athens, University of Athens"},{"author_name":"Athanassios Tsakris","author_inst":"Medical School, University of Athens"},{"author_name":"Gennaro Nicola Bifulco","author_inst":"Universita degli Studi di Napoli Federico II"},{"author_name":"Emilio Fortunato Campana","author_inst":"Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche"},{"author_name":"Gerardo Toraldo","author_inst":"Universita degli Studi di Napoli Federico II"},{"author_name":"Constantinos Siettos","author_inst":"University of Naples Federico II"},{"author_name":"Lvfen He","author_inst":"Sanya Peoples Hospital, Sanya, Hainan"},{"author_name":"Xiaoying Fu","author_inst":"Sanya Peoples Hospital, Sanya, Hainan"},{"author_name":"Shaojin Chen","author_inst":"Sanya Peoples Hospital, Sanya, Hainan"},{"author_name":"Xing Mei","author_inst":"Wenchang Peoples Hospital, Sanya, Hainan"},{"author_name":"Hai Chen","author_inst":"Sanya Peoples Hospital, Sanya, Hainan"},{"author_name":"Yi Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Childrens Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Center for Childrens Health"},{"author_name":"Liping Zhang","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Qingru Han","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Juan Zhang","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Fei Pan","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Li Chen","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Zhihong Zhu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Hongju Xiao","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Yu Liu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Gang Liu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Tanshi Li","author_inst":"PLAGH"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.18.20038190","rel_title":"A brief review of antiviral drugs evaluated in registered clinical trials for COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-03-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.18.20038190","rel_abs":"Background: Although a number of antiviral agents have been evaluated for coronaviruses there are no approved drugs available. To provide an overview of the landscape of therapeutic research for COVID-19, we conducted a review of registered clinical trials. Methods: A review of currently registered clinical trials was performed on registries, including the Chinese (chictr.org.cn) and US (clinicaltrials.gov) databases to identify relevant studies up to March, 7th 2020. The search was conducted using the search terms \"2019-nCoV\", \"COVID-19\", \"SARS-CoV-2\", \"Hcov-19\", \"new coronavirus\", \"novel coronavirus\". We included interventional clinical trials focusing on patients with COVID-19 and assessing antiviral drugs or agents. Findings: Out of the 353 studies identified, 115 clinical trials were selected for data extraction. Phase IV trials were the most commonly reported study type (n=27, 23%). However, 62 trials (54%) did not describe the phase of the study. Eighty percent (n=92) of the trials were randomized with parallel assignment and the median number of planned inclusions was 63 (IQR, 36-120). Open-label studies were the most frequent (46%) followed by double-blind (13%) and single blind studies (10%). The most frequently assessed therapies were: stem cells therapy (n=23 trials), lopinavir\/ritonavir (n=15), chloroquine (n=11), umifenovir (n=9), hydroxychloroquine (n=7), plasma treatment (n=7), favipiravir (n=7), methylprednisolone (n=5), and remdesivir (n=5). Remdesivir was tested in 5 trials with a median of 400 (IQR, 394-453) planned inclusions per trial, while stem cells therapy was tested in 23 trials, but had a median of 40 (IQR, 23-60) planned inclusions per trial.

Such information can provide a valuable tool for decision makers to decide which areas need strengthening of social distancing measures and which areas can be relieved. Researchers from the U.S, Spain, and Italy have adopted our approach and we are collaborating to further improve it.

Although the clinical features of COVID-19 have been reported previously, data regarding the risk factors associated with the clinical outcomes are lacking. Objectives: To summary and analyze the clinical characteristics and identify the predictors of disease severity and mortality. Methods: The PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, Embase, Cochrane and MedRxiv databases were searched through February 25, 2020. Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) recommendations were followed. We extracted and pooled data using random-effects meta-analysis to summary the clinical feature of the confirmed COVID-19 patients, and further identify risk factors for disease severity and death. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the I2 method and explained with subgroup analysis and meta-regression. Results: A total of 30 studies including 53000 patients with COVID-19 were included in this study, the mean age was 49.8 years (95% CI, 47.5-52.2 yrs) and 55.5% were male. The pooled incidence of severity and mortality were 20.2% (95% CI, 15.1-25.2%) and 3.1% (95% CI, 1.9-4.2%), respectively. The predictor for disease severity included old age ([&ge;] 50 yrs, odds ratio [OR] = 2.61; 95% CI, 2.29-2.98), male (OR =1.348, 95% CI, 1.195-1.521), smoking (OR =1.734, 95% CI, 1.146-2.626) and any comorbidity (OR = 2.635, 95% CI, 2.098-3.309), especially chronic kidney disease (CKD, OR = 6.017; 95% CI, 2.192-16.514), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, OR = 5.323; 95% CI, 2.613-10.847) and cerebrovascular disease (OR = 3.219; 95% CI, 1.486-6.972). In terms of laboratory results, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer and decreased blood platelet and lymphocytes count were highly associated with severe COVID-19 (all for P < 0.001). Meanwhile, old age ([&ge;] 60 yrs, RR = 9.45; 95% CI, 8.09-11.04), followed by cardiovascular disease (RR = 6.75; 95% CI, 5.40-8.43) hypertension (RR = 4.48; 95% CI, 3.69-5.45) and diabetes (RR = 4.43; 95% CI, 3.49-5.61) were found to be independent prognostic factors for the COVID-19 related death. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first evidence-based medicine research to explore the risk factors of prognosis in patients with COVID-19, which is helpful to identify early-stage patients with poor prognosis and adapt effective treatment.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xianxian Zhao","author_inst":"Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Bili Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pan Li","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chaoqun Ma","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jiawei Gu","author_inst":"Department of General Surgery, The Fifth People's Hospital of Shanghai, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Pan Hou","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhifu Guo","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hong Wu","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yuan Bai","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Eran Segal","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Herve TISSOT DUPONT","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Stephane HONORE","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University"},{"author_name":"Philippe COLSON","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Eric CHABRIERE","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Bernard LA SCOLA","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Jean Marc ROLAIN","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Philippe BROUQUI","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Didier RAOULT Sr.","author_inst":"IHU Mediterrane Infection, Aix Marseille University"},{"author_name":"Zhihong Zhu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Hongju Xiao","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Yu Liu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Gang Liu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Tanshi Li","author_inst":"PLAGH"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.17.20037671","rel_title":"Modeling and Forecasting Trend of COVID-19 Epidemic in Iran","rel_date":"2020-03-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.17.20037671","rel_abs":"Background: COVID-19 is an emerging disease and precise data are not available in the world and Iran. this study aimed to determine the epidemic trend and prediction of COVID-19 in Iran. Methods: This study is a secondary data analysis and modeling. We used the daily reports of definitive COVID-19 patients (sampling of severe cases and hospitalization) released by Iran Ministry of Health and Medical Education. Epidemic projection models of Gompertz, Von Bertalanffy and least squared error (LSE) were used to predict the number of cases at April 3, 2020 until May 13, 2020. Results: R0 in Iran was estimated to be 4.7 that has now fallen to below 2. Given the three different scenarios, the prediction of the patients on April 3, 2020 by Von Bertalanffy, Gompertz and LSE were estimated at 48200, 52500 and 58000, respectively. The number of deceased COVID-19 patients was also estimated to be 3600 individuals using the Von growth model, 4200 ones by Gompertz's model and 4850 ones according to the LSE method. To predict and estimate the number of patients and deaths in the end of epidemic based on Von and Gompertz models, we will have 87000 cases, 4900 and 11000 deaths until 13 May and 1 June, respectively. Conclusion: The process of controlling the epidemic is tangible. If enforcement and public behavior interventions continue with current trends, the control and reduction of the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran will be flat from April 28, until July, 2020 and new cases are expected to decline from the following Iranian new year.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ali Ahmadi","author_inst":"Modeling in Health Research Center, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord"},{"author_name":"Yasin Fadaei","author_inst":"Ph.D of Applied Mathematics, Researcher at Modeling in Health Research Center, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, Iran"},{"author_name":"Majid Shirani","author_inst":"Department of Urology, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, Iran."},{"author_name":"Fereydoon Rahmani","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, School of Medicine, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, Iran."},{"author_name":"Jiawei Gu","author_inst":"Department of General Surgery, The Fifth People's Hospital of Shanghai, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Pan Hou","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhifu Guo","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hong Wu","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yuan Bai","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Eran Segal","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Herve TISSOT DUPONT","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Stephane HONORE","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University"},{"author_name":"Philippe COLSON","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Eric CHABRIERE","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Bernard LA SCOLA","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Jean Marc ROLAIN","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Philippe BROUQUI","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Didier RAOULT Sr.","author_inst":"IHU Mediterrane Infection, Aix Marseille University"},{"author_name":"Zhihong Zhu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Hongju Xiao","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Yu Liu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Gang Liu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Tanshi Li","author_inst":"PLAGH"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.18.20038117","rel_title":"Predicting the epidemic trend of COVID-19 in China and across the world using the machine learning approach","rel_date":"2020-03-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.18.20038117","rel_abs":"Background: Although COVID-19 has been well controlled in China, it is rapidly spreading outside the country and may have catastrophic results globally without implementation of necessary mitigation measures. Because the COVID-19 outbreak has made comprehensive and profound impacts on the world, an accurate prediction of its epidemic trend is significant. Although many studies have predicted the COVID-19 epidemic trend, most have used early-stage data and focused on Chinese cases. Methods: We first built models to predict daily numbers of cumulative confirmed cases (CCCs), new cases (NCs), and death cases (DCs) of COVID-19 in China based on data from January 20, 2020, to March 1, 2020. Based on these models, we built models to predict the epidemic trend across the world (outside China). We also built models to predict the epidemic trend in Italy, Spain, Germany, France, UK, and USA where COVID-19 is rapidly spreading. Findings: The COVID-19 outbreak will have peaked on February 22, 2020, in China and will peak on May 22, 2020, across the world. It will be basically under control in early April 2020 in China and end-August 2020 across the world. The total number of COVID-19 cases will reach around 89,000 in China and 6,126,000 across the world during the epidemic. Around 4,000 and 290,000 people will die of COVID-19 in China and across the world, respectively. The COVID-19 outbreak will have peaked recently in Italy and will peak in Spain, Germany, France, UK, and USA within two weeks.

Since identification, infections (coronavirus disease-2019; COVID-19) caused by this novel pathogen have spread globally, with more than 180,000 confirmed cases as of March 16, 2020. Effective public health interventions, including social distancing, contact tracing, and isolation\/quarantine rely on the rapid and accurate identification of confirmed cases. However, testing capacity (having sufficient tests and laboratory throughput) to support these non-pharmaceutical interventions remains a challenge for containment and mitigation of COVID-19 infections. We undertook a sentinel event strategy (where single health events signal emerging trends) to estimate the incidence of COVID-19 in the US. Data from a recent national conference, the Conservative Political Action Conference, (CPAC) near Washington, DC and from the outbreak in Wuhan, China were used to fit a simple exponential growth model to estimate the total number of incident SARS- CoV-2 infections in the United States on March 1, 2020, and to forecast subsequent infections potentially undetected by current testing strategies. Our analysis and forecasting estimates a total of 54,100 SARS-CoV-2 infections (80 % CI 5,600 to 125,300) have occurred in the United States to March 12, 2020. Our forecast predicts that a very substantial number of infections are undetected, and without extensive and far-reaching non-pharmaceutical interventions, the number of infections should be expected to grow at an exponential rate.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew A.

Asymptomatic carriers of the COVID-19 virus display no clinical symptoms but are known to be contagious. Recent evidence reveals that this sub-population, as well as persons with mild disease, are a major contributor in the propagation of the disease. The rapid spread of COVID-19 forced governments around the world to establish and enforce generalized risk mitigation strategies, from lockdowns to guidelines for social distancing, in an effort to minimize community transmission. This created an unprecedented epidemiological situation not properly characterized by existing mathematical models of isolation and quarantine. In this manuscript, we present a mathematical model for community transmission of COVID-19 taking into account asymptomatic carriers and varying degrees of risk mitigation. The main results consist of an exact calculation of the effective reproduction number R_e(t), and a modeling framework that enables the quantification of the effect of risk mitigation and asymptomatism on community transmission. A computation of R_e(t) is provided using mean parameters. The point estimate of the basic reproduction number is approximately 12.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jacob B Aguilar","author_inst":"Saint Leo University"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Samuel Faust","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital Department of Emergency Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lauren M.

Despite the sharp rise in the incidence of COVID-19, authoritative recommendations to limit the spread of SARS-CoV2 within gastrointestinal endoscopy units are lacking. Therefore, with the primary aim of identifying best practice and scrutinizing its supporting evidence, we conducted a systematic review of literature for articles published between 1 January 2002 and 15 March 2020 in five databases relating to both the current SARS-CoV2 and the previous SARS-CoV outbreaks. Official websites for gastroenterology and endoscopy societies in the 15 most affected countries were also searched. Unfortunately, a paucity of high quality data and heterogeneity of recommendations between countries was observed. Interestingly, not all countries advocated the postponement of non-urgent or elective procedures. Recommendations for patient screening and personal protective equipment were commonly featured in all recommendations but specifics varied. Only 32% (9\/28) of all gastroenterology and endoscopy societies issued guidance on endoscopy in the COVID-19 pandemic. In conclusion, stronger evidence to inform current practice and robust guidelines are urgently needed to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV2 in gastrointestinal endoscopy departments worldwide.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"John Ong","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Gail B.

This newly propose model well describes an epidemic growth and it could be widely applied into various topics including pathology, epidemiology, business and data sciences. The Advanced Analytical Epidemic Diffusion Model (AAEDM) is a dynamic diffusion prediction model which is theoretically intuitive and its tractable closed formula could be easily adapted into versatile Bigdata driven analytics including the machine learning system. This dynamic model is still an analytical model but the periods of prediction are segmented for adapting the values from the dataset when the data is available. The epidemiologically vital parameters which effect on the AAEDM are also introduced in this paper. The evaluation of this theoretical model based on the Covid-19 data in Korea has been accomplished with relative fair future prediction accuracies. Although this analytical model has been designed from a basic exponential growth model, the performance of the AAEDM is competitive with other Bigdata based simulation models. Since the AAEDM is relatively simple and handy, anyone can use this model into analyzing outbreak situations in his daily life.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Song-Kyoo Kim","author_inst":"Macao Polytechnic Institute"},{"author_name":"Gail B.

There is great attention for the diffusion and evolution of the CoVid-19 infection which started from the north (particularly in the Lombardia region) and it is now rapidly affecting other Italian regions. We investigate on the impact of patients hospitalisation in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) at a regional and subregional granularity. We propose a model derived from well-known models in epidemic to estimate the needed number of places in intensive care units. The model will help decision-makers to plan resources in the short and medium-term in order to guarantee appropriate treatments to all patients needing it. We analyse Italian data at regional level up to March 15th aiming to: (i) support health and government decision-makers in gathering rapid and efficient decisions on increasing health structures capacities (in terms of ICU slots) and (ii) define a scalable geographic model to plan emergency and future CoVid-19 patients management using reallocating them among health structures. Finally, the here proposed model can be useful in countries where CoVid-19 is not yet strongly diffused.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pietro Hiram Guzzi","author_inst":"University of Catanzaro"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Tradigo","author_inst":"University of Catanzaro"},{"author_name":"Pierangelo Veltri","author_inst":"University of Catanzaro"},{"author_name":"Juan B.

The large droplet route has been commonly believed to be dominant for most respiratory infections since the early 20th century, and the associated droplet precaution is widely known and practiced in hospitals and in the community. The mechanism of exposure to droplets expired at close contact, however, remains surprisingly unexplored. In this study, the exposure to exhaled droplets during close contact (< 2 m) via both the short-range airborne and large droplet sub-routes is studied using a simple mathematical model of expired flows and droplet dispersion\/deposition\/inhalation, which enables the calculation of exposure due to both deposition and inhalation. The short-range airborne route is found to dominate at most distances studied during both talking and coughing. The large droplet route only dominates when the droplets are larger than 100 m and when the subjects are within 0.2 m while talking or 0.5 m while coughing. The smaller the exhaled droplets, the more important the short-range airborne route. The large droplet route contributes less than 10% of exposure when the droplets are smaller than 50 m and when the subjects are more than 0.3 m apart, even while coughing.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wenzhao Chen","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Nan Zhang","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Jianjian Wei","author_inst":"Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Hui-Ling YEN","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Yuguo Li","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Yue Zhang","author_inst":"Pinghu hospital of Shenzhen University"},{"author_name":"Xiaosheng Wang","author_inst":"China Pharmaceutical University"},{"author_name":"Hong Wu","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yuan Bai","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Eran Segal","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Herve TISSOT DUPONT","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Stephane HONORE","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University"},{"author_name":"Philippe COLSON","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Eric CHABRIERE","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Bernard LA SCOLA","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Jean Marc ROLAIN","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Philippe BROUQUI","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Didier RAOULT Sr.","author_inst":"IHU Mediterrane Infection, Aix Marseille University"},{"author_name":"Zhihong Zhu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Hongju Xiao","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Yu Liu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Gang Liu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Tanshi Li","author_inst":"PLAGH"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.17.20037903","rel_title":"Double-Quencher Probes Improved the Detection Sensitivity of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by One-Step RT-PCR","rel_date":"2020-03-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.17.20037903","rel_abs":"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerges in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, spreads worldwide, and threats the human life.

Methods: This study utilized primers and single-quencher probes in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the USA and the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) in Japan. Moreover, we designed the double-quencher probes (YCH assay) according to the oligonucleotide sequence established by NIID. Using these assays, we conducted a one-step real-time RT-PCR with serial DNA positive control to assess the detection sensitivity. Results: The threshold cycle (Ct) value of RT-PCR was relatively low in CDC and YCH assays compared to NIID assay. Serial dilution assay showed that both CDC and YCH assays could detect a low-copy number of DNA positive control. The background fluorescent signal at the baseline was lower in YCH than that of NIID. Conclusion: Double-quencher probes decreased background fluorescent signal and improved detection sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yosuke Hirotsu","author_inst":"Yamanashi Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hitoshi Mochizuki","author_inst":"Yamanashi Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Masao Omata","author_inst":"Yamanashi Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hui-Ling YEN","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Yuguo Li","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Yue Zhang","author_inst":"Pinghu hospital of Shenzhen University"},{"author_name":"Xiaosheng Wang","author_inst":"China Pharmaceutical University"},{"author_name":"Hong Wu","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yuan Bai","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Eran Segal","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Herve TISSOT DUPONT","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Stephane HONORE","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University"},{"author_name":"Philippe COLSON","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Eric CHABRIERE","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Bernard LA SCOLA","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Jean Marc ROLAIN","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Philippe BROUQUI","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Didier RAOULT Sr.","author_inst":"IHU Mediterrane Infection, Aix Marseille University"},{"author_name":"Zhihong Zhu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Hongju Xiao","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Yu Liu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Gang Liu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Tanshi Li","author_inst":"PLAGH"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"}]}
