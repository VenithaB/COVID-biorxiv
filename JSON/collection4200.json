In total, 39.3% of patients were asymptomatic, 41% were symptomatic with mild\/moderate symptoms, 5.3% were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and recovered, and 14.4% died. The mean age of death cases was 54.20 years (S.D. 11.09). Comorbidities were more prevalent in patients who died compared with others. Key findings include abnormal levels of markers assicated with infection, inflammation, abnormal blood clotting, heart problems and kidney problems in patients with severe form of the disease and poor putcome. We report a rapidly deteriorating estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in deaths during ICU stay with kidney injury complications reported in 65% of deaths (p < 0.05). Our dynamic profiling of eGFR in ICU highlights the potential role of renal markers in forecasting disease outcome that could perhaps identify patients at risk of poor outcome.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abdullah Alshukry","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology & Head and Neck Surgery, Jaber Al-Ahmad Hospital, Ministry of Health, Kuwait"},{"author_name":"Hamad Ali","author_inst":"Department of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, Health Sciences Center (HSC), Kuwait University, Kuwait"},{"author_name":"Yaseen Ali","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology & Head and Neck Surgery, Jaber Al-Ahmad Hospital, Ministry of Health, Kuwait"},{"author_name":"Talal Al-Taweel","author_inst":"Gastroenterology Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, Jaber Al-Ahmad Hospital, Ministry of Health, Kuwait."},{"author_name":"Mohamed Abu-farha","author_inst":"Dasman Diabetes Institute (DDI), Dasman, Kuwait"},{"author_name":"Jehad AbuBaker","author_inst":"Dasman Diabetes Institute (DDI), Dasman, Kuwait"},{"author_name":"Sriraman Devarajan","author_inst":"Dasman Diabetes Institute (DDI), Dasman, Kuwait"},{"author_name":"Ali A.

We examine the associations between clusters and mortality rate, vulnerability, and social inequality. We used the prospective space-time scan statistic to detect daily COVID-19 clusters and examine the relative risk from February 25th-June 7th, 2020 in 5,570 Brazilian municipalities. We apply a Spearman statistic to measure correlation between the relative risk of each cluster and mortality rate, GINI index, and social inequality. We detected 11 emerging space-time clusters of COVID-19 occurring in all Brazilian regions, with seven of them with a relative risk greater than one, and the highest in the Amapa state in the northern region of Brazil. We observed a positive and significant correlation between the relative risk and mortality rate, Brazilian Social Vulnerability Index, and GINI Index. The results can be utilized to improve COVID-19 response and planning in all Brazilian states.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marcos Roberto Martines","author_inst":"Federal University of Sao Carlos"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Vicente Ferreira","author_inst":"Federal University of Triangulo Mineiro"},{"author_name":"Rogerio H Toppa","author_inst":"Federal University of Sao Carlos"},{"author_name":"Luiza Assuncao","author_inst":"State University of Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Michael Richard Desjardins","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Eric M Delmelle","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Charlotte"},{"author_name":"Aiyoub Pezeshgi","author_inst":"Zanjan University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ali A.

The time plot showed that the cases of COVID-19 rises rapidly in recent time. KPSS test confirms the non-stationarity of the process (p < 0.05) before differencing. The test also confirmed the stationarity of the process (p > 0.05) after differencing. Various ARIMA (p,d,q) were examined with their respective AICs and Log-likelihood. ARIMA (1, 2, 1) was selected as the best model due to its least AIC (559.74) and highest log likelihood (-276.87).

The aim of the present study was to investigate the predictive accuracy of a prognostic model for forecasting the development of the cumulative number of reported SARS-CoV-2 cases in countries and administrative regions worldwide. Methods: The cumulative number of reported SARS-CoV-2 cases was forecasted in 251 regions with a horizon of two weeks, one month, and two months using a previously described hierarchical logistic model at the end of March 2020. Forecasts were compared to actual observations by using a series of evaluation metrics. Results: On average, predictive accuracy was very high in nearly all regions at the two weeks forecast, high in most regions at the one month forecast, and notable in the majority of the regions at the two months forecast. Higher accuracy was associated with the availability of more data for estimation and with a more pronounced cumulative case growth from the first case to the date of estimation. In some strongly affected regions, cumulative case counts were considerably underestimated. Conclusions: With keeping its limitations in mind, the investigated model can be used for the preparation and distribution of resources during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Future research should primarily address the model's assumptions and its scope of applicability. In addition, establishing a relationship with known mechanisms and traditional epidemiological models of disease transmission would be desirable.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Levente Kriston","author_inst":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"},{"author_name":"Isqeel Adesegun Ogunsola","author_inst":"Federal University of Agriculture Abeokuta"},{"author_name":"Saddam Adams Damisa","author_inst":"Ahmadu Bello University"},{"author_name":"Luiza Assuncao","author_inst":"State University of Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Michael Richard Desjardins","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Eric M Delmelle","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Charlotte"},{"author_name":"Aiyoub Pezeshgi","author_inst":"Zanjan University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ali A.

However, the potential for exposure to SARS-CoV-2 through breastfeeding is currently unknown. To date, case reports on breastmilk samples from a total of 24 SARS-CoV-2-infected women have been published. Of those, viral RNA was detected in ten breastmilk samples from four women. In some but not all cases, environmental contamination as the source of the virus or retrograde flow from an infected infant could not be ruled out. We established a quantitative RT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 in breastmilk with a limit of detection of 250 copies per mL and validated it by spiking breastmilk from uninfected women with known amounts of viral RNA. In addition, we established tissue culture methods to detect replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 in breastmilk. No viral RNA nor culturable virus was detected after Holder pasteurization of breastmilk samples that had been spiked with replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 (see Supplement). Between March 27 and May 6, 2020, we collected and analyzed 64 serial breastmilk samples from 18 SARS-CoV-2-infected women residing in the U.S. (see Supplement for clinical characteristics). Breastmilk samples were collected before and after women had a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test and all but one woman had symptomatic disease (see Figure). One of the 64 breastmilk samples had detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR. The positive sample was collected on the day of symptom onset but one sample 2 days prior to symptom onset and two subsequent samples, collected 12 and 41 days later, tested negative for viral RNA. In addition, a subset of 26 breastmilk samples from nine women were tested for the presence of replication-competent virus using our established culture methods, and all were negative including the one sample that tested positive for viral RNA by RT-PCR. Although SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in one milk sample from one of eighteen infected women, the viral culture for that sample was negative. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 RNA does not represent replication-competent virus and that breastmilk itself is likely not a source of infection for the infant. Furthermore, when control breastmilk samples spiked with replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 virus were treated by Holder pasteurization, a process commonly performed by donor milk banks, no replication-competent virus nor viral RNA was detectable. Further research to confirm these findings is needed, as well as an examination of convalescent milk for the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christina D Chambers","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Paul Krogstad","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Kerri Bertrand","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Deisy Contreras","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Lars Bode","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Nicole Tobin","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Grace Aldrovandi","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Ali A.

The strategies for prevention depend on largely lacking information, as infection prevalence and virus pathogenicity. This study aimed to determine the prevalence, the pathogenicity, and the speed of infection spreading in a large population in Brazil. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a serial cross-sectional study designed on a population basis and structured over houses as the sampling units. The sampling consisted of four visits at 15 days intervals in randomly selected census-designated sectors of the State major municipalities (reference municipalities) and two visits at 30 days intervals in smaller municipalities of the same regions of those of reference. At each visit, the investigators sampled houses and sampled one individual in each house for data collection. After the informed consent, the investigators performed a rapid antibody detection test (Celer Technology, Inc) and applied a questionnaire containing clinical and demographic questions. RESULTS: From May 13th to 15th, the investigators performed 6,393 rapid tests in 4,612 individuals of the reference municipalities, 1,163 individuals of the smaller municipalities, and 166 contacts of the positive individuals. Ninety-seven dwellers were positive in the reference municipalities, giving a prevalence of 2.1% (CI 95%: 1.67-2.52%). In the smaller municipalities, the figure was 0.26% (CI 95%: 0.05%-0.75%) (three positives). There was an association of the positive result with female sex (p = 0.013) and houses with five dwellers or more (p = 0.003). Seventy-eight positive individuals reported symptoms in the previous 15 days (80.4%), being anosmia (45.4%), cough (40.2%), and myalgia (38.1%) the more frequent. About one-third of them reported fever (28.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The results reveal a still small prevalence of infection in the study area, despite the significant number of sick people overloading the health system. The figures indicate an important underreporting in the area and a frequency that still can grow, making necessary public health actions for the containment of the transmission.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cristiana Costa Gomes","author_inst":"Secretaria de Estado da Saude do Espirito Santo"},{"author_name":"Crispim Cerutti Jr.","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Espirito Santo"},{"author_name":"Eliana Zandonade","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Espirito Santo"},{"author_name":"Ethel Leonor Noia Maciel","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Espirito Santo"},{"author_name":"Filomena Euridice Carvalho de Alencar","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Espirito Santo"},{"author_name":"Gilton Luiz Almada","author_inst":"Secretaria de Estado da Saude do Espirito Santo"},{"author_name":"Orlei Amaral Cardoso","author_inst":"Secretaria de Estado da Saude do Espirito Santo"},{"author_name":"Pablo Medeiros Jabor","author_inst":"Instituto Jones dos Santos Neves"},{"author_name":"Raphael Lubiana Zanotti","author_inst":"Secretaria de Estado da Saude do Espirito Santo"},{"author_name":"Tania Queiroz Reuter","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Espirito Santo.

Here, we investigated the interaction between complement and the platelet\/neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)\/thrombin axis, using COVID-19 clinical samples, cell-based inhibition studies and NETs\/human aortic endothelial cell (HAEC) co-cultures. Increased plasma levels of NETs, TF activity and sC5b-9 were detected in patients. Neutrophils yielded high tissue factor (TF) expression and released NETs carrying functionally active TF. Confirming our ex vivo findings, treatment of control neutrophils with COVID-19 platelet-rich plasma generated TF-bearing NETs that induced thrombotic activity of HAEC. Thrombin or NETosis inhibition or C5aR1 blockade attenuated platelet-mediated NET-driven thrombogenicity. Serum isolated from COVID-19 patients induces complement activation in vitro, which is consistent with high complement activity in clinical samples. Complement inhibition at the level of C3 with compstatin Cp40 disrupted TF expression in neutrophils. In conclusion, we provide a mechanistic basis that reveals the pivotal role of complement and NETs in COVID-19 immmunothrombosis.

Design: This was a retrospective cohort study focusing on the clinical data of COVID-19 inpatients admitted at the early stage of pandemic. Setting: A single center study conducted in Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong university of Science and Technology (Wuhan, China). Participants: All 1031 inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 according to Prevention and control Scheme for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia published by National Health Commission of the People' s Republic of China and WHO interim guidance in Tongji hospital (Wuhan, China), from January 27, 2020, to March 8, 2020 with the cutoff date being March 30, 2020, were included in this study. Main outcome measures: Demographic data, medical history, clinical symptoms and signs, laboratory findings, chest computed tomography (CT), treatment, and clinical outcomes were extracted from electronic medical records. Results: 1031 COVID-19 inpatients were included in this study, of whom 866 were discharged and 165 were deceased in hospital. 73% of 165 deceased patients had chronic comorbidities. Patients with underlying diseases showed CFR 2.8 times as that of patients without. Senility and males were observed to be main risk factors for increased in-hospital case-fatality rate, with the odds ratio in multivariable regression being 2.94 (95%CI: 2.00 to 4.33; P <0.001) and 2.47 (95%CI: 1.65 to 3.70; P <0.001), respectively. The odds ratio of cases with composite endpoints for patients with simple hypertension was 1.53 (95%CI: 1.07 to 2.17; P=0.019). Senile patients with hypertension were proved to be at high risk early in the disease, which might be associated with the level of CRP, LDH, and eGFR. The odds ratio of case-fatality rate for patients with hypertension taking CCB group was 0.67 (95%CI: 0.37 to 1.20; P = 0.176). Among 271 severe cases without IKF, the odds ratio of case-fatality rate was 0.42 (95CI%: 0.18 to 0.99; P = 0.046) for patients in the CCB group after adjustment of age, sex, and underlying diseases. Conclusions: Hypertension is not just a chronic underlying comorbidity, but also a risk factor affecting the severity of COVID-19 and does play a critical role in worsening patients' clinical outcomes. Therefore, hypertension management in patients with COVID-19 should be regarded as a major challenge in the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hesong Zeng","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Tianlu Zhang","author_inst":"Medical Research Institute, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xingwei He","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yuxin Du","author_inst":"Medical Research Institute, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yan Tong","author_inst":"Medical Research Institute, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xueli Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Central China Development, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Weizhong Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Hypertension, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Yin Shen","author_inst":"Medical Research Institute, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Victoria Tsironidou","author_inst":"Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, Department of Medicine, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece."},{"author_name":"Christina Tsigalou","author_inst":"Laboratory of Microbiology, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece."},{"author_name":"Maria Tektonidou","author_inst":"First Department of Propaedeutic Internal Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Theocharis Konstantinidis","author_inst":"Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, Department of Medicine, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece."},{"author_name":"Charalampos Papagoras","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine and Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandro"},{"author_name":"Ioannis Mitroulis","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine and Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandro"},{"author_name":"Georgios Germanidis","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine, AHEPA University Hospital, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece."},{"author_name":"John D Lambris","author_inst":"Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."},{"author_name":"Konstantinos Ritis","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine and Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandro"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"cardiovascular medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.14.20130922","rel_title":"Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of Venous Thromboembolism in Patients Hospitalized for COVID-19: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.14.20130922","rel_abs":"Objective: To investigate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) patients complicated with venous thromboembolism (VTE) Method: We performed a comprehensive literature search of several databases to find studies that assessed VTE in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with a primary outcome of all-cause mortality and secondary outcomes of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mechanical ventilation.

We also evaluated the clinical characteristics of VTE sufferers. Results: Eight studies have been included with a total of 1237 pooled subjects. Venous thromboembolism was associated with higher mortality (RR 2.48 (1.35, 4.55), p=0.003; I2 5%, p=0.35) after we performed sensitivity analysis, ICU admission (RR 2.32 (1.53, 3.52), p<0.0001; I2 80%, p <0.0001), and mechanical ventilation need (RR 2.73 (1.56, 4.78), p=0.0004; I2 77%, p=0.001).

Crude CFRs could by biased by larger proportions of older COVID-19 cases in population data, who are also at increased mortality risk. Such distorted age case structures are a common feature of selective COVID 19 testing strategies in many countries, and they potentially mask underlying differences arising from other important factors such as health system burden. Methods We used the method of direct case-age standardisation to evaluate the effects of age variations on CFRs. Data on cases and death by age from Italy, Spain, China, Australia and South Korea were analysed to derive standardised CFRs. Findings were compared across different case age distribution references as standards. Results Using the South Korean case age distribution as a standard, the fivefold higher crude CFR for Italy is reduced to less than two-fold after adjustment, while the crude CFR difference for Spain is virtually eliminated. The adjusted CFR for Australia is the lowest among all countries. Discussion Mortality differences based on crude CFRs are exaggerated by age structures, which are effectively controlled by case age standardization. Residual CFR differences could be attributed to health and health system factors. The South Korean case age distribution is an appropriate reference standard, given its robust case detection and contact tracing program. Till reliable population level indicators of incidence and mortality are available, the age-standardized CFR could be a viable option for international comparison of the impact of the COVID 19 epidemic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chalapati Rao","author_inst":"Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Suhail Doi","author_inst":"Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Gail Williams","author_inst":"University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Hoo Felicia Hadi Gunawan","author_inst":"Siloam Hospitals Kebon Jeruk"},{"author_name":"Alius Cahyadi","author_inst":"School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Paskah Suciadi","author_inst":"Siloam Hospitals Kebon Jeruk"},{"author_name":"Weizhong Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Hypertension, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Yin Shen","author_inst":"Medical Research Institute, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Victoria Tsironidou","author_inst":"Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, Department of Medicine, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece."},{"author_name":"Christina Tsigalou","author_inst":"Laboratory of Microbiology, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece."},{"author_name":"Maria Tektonidou","author_inst":"First Department of Propaedeutic Internal Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Theocharis Konstantinidis","author_inst":"Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, Department of Medicine, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece."},{"author_name":"Charalampos Papagoras","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine and Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandro"},{"author_name":"Ioannis Mitroulis","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine and Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandro"},{"author_name":"Georgios Germanidis","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine, AHEPA University Hospital, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece."},{"author_name":"John D Lambris","author_inst":"Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."},{"author_name":"Konstantinos Ritis","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine and Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandro"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.14.20131177","rel_title":"Long time frames to detect the impact of changing COVID-19 control measures","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.14.20131177","rel_abs":"Background: Many countries have implemented population-wide interventions such as physical distancing measures, in efforts to control COVID-19. The extent and success of such measures has varied. Many jurisdictions with declines in reported COVID-19 cases are moving to relax measures, while others are continuing to intensify efforts to reduce transmission. Aim: We aim to determine the time frame between a change in COVID-19 measures at the population level and the observable impact of such a change on cases. Methods: We examine how long it takes for there to be a substantial difference between the cases that occur following a change in control measures and those that would have occurred at baseline. We then examine how long it takes to detect a difference, given delays and noise in reported cases. We use changes in population-level (e.g., distancing) control measures informed by data and estimates from British Columbia, Canada. Results: We find that the time frames are long: it takes three weeks or more before we might expect a substantial difference in cases given a change in population-level COVID-19 control, and it takes slightly longer to detect the impacts of the change. The time frames are shorter (11-15 days) for dramatic changes in control, and they are impacted by noise and delays in the testing and reporting process, with delays reaching up to 25-40 days. Conclusion: The time until a change in broad control measures has an observed impact is longer than is typically understood, and is longer than the mean incubation period (time between exposure than onset) and the often used 14 day time period. Policy makers and public health planners should consider this when assessing the impact of policy change, and efforts should be made to develop rapid, consistent real-time COVID-19 surveillance.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jessica E Stockdale","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Renny Doig","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Joosung Min","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Nicola Mulberry","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Liangliang Wang","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Lloyd T Elliott","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Caroline Colijn","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Yin Shen","author_inst":"Medical Research Institute, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Victoria Tsironidou","author_inst":"Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, Department of Medicine, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece."},{"author_name":"Christina Tsigalou","author_inst":"Laboratory of Microbiology, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece."},{"author_name":"Maria Tektonidou","author_inst":"First Department of Propaedeutic Internal Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Theocharis Konstantinidis","author_inst":"Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, Department of Medicine, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece."},{"author_name":"Charalampos Papagoras","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine and Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandro"},{"author_name":"Ioannis Mitroulis","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine and Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandro"},{"author_name":"Georgios Germanidis","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine, AHEPA University Hospital, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece."},{"author_name":"John D Lambris","author_inst":"Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."},{"author_name":"Konstantinos Ritis","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine and Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandro"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.14.20131268","rel_title":"Explore the Possible Impact of BCG Vaccination Policy on the Morbidity, Mortality, and Recovery Rates due to COVID-19 Infection.","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.14.20131268","rel_abs":"BACKGROUND The Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) is the new form of an acute infectious respiratory disease and has quickly spread over most continents in the world. Recently, it has been shown that Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) might protect against COVID-19. This study aims to investigate the possible correlation between BCG vaccination and morbidity\/mortality\/recovery rate associated with COVID-19 infection. METHODS Data of COVID-19 confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and population were obtained from https:\/\/www.worldometers.info\/coronavirus\/ (Accessed on 12 June, 2020). To have meaningful comparisons among countries' mortality and recovery rates, we only choose those countries with COVID-19 infected cases at least 200. The Poisson regression and logistic regression were used to explore the relationship between BCG vaccination and morbidity, mortality and recovery rates. RESULTS Among those 158 countries with at least 200 COVID-19 infected cases, there were 141 countries with BCG vaccination information available. The adjusted rates ratio of COVID-19 confirmed cases for Current BCG vaccination vs. non-Current BCG vaccination was 0.339 (with 95% CI= (0.338,0.340)). Moreover, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of death and recovery after coronavirus infected for Current BCG vaccination vs. non-Current BCG vaccination were 0.258 (with 95% CI= (0.254,0.261)) and 2.151 (with 95% CI= (2.140,2.163)), respectively. CONCLUSIONS That data in this study show the BCG might provide the protection against COVID-19, with consequent less COVID-19 infection and deaths and more rapid recovery. BCG vaccine might bridge the gap before the disease-specific vaccine is developed, but this hypothesis needs to be further tested in rigorous randomized clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chuan-Hsin Chang","author_inst":"Academic Sinica"},{"author_name":"Yue-Cune Chang","author_inst":"Tamkang University"},{"author_name":"Joosung Min","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Nicola Mulberry","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Liangliang Wang","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Lloyd T Elliott","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Caroline Colijn","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Yin Shen","author_inst":"Medical Research Institute, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Victoria Tsironidou","author_inst":"Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, Department of Medicine, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece."},{"author_name":"Christina Tsigalou","author_inst":"Laboratory of Microbiology, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece."},{"author_name":"Maria Tektonidou","author_inst":"First Department of Propaedeutic Internal Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Theocharis Konstantinidis","author_inst":"Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, Department of Medicine, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece."},{"author_name":"Charalampos Papagoras","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine and Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandro"},{"author_name":"Ioannis Mitroulis","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine and Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandro"},{"author_name":"Georgios Germanidis","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine, AHEPA University Hospital, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece."},{"author_name":"John D Lambris","author_inst":"Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."},{"author_name":"Konstantinos Ritis","author_inst":"First Department of Internal Medicine and Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandro"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.14.20131078","rel_title":"Proteomics Uncovers Immunosuppression in COVID-19 Patients with Long Disease Course","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.14.20131078","rel_abs":"Little is known regarding why a subset of COVID-19 patients exhibited prolonged positivity of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Remarkably, we found that during the first three weeks since disease onset, while clinical symptoms and outcome were indistinguishable, patients with prolonged disease course displayed characteristic immunological responses including enhanced Natural Killer (NK) cell-mediated innate immunity and regulatory T cell-mediated immunosuppression. We further showed that it is possible to predict the length of disease course using machine learning based on blood protein levels during the first three weeks.

(e.g., fever, hyperventilation, anorexia, gastroenteritis, acid-base disorder) that may cause electrolyte imbalances. Hypokalemia is a concerning electrolyte disorder that may increase the susceptibility to various kinds of arrhythmia. This study aimed to estimate prevalence, risk factors and outcome of hypokalemia in a cohort of non-critically ill patients. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 290 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection at the tertiary teaching hospital of Modena, Italy. Hypokalemia (<3.5 mEq\/L) was detected in 119 patients (41%). The decrease of serum potassium level was of mild entity (3-3.4 mEq\/L) and occurred in association with hypocalcemia (P=0.001) and lower level of serum magnesium (P=0.028) compared to normokaliemic patients. Urine K: creatinine ratio, measured in a small subset of patients (n=45; 36.1%), showed an increase of urinary potassium excretion in the majority of the cases (95.5%). Causes of kaliuria were diuretic therapy (53.4%) and corticosteroids (23.3%). In the remaining patients, urinary potassium loss was associated with normal serum magnesium, low sodium excretion (FENa< 1%) and metabolic alkalosis. Risk factors for hypokalemia were female gender (P=0.002; HR 0.41, 95%CI 0.23-0.73) and diuretic therapy (P=0.027; HR 1.94, 95%CI 1.08-3.48). Hypokalemia, adjusted for sex, age and SOFA score, resulted not associated with ICU admission (P=0.131, 95% CI 0.228-1.212) and in-hospital mortality (P=0.474; 95% CI 0,170-1,324) in our cohort of patients. Hypokalemia is a frequent disorder in COVID-19 patients and urinary potassium loss may be the main cause of hypokalemia. The disorder was mild in the majority of the patients and was unrelated to poor outcomes. Nevertheless, hypokalemic patients required potassium supplements to dampen the risk of arrhythmias.","rel_num_authors":33,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gaetano Alfano","author_inst":"University of Modena and Reggio Emilia"},{"author_name":"Annachiara Ferrari","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Francesco Fontana","author_inst":"Policlinco di Modena"},{"author_name":"Rossella Perrone","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Giacomo Mori","author_inst":"Policlinco di Modena"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta Ascione","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Magistroni Riccardo","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Giulia Venturi","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Simone Pederzoli","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Gianluca Margiotta","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Marilina Romeo","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Francesca Piccinini","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Giacomo Franceschi","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Sara Volpi","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Matteo Faltoni","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Giacomo Ciusa","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Erica Bacca","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Marco Tutone","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Raimondi","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"marianna menozzi","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Erica Franceschini","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Gianluca Cuomo","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Gabriella Orlando","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Antonella Santoro","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Margherita Di Gaetano","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Cinzia Puzzolante","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Federica Carli","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Andrea Bedini","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Jovana Milic","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Marianna Meschiari","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Cristina Mussini","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Gianni Cappelli","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Guaraldi","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"nephrology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.14.20131128","rel_title":"Innate immune signaling in the olfactory epithelium reduces odorant receptor levels: modeling transient smell loss in COVID-19 patients","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.14.20131128","rel_abs":"Post-infectious anosmias typically follow death of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) with a months-long recovery phase associated with parosmias. While profound anosmia is the leading symptom associated with COVID-19 infection, many patients regain olfactory function within days to weeks without distortions. Here, we demonstrate that sterile induction of anti-viral type I interferon signaling in the mouse olfactory epithelium is associated with diminished odor discrimination and reduced odor-evoked local field potentials. RNA levels of all class I, class II, and TAAR odorant receptors are markedly reduced in OSNs in a non-cell autonomous manner. We find that people infected with COVID-19 rate odors with lower intensities and have odor discrimination deficits relative to people that tested negative for COVID-19. Taken together, we propose that inflammatory-mediated loss of odorant receptor expression with preserved circuit integrity accounts for the profound anosmia and rapid recovery of olfactory function without parosmias caused by COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Steve Rodriguez","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital \/ Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Luxiang Cao","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gregory T.

Probability of contracting this highly contagious infection is similar across age groups but disease severity and fatality among aged patients with or without comorbidities are higher. We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 infection may augment aging-related gene expression alterations resulting in severe outcomes in elderly patients.\n\nMethodologyWe performed a comparative analysis of publicly available transcriptome data from Broncho Alveolar Lavage Fluid (BALF)\/lung\/blood of healthy aging group with i) COVID-19 patients; and ii) data of host genes interacting with SARS-CoV-2 proteins.\n\nResultsWe observed i) a significant overlap of gene expression profiles of patients BALF and blood with lung and blood of the healthy group respectively; ii) a more pronounced overlap in blood compared to lung; and iii) a similar overlap between host genes interacting with SARS-CoV-2 and aging blood transcriptome.\n\nConclusionsPathway enrichment analysis of overlapping gene sets suggests that infection alters expression of genes already dysregulated in the elderly, which together may lead to poor prognosis. eQTLs in these genes may also confer poor outcome in young patients worsening with age and co-morbidities. Furthermore, the pronounced overlap observed in blood may explain clinical symptoms including blood clots, strokes, heart attack, multi-organ failure etc. in severe cases. This model based on a limited patient dataset seems robust and holds promise for testing larger tissue specific datasets from patients with varied severity and across populations.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Upasana Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"University of Delhi"},{"author_name":"BK Thelma","author_inst":"University of Delhi"},{"author_name":"Gregory T.

Severe COVID-19 disease has been associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation and thrombosis, but the mechanisms underlying COVID-19-related coagulopathy remain unknown. Since the risk of severe COVID-19 disease is higher in males than in females and increases with age, we combined proteomics data from SARS-CoV-2-infected cells with human gene expression data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database to identify gene products involved in coagulation that change with age, differ in their levels between females and males, and are regulated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This resulted in the identification of transferrin as a candidate coagulation promoter, whose levels increases with age and are higher in males than in females and that is increased upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. A systematic investigation of gene products associated with the GO term \"blood coagulation\" did not reveal further high confidence candidates, which are likely to contribute to COVID-19-related coagulopathy. In conclusion, the role of transferrin should be considered in the course of COVID-19 disease and further examined in ongoing clinic-pathological investigations.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Katie-May McLaughlin","author_inst":"University of Kent"},{"author_name":"Marco Bechtel","author_inst":"Goethe-University"},{"author_name":"Denisa Bojkova","author_inst":"Goethe-University"},{"author_name":"Sandra Ciesek","author_inst":"Goethe Universtiy Frankfurt"},{"author_name":"Mark N Wass","author_inst":"University of Kent"},{"author_name":"Martin Michaelis","author_inst":"University of Kent"},{"author_name":"Jindrich N Cinatl Jr.","author_inst":"Klinikum der Goethe-Universitaet"},{"author_name":"Alefiya Dhilla Albers","author_inst":"Endicott College \/ Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rose Gallagher","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"M.

However, where is it origin and which animals are sensitive to cross-species transmission is unclear. The interaction of virus and cell receptor is a key determinant of host range for the novel coronavirus. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is demonstrated as the primary entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we evaluated the SARS-CoV-2 entry mediated by ACE2 of 11 different species of animals, and discovered that ACE2 of Rhinolophus sinicus (Chinese horseshoe bat), Felis catus (domestic cat), Canis lupus familiaris (dog), Sus scrofa (pig), Capra hircus (goat) and especially Manis javanica (Malayan pangolin) were able to render SARS-CoV-2 entry in non-susceptible cells. This is the first report that ACE2 of Pangolin could mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry which increases the presume that SARS-CoV-2 may have a pangolin origin. However, none of the ACE2 proteins from Rhinolophus ferrumequinum (greater horseshoe bat), Gallus gallus (chicken), Notechis scutatus (mainland tiger snake), Mus musculus (house mouse) rendered SARS-CoV-2 entry. Specifically, a natural isoform of Macaca mulatta (Rhesus monkey) ACE2 with a mutation of Y217N was resistance to infection, which rises the possible impact of this type of ACE2 during monkey studies of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, these results clarify that SARS-CoV-2 could engage receptors of multiple species of animals and it is a perplexed work to track SARS-CoV-2 origin and its intermediate hosts.\n\nIMPORTANCEIn this study, we illustrated that SARS-CoV-2 is able to engage receptors of multiple species of animals. This indicated that it may be a perplexed work to track SARS-CoV-2 origin and discover its intermediate hosts. This feature of virus is considered to potentiate its diverse cross-species transmissibility. Of note, here is the first report that ACE2 of Pangolin could mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry which increases the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 may have a pangolin origin. And we also demonstrated that not all species of bat were sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. At last, it is also important to detect the expression ratio of the Y217N ACE2 to the prototype in Rhesus monkeys to be recruited for studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yan-Dong Tang","author_inst":"Harbin Veterinary Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yuming Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science"},{"author_name":"Jing Sun","author_inst":"National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Hongliang Zhang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences"},{"author_name":"Tong-yun Wang","author_inst":"Harbin Veterinary Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ming-Xia Sun","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yue-Lin Yang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiaoliang Hu","author_inst":"Yibin University"},{"author_name":"Jincun Zhao","author_inst":"Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xuehui Cai","author_inst":"Harbin Veterinary Research Institute of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zhifeng Ren","author_inst":"University of Houston"},{"author_name":"Daniel Tatar","author_inst":"The ADK Group"},{"author_name":"Shibani Mukerji","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ross Zafonte","author_inst":"Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital"},{"author_name":"Edward W.

This process requires a single host to be infected with more than one type of coronavirus, which recombine to form novel strains of virus with unique combinations of genetic material. Identifying possible sources of novel coronaviruses requires identifying hosts (termed recombination hosts) of more than one coronavirus type, in which recombination might occur. However, the majority of coronavirus-host interactions remain unknown, and therefore the vast majority of recombination hosts for coronaviruses cannot be identified. Here we show that there are 11.5-fold more coronavirus-host associations, and over 30-fold more potential SARS-CoV-2 recombination hosts, than have been observed to date. We show there are over 40-fold more host species with four or more different subgenera of coronaviruses. This underestimation of both number and novel coronavirus generation in wild and domesticated animals. Our results list specific high-risk hosts in which our model predicts homologous recombination could occur, our model identifies both wild and domesticated mammals including known important and understudied species. We recommend these species for coronavirus surveillance, as well as enforced separation in livestock markets and agriculture.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maya Wardeh","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Matthew Baylis","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Marcus SC Blagrove","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Hongliang Zhang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences"},{"author_name":"Tong-yun Wang","author_inst":"Harbin Veterinary Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ming-Xia Sun","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yue-Lin Yang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiaoliang Hu","author_inst":"Yibin University"},{"author_name":"Jincun Zhao","author_inst":"Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xuehui Cai","author_inst":"Harbin Veterinary Research Institute of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zhifeng Ren","author_inst":"University of Houston"},{"author_name":"Daniel Tatar","author_inst":"The ADK Group"},{"author_name":"Shibani Mukerji","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ross Zafonte","author_inst":"Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital"},{"author_name":"Edward W.

With no vaccines, and only recently developed antiviral therapeutics, we are ill equipped to handle coronavirus outbreaks4. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate coronavirus replication and pathogenesis is needed to guide the development of new antiviral therapeutics and vaccines. RNA secondary structures play critical roles in multiple aspects of coronavirus replication, but the extent and conservation of RNA secondary structure across coronavirus genomes is unknown5. Here, we define highly structured RNA regions throughout the MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We find that highly stable RNA structures are pervasive throughout coronavirus genomes, and are conserved between the SARS-like CoV. Our data suggests that selective pressure helps preserve RNA secondary structure in coronavirus genomes, suggesting that these structures may play important roles in virus replication and pathogenesis. Thus, disruption of conserved RNA secondary structures could be a novel strategy for the generation of attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for use against the current COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wes Sanders","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Ethan J Fritch","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Emily A Madden","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Rachel L Graham","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Heather A Vincent","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Mark T Heise","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Ralph S Baric","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Nathaniel J Moorman","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Kalpana Panneerselvam","author_inst":"European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, CB10 1SD, UK."},{"author_name":"Simona Panni","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Ecology and Earth Sciences, Universita della Calabria, Rende, Italy"},{"author_name":"Negin Rahimzadeh","author_inst":"UCLA-DOE Institute, UCLA, Los Angeles, USA.

Daclatasvir and sofosbuvir (SFV) are clinically approved direct-acting antivirals (DAA) against hepatitis C virus (HCV), with satisfactory safety profile. In the HCV replicative cycle, daclatasvir and SFV target the viral enzymes NS5A and NS5B, respectively. NS5A is endowed with pleotropic activities, which overlap with several proteins from SARS-CoV-2. HCV NS5B and SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 are RNA polymerases that share homology in the nucleotide uptake channel. These characteristics of the HCV and SARS-CoV-2 motivated us to further study the activity of daclatasvir and SFV against the new coronavirus. Daclatasvir consistently inhibited the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus particles in Vero cells, in the hepatoma cell line HuH-7 and in type II pneumocytes (Calu-3), with potencies of 0.8, 0.6 and 1.1 M, respectively. Daclatasvir targeted early events during SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle and prevented the induction of IL-6 and TNF-, inflammatory mediators associated with the cytokine storm typical of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Sofosbuvir, although inactive in Vero cells, displayed EC50 values of 6.2 and 9.5 M in HuH-7 and Calu-3 cells, respectively. Our data point to additional antiviral candidates, in especial daclatasvir, among drugs overlooked for COVID-19, that could immediately enter clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carolina Q.

Currently, the knowledge accumulated from different studies about this virus is very limited. Leveraging a wide-range of biological knowledge, such as gene on-tology and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks from other closely related species presents a vital approach to infer the molecular impact of a new species. In this paper, we propose the transferred multi-relational embedding model Bio-JOIE to capture the knowledge of gene ontology and PPI networks, which demonstrates superb capability in modeling the SARS-CoV-2-human protein interactions. Bio-JOIE jointly trains two model components. The knowledge model encodes the relational facts from the protein and GO domains into separated embedding spaces, using a hierarchy-aware encoding technique employed for the GO terms. On top of that, the transfer model learns a non-linear transformation to transfer the knowledge of PPIs and gene ontology annotations across their embedding spaces. By leveraging only structured knowledge, Bio-JOIE significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in PPI type prediction on multiple species. Furthermore, we also demonstrate the potential of leveraging the learned representations on clustering proteins with enzymatic function into enzyme commission families. Finally, we show that Bio-JOIE can accurately identify PPIs between the SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human proteins, providing valuable insights for advancing research on this new disease.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Junheng Hao","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Chelsea Jui-Ting Ju","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Muhao Chen","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Yizhou Sun","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Carlo Zaniolo","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Camila R.

From nearly 12,000 compounds, we identified 66 compounds capable of selectively inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication in human cells. Twenty-four of these drugs show additive activity in combination with the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor remdesivir and may afford increased in vivo efficacy. We also identified synergistic interaction of the nucleoside analog riboprine and a folate antagonist 10-deazaaminopterin with remdesivir. Overall, seven clinically approved drugs (halofantrine, amiodarone, nelfinavir, simeprevir, manidipine, ozanimod, osimertinib) and 19 compounds in other stages of development may have the potential to be repurposed as SARS-CoV-2 oral therapeutics based on their potency, pharmacokinetic and human safety profiles.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Malina A.

However, the cellular mechanism behind the sudden loss of smell has not yet been investigated. The initial step of odour detection takes place in the pseudostratified olfactory epithelium (OE) mainly composed of olfactory sensory neurons surrounded by supporting cells known as sustentacular cells. The olfactory neurons project their axons to the olfactory bulb in the central nervous system offering a potential pathway for pathogens to enter the central nervous system by bypassing the blood brain barrier. In the present study, we explored the impact of SARS-COV-2 infection on the olfactory system in golden Syrian hamsters. We observed massive damage of the OE as early as 2 days post nasal instillation of SARS-CoV-2, resulting in a major loss of cilia necessary for odour detection. These damages were associated with infection of a large proportion of sustentacular cells but not of olfactory neurons, and we did not detect any presence of the virus in the olfactory bulbs. We observed massive infiltration of immune cells in the OE and lamina propria of infected animals, which may contribute to the desquamation of the OE. The OE was partially restored 14 days post infection. Anosmia observed in COVID-19 patient is therefore likely to be linked to a massive and fast desquamation of the OE following sustentacular cells infection with SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent recruitment of immune cells in the OE and lamina propria.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bertrand Bryche","author_inst":"Universite Paris-Saclay, INRAE, UVSQ, VIM, 78350, Jouy-en-Josas, France"},{"author_name":"Audrey Saint-Albin Deliot","author_inst":"Universite Paris-Saclay, INRAE, UVSQ, VIM, 78350, Jouy-en-Josas, France"},{"author_name":"Severine Murri","author_inst":"Laboratoire de Lyon, ANSES, Unite virologie, Lyon, France"},{"author_name":"Sandra Lacote","author_inst":"Laboratoire de Lyon, ANSES, Unite virologie, Lyon, France"},{"author_name":"Coralie Pulido","author_inst":"Laboratoire de Lyon, ANSES, Unite virologie, Lyon, France"},{"author_name":"Meriadeg Ar Gouilh","author_inst":"Service de Virologie, CHU de Caen, Caen, France"},{"author_name":"Sandrine Lesellier","author_inst":"Laboratoire rage et faune sauvage, ANSES, Malzeville, France"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Servat","author_inst":"Laboratoire rage et faune sauvage, ANSES, Malzeville, France"},{"author_name":"Marine Wasniewski","author_inst":"Laboratoire rage et faune sauvage, ANSES, Malzeville, France"},{"author_name":"Evelyne Picard-Meyer","author_inst":"Laboratoire rage et faune sauvage, ANSES, Malzeville, France"},{"author_name":"Elodie Montchartre-Leroy","author_inst":"Laboratoire rage et faune sauvage, ANSES, Malzeville, France"},{"author_name":"Romain Volmer","author_inst":"Universite de Toulouse, ENVT, INRA, UMR 1225, Toulouse, France"},{"author_name":"Olivier Rampin","author_inst":"Universite Paris Saclay, INRAE, AgroParisTech, PNCA, 78350, Jouy-en-Josas, France"},{"author_name":"Ronan Le Goffic","author_inst":"Universite Paris-Saclay, INRAE, UVSQ, VIM, 78350, Jouy-en-Josas, France"},{"author_name":"Philippe Marianneau","author_inst":"Laboratoire de Lyon, ANSES, Unite virologie, Lyon, France"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Meunier","author_inst":"Universite Paris-Saclay, INRAE, UVSQ, VIM, 78350, Jouy-en-Josas, France"},{"author_name":"Sandra Orchard","author_inst":"European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, CB10 1SD, UK."},{"author_name":"Igor Jurisica","author_inst":"Krembil Research Institute, Data Science Discovery Centre for Chronic Diseases, University Health Network, 5KD-407, 60 Leonard Avenue, Toronto, ON, M5T 0S8, Can"},{"author_name":"Henning Hermjakob","author_inst":"European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, CB10 1SD, UK."},{"author_name":"Pablo Porras","author_inst":"European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, CB10 1SD, UK."},{"author_name":"Erica Franceschini","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Gianluca Cuomo","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Gabriella Orlando","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Antonella Santoro","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Margherita Di Gaetano","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Cinzia Puzzolante","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Federica Carli","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Andrea Bedini","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Jovana Milic","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Marianna Meschiari","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Cristina Mussini","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Gianni Cappelli","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Guaraldi","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"neuroscience"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.16.154211","rel_title":"TMPRSS2, a SARS-CoV-2 internalization protease is downregulated in head and neck cancer patients.","rel_date":"2020-06-16","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.16.154211","rel_abs":"ObjectivesTwo of the main target tissues of SARS-coronavirus 2 are the oral cavity pharynx-larynx epithelium, the main virus entry site, and the lung epithelium. The virus enters host cells through binding of the Spike protein to ACE2 receptor and subsequent S priming by the TMPRSS2 protease. Herein we aim to assess differences in both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in normal tissues from oral cavity-pharynx-larynx and lung tissues as well as neoplastic tissues from the same histological areas. The information provided in this study may contribute to better understanding of SARS-coronavirus 2 ability to interact with different biological systems and contributes to cumulative knowledge on potential mechanisms to inhibit its diffusion.\n\nMaterials and MethodsThe study has been conducted using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Regina Elena Institute (IRE) databases and validated by experimental model in HNSCC and Lung cancer cells. Data from one COVID19 positive patient who was operated on for HNSCC was also included. We have analyzed 478 tumor samples and 44 normal samples from TCGA HNSCC cohort for whom both miRNA and mRNA sequencing was available. The dataset included 391 HPV- and 85 HPV+ cases, with 331 P53 mutated and 147 P53 wild type cases respectively. 352 out of 478 samples were male and 126 female. In IRE cohort we analyzed 66 tumor samples with matched normal sample for miRNA profiling and 23 tumor\\normal matched samples for mRNA profiling. 45 out of 66 tumors from IRE cohort were male and 21 female, 38 were P53 mutated and 27 wild type. Most patients (63 of 66) in IRE cohort were HPV negative. Normalized TCGA HNSCC gene expression and miRNA expression data were obtained from Broad Institute TCGA Genome Data Analysis Center (http:\/\/gdac.broadinstitute.org\/). mRNA expression data from IRE cohort used in this study has been deposited to NCBIs Gene Expression Omnibus and is accessible through GEO series accession number GSE107591. In order to inference about potential molecular modulation of TMPRSS2, we also included miRNAs expression for the 66 IRE cohort matched tumor and normal samples from Agilent platform. DNA methylation data for TCGA tumors were obtained from Wanderer (http:\/\/maplab.imppc.org\/wanderer\/). We used miRWalk and miRNet web tools for miRNA-target interaction prediction and pathway enrichment analysis. The correlation and regression analyses as well as the miRNA and gene modulation and the survival analysis were conducted using Matlab R2019.\n\nResultsTMPRSS2 expression in HNSCC was significantly reduced compared to the normal tissues and had a prognostic value in HNSCC patients. Reduction of TMPRSS2 expression was more evident in women than in men, in TP53 mutated versus wild TP53 tumors as well as in HPV negative patients compared to HPV positive counterparts. Functionally, we assessed the multivariate effect on TMPRSS2 in a single regression model. We observed that all variables had an independent effect on TMPRSS2 in HNSCC patients with HPV negative, TP53 mutated status and with elevated TP53-dependent Myc-target genes associated with low TMPRSS2 expression. Investigation of the molecular modulation of TMPRSS2 in both HNSCC and lung cancers revealed that expression of microRNAs targeting TMPRSS2 anti-correlated in both TCGA and IRE HNSCC datasets, while there was not evidence of TMPRSS2 promoter methylation in both tumor cohorts. Interestingly, the anti-correlation between microRNAs and TMPRSS2 expression was corroborated by testing this association in a SARS-CoV-2 positive HNSCC patient.\n\nConclusionsCollectively, these findings suggest that tumoral tissues, herein exemplified by HNSCC and lung cancers might be more resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to reduced expression of TMPRSS2. The protective mechanism might occur, at least partially, through the aberrant activation of TMPRSS2 targeting microRNAs; thereby providing strong evidence on the role of non-coding RNA molecule in host viral infection. These observations may help to better assess the frailty of SARS-CoV-2 positive cancer patients.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrea Sacconi","author_inst":"IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Sara Donzelli","author_inst":"IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Claudio Pulito","author_inst":"IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Stefano Ferrero","author_inst":"University of Milan La Statale"},{"author_name":"Aldo Morrone","author_inst":"San Gallicano Dermatological Institute IRCCS"},{"author_name":"Marta Rigoni","author_inst":"University of Trento"},{"author_name":"Fulvia Pimipinelli","author_inst":"San Gallicano Dermatologic Institute IRCCS"},{"author_name":"Fabrizio Ensoli","author_inst":"San Gallicano Dermatologic Institute IRCCS"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Sanguineti","author_inst":"IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Raul Pellini","author_inst":"IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Nishant Agrawal","author_inst":"University of Chicago Medicine and Biological Sciences"},{"author_name":"Evgeny Izumchenko","author_inst":"University of Chicago Medicine and Biological Sciences"},{"author_name":"Gennaro Ciliberto","author_inst":"IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Aldo Gianni","author_inst":"University of Milan La Statale"},{"author_name":"Paola Muti","author_inst":"University of Milan La Statale"},{"author_name":"Sabrina Strano","author_inst":"IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Blandino","author_inst":"IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Igor Jurisica","author_inst":"Krembil Research Institute, Data Science Discovery Centre for Chronic Diseases, University Health Network, 5KD-407, 60 Leonard Avenue, Toronto, ON, M5T 0S8, Can"},{"author_name":"Henning Hermjakob","author_inst":"European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, CB10 1SD, UK."},{"author_name":"Pablo Porras","author_inst":"European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, CB10 1SD, UK."},{"author_name":"Erica Franceschini","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Gianluca Cuomo","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Gabriella Orlando","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Antonella Santoro","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Margherita Di Gaetano","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Cinzia Puzzolante","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Federica Carli","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Andrea Bedini","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Jovana Milic","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Marianna Meschiari","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Cristina Mussini","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Gianni Cappelli","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Guaraldi","author_inst":"Policlinico di Modena"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"cancer biology"}]}
