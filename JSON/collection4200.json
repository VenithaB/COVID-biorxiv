A description is developed based on the framework of susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed model. Removed population is split into recovered and death populations allowing a better comprehension of real situations. Besides, total population is reduced based on the number of deaths. Hospital infrastructure is also included into the mathematical description allowing the consideration of collapse scenarios. Initially, a model verification is carried out calibrating system parameters with data from China outbreak that is considered a benchmark due the availability of data for the entire cycle. Afterward, numerical simulations are performed to analyze COVID-19 dynamics in Brazil. Results show several scenarios showing the importance of social isolation. System dynamics has a strong sensitivity to transmission rate showing the importance of numerical simulations to guide public health decision strategies.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pedro M.C.L.

In this study we estimate susceptibility and infectivity of children compared to those of adults. Understanding the age-structured transmission dynamics of the outbreak provides precious and timely information to guide epidemic modelling and public health policy. Data were collected from households in the city of Bnei Brak, Israel, in which all household members were tested for COVID-19 using PCR. To estimate relative transmission parameters in the absence of data on who infected whom, we developed an estimation method based on a discrete stochastic dynamic model of the spread of the epidemic within a household. The model describes the propagation of the disease between household members allowing for susceptibility and infectivity parameters to vary among two age groups. The parameter estimates are obtained by a maximum likelihood method, where the likelihood function is computed based on the stochastic model via simulations. Inspection of the data reveals that children are less likely to become infected compared to adults (25% of children infected over all households, 44% of adults infected over all households, excluding index cases), and the chances of becoming infected increases with age. An interesting exception is that infants up to age one year are more likely to be infected than children between one and four. Using our modelling approach, we estimate that the susceptibility of children (under 20 years old) is 45% [40%, 55%] of the susceptibility of adults. The infectivity of children was estimated to be 85% [65%,110%] relative to that of adults. It is widely observed that the percentage of children within confirmed cases is low. A common explanation is that children who are infected are less likely to develop symptoms than adults, and thus are less likely to be tested. We estimate that children are less susceptible to infection, which is an additional factor explaining their relatively low rate of occurrence within confirmed cases. Moreover, our results indicate that children, when infected, are somewhat less prone to infect others compared to adults; however, this result is not statistically significant. The resulting estimates of susceptibility and infectivity of children compared to adults are crucial for deciding on appropriate interventions, and for controlling the epidemic outbreak and its progress. These estimates can guide age-dependent public health policy such as school closure and opening. However, while our estimates of children's susceptibility and infectivity are lower than those of adults within a household, it is important to bear in mind that their role in the spread of COVID-19 outside the household, is also affected by different contact patterns and hygiene habits.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Itai Dattner","author_inst":"University of Haifa, Israel"},{"author_name":"Yair Goldberg","author_inst":"Technion - Israel Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Guy Katriel","author_inst":"ORT Braude College"},{"author_name":"Rami Yaari","author_inst":"Gertner Institute for Health Policy and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Nurit Gal","author_inst":"Gertner Institute for Health Policy and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Yoav Miron","author_inst":"Gertner Institute for Health Policy and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Arnona Ziv","author_inst":"Gertner Institute for Health Policy and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Yoram Hamo","author_inst":"Gertner Institute for Health Policy and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Amit Huppert","author_inst":"Gertner Institute for Health Policy and Epidemiology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.02.20119883","rel_title":"A simplified model for the analysis of COVID-19 evolution during the lockdown period in Italy","rel_date":"2020-06-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.02.20119883","rel_abs":"A simplified model applied to COVID-19 cases detected and officially published by the italian government, seems to fit quite well the time evolution of the disease in Italy during the period feb-24th - may-19th 2020. The hypothesis behind the model is based on the fact that in the lockdown period the infection cannot be transmitted due to social isolation and, more generally, due to the strong protection measures in place during the observation period. In this case a compartment model is used and the interactions between the different compartments are simplified. The sample of cases detected is intended as a set of individuals susceptible to infection which, after being exposed and undergoing the infection, were isolated ('treated') in such a way they can no longer spread the infection. The values obtained are to be considered indicative as they depend not only on the quality of the data collected, but also on the qualitative approximation of the curves modeled to the data and on the number of available data.

Infectious diseases outbreaks like the ongoing COVID19 pandemic have negative impact on healthcare workers' (HCWs) mental health, which needs to be investigated. Therefore, we aimed to assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 on frontline HCWs and their coping strategies. Methods: A web-based, cross-sectional study was conducted among HCWs of the Punjab province of Pakistan. The generalized anxiety scale (GAD-7), patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Brief-COPE were used to assess anxiety, depression and coping strategies of the respondents. Results: The mean age of respondents (N = 398) was 28.67 {+\/-} 4.15 years, with majority of medical doctors (52%). The prevalence of anxiety and depression were 21.4% and 21.9%, respectively. There was no significant difference of anxiety and depression scores among doctors, nurses and pharmacists. Females had significantly higher anxiety (p = 0.003) and depression (p = 0.001) scores than males. Moreover, HCWs performing duties in COVID-19 ICU had significantly higher anxiety score than those from isolation wards (p = 0.020) and other departments (p = 0.014). Depression, not anxiety, score were higher among those who did not receive the infection prevention training. Most frequently adopted coping strategy was religious coping (5.98 {+\/-} 1.73) followed by acceptance (5.59 {+\/-} 1.55) and coping planning (4.91 {+\/-} 1.85). Conclusion: A considerable proportion of HCWs are having generalized anxiety and depression during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings call for interventions to mitigate mental health risks in HCWs.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Muhammad Salman","author_inst":"The University of Lahore"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Hussnain Raza","author_inst":"Faisalabad Institute of Cardiology"},{"author_name":"Zia Ul Mustafa","author_inst":"District Headquarter Hospital Pakpattan"},{"author_name":"Tahir Mehmood Khan","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences"},{"author_name":"Noman Asif","author_inst":"University of the Punjab"},{"author_name":"Humera Tahir","author_inst":"Lahore Medical and Dental College"},{"author_name":"Naureen Shehzadi","author_inst":"University of the Punjab"},{"author_name":"Khalid Hussain","author_inst":"University of the Punjab"},{"author_name":"Amit Huppert","author_inst":"Gertner Institute for Health Policy and Epidemiology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.02.20117739","rel_title":"iSCAN: An RT-LAMP-coupled CRISPR-Cas12 module for rapid, sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-06-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.02.20117739","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 affects all aspects of human life. Detection platforms that are efficient, rapid, accurate, specific, sensitive, and user friendly are urgently needed to manage and control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. RT-qPCR based methods are the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 detection. However, these methods require trained personnel, sophisticated infrastructure, and a long turnaround time, thereby limiting their usefulness. Reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), a one-step nucleic acid amplification method conducted at a single temperature, has been used for colorimetric virus detection. CRISPR-Cas12 and CRISPR-Cas13 systems, which possess collateral activity against ssDNA and RNA, respectively, have also been harnessed for virus detection. Here, we built an efficient, rapid, specific, sensitive, user-friendly SARS-CoV-2 detection module that combines the robust virus amplification of RT-LAMP with the specific detection ability of SARS-CoV-2 by CRISPR-Cas12. Furthermore, we combined the RT-LAMP-CRISPR-Cas12 module with lateral flow cells to enable highly efficient point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 detection. Our iSCAN SARS-CoV-2 detection module, which exhibits the critical features of a robust molecular diagnostic device, should facilitate the effective management and control of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zahir Ali","author_inst":"KAUST"},{"author_name":"Rashid Aman","author_inst":"KAUST"},{"author_name":"Ahmed Mahas","author_inst":"KAUST"},{"author_name":"sivakrishna gundra","author_inst":"KAUST"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Tehseen","author_inst":"KAUST"},{"author_name":"Tin Marsic","author_inst":"KAUST"},{"author_name":"Rahule Salunke","author_inst":"KAUST"},{"author_name":"Amit Subudhi","author_inst":"KAUST"},{"author_name":"Sharif Hala","author_inst":"KAUST"},{"author_name":"Samir Hamdan","author_inst":"KAUST"},{"author_name":"Arnab Pain","author_inst":"KAUST"},{"author_name":"Norhan Hassan","author_inst":"KAUST"},{"author_name":"MAGDY MAHFOUZ","author_inst":"KAUST"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.03.20117267","rel_title":"Implementation and evaluation of a novel real-time multiplex assay for SARS-CoV-2: In-field learnings from a clinical microbiology laboratory","rel_date":"2020-06-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.03.20117267","rel_abs":"The unprecedented scale of testing required to effectively control the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has necessitated urgent implementation of rapid testing in clinical microbiology laboratories. To date, there are limited data available on the analytical performance of emerging commercially available assays for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and integration of these assays into laboratory workflows. Here, we performed a prospective validation study of a commercially available assay, the AusDiagnostics Coronavirus Typing (8-well) assay. Respiratory tract samples for SARS-CoV-2 testing were collected between 1st March and 25th March 2020. All positive samples and a random subset of negative samples were sent to a reference laboratory for confirmation. In total, 2,673 samples were analyzed using the Coronavirus Typing assay. The predominant sample type was a combined nasopharyngeal\/throat swab (2,640\/2,673; 98.8%). Fifty-four patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 (0.02%) using the Coronavirus Typing assay; 53\/54 (98.1%) positive results and 621\/621 (100%) negative results were concordant with the reference laboratory. Compared to the reference standard, sensitivity of the Coronavirus Typing assay for SARS-CoV-2 was 100% [95% CI 93.2%-100%], specificity 99.8% [95% CI 99.1%-100%], positive predictive value 98.1% (95% CI 90.2%-99.7%] and negative predictive value 100% [95% CI 99.4%-100%]. In many countries, standard regulatory requirements for the introduction of new assays have been replaced by emergency authorizations and it is critical that laboratories share their post-market validation experiences, as the consequences of widespread introduction of a sub-optimal assay for SARS-CoV-2 are profound.

Cultures take several days to return a result and organisms frequently fail to grow. In critically ill patients this leads to the use of empiric, broad-spectrum antimicrobials and mitigates against stewardship. Methods Single ICU observational cohort study with contemporaneous comparator group. We developed and implemented a TaqMan array card (TAC) covering 52 respiratory pathogens in ventilated patients undergoing bronchoscopic investigation for suspected pneumonia. The time to result was compared against conventional culture, and sensitivity compared to conventional microbiology and metagenomic sequencing. We observed the clinician decisions in response to array results, comparing antibiotic free days (AFD) between the study cohort and comparator group. Findings 95 patients were enrolled with 71 forming the comparator group. TAC returned results 61 hours (IQR 42-90) faster than culture. The test had an overall sensitivity of 93% (95% CI 88-97%) compared to a combined standard of conventional culture and metagenomic sequencing, with 100% sensitivity for most individual organisms. In 54% of cases the TAC results altered clinical management, with 62% of changes leading to de-escalation, 30% to an increase in spectrum, and investigations for alternative diagnoses in 9%.

We use a non-Markovian age-of-infection model that is capable of handling long and variable time delays without changing its model topology. Bayesian estimation of model parameters is carried out using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. This framework allows us to treat all available input information, including both the previously published parameters of the epidemic and available local data, in a uniform manner. To accurately model deaths as well as demand on the healthcare system, we calibrate our predictions to total and in-hospital deaths as well as hospital and ICU bed occupancy by COVID-19 patients. We apply this model not only to the state as a whole but also its sub-regions in order to account for the wide disparities in population size and density. Without prior information on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), the model independently reproduces a mitigation trend closely matching mobility data reported by Google and Unacast. Forward predictions of the model provide robust estimates of the peak position and severity and also enable forecasting the regional-dependent results of releasing Stay-at-Home orders. The resulting highly constrained narrative of the epidemic is able to provide estimates of its unseen progression and inform scenarios for sustainable monitoring and control of the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"George N Wong","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Zachary J Weiner","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Alexei Tkachenko","author_inst":"Brookhaven National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Ahmed Elbanna","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Sergei Maslov","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Nigel Goldenfeld","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Yang Chen","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Constantin Habimana Mugabo","author_inst":"Karolinska Instituet"},{"author_name":"Anh Nguyen Quoc","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Nowlan","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Tomas Strandin","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Lev Levanov","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Jaromir Mikes","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Anu Kantele","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Jussi Hepojoki","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Olli Vapalahti","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Santtu Heinonen","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Eliisa Kekalainen","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Petter Brodin","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Gordon Dougan","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Andrew Conway Morris","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.03.20121194","rel_title":"Identification of spatial variations in COVID-19 epidemiological data using K-Means clustering algorithm: a global perspective","rel_date":"2020-06-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.03.20121194","rel_abs":"Background: Discerning spatial variations of COVID-19 through quantitative analysis operating on the geographically designated datasets relating to socio-demographics and epidemiological data facilitate strategy planning in curtailing the transmission of the disease and focus on articulation of necessary interventions in an informed manner. Methods: K-means clustering was employed on the available country-specific COVID-19 epidemiological data and the influential background characteristics. Country-specific case fatality rates and the average number of people tested positive for COVID-19 per every 10,000 population in each country were derived from the WHO COVID-19 situation report 107, and were used for clustering along with the background characteristics of proportion of countrys population aged >65 years and percentage GDP spent as public health expenditure. Results: The algorithm grouped the 89 countries into cluster 1 and Cluster 2 of sizes 54 and 35, respectively. It is apparent that Americas, European countries, and Australia formed a major part of cluster 2 with high COVID-19 case fatality rate, higher proportion of countrys population tested COVID-19 positive, higher percentage of GDP spent as public health expenditure, and greater percentage of population being more than 65 years of age. Conclusion: In spite of the positive correlation between high public health expenditure (%GDP) and COVID-19 incidence, case fatality rate, the immediate task ahead of most of the low and middle income countries is to strengthen their public health systems realizing that the correlation found in this study could be spurious in light of the underreported number of cases and poor death registration.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Viswa Chandu","author_inst":"SIBAR Institute of Dental Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zachary J Weiner","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Alexei Tkachenko","author_inst":"Brookhaven National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Ahmed Elbanna","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Sergei Maslov","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Nigel Goldenfeld","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Yang Chen","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Constantin Habimana Mugabo","author_inst":"Karolinska Instituet"},{"author_name":"Anh Nguyen Quoc","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Nowlan","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Tomas Strandin","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Lev Levanov","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Jaromir Mikes","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Anu Kantele","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Jussi Hepojoki","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Olli Vapalahti","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Santtu Heinonen","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Eliisa Kekalainen","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Petter Brodin","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Gordon Dougan","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Andrew Conway Morris","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.02.20120568","rel_title":"A Model for the Testing and Tracing Needed to Suppress COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-06-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.02.20120568","rel_abs":"This paper presents the first analytical model for calculating how many tests and tracing needed to suppress COVID-19 transmission.

As a result, there has been limited information about the demographic and clinical characteristics of deceased cases in the region, as well as the impacts of different case management strategies. Methods: Data from deceased cases reported across SSA through May 10, 2020 and from hospitalized cases in Burkina Faso through April 15, 2020 were analyzed. Demographic, epidemiological, and clinical information on deceased cases in SSA was derived through a line-list of publicly available information and, for cases in Burkina Faso, from aggregate records at the Center Hospitalier Universitaire de Tengandogo in Ouagadougou. A synthetic case population was derived probabilistically using distributions of age, sex, and underlying conditions from populations of West African countries to assess individual risk factors and treatment effect sizes. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the adjusted odds of survival for patients receiving oxygen therapy or convalescent plasma, based on therapeutic effectiveness observed for other respiratory illnesses. Results: Across SSA, deceased cases for which demographic data are available have been predominantly male (63\/103, 61.2%) and over 50 years of age (59\/75, 78.7%). In Burkina Faso, specifically, the majority of deceased cases either did not seek care at all or were hospitalized for a single day (59.4%, 19\/32); hypertension and diabetes were often reported as underlying conditions. After adjustment for sex, age, and underlying conditions in the synthetic case population, the odds of mortality for cases not receiving oxygen therapy was significantly higher than those receiving oxygen, such as due to disruptions to standard care (OR: 2.07; 95% CI: 1.56-2.75). Cases receiving convalescent plasma had 50% reduced odds of mortality than those who did not (95% CI: 0.24-0.93). Conclusion: Investment in sustainable production and maintenance of supplies for oxygen therapy, along with messaging around early and appropriate use for healthcare providers, caregivers, and patients could reduce COVID-19 deaths in SSA. Further investigation into convalescent plasma is warranted, as data on its effectiveness specifically in treating COVID-19 becomes available. The success of supportive or curative clinical interventions will depend on earlier treatment seeking, such that community engagement and risk communication will be critical components of the response.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Laura Skrip","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Karim Derra","author_inst":"IRSS - Clinical Research Unit of Nanoro, Burkina Faso"},{"author_name":"Mikaila Kabor\u00e9","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Teaching Hospital Yalgado Ouedraogo, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso; Ministry of Health, Teaching Hospital Tengandogo, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso"},{"author_name":"Navideh Noori","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Adama Gansan\u00e9","author_inst":"Centre National de Recherche et de Formation sur le Paludisme, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso; Ministry of Health, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso"},{"author_name":"Innocent Val\u00e9a","author_inst":"IRSS - Clinical Research Unit of Nanoro, Burkina Faso"},{"author_name":"Halidou Tinto","author_inst":"IRSS - Clinical Research Unit of Nanoro, Burkina Faso"},{"author_name":"Bicaba W.

Methods: Using predefined selection criteria, a literature search identified 43 eligible meta-analyses and\/or systematic reviews. Results: Most (N=17) studies addressed clinical manifestations and associated comorbidity, 6 studies addressed clinical manifestations in pregnant women and younger individuals, 8 studies addressed diagnostic data, 9 studies addressed various interventions, and 9 studies addressed prevention and control. The number of studies included in the various systemic reviews and meta-analyses ranged from 2 to 89. While there were some similarities and consistency for some findings, e.g. the relation between comorbidities and disease severity, we also noted occasionally conflicting data. Conclusion: As more data are collected from patients infected with COVID-19 all over the world, more studies will undoubtedly be published and attention to scientific accuracy in the performance of trials must be exercised to inform clinical decision-making and treatment guidelines.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ezzeldin Ibrahim","author_inst":"International Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Nasrien E Ibrahim","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA"},{"author_name":"Mikaila Kabor\u00e9","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Teaching Hospital Yalgado Ouedraogo, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso; Ministry of Health, Teaching Hospital Tengandogo, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso"},{"author_name":"Navideh Noori","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Adama Gansan\u00e9","author_inst":"Centre National de Recherche et de Formation sur le Paludisme, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso; Ministry of Health, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso"},{"author_name":"Innocent Val\u00e9a","author_inst":"IRSS - Clinical Research Unit of Nanoro, Burkina Faso"},{"author_name":"Halidou Tinto","author_inst":"IRSS - Clinical Research Unit of Nanoro, Burkina Faso"},{"author_name":"Bicaba W.

Methods: We used daily death count data from the Spanish MoMo, and death counts from 2018, and population on 1 July, 2019 by region (CCAA), age groups, and sex from the Spanish National Statistics Institute. We estimated weekly and annual (2019 and 2020*, the shifted annual calendar period up to June 14th 2020) life expectancies at birth as well as their differences with respect to 2019. Results: Weekly life expectancies at birth in Spain were lower in weeks 11-20, 2020 compared to the same weeks in 2019. This drop in weekly life expectancy was especially strong in weeks 13 and 14 (March 23rd to April 5th), with national declines ranging between 6.1 and 7.6 years and maximum regional weekly declines of up to 15 years in Madrid. Annual life expectancy differences between 2019 and 2020 also reflected an overall drop in annual life expectancy of 0.8 years for both men and women. These drops ranged between 0 years in several regions (e.g. Canary and Balearic Islands) to 2.7 years among men in Madrid. Conclusions: Life expectancy is an easy to interpret measure for understanding the heterogeneity of mortality patterns across Spanish regions. Weekly and annual life expectancy are sensitive useful indicators for understanding disparities and communicating the gravity of the situation because differences are expressed in intuitive year units.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sergi Trias-Llimos","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tim Riffe","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research"},{"author_name":"Usama Bilal","author_inst":"Dornsife School of Public Health, Drexel University"},{"author_name":"Navideh Noori","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Adama Gansan\u00e9","author_inst":"Centre National de Recherche et de Formation sur le Paludisme, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso; Ministry of Health, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso"},{"author_name":"Innocent Val\u00e9a","author_inst":"IRSS - Clinical Research Unit of Nanoro, Burkina Faso"},{"author_name":"Halidou Tinto","author_inst":"IRSS - Clinical Research Unit of Nanoro, Burkina Faso"},{"author_name":"Bicaba W.

To remedy this, several countries, including France, have taken strict lockdown measures, requiring the closure of all but essential places. This unprecedented disruption of daily routines has a strong potential for disrupting nutritional behaviours. Nutrition being one of the main modifiable risk factors for chronic disease risk, this may have further consequences for public health. Our objective was therefore to describe nutritional behaviours during the lockdown period and to put them in light of individual characteristics. Methods: 37,252 French adults from the web-based NutriNet-Sante cohort filled lockdown-specific questionnaires in April-May 2020 (nutritional behaviours, body weight, physical activity, 24h-dietary records). Nutritional behaviours were compared before and during lockdown using Student paired t-tests and associated to individual characteristics using multivariable logistic or linear regression models. Clusters of nutritional behaviours were derived from multiple correspondence analysis and ascending hierarchical classification. Results: During the lockdown, trends for unfavourable nutritional behaviours were observed: weight gain (for 35%; +1.8kg on average), decreased physical activity (53%), increased sedentary time (63%), increased snacking, decreased consumption of fresh food products (especially fruit and fish), increased consumption of sweets, biscuits and cakes. Yet, opposite trends were also observed: weight loss (for 23%, -2kg on average), increased home-made cooking (40%), increased physical activity (19%). These behavioural trends related to sociodemographic and economic position, professional situation during the lockdown (teleworking or not), initial weight status, having children at home, anxiety and depressive symptoms, as well as diet quality before the lockdown. Modifications of nutritional practices mainly related to routine change, food supply, emotional reasons but also to voluntary changes to adjust to the current situation. Conclusion: These results suggest that the lockdown led, in a substantial part of the population, to unhealthy nutritional behaviours that, if maintained in the long term, may increase the nutrition-related burden of disease and also impact immunity. Yet, the lockdown situation also created an opportunity for some people to improve their nutritional behaviours, with high stakes to understand the leverages to put these on a long-term footing.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Melanie Deschasaux-Tanguy","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Druesne-Pecollo","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Younes Esseddik","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Fabien Szabo de Edelenyi","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Alles","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Valentina A Andreeva","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Julia Baudry","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Helene Charreire","author_inst":"Paris-Est University, LabUrba, UPEC"},{"author_name":"Valerie Deschamps","author_inst":"Nutritional Surveillance and Epidemiology Team (ESEN), French Public Health Agency, Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center,"},{"author_name":"Manon Egnell","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Leopold K Fezeu","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Pilar Galan","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Chantal Julia","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Emmanuelle Kesse-Guyot","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Paule Latino-Martel","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Jean-Michel Oppert","author_inst":"Department of Nutrition, Institute of Cardiometabolism and Nutrition, Sorbonne University, Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sandrine Peneau","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Verdot","author_inst":"Nutritional Surveillance and Epidemiology Team (ESEN), French Public Health Agency, Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center,"},{"author_name":"Serge Hercberg","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Mathilde Touvier","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Gordon Dougan","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Andrew Conway Morris","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"nutrition"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.04.20120725","rel_title":"Covid-19 trajectories: Monitoring pandemic in the worldwide context","rel_date":"2020-06-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.04.20120725","rel_abs":"Background: Covid-19 pandemic is developing worldwide with common dynamics but also with partly marked differences between regions and countries. They are not completely understood, but presumably, provide one clue to find ways to mitigate epidemics until exit strategies to its eradication become available. Method: We provide a monitoring tool available at www.izbi.de. It enables inspection of the dynamic state of the epidemic in 187 countries using trajectories. They visualize transmission and removal rates of the epidemic and this way bridge epi-curve tracking with modelling approaches. Results: Examples were provided which characterize state of epidemic in different regions of the world in terms of fast and slow growing and decaying regimes and estimate associated rate factors. Basic spread of the disease associates with transmission between two individuals every two-three days on the average. Non-pharmaceutical interventions decrease this value to up to ten days where complete lock down measures are required to stop the epidemic. Comparison of trajectories revealed marked differences between the countries regarding efficiency of measures taken against the epidemic. Trajectories also reveal marked country-specific dynamics of recovery and death rates. Conclusions: The results presented refer to the pandemic state in May 2020 and can serve as working instruction for timely monitoring using the interactive monitoring tool as a sort of seismometer for the evaluation of the state of epidemic, e.g., the possible effect of measures taken in both, lock-down and lock-up directions. Comparison of trajectories between countries and regions will support developing hypotheses and models to better understand regional differences of dynamics of Covid-19.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Henry Loeffler-Wirth","author_inst":"University of Leipzig"},{"author_name":"Maria Schmidt","author_inst":"University of Leipzig"},{"author_name":"Hans Binder","author_inst":"University of Leipzig"},{"author_name":"Fabien Szabo de Edelenyi","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Alles","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Valentina A Andreeva","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Julia Baudry","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Helene Charreire","author_inst":"Paris-Est University, LabUrba, UPEC"},{"author_name":"Valerie Deschamps","author_inst":"Nutritional Surveillance and Epidemiology Team (ESEN), French Public Health Agency, Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center,"},{"author_name":"Manon Egnell","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Leopold K Fezeu","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Pilar Galan","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Chantal Julia","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Emmanuelle Kesse-Guyot","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Paule Latino-Martel","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Jean-Michel Oppert","author_inst":"Department of Nutrition, Institute of Cardiometabolism and Nutrition, Sorbonne University, Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sandrine Peneau","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Verdot","author_inst":"Nutritional Surveillance and Epidemiology Team (ESEN), French Public Health Agency, Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center,"},{"author_name":"Serge Hercberg","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Mathilde Touvier","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Gordon Dougan","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Andrew Conway Morris","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.03.20121590","rel_title":"Deep Learning and Holt-Trend Algorithms for predicting COVID-19  pandemic","rel_date":"2020-06-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.03.20121590","rel_abs":"According to WHO, more than one million individuals are infected with COVID-19, and around 20000 people have died because of this infectious disease around the world. In addition, COVID-19 epidemic poses serious public health threat to the world where people with little or no pre-existing human immunity can be more vulnerable to the effects of the effects of the coronavirus. Thus, developing surveillance systems for predicting COVID-19 pandemic in an early stage saves millions of lives. In this study, the deep learning algorithm and Holt-trend model is proposed to predict coronavirus. The Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM ) algorithm and Holt-trend were applied to predict confirmed numbers and death cases. The real time data have been collected from the World Health Organization (WHO) . In the proposed research, we have considered three countries to test the proposed model namely Saudi Arabia, Spain and Italy. The results suggest that the LSTM models showed better performance in predicting the cases of coronavirus patients. Standard measure performance MSE, RMSE, Mean error and correlation are employed to estimate the results of the proposed models. The empirical results of the LSTM by using correlation metric are 99.94%, 99.94% and 99.91 to predict number of confirmed cases on COVID-19 in three countries. Regarding the prediction results of LSTM model to predict the number of death on COVID-19 are 99.86%, 98.876% and 99.16 with respect to the Saudi Arabia, Italy and Spain respectively. Similarly the experimented results of Holt-Trend to predict the number of confirmed cases on COVID-19 by using correlation metrics are 99.06%, 99.96% and 99.94, whereas the results of Holt-Trend to predict the number of death cases are 99.80%, 99.96 and 99.94 with respect to the Saudi Arabia, Italy and Spain respectively. The empirical results indicate the efficient performance of the presented model in predicting the number of confirmed and death cases of COVID-19 in these countries. Such findings provide better insights about the future of COVID-19 in general. The results were obtained by applying the time series models which needs to be considered for the sake of saving the lives of many people.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Theyazn H.H Aldhyani","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science and Information at king faisal University, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Melfi Alrasheed Sr.","author_inst":"Department of Quantitative Methods, School of Business, King Faisal University.

It has been declared as a \"Public Health Emergency of International Concern\" (PHEIC), by the World Health Organization (1). Several mathematical models, mostly based on compartmental modeling, are being used for projections for COVID-19 in India. These projections are being used for policy level decisions and public health prevention activities (2,3). Unlike compartmental models, which consider population averages, Agent Based Models (ABM) consider individual behavior in the models for disease projections. ABMs, provide better insights into projections compared to compartmental models (4). We present an ABM approach with a synthetic population from Rangareddy district, Telangana state, India, to examine the patterns and trends of the COVID-19 in terms of infected, admitted, critical cases requiring intensive care and\/ or ventilator support, mortality and recovery. The model is developed based on data pertaining to a local area, i.e. district, as this prove to be much helpful for policymaking compared to models estimating nation-wide disease projections. The parameters for the ABM model were defined and model run for a period of 365 days for three different non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) scenarios, namely; no lockdown, 50% lockdown and 75% lockdown scenarios. AnyLogic platform was used for the ABM simulations. Results revealed that the peak values and slope of the curve declined as NPI became more stringent. The results could provide a platform for researchers and modelers to explore using ABM approach for COVID-19 projections with inclusion of interventions and health system preparedness.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Narassima MS","author_inst":"Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham"},{"author_name":"Guru Rajesh Jammy","author_inst":"Society for Health, Allied Research and Education (SHARE-INDIA), Telangana, India."},{"author_name":"Rashmi Pant","author_inst":"Society for Health Allied Research and Education (SHARE-INDIA)"},{"author_name":"Lincoln Choudhury","author_inst":"Krashapana Consultancy Private limited, New Delhi, India."},{"author_name":"Aadharsh R","author_inst":"Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham"},{"author_name":"Vijay Yeldandi","author_inst":"Society for Health, Allied Research and Education (SHARE-INDIA), Telangana, India."},{"author_name":"Anbuudayasankar SP","author_inst":"Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham"},{"author_name":"Rangasami P","author_inst":"Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham"},{"author_name":"Denny John","author_inst":"Department of Public Health, Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Kochi, Kerala, India"},{"author_name":"Manon Egnell","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Leopold K Fezeu","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Pilar Galan","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Chantal Julia","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Emmanuelle Kesse-Guyot","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Paule Latino-Martel","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Jean-Michel Oppert","author_inst":"Department of Nutrition, Institute of Cardiometabolism and Nutrition, Sorbonne University, Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sandrine Peneau","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Verdot","author_inst":"Nutritional Surveillance and Epidemiology Team (ESEN), French Public Health Agency, Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center,"},{"author_name":"Serge Hercberg","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Mathilde Touvier","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Gordon Dougan","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Andrew Conway Morris","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.04.20122028","rel_title":"Geographical Variation in COVID-19 Cases, Prevalence, Recovery and Fatality Rate by Phase of National Lockdown in India, March 14-May 29, 2020","rel_date":"2020-06-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.04.20122028","rel_abs":"Background: Since the COVID-19 pandemic hit Indian states at varying speed, it is crucial to investigate the geographical pattern in COVID-19. We analyzed the geographical pattern of COVID-19 prevalence and mortality by the phase of national lockdown in India. Method: Using publicly available compiled data on COVID-19, we estimated the trends in new cases, period-prevalence rate (PPR), case recovery rate (CRR), and case fatality ratio (CFR) at national, state and district level. Findings: The age and sex are missing for more than 60 percent of the COVID-19 patients. There is an exponential increase in COVID-19 cases both at national and sub-national levels. The COVID-19 infected has jumped about 235 times ( from 567 cases in the pre-lockdown period to 1,33,669 in the fourth lockdown); the average daily new cases have increased from 57 in the first lockdown to 6,482 in the fourth lockdown; the average daily recovered persons from 4 to 3,819; the average daily death from 1 to 163. From first to the third lockdown, PPR (0.04 to 5.94), CRR (7.05 to 30.35) and CFR (1.76 to 1.89) have consistently escalated. At state-level, the maximum number of COVID-19 cases is found in the states of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, and Gujarat contributing 66.75 percent of total cases. Whereas no cases found in some states, Kerela is the only state flattening the COVID-19 curve. The PPR is found to be highest in Delhi, followed by Maharastra. The highest recovery rate is observed in Kerala, till second lockdown; and in Andhra Pradesh in third lockdown. The highest case fatality ratio in the fourth lockdown is observed in Gujarat and Telangana. A few districts viz. like Mumbai (96.7); Chennai (63.66) and Ahmedabad (62.04) have the highest infection rate per 100 thousand population. Spatial analysis shows that clusters in Konkan coast especially in Maharashtra (Palghar, Mumbai, Thane and Pune); southern part from Tamil Nadu (Chennai, Chengalpattu and Thiruvallur), and the northern part of Jammu & Kashmir (Anantnag, Kulgam) are hot-spots for COVID-19 infection while central, northern and north-eastern regions of India are the cold-spots. Conclusion: India has been experiencing a rapid increase of COVID-19 cases since the second lockdown phase. There is huge geographical variation in COVID-19 pandemic with a concentration in some major cities and states while disaggregated data at local levels allows understanding the geographical disparity of the pandemic, the lack of age-sex information of the COVID-19 patients forbids to investigate the individual pattern of COVID-19 burden.

Although evidence suggests that children generally display mild symptoms, the size of the school-age population means the total impact of reopening schools is unclear. Here, we present work from mid-May that focused on the imminent opening of schools and consider what these results imply for future policy. We compared eight strategies for reopening primary and secondary schools in England. Modifying a transmission model fitted to UK SARS-CoV-2 data, we assessed how reopening schools affects contact patterns, anticipated secondary infections and the relative change in the reproductive number, R. We determined the associated public health impact and its sensitivity to changes in social-distancing within the wider community. We predicted reopening schools with half-sized classes or focused on younger children was unlikely to push R above one. Older children generally have more social contacts, so reopening secondary schools results in more cases than reopening primary schools, while reopening both could have pushed R above one in some regions. Reductions in community social-distancing were found to outweigh and exacerbate any impacts of reopening. In particular, opening schools when the reproductive number R is already above one generates the largest increase in cases. Our work indicates that while any school reopening will result in increased mixing and infection amongst children and the wider population, reopening schools alone in June was unlikely to push R above one. Ultimately, reopening decisions are a difficult trade-off between epidemiological consequences and the emotional, educational and developmental needs of children.

The data was obtained using publicly available information from the official website of Vietnam Ministry of Health covering a period of 01\/23\/2020 to 05\/27\/2020. T-test, Chi-square test and Fishers Exact test were utilized to compare characteristics of COVID-19 patients between under-treatment and discharge groups and between overseas and non-overseas travel groups. Results. Vietnam had a total of 327 cases of COVID-19 as of May 27, 2020. The median age of patients was 30 years (ranging from 3 months to 88 years). About 68% of patients (n=223) had acquired the disease outside the country while 32% were infected within the country. Among those infected inside the country, 66% were women. Men were more likely than women to be infected from overseas (p<0.001). Younger patients were significantly associated with international travel (p=.001). While patients in the South reported highest levels of overseas travel history (77.9%), those (100%) in the Central reporting the highest level of being discharged (p<0.001). Women (54.7%) had a higher rate of discharge compared to men (45.3%) [p<0.001]. Nearly 86% have recovered and discharged from hospitals. There has been no reported fatality. Conclusion. A majority of COVID-19 cases in Vietnam were acquired from abroad. A significantly higher number of women than men were infected inside the country calling for further research about gender disparities in the fight against COVID-19 in Vietnam.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Toan H Ha","author_inst":"University of Connecticut School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Gualberto Ruano","author_inst":"University of Connecticut Health, Connecticut Convergence Institute for Translation in Regenerative Engineering"},{"author_name":"Judy Lewis","author_inst":"University of Connecticut School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bridget Penman","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Emma Southall","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Glen Guyver-Fletcher","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Alex Holmes","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Hector McKimm","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Erin E Gorsich","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Edward M Hill","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Louise Dyson","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Pilar Galan","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Chantal Julia","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Emmanuelle Kesse-Guyot","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Paule Latino-Martel","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Jean-Michel Oppert","author_inst":"Department of Nutrition, Institute of Cardiometabolism and Nutrition, Sorbonne University, Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sandrine Peneau","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Verdot","author_inst":"Nutritional Surveillance and Epidemiology Team (ESEN), French Public Health Agency, Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center,"},{"author_name":"Serge Hercberg","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Mathilde Touvier","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Gordon Dougan","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Andrew Conway Morris","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.03.20121517","rel_title":"A modified SEIR meta-population transmission based Modeling and Forecasting of the COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan","rel_date":"2020-06-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.03.20121517","rel_abs":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started from China at the end of 2019, has now spread across the globe. Modeling and simulation of the - outspread is significant for timely and effective measures to be taken. Scientists around the world are using various epidemiological models to help policymakers to plan and determine what interventions and resources will be needed in case of a surge and to estimate the potential future burden on health care system. Pakistan is also among the affected countries with 18th highest number of total detected number of cases, as of 3rd of June, 2020. A modified time-dependent Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) metapopulation transmission model is used in the Global Epidemic and Mobility Model (GLEaM) for this simulation. The simulation assumes the index case in Wuhan, China and models the global spread of SARS- COV-2 with reasonable results for several countries within the 95% confidence interval. This model was then tuned with parameters for Pakistan to predict the outspread of COVID-19 in Pakistan. The impact of Non-Drug Interventions on flattening the curve are also incorporated in the simulation and the results are further extended to find the peak of the pandemic and future predictions. It has been observed that in the current scenario, the epidemic trend of COVID-19 spread in Pakistan would attain a peak in the second decade of month of June with approximately (3600-4200) daily cases. The current wave of SARS-COV-2 in Pakistan with is estimated to cause some (210,000 - 226,000) cumulative cases and (4400 - 4750) cumulative lost lives by the end of August when the epidemic is reduced by 99%. However, the disease is controllable in the likely future if inclusive and strict control measures are taken.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sohaib Hassan","author_inst":"PINSTECH"},{"author_name":"Bilal Javed Mughal","author_inst":"PINSTECH"},{"author_name":"Marian Siwiak","author_inst":"Data 3.0 Ltd"},{"author_name":"Zafar Yasin","author_inst":"PINSTECH"},{"author_name":"Emma Southall","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Glen Guyver-Fletcher","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Alex Holmes","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Hector McKimm","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Erin E Gorsich","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Edward M Hill","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Louise Dyson","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Pilar Galan","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Chantal Julia","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Emmanuelle Kesse-Guyot","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Paule Latino-Martel","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Jean-Michel Oppert","author_inst":"Department of Nutrition, Institute of Cardiometabolism and Nutrition, Sorbonne University, Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sandrine Peneau","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Verdot","author_inst":"Nutritional Surveillance and Epidemiology Team (ESEN), French Public Health Agency, Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center,"},{"author_name":"Serge Hercberg","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Mathilde Touvier","author_inst":"Sorbonne Paris Nord University, Inserm, Inrae, Cnam, Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team (EREN), Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center, University of P"},{"author_name":"Gordon Dougan","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Andrew Conway Morris","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.03.20121574","rel_title":"Predicting individual risk for COVID19 complications using EMR data","rel_date":"2020-06-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.03.20121574","rel_abs":"Background: The global pandemic of COVID-19 has challenged healthcare organizations and caused numerous deaths and hospitalizations worldwide. The need for data-based decision support tools for many aspects of controlling and treating the disease is evident but has been hampered by the scarcity of real-world reliable data. Here we describe two approaches: a. the use of an existing EMR-based model for predicting complications due to influenza combined with available epidemiological data to create a model that identifies individuals at high risk to develop complications due to COVID-19 and b. a preliminary model that is trained using existing real world COVID-19 data. Methods: We have utilized the computerized data of Maccabi Healthcare Services a 2.3 million member state-mandated health organization in Israel. The age and sex matched matrix used for training the XGBoost ILI-based model included, circa 690,000 rows and 900 features. The available dataset for COVID-based model included a total 2137 SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals who were either not hospitalized (n=1658), or hospitalized and marked as mild (n=332), or as having moderate (n=83) or severe (n=64) complications. Findings: The AUC of our models and the priors on the 2137 COVID-19 patients for predicting moderate and severe complications as cases and all other as controls, the AUC for the ILI-based model was 0.852[0.824-0.879] for the COVID19-based model - 0.872[0.847-0.879].. Interpretation: These models can effectively identify patients at high-risk for complication, thus allowing optimization of resources and more focused follow up and early triage these patients if once symptoms worsen.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yaron Kinar","author_inst":"Medial EarlySign, Hod Hasharon, Israel"},{"author_name":"Alon Lanyado","author_inst":"Medial EarlySign, Hod Hasharon, Israel"},{"author_name":"Avi Shoshan","author_inst":"Medial EarlySign, Hod Hasharon, Israel"},{"author_name":"Rachel Yesharim","author_inst":"Medial EarlySign, Hod Hasharon, Israel"},{"author_name":"Tamar Domany","author_inst":"Medial EarlySign, Hod Hasharon, Israel"},{"author_name":"Varda Shalev","author_inst":"KSM Kahn - Sagol -.

The impact of these measures has been inconsistent, with some regions rapidly nearing disease elimination and others seeing delayed peaks or nearly flat epidemic curves. Here we build a stochastic epidemic model to examine the effects of COVID-19 clinical progression and transmission network structure on the outcomes of social distancing interventions. We find that the strength of within-household transmission is a critical determinant of success, governing the timing and size of the epidemic peak, the rate of decline, individual risks of infection, and the success of partial relaxation measures. The structure of residual external connections, driven by workforce participation and essential businesses, interacts to determine outcomes. These findings can improve future predictions of the timescale and efficacy of interventions needed to control similar outbreaks, and highlight the need for better quantification and control of household transmission.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anjalika Nande","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Ben Adlam","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Justin Sheen","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Michael Z Levy","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Alison L Hill","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Varda Shalev","author_inst":"KSM Kahn - Sagol -.

To determine this, we used the existing polio environment surveillance network in Pakistan to investigate presence of SARs-CoV-2 using three commercially available kits and E-Gene detection published assay for surety and confirmatory of positivity. A Two-phase separation method is used for sample clarification and concentration. Before proceeding directly for RNA extraction, an additional high-speed centrifugation (14000Xg for 30 min) step was introduced to increase viral RNA yield resulting decrease in Cq value. A total of 78 wastewater samples collected from 38 districts across Pakistan, 74 wastewater samples from existing polio environment surveillance sites, 3 from drains of COVID-19 infected areas and 1 from COVID 19 quarantine center drainage, were tested for presence of SARs-CoV-2. 21 wastewater samples (27%) from 13 districts turned to be positive on RT-qPCR. SARs-COV-2 RNA positive samples from areas with COVID patients and COVID 19 patient quarantine center drainage strengthen the findings and use of wastewater surveillance in future. Furthermore, sequence data of partial ORF 1a generated from COVID 19 patient quarantine center drainage sample also reinforce our findings that SARs-CoV-2 can be detected in wastewater. This study finding indicates that SARs-CoV-2 detection through wastewater surveillance has an epidemiologic potential that can be used as early warning system to monitor viral tracking and circulation in cities with lower COVID-19 disease burden or heavily populated areas where door-to-door tracing may not be possible. However, attention needed on virus concentration and detection assay to increase the sensitivity. Development of highly sensitive assay will be an indicator for virus monitoring and to provide early warning signs.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Salmaan Sharif Sr.","author_inst":"National Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Aamer Ikram Sr.","author_inst":"National Institute of Health, Islamabad, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Adnan Khurshid Sr.","author_inst":"National Institute of Health, Islamabad, Paksitan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Salman Sr.","author_inst":"National Institute of Health, Islamabad, Pakistan."},{"author_name":"Nayab Mehmood Sr.","author_inst":"National Institute of Health, Islamabad, Pakistan."},{"author_name":"Yasir Arshad Sr.","author_inst":"National Institute of Health, Islamabad, Pakistan."},{"author_name":"Jamal Ahmad Sr.","author_inst":"World Health Organization"},{"author_name":"Mehar Angez Sr.","author_inst":"National Institute of Health, Islamabad, Pakistan."},{"author_name":"Muhammad Masroor Alam Sr.","author_inst":"National Institute of Health, Islamabad, Pakistan."},{"author_name":"Lubna Rehman Sr.","author_inst":"National Institute of Health, Islamabad, Pakistan."},{"author_name":"Ghulam Mujtaba","author_inst":"National Institute of Health, Islamabad, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Jaffar Hussain Sr.","author_inst":"National Institute of Health, Islamabad, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Johar Ali Sr.","author_inst":"National Institute of Health, Islamabad, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"RIbqa Akthar Sr.","author_inst":"National Institute of Health Islamabad, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Wasif Malik Sr.","author_inst":"National Institute of Health, Islamabad, Paksitan."},{"author_name":"Zeeshan Iqbal Baig Sr.","author_inst":"National Institute of Health, Islamabad, Pakistan."},{"author_name":"Muhammad Suleman Rana Sr.","author_inst":"National Institute of Health, Islamabad, Pakistan."},{"author_name":"Muhammad Usman Sr.","author_inst":"National Institute of Health, Islamabad, Pakistan."},{"author_name":"Muhammad Qasir Ali Sr.","author_inst":"National Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Abdul Ahad Sr.","author_inst":"National Institute of Health, Islamabad, Pakistan."},{"author_name":"Nazish Badar Sr.","author_inst":"National Institute of Health, Islamabad, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Massab Umair Sr.","author_inst":"National Institute of Health, Islamabad, Pakistan."},{"author_name":"Sana Tamim Sr.","author_inst":"National Institute of Health, Islamabad, Pakistan."},{"author_name":"Asiya Ashraf","author_inst":"National Institute of Health, Islamabad, Pakistan."},{"author_name":"Faheem Tahir Sr.","author_inst":"National Institute of Health, Islamabad, Pakistan."},{"author_name":"Nida Ali Sr.","author_inst":"World Health Organization"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.03.20121392","rel_title":"Modulation of COVID-19 Epidemiology by UV-B and -A Photons from the Sun","rel_date":"2020-06-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.03.20121392","rel_abs":"It is well known that 200-290 nm ultraviolet photons (hereinafter UV-C radiation) photo-chemically interacts with DNA and RNA and are endowed with germicidal properties that are also effective on viruses. Fortunately, Solar UV-C photons of this wavelength are filtered out by the Ozone layer of the upper Atmosphere, at around 35 km. Softer UV photons from the Sun with wavelengths in the range 290-320 nm (UV-B) and 320-400 nm (UV-A), however, do reach the Earth s surface. The effect of these photons on Single- and Double-Stranded RNA\/DNA viruses and the possible role they play on the seasonality of epidemics, are nevertheless little studied and highly debated in alternative or complementarity to other environmental causes. Notably though, the effects of both direct and indirect radiation from the Sun needs to be considered in order to completely explain the effects of UV radiations in life processes (with e.g. the UV virucidal effect enhanced in combination to the concomitant process of water droplets depletion because of Solar heat). Herein we present a number of concurring circumstantial evidence suggesting that the evolution and strength of the recent Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-Cov-2) pandemics, might be have been modulated by the intensity of UV-B and UV-A Solar radiation hitting different regions of Earth during the diffusion of the outbreak between January and July 2020. Out findings, if confirmed by more in depth data analysis and modeling of the epidemics, which includes Solar modulation, could help in designing the social behaviors to be adopted depending on season and environmental conditions.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fabrizio Nicastro","author_inst":"INAF - Italian National Institute for Astrophysics"},{"author_name":"Giorgia Sironi","author_inst":"INAF - Italian National Institute for Astrophysics"},{"author_name":"Elio Antonello","author_inst":"INAF - Italian National Institute for Astrophysics"},{"author_name":"Andrea Bianco","author_inst":"INAF - Italian National Institute for Astrophysics"},{"author_name":"Mara Biasin","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences L.
