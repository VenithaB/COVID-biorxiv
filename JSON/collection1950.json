We analyze the effect of climatic parameters (Average Temperature (AT), Atmospheric Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH), Solar Radiation (SR) and Wind Speed (WS)) on the COVID-19 epidemic during 25 March 2020 to 15 June 2020 in most affected states of India i.e. Maharashtra, Delhi and Tamilnadu. We quantitatively establish the correlation between these parameters by using Kendall & Spearman rank correlation test. The results indicate that the positive cases are highly correlated with the AT (r^2 >0.6,p<0.001) in Delhi where as a moderate correlation ( r^2<0.6,p<0.001) has been estimated for Maharashtra and Tamilnadu. Similarly, an intermediate range of correlation coefficient has been observed for other climatic parameters. The range of climatic parameters have been found corresponding to maximum number of cases results as AT (25~40 0 C), RH (40~70%), AT (740~965 mmHg), SR (200-250 W\/mt2) and WS (.5~14 m\/sec). Time series analysis depicts that the positive cases and mortality are increasing rapidly. COVID-19 epidemic peak is predicted and would be appearing October 2020 using SIR model for capital of India (New Delhi). The outcomes of this study will be helpful for the containment of COVID-19 worldwide.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Namrata Deyal","author_inst":"Department of Physics, KU, SSJ campus Almora (263601), Uttarakhand (India)"},{"author_name":"Vipin Tiwari","author_inst":"Department of Physics, KU, SSJ campus Almora (263601), Uttarakhand (India)"},{"author_name":"Nandan Bisht","author_inst":"Department of Physics, KU, SSJ campus Almora (263601), Uttarakhand (India)"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.26.20158550","rel_title":"Association of olfactory dysfunction with hospitalization for COVID-19: a multicenter study in Kurdistan","rel_date":"2020-07-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.26.20158550","rel_abs":"Objective: To evaluate the association of olfactory dysfunction (OD) with hospitalization for COVID-19. Study Design: Multi-center cohort study. Setting: Emergency departments of thirteen COVID-19-designed hospitals in Kurdistan province, Iran. Subjects and Methods: Patients presenting with flu-like symptoms who tested positive by RT-PCR for COVID-19 between May 1st and 31st, 2020. At the time of presentation and enrollment, patients were asked about the presence of OD, fever, cough, shortness of breath, headache, rhinorrhea and sore throat. The severity of OD was assessed on an 11-point scale from 0 (none) to 10 (anosmia). Patients were either hospitalized or sent home for outpatient care based on standardized criteria. Results: Of 203 patients, who presented at a mean of 6 days into the COVID-19 disease course, 25 patients (12.3%) had new OD and 138 patients (68.0%) were admitted for their COVID-19. Patients admitted for COVID-19 had a higher prevalence of all symptoms assessed, including OD (p<0.05 in all cases), and OD identified admitted patients with 84.0% sensitivity and 34.3% specificity. On univariate logistic regression, hospitalization was associated with OD (odds ratio [OR] = 2.47, 95%CI: 1.085-6.911, p=0.049). However, hospitalization for COVID-19 was not associated with OD (OR=3.22, 95% CI: 0.57-18.31, p=0.188) after controlling for confounding demographics and comorbidities. Conclusion: OD may be associated with hospitalization for (and therefore more severe) COVID-19. However, this association between OD and COVID-19 severity is more likely driven by patient characteristics linked to OD, such as greater numbers of COVID-19 symptoms experienced or high-risk comorbidities.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hosna Zobairy","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology, Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Sanandaj, Iran."},{"author_name":"Erfan Shamsoddin","author_inst":"National Institute for Medical Research Development (NIMAD), Tehran, Iran."},{"author_name":"Mohammad Aziz Rasouli","author_inst":"Clinical Research Development Center, Kowsar Hospital, Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Sanandaj, Iran."},{"author_name":"Nasrollah Veisi Khodlan","author_inst":"Prevention and Control of Communicable Diseases Management Group, Vice-Chancellor of Health Affairs, Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Sanandaj, Iran."},{"author_name":"Ghobad Moradi","author_inst":"Social Determinants of Health Research Center, Research Institute for Health Development, Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Sanandaj, Iran."},{"author_name":"Bushra Zareie","author_inst":"Clinical Research Development Center, Kowsar Hospital, Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Sanandaj, Iran."},{"author_name":"Sara Teymori","author_inst":"Clinical Research Development Center, Tohid Hospital, Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Sanandaj, Iran."},{"author_name":"Jalal Asadi","author_inst":"Student Research Committee, Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Sanandaj, Iran."},{"author_name":"Ahmad Sofi-Mahmudi","author_inst":"Cochrane Iran Associate Centre, National Institute for Medical Research Development (NIMAD), Tehran, Iran."},{"author_name":"Ahmad R.

Amongst the 69 patients with severe COVID-19 that have been discharged from the intensive care units in our hospital, we have seen 11 individuals (16%) with such neuropathies. In many instances, the multi-focal nature of the weakness in these patients was initially unrecognised as symptoms were wrongly assumed to simply relate to \"critical illness neuropathy\".

Even though a few candidate drugs, such as remdesivir (a broad antiviral prodrug) and hydroxychloroquine, have been investigated in human clinical trials, their therapeutic efficacy needs to be clarified further to be used to treat COVID-19 patients. Here we show that pyronaridine and artesunate, which are the chemical components of anti-malarial drug Pyramax(R), exhibit antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses. In human lung epithelial (Calu-3) cells, pyronaridine and artesunate were highly effective against SARS-CoV-2 while hydroxychloroquine did not show any effect at concentrations of less than 100 M. In viral growth kinetics, both pyronaridine and artesunate inhibited the growth of SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal influenza A virus in Calu-3 cells. Taken together, we suggest that artesunate and pyronaridine might be effective drug candidates for use in human patients with COVID-19 and\/or influenza, which may co-circulate during this coming winter season.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joon-Yong Bae","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Korea University College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Gee Eun Lee","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Korea University College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Heedo Park","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Korea University College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Juyoung Cho","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Korea University College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yung-Eui Kim","author_inst":"Korea National Institute of Health, Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Joo-Yeon Lee","author_inst":"Korea National Institute of Health, Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chung Ju","author_inst":"Shin Poong Pharmaceutical"},{"author_name":"Won-Ki Kim","author_inst":"Department of Neuroscience, Korea University College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jin Il Kim","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Korea University College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Man-Seong Park","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Korea University College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Thien-Kim Le","author_inst":"Affinity Biosciences Pty.

Inhibition of this vital proteolytic process is effective in preventing the virus from replication in infected cells and therefore provides a potential COVID-19 treatment option. Guided by previous medicinal chemistry studies about SARS-CoV-1 main protease (SC1MPro), we have designed and synthesized a series of SC2MPro inhibitors that contain {beta}-(S-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl)-alaninal (Opal) for the formation of a reversible covalent bond with the SC2MPro active site cysteine C145. All inhibitors display high potency with IC50 values at or below 100 nM. The most potent compound MPI3 has as an IC50 value as 8.5 nM. Crystallographic analyses of SC2MPro bound to 7 inhibitors indicated both formation of a covalent bond with C145 and structural rearrangement from the apoenzyme to accommodate the inhibitors. Virus inhibition assays revealed that several inhibitors have high potency in inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathogenic effect in both Vero E6 and A549 cells. Two inhibitors MP5 and MPI8 completely prevented the SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathogenic effect in Vero E6 cells at 2.5-5 M and A549 cells at 0.16-0.31 M. Their virus inhibition potency is much higher than some existing molecules that are under preclinical and clinical investigations for the treatment of COVID-19. Our study indicates that there is a large chemical space that needs to be explored for the development of SC2MPro inhibitors with extreme potency. Due to the urgent matter of the COVID-19 pandemic, MPI5 and MPI8 may be quickly advanced to preclinical and clinical tests for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wenshe Ray Liu","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Kai S Yang","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Xinyu R.

Attachment and entry of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by the spike glycoprotein (SGP). Recently, a SARS-CoV-2 Spike Pseudotyped Lentivirus (SSPL) was developed that allows studying spike-mediated cell entry via luciferase reporter activity in a BSL2 environment. Here, we show that iota-carrageenan can inhibit the cell entry of SSPL in a dose dependent manner. SSPL particles were efficiently neutralized with an IC50 value of 2.6 {micro}g\/ml iota-carrageenan. In vitro data on iota-carrageenan against various Rhino- and Coronaviruses showed similar IC50 values and translated readily into clinical effectiveness when a nasal spray containing iota-carrageenan demonstrated a reduction in severity and duration of symptoms of common cold caused by various respiratory viruses. Accordingly, our in vitro data on SSPL suggest that administration of iota-carrageenan may be an effective and safe prophylaxis or treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infections.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Martina Morokutti-Kurz","author_inst":"Marinomed Biotech AG"},{"author_name":"Philipp Graf","author_inst":"Marinomed Biotech AG"},{"author_name":"Andreas Grassauer","author_inst":"Marinomed Biotech AG"},{"author_name":"Eva Prieschl-Grassauer","author_inst":"Marinomed Biotech AG"},{"author_name":"Yugenda R.

Here we investigated the susceptibility of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived monolayer brain cells and region-specific brain organoids to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found modest numbers of infected neurons and astrocytes, but greater infection of choroid plexus epithelial cells. We optimized a protocol to generate choroid plexus organoids from hiPSCs, which revealed productive SARS-CoV-2 infection that leads to increased cell death and transcriptional dysregulation indicative of an inflammatory response and cellular function deficits. Together, our results provide evidence for SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism and support use of hiPSC-derived brain organoids as a platform to investigate the cellular susceptibility, disease mechanisms, and treatment strategies for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fadi Jacob","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sarshan Pather","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Wei-Kai Huang","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Samuel Zheng Hao Wong","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Haowen Zhou","author_inst":"Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute"},{"author_name":"Feng Zhang","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Beatrice Cubitt","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Catherine Z Chen","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Miao Xu","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Manisha Pradhan","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Daniel Y Zhang","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Wei Zheng","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Anne G Bang","author_inst":"Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute"},{"author_name":"Hongjun Song","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Juan Carlos de la Torre","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Guo-li Ming","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Jin Liu","author_inst":"University of North Texas System College of Pharmacy"},{"author_name":"Pingwei Li","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Carol A.

Functional analysis of MRV and PEDV DEGs showed that MRV increased the expression level of several cytokines and chemokines (e.g. IL6, CXCL10, IL1A, CXCL8 [alias IL8]) and antiviral genes (e.g. IFI44, IFIT1, MX1, OASL), whereas for PEDV no enhanced expression was observed for these \"hallmark\" antiviral and immune effector genes. Pathway and Gene Ontology \"enrichment analysis\" revealed that PEDV infection did not stimulate expression of genes able to activate an acquired immune response, whereas MRV did so within 6h. Instead, PEDV down-regulated the expression of a set of zinc finger proteins with putative antiviral activity and enhanced the expression of the transmembrane serine protease gene TMPRSS13 (alias MSPL) to support its own infection by virus-cell membrane fusion (Shi et al, 2017, Viruses, 9(5):114). PEDV also down-regulated expression of Ectodysplasin A, a cytokine of the TNF-family able to activate the canonical NFKB-pathway responsible for transcription of inflammatory genes like IL1B, TNF, CXCL8 and PTGS2. The only 2 cytokine genes found up-regulated by PEDV were Cardiotrophin-1, an IL6-type cytokine with pleiotropic functions on different tissues and types of cells, and Endothelin 2, a neuroactive peptide with vasoconstrictive properties. Furthermore, by comprehensive datamining in biological and chemical databases and consulting related literature we identified sets of PEDV-response genes with potential to influence i) the metabolism of biogenic amines (e.g. histamine), ii) the formation of cilia and \"synaptic clefts\" between cells, iii) epithelial mucus production, iv) platelets activation, and v) physiological processes in the body regulated by androgenic hormones (like blood pressure, salt\/water balance and energy homeostasis). The information in this study describing a \"very early\" response of epithelial cells to an infection with a coronavirus may provide pharmacologists, immunological and medical specialists additional insights in the underlying mechanisms of coronavirus associated severe clinical symptoms including those induced by SARS-CoV-2. This may help them to fine-tune therapeutic treatments and apply specific approved drugs to treat COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wei Hou","author_inst":"College of Veterinary Medicine, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China"},{"author_name":"Fei Liu","author_inst":"College of Veterinary Medicine, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China"},{"author_name":"Wim H.M. van der Poel","author_inst":"Wageningen Bioveterinary Research, Lelystad, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Marcel M Hulst","author_inst":"Wageningen Bioveterinary Research"},{"author_name":"Jongchan Choi","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Cheng Dai","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Valentin Voillet","author_inst":"Cape Town HVTN Immunology Laboratory, Hutchinson Centre Research Institute of South Africa, NPC (HCRISA); Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchins"},{"author_name":"Kelsey Scherler","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Pamela Troisch","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Venkata R Duvvuri","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Priyanka Baloni","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Guangrong Qin","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Brett Smith","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Sergey Kornilov","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Clifford Rostomily","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Alex Xu","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"Institute for Immunity, Transplantation and Infection, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford"},{"author_name":"Shen Dong","author_inst":"Diabetes Center, University of California, San Francisco."},{"author_name":"Jing Zhou","author_inst":"Isoplexis Corporation"},{"author_name":"Kim Murray","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Rick Edmark","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Sunga Hong","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Lesley Jones","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhou","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Ryan Roper","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Sean Mackay","author_inst":"Isoplexis Corporation"},{"author_name":"Christopher R Dale","author_inst":"Swedish Center for Research and Innovation, Swedish Medical Center; Providence St. Joseph Health."},{"author_name":"Julie A Wallick","author_inst":"Swedish Center for Research and Innovation, Swedish Medical Center; Providence St. Joseph Health."},{"author_name":"Heather A Algren","author_inst":"Swedish Center for Research and Innovation, Swedish Medical Center; Providence St. Joseph Health."},{"author_name":"Zager A Michael","author_inst":"Center for Data Visualization, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center,"},{"author_name":"Andrew Magis","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Wei Wei","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Nathan D Price","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Sui Huang","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Naeha Subramanian","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Kai Wang","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Hadlock","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Leroy Hood","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey A.

Results reveal the existence of non-synonymous G614 spike protein mutation in 61.45% of the total study genome along with three other mutations. Further, temporal variation in the frequencies of G614 genotype in the country is observed. The examination of the probable association of G614 genotype with COVID-19 severity shows that CFR G614 genotype in India is positively and strongly correlated. It appears that the clinical outcome of the COVID-19 cases in India are significantly and adversely affected by the increasing trend in the G614 genotype; which needs to be addressed combining both laboratory experiments and epidemiological investigations.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ballamoole Krishna Kumar","author_inst":"Nitte (Deemed to be University), Nitte University Centre for Science Education & Research, Mangaluru, Karnataka"},{"author_name":"Bakilapadavu Venkatraja","author_inst":"Department of Economics, Shri Dharmasthala Manjunatheshwara Institute for Management Development (SDMIMD), Mysuru, Karnataka"},{"author_name":"Kattapuni Suresh Prithvisagar","author_inst":"Nitte (Deemed to be University), Nitte University Centre for Science Education and Research, (NUCSER), Mangaluru, Karnataka"},{"author_name":"Praveen Rai","author_inst":"Nitte (Deemed to be University), Nitte University Centre for Science Education and Research, (NUCSER)"},{"author_name":"Anusha Rohit","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, The Madras Medical Mission, Chennai, Tamil Nadu"},{"author_name":"Madhura Nagesh Hegde","author_inst":"Department of Information Science and Engineering, Sahyadri College of Engineering and Management, Mangaluru, Karnataka"},{"author_name":"Indrani Karunasagar","author_inst":"Nitte (Deemed to be University), Nitte University Centre for Science Education and Research, (NUCSER), Mangaluru, India"},{"author_name":"Iddya Karunasagar","author_inst":"Nitte (Deemed to be University), Mangaluru, Karnataka"},{"author_name":"Pamela Troisch","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Venkata R Duvvuri","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Priyanka Baloni","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Guangrong Qin","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Brett Smith","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Sergey Kornilov","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Clifford Rostomily","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Alex Xu","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"Institute for Immunity, Transplantation and Infection, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford"},{"author_name":"Shen Dong","author_inst":"Diabetes Center, University of California, San Francisco."},{"author_name":"Jing Zhou","author_inst":"Isoplexis Corporation"},{"author_name":"Kim Murray","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Rick Edmark","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Sunga Hong","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Lesley Jones","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhou","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Ryan Roper","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Sean Mackay","author_inst":"Isoplexis Corporation"},{"author_name":"Christopher R Dale","author_inst":"Swedish Center for Research and Innovation, Swedish Medical Center; Providence St. Joseph Health."},{"author_name":"Julie A Wallick","author_inst":"Swedish Center for Research and Innovation, Swedish Medical Center; Providence St. Joseph Health."},{"author_name":"Heather A Algren","author_inst":"Swedish Center for Research and Innovation, Swedish Medical Center; Providence St. Joseph Health."},{"author_name":"Zager A Michael","author_inst":"Center for Data Visualization, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center,"},{"author_name":"Andrew Magis","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Wei Wei","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Nathan D Price","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Sui Huang","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Naeha Subramanian","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Kai Wang","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Hadlock","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Leroy Hood","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey A.

We perform an exploratory study to understand the variability of the whole coding region of possible proximal evolutionary neighbours of SARSCoV-2. We consider seven (07) human coronavirus strains from six different species as a candidate for our study.\n\nFirst, we observe a good variability of nucleotides across candidate strains. We did not find a significant variation of GC content across the strains for codon position first and second. However, we interestingly see huge variability of GC-content in codon position 3rd (GC3), and pairwise mean GC-content (SARSCoV, MERSCoV), and (SARSCoV-2, hCoV229E) are quite closer. While observing the relative abundance of dinucleotide feature, we find a shared typical genetic pattern, i.e., high usage of GC and CT nucleotide pair at the first two positions (P12) of codons and the last two positions (P23) of codons, respectively. We also observe a low abundance of CG pair that might help in their evolution bio-process. Secondly, Considering RSCU score, we find a substantial similarity for mild class coronaviruses, i.e., hCoVOC43, hCoVHKU1, and hCoVNL63 based on their codon hit with high RSCU value ([&ge;] 1.5), and minim number of codons hit (count-9) is observed for MERSCoV. We see seven codons ATT, ACT, TCT, CCT, GTT, GCT and GGT with high RSCU value, which are common in all seven strains. These codons are mostly from Aliphatic and Hydroxyl amino acid group. A phylogenetic tree built using RSCU feature reveals proximity among hCoVOC43 and hCoV229E (mild). Thirdly, we perform linear regression analysis among GC content in different codon position and ENC value. We observe a strong correlation (significant p-value) between GC2 and GC3 for SARSCoV-2, hCoV229E and hCoVNL63, and between GC1 and GC3 for hCoV229E, hCoVNL63, SARSCoV. We believe that our findings will help in understanding the mechanism of human coronavirus.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jayanta Das","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University, MD-21205, USA"},{"author_name":"Swarup Roy","author_inst":"Sikkim University"},{"author_name":"Kattapuni Suresh Prithvisagar","author_inst":"Nitte (Deemed to be University), Nitte University Centre for Science Education and Research, (NUCSER), Mangaluru, Karnataka"},{"author_name":"Praveen Rai","author_inst":"Nitte (Deemed to be University), Nitte University Centre for Science Education and Research, (NUCSER)"},{"author_name":"Anusha Rohit","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, The Madras Medical Mission, Chennai, Tamil Nadu"},{"author_name":"Madhura Nagesh Hegde","author_inst":"Department of Information Science and Engineering, Sahyadri College of Engineering and Management, Mangaluru, Karnataka"},{"author_name":"Indrani Karunasagar","author_inst":"Nitte (Deemed to be University), Nitte University Centre for Science Education and Research, (NUCSER), Mangaluru, India"},{"author_name":"Iddya Karunasagar","author_inst":"Nitte (Deemed to be University), Mangaluru, Karnataka"},{"author_name":"Pamela Troisch","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Venkata R Duvvuri","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Priyanka Baloni","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Guangrong Qin","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Brett Smith","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Sergey Kornilov","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Clifford Rostomily","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Alex Xu","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"Institute for Immunity, Transplantation and Infection, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford"},{"author_name":"Shen Dong","author_inst":"Diabetes Center, University of California, San Francisco."},{"author_name":"Jing Zhou","author_inst":"Isoplexis Corporation"},{"author_name":"Kim Murray","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Rick Edmark","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Sunga Hong","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Lesley Jones","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhou","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Ryan Roper","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Sean Mackay","author_inst":"Isoplexis Corporation"},{"author_name":"Christopher R Dale","author_inst":"Swedish Center for Research and Innovation, Swedish Medical Center; Providence St. Joseph Health."},{"author_name":"Julie A Wallick","author_inst":"Swedish Center for Research and Innovation, Swedish Medical Center; Providence St. Joseph Health."},{"author_name":"Heather A Algren","author_inst":"Swedish Center for Research and Innovation, Swedish Medical Center; Providence St. Joseph Health."},{"author_name":"Zager A Michael","author_inst":"Center for Data Visualization, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center,"},{"author_name":"Andrew Magis","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Wei Wei","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Nathan D Price","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Sui Huang","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Naeha Subramanian","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Kai Wang","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Hadlock","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Leroy Hood","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey A.

Here, we present a retrospective multi-institutional cohort study evaluating ventilatory status in patients who had taken a tetracycline antibiotic within a year prior to diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The primary outcomes were the need for mechanical ventilation and duration of mechanical ventilation. The secondary outcome was the duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Data was evaluated using logistic regression and treatment effects regression models. Minocycline or doxycycline treatment within a year prior to ARDS diagnosis was associated with a 75% reduced likelihood for mechanical ventilation during hospital stay. Furthermore, tetracycline antibiotic therapy corresponded to significant reductions in duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay in ARDS patients. These data suggest tetracyclines may provide prophylactic benefit in reducing ventilatory support for ARDS patients and support further evaluation in a randomized prospective trial.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"James D Byrne","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rameen Shakur","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Joy Collins","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sarah L Becker","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cameron C Young","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hannah Boyce","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Carlo Traverso","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Iddya Karunasagar","author_inst":"Nitte (Deemed to be University), Mangaluru, Karnataka"},{"author_name":"Pamela Troisch","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Venkata R Duvvuri","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Priyanka Baloni","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Guangrong Qin","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Brett Smith","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Sergey Kornilov","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Clifford Rostomily","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Alex Xu","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"Institute for Immunity, Transplantation and Infection, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford"},{"author_name":"Shen Dong","author_inst":"Diabetes Center, University of California, San Francisco."},{"author_name":"Jing Zhou","author_inst":"Isoplexis Corporation"},{"author_name":"Kim Murray","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Rick Edmark","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Sunga Hong","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Lesley Jones","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhou","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Ryan Roper","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Sean Mackay","author_inst":"Isoplexis Corporation"},{"author_name":"Christopher R Dale","author_inst":"Swedish Center for Research and Innovation, Swedish Medical Center; Providence St. Joseph Health."},{"author_name":"Julie A Wallick","author_inst":"Swedish Center for Research and Innovation, Swedish Medical Center; Providence St. Joseph Health."},{"author_name":"Heather A Algren","author_inst":"Swedish Center for Research and Innovation, Swedish Medical Center; Providence St. Joseph Health."},{"author_name":"Zager A Michael","author_inst":"Center for Data Visualization, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center,"},{"author_name":"Andrew Magis","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Wei Wei","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Nathan D Price","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Sui Huang","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Naeha Subramanian","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Kai Wang","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Hadlock","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Leroy Hood","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey A.

This data now allows the design of secondary analyses that take advantage of this information to create new knowledge through specific computational approaches. One of these feasible analyses is the evaluation of the expression level for a gene through a series of different conditions or cell types. Based on this idea, we have developed ASACO, Automatic and Serial Analysis of CO-expression, which performs expression profiles for a given gene along hundreds of normalized and heterogeneous transcriptomics experiments and discover other genes that show either a similar or an inverse behavior. It might help to discover co-regulated genes, and even common transcriptional regulators in any biological model, including human diseases or microbial infections. The present SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is an opportunity to test this novel approach due to the wealth of data that is being generated, which could be used for validating results. In addition, new cell mechanisms identified could become new therapeutic targets. Thus, we have identified 35 host factors in the literature putatively involved in the infectious cycle of SARS-CoV and\/or SARS-CoV-2 and searched for genes tightly co-expressed with them. We have found around 1900 co-expressed genes whose assigned functions are strongly related to viral cycles. Moreover, this set of genes heavily overlap with those identified by former laboratory high-throughput screenings (with p-value near 0). Some of these genes aim to cellular structures such as the stress granules, which could be essential for the virus replication and thereby could constitute potential targets in the current fight against the virus. Additionally, our results reveal a series of common transcription regulators, involved in immune and inflammatory responses, that might be key virus targets to induce the coordinated expression of SARS-CoV-2 host factors. All of this proves that ASACO can discover gene co-regulation networks with potential for proposing new genes, pathways and regulators participating in particular biological systems.\n\nHighlightsO_LIASACO identifies regulatory associations of genes using public transcriptomics data.\nC_LIO_LIASACO highlights new cell functions likely involved in the infection of coronavirus.\nC_LIO_LIComparison with high-throughput screenings validates candidates proposed by ASACO.\nC_LIO_LIGenes co-expressed with hosts genes used by SARS-CoV-2 are related to stress granules.\nC_LI","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Antonio J.

One model was applied to European countries and published in Nature, concluding that complete lockdown was by far the most effective measure and 3 million deaths were avoided in the examined countries. The Imperial College team applied a different model to the USA states. Here, we show that inference is not robust to model specification and indeed changes substantially with the model used for the evolution of the time-varying reproduction number. Applying to European countries the model that the Imperial College team used for the USA states shows that complete lockdown has no or little impact, since it was introduced typically at a point when the time-varying reproduction number was already very low. We also show that results are not robust to the inclusion of additional follow-up data.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vincent Chin","author_inst":"The University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"John Ioannidis","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Martin Tanner","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Sally Cripps","author_inst":"The University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Rosario Rodriguez-Grinolo","author_inst":"Universidad Pablo de Olavide"},{"author_name":"Andres Garzon","author_inst":"Universidad Pablo de Olavide"},{"author_name":"Manuel J Munoz","author_inst":"Universidad Pablo de Olavide"},{"author_name":"Iddya Karunasagar","author_inst":"Nitte (Deemed to be University), Mangaluru, Karnataka"},{"author_name":"Pamela Troisch","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Venkata R Duvvuri","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Priyanka Baloni","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Guangrong Qin","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Brett Smith","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Sergey Kornilov","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Clifford Rostomily","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Alex Xu","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"Institute for Immunity, Transplantation and Infection, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford"},{"author_name":"Shen Dong","author_inst":"Diabetes Center, University of California, San Francisco."},{"author_name":"Jing Zhou","author_inst":"Isoplexis Corporation"},{"author_name":"Kim Murray","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Rick Edmark","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Sunga Hong","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Lesley Jones","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhou","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Ryan Roper","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Sean Mackay","author_inst":"Isoplexis Corporation"},{"author_name":"Christopher R Dale","author_inst":"Swedish Center for Research and Innovation, Swedish Medical Center; Providence St. Joseph Health."},{"author_name":"Julie A Wallick","author_inst":"Swedish Center for Research and Innovation, Swedish Medical Center; Providence St. Joseph Health."},{"author_name":"Heather A Algren","author_inst":"Swedish Center for Research and Innovation, Swedish Medical Center; Providence St. Joseph Health."},{"author_name":"Zager A Michael","author_inst":"Center for Data Visualization, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center,"},{"author_name":"Andrew Magis","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Wei Wei","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Nathan D Price","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Sui Huang","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Naeha Subramanian","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Kai Wang","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Hadlock","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Leroy Hood","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey A.

We show that COVID-19 papers are much more openly available (OA rate of 89.5%) than those concerning the four most recent viral outbreaks (Avian influenza, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Swine influenza; OA rates (from 26.2% to 51.3%) and the ten non COVID-19 disease categories responsible for the highest number of deaths worldwide (OA rates from 44.0% for Maternal and neonatal disorders to 58.9% for Respiratory infections and tuberculosis). This evidence confronts us with an inevitable question: how can we bridge the gap between OA rates for COVID-19 and other high-impact human diseases? Based on empirical data and projections, we show that it is possible to increase substantially immediate OA to publicly-funded research and complement more demanding initiatives for access to medical literature in developing countries working on the sharing of post-prints at individual, group and multi stakeholder partnership level. However, to make our plan effective in bringing us closer to the health information for all goal a more widespread culture of cooperation is fundamental. We argue that the lesson taught by COVID-19 is a unique opportunity to raise awareness among researchers and stakeholders about the importance of open science for human health and to demonstrate that a real change is now possible.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marco Capocasa","author_inst":"Istituto Italiano di Antropologia"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Destro Bisol","author_inst":"University of Rome \"La Sapienza\""},{"author_name":"Paolo Anagnostou","author_inst":"University of Rome La Sapienza"},{"author_name":"Sally Cripps","author_inst":"The University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Rosario Rodriguez-Grinolo","author_inst":"Universidad Pablo de Olavide"},{"author_name":"Andres Garzon","author_inst":"Universidad Pablo de Olavide"},{"author_name":"Manuel J Munoz","author_inst":"Universidad Pablo de Olavide"},{"author_name":"Iddya Karunasagar","author_inst":"Nitte (Deemed to be University), Mangaluru, Karnataka"},{"author_name":"Pamela Troisch","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Venkata R Duvvuri","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Priyanka Baloni","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Guangrong Qin","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Brett Smith","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Sergey Kornilov","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Clifford Rostomily","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Alex Xu","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"Institute for Immunity, Transplantation and Infection, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford"},{"author_name":"Shen Dong","author_inst":"Diabetes Center, University of California, San Francisco."},{"author_name":"Jing Zhou","author_inst":"Isoplexis Corporation"},{"author_name":"Kim Murray","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Rick Edmark","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Sunga Hong","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Lesley Jones","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhou","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Ryan Roper","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Sean Mackay","author_inst":"Isoplexis Corporation"},{"author_name":"Christopher R Dale","author_inst":"Swedish Center for Research and Innovation, Swedish Medical Center; Providence St. Joseph Health."},{"author_name":"Julie A Wallick","author_inst":"Swedish Center for Research and Innovation, Swedish Medical Center; Providence St. Joseph Health."},{"author_name":"Heather A Algren","author_inst":"Swedish Center for Research and Innovation, Swedish Medical Center; Providence St. Joseph Health."},{"author_name":"Zager A Michael","author_inst":"Center for Data Visualization, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center,"},{"author_name":"Andrew Magis","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Wei Wei","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Nathan D Price","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Sui Huang","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Naeha Subramanian","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Kai Wang","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Hadlock","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Leroy Hood","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey A.

Out of 15816 COVID-19 patients, 2054 went into critical state or deceased. Random, stratified train-test splits were repeated 100 times and lead to a ROC AUC of 0.872 [0.868, 0.877] and a precision-recall AUC of 0.500 [0.488, 0.509] (median and interquartile range). The model was well-calibrated, showing minor tendency to over-forecast probabilities above 0.5. The interpretability analysis confirmed evidence on major risk factors (e.g., older age, higher BMI, male gender, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease) in an efficient way compared to clinical studies, demonstrating the model validity. Such personalized predictions could enable fine-graded risk stratification for optimized care management.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mike Domenik Rinderknecht","author_inst":"IBM Switzerland AG"},{"author_name":"Yannick Klopfenstein","author_inst":"IBM Switzerland AG"},{"author_name":"Paolo Anagnostou","author_inst":"University of Rome La Sapienza"},{"author_name":"Sally Cripps","author_inst":"The University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Rosario Rodriguez-Grinolo","author_inst":"Universidad Pablo de Olavide"},{"author_name":"Andres Garzon","author_inst":"Universidad Pablo de Olavide"},{"author_name":"Manuel J Munoz","author_inst":"Universidad Pablo de Olavide"},{"author_name":"Iddya Karunasagar","author_inst":"Nitte (Deemed to be University), Mangaluru, Karnataka"},{"author_name":"Pamela Troisch","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Venkata R Duvvuri","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Priyanka Baloni","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Guangrong Qin","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Brett Smith","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Sergey Kornilov","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Clifford Rostomily","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Alex Xu","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"Institute for Immunity, Transplantation and Infection, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford"},{"author_name":"Shen Dong","author_inst":"Diabetes Center, University of California, San Francisco."},{"author_name":"Jing Zhou","author_inst":"Isoplexis Corporation"},{"author_name":"Kim Murray","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Rick Edmark","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Sunga Hong","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Lesley Jones","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhou","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Ryan Roper","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Sean Mackay","author_inst":"Isoplexis Corporation"},{"author_name":"Christopher R Dale","author_inst":"Swedish Center for Research and Innovation, Swedish Medical Center; Providence St. Joseph Health."},{"author_name":"Julie A Wallick","author_inst":"Swedish Center for Research and Innovation, Swedish Medical Center; Providence St. Joseph Health."},{"author_name":"Heather A Algren","author_inst":"Swedish Center for Research and Innovation, Swedish Medical Center; Providence St. Joseph Health."},{"author_name":"Zager A Michael","author_inst":"Center for Data Visualization, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center,"},{"author_name":"Andrew Magis","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Wei Wei","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Nathan D Price","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Sui Huang","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Naeha Subramanian","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Kai Wang","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Hadlock","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Leroy Hood","author_inst":"Institute for Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey A.

Conversely, Uruguay stands out as an outlier managing this health crisis with remarkable success. Methods: We developed a molecular diagnostic test to detect SARS-CoV-2. This methodology was transferred to research institutes, public hospitals and academic laboratories all around the country, creating a COVID-19 diagnostic lab network. Uruguay also implemented active epidemiological surveillance following the Test, Trace and Isolate (TETRIS) strategy coupled to real-time genomic epidemiology. Results: Three months after the first cases were detected, the number of positive individuals reached 826 (23 deaths, 112 active cases and 691 recovered). The Uruguayan strategy was based in a close synergy established between the national health authorities and the scientific community. In turn, academia rapidly responded to develop national RT-qPCR tests. Consequently, Uruguay was able to perform ~1,000 molecular tests per day in a matter of weeks. The COVID-19 diagnostic lab network performed more than 54% of the molecular tests in the country. This, together with real-time genomics, were instrumental to implement the TETRIS strategy, helping to contain domestic transmission of the main outbreaks registered so far. Conclusions: Uruguay has successfully navigated the first trimester of the COVID-19 health crisis in South America. A rapid response by the scientific community to increase testing capacity, together with national health authorities seeking out the support from the academia were fundamental to successfully contain, until now, the COVID-19 outbreak in the country.","rel_num_authors":50,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pilar Moreno","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo Facultad de Ciencias, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Gonzalo Andres Moratorio","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo Facultad de Ciencias, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Gregorio Iraola","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Fajardo","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo Facultad de Ciencias, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Fabian Aldunate","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo Facultad de Ciencias, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Marianoel Pereira","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo Facultad de Ciencias, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Paula Perbolianachis","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo Facultad de Ciencias, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Alicia Costabile","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo Facultad de Ciencias, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Fernando Lopez-Tort","author_inst":"Centro Universitario Regional Norte, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Diego Simon","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo Facultad de Ciencias, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Salazar","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Ignacio Ferres","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Florencia Diaz-Viraque","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Andres Abin","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo ATGen Biotech"},{"author_name":"Mariana Bresque","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Matias Fabregat","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Matias Maidana","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Investigacion Agropecuaria"},{"author_name":"Bernardina Rivera","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo Hospital Maciel"},{"author_name":"Maria Cruces","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Jorge Rodriguez","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Paola Scavone","author_inst":"IIBCE"},{"author_name":"Miguel Alegretti","author_inst":"MSP"},{"author_name":"Adriana Nabon","author_inst":"MSP"},{"author_name":"Gustavo Gagliano","author_inst":"MSP"},{"author_name":"Raquel Rosa","author_inst":"MSP"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Henderson","author_inst":"ASSE"},{"author_name":"Estela Bidegain","author_inst":"Hospital Maciel ASSE"},{"author_name":"Leticia Zarantonelli","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Claudia Piattoni","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Gonzalo Greif","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Maria Francia","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo Facultad de Medicina, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Carlos Robello","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo Facultad de Medicina, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Rosario Duran","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo IIBCE"},{"author_name":"Gustavo Brito","author_inst":"INIA"},{"author_name":"Victoria Bonnecarrere","author_inst":"INIA"},{"author_name":"Miguel Sierra","author_inst":"INIA"},{"author_name":"Rodney Colina","author_inst":"Centro Universitario Regional Norte, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Monica Marin","author_inst":"Facultad de Ciencias, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Juan Cristina","author_inst":"Facultad de Ciencias, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Erlich","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Fernando Paganini","author_inst":"Universidad Ort"},{"author_name":"Henry Cohen","author_inst":"Hospital de Clinicas, Facultad de Medicina, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Rafael Radi","author_inst":"Facultad de Medicina, UdelaR"},{"author_name":"Luis Barbeito","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Jose Badano","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Otto Pritsch","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo Facultad de Medicina Udelar"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Fernandez","author_inst":"Udelar"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo Arim","author_inst":"Udelar"},{"author_name":"Carlos Batthyany","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"- Interinstitutional COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":"-"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.24.20051508","rel_title":"New Insights on Excess Deaths and COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-07-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.24.20051508","rel_abs":"Background: Weinberger and colleagues estimated that 27,065 of the 122,300 excess deaths in the United States between March 1 and May 30, 2020 did not have a COVID-19 cause of death. Methods: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) post weekly data on mortality for 13 causes of death from the most prevalent comorbid conditions reported on death certificates where COVID-19 was listed as a cause of death. The 2015-2019 data for weeks 10 through 22 were used to forecast the number of deaths from the 13 causes in the absence of COVID-19 during 2020. The forecast was subtracted from the observed number of deaths for each cause during the period March 1 to May 30, 2020. Results: The total of the differences for each of the 13 causes of death, 18,489 deaths, accounts for over two-thirds of the 27,065 excess deaths not due to COVID-19. Conclusion: Combining the 95,235 reported COVID-19 deaths with the 18,489 from the 13 most frequent comorbid conditions reported on death certificates where COVID-19 was a cause suggests that as many as 93% of the excess deaths were due to COVID-19 and implies that COVID-19 deaths were undercounted.

We used an unbiased, genome-wide screening technology, termed T-Scan, to identify specific epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 that are recognized by the memory CD8+ T cells of 25 COVID-19 convalescent patients, focusing on epitopes presented by the six most prevalent Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) types: A*02:01, A*01:01, A*03:01, A*11:01, A*24:02, and B*07:02. For each HLA type, the patients' T cells recognized 3-8 immunodominant epitopes that are broadly shared among patients. Remarkably, 94% of screened patients had T cells that recognized at least one of the three most dominant epitopes for a given HLA, and 53% of patients had T cells that recognized all three. Subsequent validation studies in 18 additional A*02:01 patients confirmed the presence of memory CD8+ T cells specific for the top six identified A*02:01 epitopes, and single-cell sequencing revealed that patients often have many different T cell clones targeting each epitope, but that the same T cell receptor Valpha regions are predominantly used to recognize these epitopes, even across patients. In total, we identified 29 shared epitopes across the six HLA types studied. T cells that target most of these immunodominant epitopes (27 of 29) do not cross-react with the endemic coronaviruses that cause the common cold, and the epitopes do not occur in regions with high mutational variation. Notably, only 3 of the 29 epitopes we identified reside in the spike protein, highlighting the need to design new classes of vaccines that recapitulate natural CD8+ T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew P Ferretti","author_inst":"TScan Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Tomasz Kula","author_inst":"TScan Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Yifan Wang","author_inst":"TScan Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Dalena MV Nguyen","author_inst":"TScan Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Adam Weinheimer","author_inst":"TScan Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Garrett S Dunlap","author_inst":"TScan Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Qikai Xu","author_inst":"TScan Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Nancy Nabilsi","author_inst":"TScan Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Candace R Perullo","author_inst":"TScan Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Alexander W Cristofaro","author_inst":"TScan Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Holly J Whitton","author_inst":"TScan Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Amy Virbasius","author_inst":"TScan Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Kenneth J Olivier Jr.","author_inst":"TScan Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Lyndsey B Baiamonte","author_inst":"Ochsner Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Angela T Alistar","author_inst":"Atlantic Health System Cancer Care"},{"author_name":"Eric D Whitman","author_inst":"Atlantic Health System Cancer Care"},{"author_name":"Sarah A Bertino","author_inst":"TScan Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Shrikanta Chattopadhyay","author_inst":"TScan Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Gavin MacBeath","author_inst":"TScan Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Jorge Rodriguez","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Paola Scavone","author_inst":"IIBCE"},{"author_name":"Miguel Alegretti","author_inst":"MSP"},{"author_name":"Adriana Nabon","author_inst":"MSP"},{"author_name":"Gustavo Gagliano","author_inst":"MSP"},{"author_name":"Raquel Rosa","author_inst":"MSP"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Henderson","author_inst":"ASSE"},{"author_name":"Estela Bidegain","author_inst":"Hospital Maciel ASSE"},{"author_name":"Leticia Zarantonelli","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Claudia Piattoni","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Gonzalo Greif","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Maria Francia","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo Facultad de Medicina, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Carlos Robello","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo Facultad de Medicina, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Rosario Duran","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo IIBCE"},{"author_name":"Gustavo Brito","author_inst":"INIA"},{"author_name":"Victoria Bonnecarrere","author_inst":"INIA"},{"author_name":"Miguel Sierra","author_inst":"INIA"},{"author_name":"Rodney Colina","author_inst":"Centro Universitario Regional Norte, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Monica Marin","author_inst":"Facultad de Ciencias, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Juan Cristina","author_inst":"Facultad de Ciencias, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Erlich","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Fernando Paganini","author_inst":"Universidad Ort"},{"author_name":"Henry Cohen","author_inst":"Hospital de Clinicas, Facultad de Medicina, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Rafael Radi","author_inst":"Facultad de Medicina, UdelaR"},{"author_name":"Luis Barbeito","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Jose Badano","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Otto Pritsch","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo Facultad de Medicina Udelar"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Fernandez","author_inst":"Udelar"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo Arim","author_inst":"Udelar"},{"author_name":"Carlos Batthyany","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"- Interinstitutional COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":"-"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.21.20153650","rel_title":"Patient characteristics and predictors of mortality in 470 adults admitted to a district general hospital in England with Covid-19","rel_date":"2020-07-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.21.20153650","rel_abs":"Background Understanding risk factors for death in Covid 19 is key to providing good quality clinical care. Due to a paucity of robust evidence, we sought to assess the presenting characteristics of patients with Covid 19 and investigate factors associated with death. Methods Retrospective analysis of adults admitted with Covid 19 to Royal Oldham Hospital, UK. Logistic regression modelling was utilised to explore factors predicting death. Results 470 patients were admitted, of whom 169 (36%) died. The median age was 71 years (IQR 57 to 82), and 255 (54.3%) were men. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (n=218, 46.4%), diabetes (n=143, 30.4%) and chronic neurological disease (n=123, 26.1%). The most frequent complications were acute kidney injury (n=157, 33.4%) and myocardial injury (n=21, 4.5%). Forty three (9.1%) patients required intubation and ventilation, and 39 (8.3%) received non-invasive ventilation Independent risk factors for death were increasing age (OR per 10 year increase above 40 years 1.87, 95% CI 1.57 to 2.27), hypertension (OR 1.72, 1.10 to 2.70), cancer (OR 2.20, 1.27 to 3.81), platelets <150x103\/microlitre (OR 1.93, 1.13 to 3.30), C-reactive protein >100 micrograms\/mL (OR 1.68, 1.05 to 2.68), >50% chest radiograph infiltrates, (OR 2.09, 1.16 to 3.77) and acute kidney injury (OR 2.60, 1.64 to 4.13). There was no independent association between death and gender, ethnicity, deprivation level, fever, SpO2\/FiO2 (oxygen saturation index), lymphopenia or other comorbidities. Conclusions We characterised the first wave of patients with Covid 19 in one of Englands highest incidence areas, determining which factors predict death. These findings will inform clinical and shared decision making, including the use of respiratory support and therapeutic agents.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joseph V Thompson","author_inst":"Royal Oldham Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nevan Meghani","author_inst":"Royal Oldham Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bethan M Powell","author_inst":"Royal Oldham Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ian Newell","author_inst":"Royal Oldham Hospital"},{"author_name":"Roanna Craven","author_inst":"Royal Oldham Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gemma Skilton","author_inst":"Royal Oldham Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lydia J Bagg","author_inst":"Royal Oldham Hospital"},{"author_name":"Irha Yaqoob","author_inst":"Royal Oldham Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michael J Dixon","author_inst":"Royal Oldham Hospital"},{"author_name":"Eleanor J Evans","author_inst":"Royal Oldham Hospital"},{"author_name":"Belina Kambele","author_inst":"Royal Oldham Hospital"},{"author_name":"Asif Rehman","author_inst":"Royal Oldham Hospital"},{"author_name":"Georges Ng Man Kwong","author_inst":"Royal Oldham Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lyndsey B Baiamonte","author_inst":"Ochsner Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Angela T Alistar","author_inst":"Atlantic Health System Cancer Care"},{"author_name":"Eric D Whitman","author_inst":"Atlantic Health System Cancer Care"},{"author_name":"Sarah A Bertino","author_inst":"TScan Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Shrikanta Chattopadhyay","author_inst":"TScan Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Gavin MacBeath","author_inst":"TScan Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Jorge Rodriguez","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Paola Scavone","author_inst":"IIBCE"},{"author_name":"Miguel Alegretti","author_inst":"MSP"},{"author_name":"Adriana Nabon","author_inst":"MSP"},{"author_name":"Gustavo Gagliano","author_inst":"MSP"},{"author_name":"Raquel Rosa","author_inst":"MSP"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Henderson","author_inst":"ASSE"},{"author_name":"Estela Bidegain","author_inst":"Hospital Maciel ASSE"},{"author_name":"Leticia Zarantonelli","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Claudia Piattoni","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Gonzalo Greif","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Maria Francia","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo Facultad de Medicina, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Carlos Robello","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo Facultad de Medicina, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Rosario Duran","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo IIBCE"},{"author_name":"Gustavo Brito","author_inst":"INIA"},{"author_name":"Victoria Bonnecarrere","author_inst":"INIA"},{"author_name":"Miguel Sierra","author_inst":"INIA"},{"author_name":"Rodney Colina","author_inst":"Centro Universitario Regional Norte, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Monica Marin","author_inst":"Facultad de Ciencias, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Juan Cristina","author_inst":"Facultad de Ciencias, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Erlich","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Fernando Paganini","author_inst":"Universidad Ort"},{"author_name":"Henry Cohen","author_inst":"Hospital de Clinicas, Facultad de Medicina, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Rafael Radi","author_inst":"Facultad de Medicina, UdelaR"},{"author_name":"Luis Barbeito","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Jose Badano","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Otto Pritsch","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo Facultad de Medicina Udelar"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Fernandez","author_inst":"Udelar"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo Arim","author_inst":"Udelar"},{"author_name":"Carlos Batthyany","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"- Interinstitutional COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":"-"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.18.20155549","rel_title":"Trends of in-hospital and 30-day mortality after percutaneous coronary intervention in England before and after the COVID-19 era","rel_date":"2020-07-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.18.20155549","rel_abs":"Objectives: To examine short-term primary causes of death after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in a national cohort before and during COVID-19. Background: Public reporting of PCI outcomes is a performance metric and a requirement in many healthcare systems. There are inconsistent data on the causes of death after PCI, and what proportion of these are attributable to cardiac causes. Methods: All patients undergoing PCI in England between 1st January 2017 and 10th May 2020 were retrospectively analysed (n=273,141), according to their outcome from the date of PCI; no death and in-hospital, post-discharge, and 30-day death. Results: The overall rates of in-hospital and 30-day death were 1.9% and 2.8%, respectively. The rate of 30-day death declined between 2017 (2.9%) and February 2020 (2.5%), mainly due to lower in-hospital death (2.1% vs. 1.5%), before rising again from 1st March 2020 (3.2%) due to higher rates of post-discharge mortality. Only 59.6% of 30-day deaths were due to cardiac causes, the most common being acute coronary syndrome, cardiogenic shock and heart failure, and this persisted throughout the study period. 10.4% of 30-day deaths after 1st March 2020 were due to confirmed COVID-19. Conclusions: In this nationwide study, we show that 40% of 30-day deaths are due to non-cardiac causes. Non-cardiac deaths have increased even more from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, with one in ten deaths from March 2020 being COVID-19 related. These findings raise a question of whether public reporting of PCI outcomes should be cause-specific.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohamed O Mohamed","author_inst":"Keele Cardiovascular Research Group, Keele University, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Tim Kinnaird","author_inst":"University hospital of Wales, Cardiff, Wales, UK"},{"author_name":"Nick Curzen","author_inst":"Wessex Cardiothoracic Unit, Southampton University Hospital Southampton & Faculty of Medicine University of Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Peter Ludman","author_inst":"Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Jianhua Wu","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Rashid","author_inst":"Keele Cardiovascular Research Group, Centre for Prognosis Research, Keele University, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Ahmad Shoaib","author_inst":"Keele Cardiovascular Research Group, Centre for Prognosis Research, Keele University, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Mark de Belder","author_inst":"National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research, Barts Health NHS Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"John Deanfield","author_inst":"Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London, UK"},{"author_name":"Chris Gale","author_inst":"Leeds Institute for Data analytics, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK"},{"author_name":"Mamas A Mamas","author_inst":"Keele Cardiovascular Research Group, Centre for Prognosis Research, Keele University, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Asif Rehman","author_inst":"Royal Oldham Hospital"},{"author_name":"Georges Ng Man Kwong","author_inst":"Royal Oldham Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lyndsey B Baiamonte","author_inst":"Ochsner Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Angela T Alistar","author_inst":"Atlantic Health System Cancer Care"},{"author_name":"Eric D Whitman","author_inst":"Atlantic Health System Cancer Care"},{"author_name":"Sarah A Bertino","author_inst":"TScan Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Shrikanta Chattopadhyay","author_inst":"TScan Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Gavin MacBeath","author_inst":"TScan Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Jorge Rodriguez","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Paola Scavone","author_inst":"IIBCE"},{"author_name":"Miguel Alegretti","author_inst":"MSP"},{"author_name":"Adriana Nabon","author_inst":"MSP"},{"author_name":"Gustavo Gagliano","author_inst":"MSP"},{"author_name":"Raquel Rosa","author_inst":"MSP"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Henderson","author_inst":"ASSE"},{"author_name":"Estela Bidegain","author_inst":"Hospital Maciel ASSE"},{"author_name":"Leticia Zarantonelli","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Claudia Piattoni","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Gonzalo Greif","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Maria Francia","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo Facultad de Medicina, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Carlos Robello","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo Facultad de Medicina, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Rosario Duran","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo IIBCE"},{"author_name":"Gustavo Brito","author_inst":"INIA"},{"author_name":"Victoria Bonnecarrere","author_inst":"INIA"},{"author_name":"Miguel Sierra","author_inst":"INIA"},{"author_name":"Rodney Colina","author_inst":"Centro Universitario Regional Norte, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Monica Marin","author_inst":"Facultad de Ciencias, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Juan Cristina","author_inst":"Facultad de Ciencias, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Erlich","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Fernando Paganini","author_inst":"Universidad Ort"},{"author_name":"Henry Cohen","author_inst":"Hospital de Clinicas, Facultad de Medicina, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Rafael Radi","author_inst":"Facultad de Medicina, UdelaR"},{"author_name":"Luis Barbeito","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Jose Badano","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Otto Pritsch","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo Facultad de Medicina Udelar"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Fernandez","author_inst":"Udelar"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo Arim","author_inst":"Udelar"},{"author_name":"Carlos Batthyany","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"- Interinstitutional COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":"-"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"cardiovascular medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.25.20161661","rel_title":"Adapting for the COVID-19 pandemic in Ecuador, a characterization of hospital strategies and patients","rel_date":"2020-07-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.25.20161661","rel_abs":"Abstract The World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) a global pandemic on March 11th. In Ecuador, the first case of COVID-19 was recorded on February 29th. Despite efforts to control its spread, SARS-CoV-2 overrun the Ecuadorian public health system which became one of the most affected in Latin America with 22,719 cases reported up to April, 24th. Public health control measures, including social distancing and lockdowns, were implemented at different times in the biggest cities of the country: Guayaquil and Quito. The Hospital General del Sur de Quito (HGSQ) had to transition from a general to a specific COVID-19 health center in a short period of time to fulfill the health demand from patients with respiratory afflictions. Here, we summarized the implementations applied in the HGSQ to become a COVID-19 exclusive hospital, including the rearrangement of hospital rooms and a triage strategy based on a severity score calculated through an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted chest computed tomography (CT). Moreover, we present clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory data from 75 laboratory tested COVID-19 patients, which represent the first outbreak of Quito city.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel Garzon-Chavez","author_inst":"Universidad San Francisco de Quito"},{"author_name":"Daniel Romero-Alvarez","author_inst":"University of Kansas"},{"author_name":"Marco Bonifaz","author_inst":"Hospital IESS Quito Sur"},{"author_name":"Juan Gaviria","author_inst":"Hospital IESS Quito Sur"},{"author_name":"Daniel Mero","author_inst":"Hospital IESS Quito Sur"},{"author_name":"Narcisa Gunsha","author_inst":"Hospital IESS Quito Sur"},{"author_name":"Asiris Perez","author_inst":"Hospital IESS Quito Sur"},{"author_name":"Maria Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital IESS Quito Sur"},{"author_name":"Hugo Espejo","author_inst":"Hospital IESS Quito Sur"},{"author_name":"Franklin Espinosa","author_inst":"Hospital IESS Quito Sur"},{"author_name":"Edison Ligna","author_inst":"Hospital IESS Quito Sur"},{"author_name":"Mauricio Espinel","author_inst":"Hospital IESS Quito Sur"},{"author_name":"Emmanuelle Quentin","author_inst":"Universidad Tecnologica Equinoccial"},{"author_name":"Enrique Teran","author_inst":"Universidad San Francisco de Quito"},{"author_name":"Francisco Mora","author_inst":"Hospital IESS Quito Sur"},{"author_name":"Jorge Reyes","author_inst":"Hospital IESS Quito Sur"},{"author_name":"Sarah A Bertino","author_inst":"TScan Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Shrikanta Chattopadhyay","author_inst":"TScan Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Gavin MacBeath","author_inst":"TScan Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Jorge Rodriguez","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Paola Scavone","author_inst":"IIBCE"},{"author_name":"Miguel Alegretti","author_inst":"MSP"},{"author_name":"Adriana Nabon","author_inst":"MSP"},{"author_name":"Gustavo Gagliano","author_inst":"MSP"},{"author_name":"Raquel Rosa","author_inst":"MSP"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Henderson","author_inst":"ASSE"},{"author_name":"Estela Bidegain","author_inst":"Hospital Maciel ASSE"},{"author_name":"Leticia Zarantonelli","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Claudia Piattoni","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Gonzalo Greif","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Maria Francia","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo Facultad de Medicina, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Carlos Robello","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo Facultad de Medicina, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Rosario Duran","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo IIBCE"},{"author_name":"Gustavo Brito","author_inst":"INIA"},{"author_name":"Victoria Bonnecarrere","author_inst":"INIA"},{"author_name":"Miguel Sierra","author_inst":"INIA"},{"author_name":"Rodney Colina","author_inst":"Centro Universitario Regional Norte, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Monica Marin","author_inst":"Facultad de Ciencias, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Juan Cristina","author_inst":"Facultad de Ciencias, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Erlich","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Fernando Paganini","author_inst":"Universidad Ort"},{"author_name":"Henry Cohen","author_inst":"Hospital de Clinicas, Facultad de Medicina, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Rafael Radi","author_inst":"Facultad de Medicina, UdelaR"},{"author_name":"Luis Barbeito","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Jose Badano","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Otto Pritsch","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo Facultad de Medicina Udelar"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Fernandez","author_inst":"Udelar"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo Arim","author_inst":"Udelar"},{"author_name":"Carlos Batthyany","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"- Interinstitutional COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":"-"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.25.20161869","rel_title":"Functional mapping of B-cell linear epitopes 1 of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 convalescent population","rel_date":"2020-07-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.25.20161869","rel_abs":"Pandemic SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 10 million people and caused over 500,000 mortalities. Vaccine development is in urgent need to stop the pandemic. Despite great progresses on SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development, the efficacy of the vaccines remains to be determined. Deciphering the interactions of the viral epitopes with their elicited neutralizing antibodies in the convalescent COVID-19 population inspires the vaccine development. In this study, we devised a peptide array composed of 20-mer overlapped peptides of spike (S), membrane (M) and envelope (E) proteins, and performed a screening with 120 COVID-19 convalescent serums and 24 non-COVID-19 serums. We identified five SARS-CoV-2-specific dominant epitopes that reacted with above 40% COVID-19 convalescent serums. Epitopes in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S ill reacted with the convalescent serums. Of note, two peptides non-specifically interacted with most of the non-COVID-19 serums. Neutralization assay indicated that only five serums completely blocked viral infection at the dilution of 1:200. By using a peptide-compete neutralizing assay, we found that three dominant epitopes partially competed the neutralization activity of several convalescent serums, suggesting antibodies elicited by these epitopes played an important role in neutralizing viral infection. The epitopes we identified in this study may serve as vaccine candidates to elicit neutralizing antibodies in most vaccinated people or specific antigens for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhigang Yi","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yun Ling","author_inst":"Shanghai public health clinical center, Fudan

to prior drug prescribing. Design -- Matched case-control study (REACT-SCOT) based on record linkage to hospital discharges since June 2015 and dispensed prescriptions issued in primary care during the last 240 days. Setting -- Scottish population. Main outcome measure -- Severe COVID-19, defined by entry to critical care or fatal outcome. Participants -- All 4272 cases of severe COVID-19 in Scotland since the start of the epidemic, with 36948 controls matched for age, sex and primary care practice. Results -- Severe COVID-19 was strongly associated with the number of non-cardiovascular drug classes dispensed. This association was strongest in those not resident in care homes, in whom the rate ratio (95% CI) associated with dispensing of 12 or more drug classes versus none was 10.8 (8.7, 13.2), and was not accounted for by treatment of conditions designated as conferring increased risk. Of 17 drug classes postulated at the start of the epidemic to be \"medications compromising COVID\", all were associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19. The largest effect was for antipsychotic agents: rate ratio 4.14 (3.39, 5.07). Other drug classes with large effects included proton pump inhibitors (rate rato 2.19 (1.70, 2.80) for >= 2 defined daily doses\/day), opioids (3.62 (2.65, 4.94) for >= 50 mg morphine equivalent\/day) and gabapentinoids. These associations persisted after adjusting for covariates, and were stronger with recent than with non-recent exposure. Conclusions -- Severe COVID-19 is associated with polypharmacy and with drugs that cause sedation, respiratory depression or dyskinesia, have anticholinergic effects or affect the gastrointestinal system. These associations are not easily explained by co-morbidity. Although the evidence for causality is not conclusive, these results support existing guidance on reducing overprescribing of these drug classes and limiting inappropriate polypharmacy as a potential means of reducing COVID-19 risk.

We present a case series raising safety and efficacy concerns in COVID-19 affected patients. Methods: We measured LPV trough concentrations in 12 patients treated at our center and reviewed their clinical charts for side effects known to occur in HIV patients. Results: Compared to established LPV trough concentrations in HIV treated patients, concentrations in COVID-19 affected patients were 3-fold greater (20.64 +\/- 10.14 mcg\/mL versus 6.25 mcg\/mL). In addition, cholestasis and dyslipidemia toxicity thresholds were exceeded in 12\/12 and 11\/12 patients respectively. No patients achieved the presumed therapeutic concentration. The side effects noted were mainly gastrointestinal symptoms (5\/12, 42%), electrolytes imbalances (4\/12, 33%), liver enzyme disturbances (5\/12, 42%), and triglyceride elevations (2\/12, 17%). Conclusion: None of our patients reached presumed therapeutic LPV concentrations despite experiencing side effects and exceeding cholestasis and dyslipidemia toxicity thresholds. This raises concerns for the safety and efficacy of LPV\/r. Clinicians should consider closely monitoring for side effects and not necessarily attribute them to COVID-19 itself.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marc-Antoine Lepage","author_inst":"McGill University Health Centre"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Rozza","author_inst":"McGill University Health Centre"},{"author_name":"Richard Kremer","author_inst":"McGill University Health Centre"},{"author_name":"Ami Grunbaum","author_inst":"McGill University Health Centre"},{"author_name":"Jingyi Zhu","author_inst":"Henan Normal University"},{"author_name":"Gege Sun","author_inst":"Henan Normal University"},{"author_name":"Guoying Yu","author_inst":"Henan Normal University"},{"author_name":"Rachael Wood","author_inst":"NHS Information Services Division (Public Health Scotland)"},{"author_name":"Nazir Lone","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Janet Murray","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Thomas M Caparrotta","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Alison Smith-Palmer","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"David Goldberg","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Jim McMenamin","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Colin Ramsay","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Bruce Guthrie","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Sharon Hutchinson","author_inst":"Glasgow Caledonian University"},{"author_name":"Helen M Colhoun","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Gavin MacBeath","author_inst":"TScan Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Jorge Rodriguez","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Paola Scavone","author_inst":"IIBCE"},{"author_name":"Miguel Alegretti","author_inst":"MSP"},{"author_name":"Adriana Nabon","author_inst":"MSP"},{"author_name":"Gustavo Gagliano","author_inst":"MSP"},{"author_name":"Raquel Rosa","author_inst":"MSP"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Henderson","author_inst":"ASSE"},{"author_name":"Estela Bidegain","author_inst":"Hospital Maciel ASSE"},{"author_name":"Leticia Zarantonelli","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Claudia Piattoni","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Gonzalo Greif","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Maria Francia","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo Facultad de Medicina, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Carlos Robello","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo Facultad de Medicina, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Rosario Duran","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo IIBCE"},{"author_name":"Gustavo Brito","author_inst":"INIA"},{"author_name":"Victoria Bonnecarrere","author_inst":"INIA"},{"author_name":"Miguel Sierra","author_inst":"INIA"},{"author_name":"Rodney Colina","author_inst":"Centro Universitario Regional Norte, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Monica Marin","author_inst":"Facultad de Ciencias, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Juan Cristina","author_inst":"Facultad de Ciencias, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Erlich","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Fernando Paganini","author_inst":"Universidad Ort"},{"author_name":"Henry Cohen","author_inst":"Hospital de Clinicas, Facultad de Medicina, Udelar"},{"author_name":"Rafael Radi","author_inst":"Facultad de Medicina, UdelaR"},{"author_name":"Luis Barbeito","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Jose Badano","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Otto Pritsch","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo Facultad de Medicina Udelar"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Fernandez","author_inst":"Udelar"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo Arim","author_inst":"Udelar"},{"author_name":"Carlos Batthyany","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur de Montevideo"},{"author_name":"- Interinstitutional COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":"-"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pharmacology and therapeutics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.25.20151225","rel_title":"Impact of COronaVirus Disease -2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on Haemodialysis care delivery pattern in Karnataka, India- a cross-sectional, questionnaire based survey.","rel_date":"2020-07-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.25.20151225","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted health care delivery globally. Patients on in-centre haemodialysis(HD) are particularly affected due to their multiple hospital visits and the need for uninterrupted care for their well-being and survival. We studied the impact of the pandemic and the national policy for pandemic control on the HD care delivery in Karnataka state in India in April 2020, when the first and second national lockdown were in place. An online, questionnaire based survey of dialysis facilities was conducted and the responses analysed. The questions were pertaining to the key areas such as changes in number of dialysis treatments, frequency, duration, expenses, transportation to and from dialysis units, impact on availability of consumables, effect on dialysis personnel and on machine maintenance. 62 centres participated. Median of dialysis treatments for the months of March and April 2020 were 695.5 and 650 respectively. Reduction in dialysis treatments was noted in 29(46.8%) facilities , decreased frequency reported by 60 centres. In at least 35(56.5%) centres, dialysis patients had to bear increased expenses. Cost and availability of dialysis consumables were affected in 40(64.5%) and 55(88.7%) centres respectively. Problems with transportation and movement restriction were the two key factors affecting both patients and dialysis facilities.This survey documents the collateral impact of COVID -19 on the vulnerable group of patients on HD, even when not affected by COVID. It identifies the key areas of challenges faced by the patients and the facilities and implores the care-providers for finding newer avenues for mitigation of the problems.
