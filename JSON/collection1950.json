Though COVID-19 primarily affects the respiratory system, it has also been associated with a wide range of cardiovascular (CV) manifestations portending extremely poor prognosis. The principal hypothesis for CV involvement is through direct myocardial infection and systemic inflammation. We conducted a systematic review of the current literature to provide a foundation for understanding the CV manifestations and outcomes of COVID-19. PubMed and EMBASE databases were electronically searched from the inception of the databases through April 27th, 2020. A second literature review was conducted to include major trials and guidelines that were published after the initial search but before submission. The inclusion criteria for studies to be eligible were case reports, case series, and observation studies reporting CV outcomes among patients with COVID-19 infection. This review of the current COVID-19 disease and CV outcomes literature revealed a myriad of CV manifestations with potential avenues for treatment and prevention. Future studies are required to understand on a more mechanistic level the effect of COVID-19 on the myocardium and thus provide avenues to improve mortality and morbidity.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samarthkumar Thakkar","author_inst":"Rochester General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shilpkumar Arora","author_inst":"Case Western University"},{"author_name":"Ashish Kumar","author_inst":"Saint John's Medical College"},{"author_name":"Rahul Jaswaney","author_inst":"Case Western University"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Faisaluddin","author_inst":"Deccan College Of Medical Science"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Ammad Ud Din","author_inst":"Rochester General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mariam Shariff","author_inst":"St John's Medical College"},{"author_name":"Kirolos Barssoum","author_inst":"Rochester General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Harsh P.

We aimed to characterise patients attending emergency departments with suspected COVID-19, including subgroups based on sex, ethnicity and COVID-19 test results. Methods We undertook a mixed prospective and retrospective observational cohort study in 70 emergency departments across the United Kingdom (UK). We collected presenting data from 22446 people attending with suspected COVID-19 between 26 March 2020 and 28 May 2020. Outcomes were admission to hospital, COVID-19 result, organ support (respiratory, cardiovascular or renal), and death, by record review at 30 days. Results Adults were acutely unwell (median NEWS2 score 4) and had high rates of admission (67.1%), COVID-19 positivity (31.2%), organ support (9.8%) and death (15.9%). Children had much lower rates of admission (27.4%), COVID-19 positivity (1.2%), organ support (1.4%) and death (0.3%). Adult men and women presented in similar numbers (10210 versus 10506), but men were more likely to be admitted (72.9% v 61.4%), require organ support (12.2% v 7.7%) and die (18.7% v 13.3%). Black or Asian adults tended to be younger than White adults (median age 54, 50 and 67 years), were less likely to be admitted (60.8%, 57.3%, 69.6%) or die (11.9%, 11.2%, 16.8%), but were more likely to require organ support (15.9%, 14.3%, 8.9%) or have a positive COVID-19 test (40.8%, 42.1%, 30.0%). Adults admitted with confirmed COVID-19 had similar age and comorbidities (except chronic lung disease) to those who did not have COVID-19 confirmed, but were much more likely to need organ support (22.2% v 8.9%) or die (32.7% v 15.9%). Conclusions Important differences exist between patient groups presenting to the emergency department with suspected COVID-19. People with confirmed COVID-19 have a poor prognosis, compared with similar emergency admissions without confirmed COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Steve Goodacre","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Ben Thomas","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Ellen Lee","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Laura Sutton","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Amanda Loban","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Simon Waterhouse","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Richard Simmonds","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Katie Biggs","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Carl Marincowitz","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Jose Schutter","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Sarah Connelly","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Elena Sheldon","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Jamie Hall","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Emma Young","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Andrew Bentley","author_inst":"Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, Wythenshawe Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kirsty Challen","author_inst":"Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Chris Fitzsimmons","author_inst":"Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Tim Harris","author_inst":"Barts Health NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Fiona Lecky","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Andrew Lee","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Ian Maconochie","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Darren Walter","author_inst":"Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"emergency medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.10.20172320","rel_title":"Effective reproduction number for COVID-19 in Aotearoa New Zealand","rel_date":"2020-08-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.10.20172320","rel_abs":"The effective reproduction number, Reff, is the average number of secondary cases infected by a primary case, a key measure of the transmission potential for a disease. Compared to many countries, New Zealand has had relatively few COVID-19 cases, many of which were caused by infections acquired overseas. This makes it difficult to use standard methods to estimate Reff. In this work, we use a stochastic model to simulate COVID-19 spread in New Zealand and report the values of Reff from simulations that gave best fit to case data. We estimate that New Zealand had an effective reproduction number Reff = 1.8 for COVID-19 transmission prior to moving into Alert Level 4 on March 25 2020 and that after moving into Alert level 4 this was reduced to Reff = 0.35. Our estimate Reff = 1.8 for reproduction number before Alert Level 4, is relatively low compared to other countries.

We have investigated both waves by a modified SIR-SI infection model, adapted to the data to the Robert-Koch-Institute (RKI) or the Johns- Hopkins-University (JHU). The first wave is characterized by the SIR model: in a perfect lockdown only a small part of the society is infected and the infections end after a certain time. The SI part considers the incompleteness of any lockdown: at the end of the first wave infections do not completely go down to zero, but continue to rise again, but only slowly due to mouth protection, hygiene and distance keeping. During this first wave the number of deceased people follows the number of infected persons with a fixed time interval and percentage: mostly symptomatic ill people have been tested. This applied to nearly all countries observed, with different intervals and percentages. In the present second wave, the number of daily infections has risen again significantly in some countries, and it may be questioned whether this is due to the increased number of tests. The answer may be given by looking at the daily number of deaths. In Germany, Austria, Italy, Great Britain and others this number has still remained at a constant level for six weeks. In these countries a second wave of died people has not yet arrived. The increased number of tests include obviously mostly asymptomatically infected persons, who do not fall ill or die from coronavirus. However, in some countries, like USA or Israel, the second wave did arrive. The numbers of infected and deceased people both have grown. A real second wave is a permanent threat to all countries.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Juergen Mimkes","author_inst":"Paderborn University"},{"author_name":"Rainer Janssen","author_inst":"retired"},{"author_name":"Ann Brower","author_inst":"University of Canterbury"},{"author_name":"Shaun C Hendy","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Alex James","author_inst":"University of Canterbury"},{"author_name":"Matthew Parry","author_inst":"University of Otago"},{"author_name":"Michael J Plank","author_inst":"University of Canterbury"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Steyn","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Carl Marincowitz","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Jose Schutter","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Sarah Connelly","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Elena Sheldon","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Jamie Hall","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Emma Young","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Andrew Bentley","author_inst":"Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, Wythenshawe Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kirsty Challen","author_inst":"Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Chris Fitzsimmons","author_inst":"Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Tim Harris","author_inst":"Barts Health NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Fiona Lecky","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Andrew Lee","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Ian Maconochie","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Darren Walter","author_inst":"Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.10.20172049","rel_title":"Application of Optimal Control to Long Term Dynamics of COVID-19 Disease in South Africa","rel_date":"2020-08-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.10.20172049","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) belongs to the beta-coronavirus family, these include; the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

In this study, we use a set of five differential equations to analyse the effects on long term dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic with optimal control measures. Mathematical analyses of the model without control were done and the basic reproduction number (R0) of the COVID-19 for the South African epidemic determined. The model steady states were also determined, and their analyses presented based on R0: We introduced permissible control measures and formulated an optimal control problem using the Pontraygain Maximum Principle. Our numerical findings suggest that joint implementation of effective mask usage, physical distancing and active screening and testing are effective measures to curtail the spread of the disease on undiagnosed humans.

Once new cases are no longer detected over consecutive days, the probability of elimination is an important measure for informing decisions on when certain COVID-19 restrictions should be relaxed. Our model of COVID-19 spread in New Zealand estimates that after 2-3 weeks of no new reported cases, there is a 95% probability that COVID-19 has been eliminated. We assessed the sensitivity of this estimate to varying model parameters, in particular to different likelihoods of detection of clinical cases and different levels of control effectiveness. Under an optimistic scenario with high detection of clinical cases, a 95% probability of elimination is achieved after 10 consecutive days with no new reported cases, while under a more pessimistic scenario with low case detection it is achieved after 22 days.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rachelle N Binny","author_inst":"Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research"},{"author_name":"Shaun C Hendy","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Alex James","author_inst":"University of Canterbury"},{"author_name":"Audrey Lustig","author_inst":"Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research"},{"author_name":"Michael J Plank","author_inst":"University of Canterbury"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Steyn","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Michael J Plank","author_inst":"University of Canterbury"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Steyn","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Carl Marincowitz","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Jose Schutter","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Sarah Connelly","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Elena Sheldon","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Jamie Hall","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Emma Young","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Andrew Bentley","author_inst":"Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, Wythenshawe Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kirsty Challen","author_inst":"Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Chris Fitzsimmons","author_inst":"Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Tim Harris","author_inst":"Barts Health NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Fiona Lecky","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Andrew Lee","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Ian Maconochie","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Darren Walter","author_inst":"Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.04.20167205","rel_title":"Telmisartan for treatment of Covid-19 patients: an open randomized clinical trial.

Covid-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, is associated with significant respiratory-related morbidity and mortality. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been postulated as tentative pharmacological agents to treat Covid-19-induced lung inflammation. Trial design. This trial is a parallel group, randomized, two arm, open label, multicenter superiority trial with 1:1 allocation ratio. Methods. Participants included patients who were 18 years of age or older and who had been hospitalized with confirmed Covid-19 with 4 or fewer days since symptom onset. Exclusion criteria included intensive care unit admission prior to randomization and use of angiotensin receptor blocker or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors at admission. Participants in the treatment arm received telmisartan 80 mg bid during 14 days plus standard care. Participants in the control arm received standard care alone. Primary outcome was to achieve significant reductions in plasma levels of C-reactive protein in telmisartan treated Covid-19 patients at day 5 and 8 after randomization. Key secondary outcomes included time to discharge evaluated at 15 days after randomization and admission to ICU and death at 15- and 30-days post randomization. We present here a preliminary report. Results. A total of 78 patients were included in the interim analysis, 40 in the telmisartan and 38 in the control groups. CRP levels at day 5 in the control group were 51.1 +\/- 44.8 mg\/L (mean +\/- SD; n=28) and in the telmisartan group were 24.2 +\/- 31.4 mg\/L (mean +\/- SD; n=32, p<0.05). At day 8, CRP levels were 41.6 +\/- 47.6 mg\/L (mean +\/- SD; n=16) and 9.0 +\/- 10.0 mg\/L (mean +\/- SD; n=13, p < 0.05) in the control and telmisartan groups, respectively. Also, analysis of time to discharge by Kaplan-Meier method showed that telmisartan treated patients had statistically significant lower time to discharge (median time to discharge control group=15 days; telmisartan group=9 days). No differences were observed for ICU admission or death. No significant adverse events related to telmisartan were reported. Conclusions. In the present preliminary report, despite the small number of patients studied, ARB telmisartan, a well-known inexpensive safe antihypertensive drug, administered in high doses, demonstrates anti-inflammatory effects and improved morbidity in hospitalized patients infected with SARS -CoV-2, providing support for its use in this serious pandemia (NCT04355936).","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mariano Duarte","author_inst":"Joint first authorship.

However, due to their ecological design, based on large spatial units, they neglect the strong localised air-pollution patterns, and potentially lead to inadequate confounding adjustment. We investigated the effect of long-term exposure to NO2 and PM2.5 on COVID-19 deaths up to June 30, 2020 in England using high geographical resolution. Methods: We included 38 573 COVID-19 deaths up to June 30, 2020 at the Lower Layer Super Output Area level in England (n=32 844 small areas). We retrieved averaged NO2 and PM2.5 concentration during 2014-2018 from the Pollution Climate Mapping. We used Bayesian hierarchical models to quantify the effect of air-pollution while adjusting for a series of confounding and spatial autocorrelation. Findings: We find a 0.5% (95% credible interval: -0.2%-1.2%) and 1.4% (-2.1%-5.1%) increase in COVID-19 mortality rate for every 1g\/m3 increase in NO2 and PM2.5 respectively, after adjusting for confounding and spatial autocorrelation. This corresponds to a posterior probability of a positive effect of 0.93 and 0.78 respectively. The spatial relative risk at LSOA level revealed strong patterns, similar for the different pollutants. This potentially captures the spread of the disease during the first wave of the epidemic. Interpretation: Our study provides some evidence of an effect of long-term NO2 exposure on COVID-19 mortality, while the effect of PM2.5 remains more uncertain.

Hospital-associated transmission has been identified as a major factor in the perpetuation of COVID-19, with healthcare workers at high-risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 and representing important vectors for spread, but not routinely having their clinical observations monitored or being tested for COVID-19. Methods: A single-center, prospective observational study of 60 healthcare workers will explore how many healthcare workers in high-risk areas develop COVID-19 infection over a thirty day period. High-risk areas are defined as COVID positive wards, the intensive care unit or the accident and emergency department. Healthcare workers (HCWs) will be recruited and have daily self-administered nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests. They will also be provided with a wearable medical device to measure their clinical observations during non-working hours, and be asked to complete a daily self-reported symptom questionnaire over the study period. Statistical analysis will assess the proportion of healthcare workers who develop COVID-19 infection as a primary objective, with secondary objectives exploring what symptoms are developed, time-to-event, and deviations in clinical observations. Discussion: At present clinical observations, symptoms and COVID-19 PCR swabs are not routinely undertaken for healthcare workers. If the CEDiD (COVID-19 Early Detection in Doctors and Healthcare Workers) study is successful, it will provide useful information for workforce decisions in reducing hospital-associated transmission of COVID-19. The data will help in determining whether there are early warning signs for development of COVID-19 infections amongst healthcare workers and may contribute to the evidence base advocating for more regular testing of healthcare workers observations, symptoms and COVID-19 status.

The risk of mortality from COVID-19 depends strongly on age and current estimates of the infection fatality ratio do not account for differences in national age profiles. Comparisons of cumulative death trajectories allow the effect and timing of public health interventions to be assessed. Our purpose is to (1) determine whether countries are clustered according to infection fatality ratios and (2) compare interventions to slow the spread of the disease by clustering death trajectories. Methods National age standardised infection fatality ratios were derived from age stratified estimates from China and population estimates from the World Health Organisation. The IFRs were clustered into groups using Gaussian mixture models. Trajectory analysis clustered cumulative death rates in two time windows, 50 and 100 days after the first reported death. Findings Infection fatality ratios from 201 nations were clustered into three groups: young, medium and older, with corresponding means (SD) of 0.20% (0.03%), 0.38% (0.11%) and 0.93% (0.21%). At 50 and 100 days after the first reported death, there were two clusters of cumulative death trajectories from 113 nations with at least 25 deaths reported at 100 days. The first group had slowly increasing or stable cumulative death rates, while the second group had accelerating rates at the end of the time window. Fifty-two nations changed group membership between the time windows. Conclusion A cluster of younger nations have a lower estimated infection fatality ratio than older nations. The effect and timing of public health interventions in preventing the spread of the disease can be tracked by clustering death rate trajectories into stable or accelerating and comparing changes over time.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thu-Lan Kelly","author_inst":"South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Greer Humphrey","author_inst":"South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Caroline Miller","author_inst":"South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline A Bowden","author_inst":"University of Adelaide"},{"author_name":"Joanne Dono","author_inst":"South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Paddy A Phillips","author_inst":"SA Commission on Excellence and Innovation in Health"},{"author_name":"Anne Greenough","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Mauro Basconcel","author_inst":"Hospital Espanol de Buenos Aires"},{"author_name":"Marcela Castro","author_inst":"Hospital de Clinicas Jose de San Martin, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Buenos Aires"},{"author_name":"Javier Coyle","author_inst":"Hospital de Clinicas Jose de San Martin, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Buenos Aires"},{"author_name":"Ignacio Davolos","author_inst":"Hospital de Clinicas Jose de San Martin, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Buenos Aires"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Esparza","author_inst":"Hospital Espanol de Buenos Aires"},{"author_name":"Ignacio Fernandez Criado","author_inst":"Hospital de Clinicas Jose de San Martin, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Buenos Aires"},{"author_name":"Rosana Gregori","author_inst":"Hospital Espanol de Buenos Aires"},{"author_name":"Pedro Mastrodonato","author_inst":"Hospital Espanol de Buenos Aires."},{"author_name":"Maria Rubio","author_inst":"Hospital Espanol de Buenos Aires"},{"author_name":"Sergio Sarquis","author_inst":"Hospital de Clinicas Jose de San Martin, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Buenos Aires"},{"author_name":"Fernando Wahlmann","author_inst":"Hospital Espanol de Buenos Aires"},{"author_name":"Rodolfo Pedro Rothlin","author_inst":"Sociedad Argentina de Farmacologia Clinica, Asociacion Medica Argentina; Asociacion Argentina de Medicamentos, Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Andrew Lee","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Ian Maconochie","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Darren Walter","author_inst":"Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.10.20171777","rel_title":"The effectiveness of tests to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus, and antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, to inform COVID-19 diagnosis: a rapid systematic review","rel_date":"2020-08-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.10.20171777","rel_abs":"Objectives: We undertook a rapid systematic review with the aim of identifying evidence that could be used to answer the following research questions: (1) What is the clinical effectiveness of tests that detect the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to inform COVID-19 diagnosis? (2) What is the clinical effectiveness of tests that detect the presence of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus to inform COVID-19 diagnosis? Design: systematic review and meta-analysis of studies of diagnostic test accuracy. We systematically searched for all published evidence on the effectiveness of tests for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus, or antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, up to 4 May 2020, and assessed relevant studies for risks of bias using the QUADAS-2 framework. Main outcome measures: measures of diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive\/negative predictive value) were the main outcomes of interest. We also included studies that reported influence of testing on subsequent patient management, and that reported virus\/antibody detection rates where these facilitated comparisons of testing in different settings, different populations, or using different sampling methods. Results: 38 studies on SARS-CoV-2 virus testing and 25 studies on SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing were identified. We identified high or unclear risks of bias in the majority of studies, most commonly as a result of unclear methods of patient selection and test conduct, or because of the use of a reference standard that may not definitively diagnose COVID-19. The majority were in hospital settings, in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection. Pooled analysis of 16 studies (3818 patients) estimated a sensitivity of 87.8% (95% confidence interval 81.5% to 92.2%) for an initial reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test. For antibody tests, ten studies reported diagnostic accuracy outcomes: sensitivity ranged from 18.4% to 96.1% and specificity 88.9% to 100%. However, the lack of a true reference standard for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis makes it challenging to assess the true diagnostic accuracy of these tests. Eighteen studies reporting different sampling methods suggest that for virus tests, the type of sample obtained\/type of tissue sampled could influence test accuracy. Finally we searched for, but did not identify, any evidence on how any test influences subsequent patient management. Conclusions: Evidence is rapidly emerging on the effectiveness of tests for COVID-19 diagnosis and management, but important uncertainties about their effectiveness and most appropriate application remain. Estimates of diagnostic accuracy should be interpreted bearing in mind the absence of a definitive reference standard to diagnose or rule out COVID-19 infection. More evidence is needed about the effectiveness of testing outside of hospital settings and in mild or asymptomatic cases. Implementation of public health strategies centred on COVID-19 testing provides opportunities to explore these important areas of research.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Jarrom","author_inst":"Health Technology Wales, Velindre University NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Lauren Elston","author_inst":"Health Technology Wales, Velindre University NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Washington","author_inst":"Velindre University NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Matthew Prettyjohns","author_inst":"Health Technology Wales, Velindre University NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Kimberley Cann","author_inst":"Health Technology Wales, Velindre University NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Susan Myles","author_inst":"Health Technology Wales, Velindre University NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Anne Greenough","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Mauro Basconcel","author_inst":"Hospital Espanol de Buenos Aires"},{"author_name":"Marcela Castro","author_inst":"Hospital de Clinicas Jose de San Martin, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Buenos Aires"},{"author_name":"Javier Coyle","author_inst":"Hospital de Clinicas Jose de San Martin, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Buenos Aires"},{"author_name":"Ignacio Davolos","author_inst":"Hospital de Clinicas Jose de San Martin, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Buenos Aires"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Esparza","author_inst":"Hospital Espanol de Buenos Aires"},{"author_name":"Ignacio Fernandez Criado","author_inst":"Hospital de Clinicas Jose de San Martin, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Buenos Aires"},{"author_name":"Rosana Gregori","author_inst":"Hospital Espanol de Buenos Aires"},{"author_name":"Pedro Mastrodonato","author_inst":"Hospital Espanol de Buenos Aires."},{"author_name":"Maria Rubio","author_inst":"Hospital Espanol de Buenos Aires"},{"author_name":"Sergio Sarquis","author_inst":"Hospital de Clinicas Jose de San Martin, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Buenos Aires"},{"author_name":"Fernando Wahlmann","author_inst":"Hospital Espanol de Buenos Aires"},{"author_name":"Rodolfo Pedro Rothlin","author_inst":"Sociedad Argentina de Farmacologia Clinica, Asociacion Medica Argentina; Asociacion Argentina de Medicamentos, Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Andrew Lee","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Ian Maconochie","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Darren Walter","author_inst":"Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.07.20163402","rel_title":"A Large-Scale Clinical Validation Study Using nCapp Cloud Plus Terminal by Frontline Doctors for the Rapid Diagnosis of COVID-19 and COVID-19 pneumonia in China","rel_date":"2020-08-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.07.20163402","rel_abs":"Background The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic acute infectious disease, especially with the features of possible asymptomatic carriers and high contagiousness. It causes acute respiratory distress syndrome and results in a high mortality rate if pneumonia is involved. Currently, it is difficult to quickly identify asymptomatic cases or COVID-19 patients with pneumonia due to limited access to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) nucleic acid tests and CT scans, which facilitates the spread of the disease at the community level, and contributes to the overwhelming of medical resources in intensive care units. Goal This study aimed to develop a scientific and rigorous clinical diagnostic tool for the rapid prediction of COVID-19 cases based on a COVID-19 clinical case database in China, and to assist global frontline doctors to efficiently and precisely diagnose asymptomatic COVID-19 patients and cases who had a false-negative RT-PCR test result. Methods With online consent, and the approval of the ethics committee of Zhongshan Hospital Fudan Unversity (approval number B2020-032R) to ensure that patient privacy is protected, clinical information has been uploaded in real-time through the New Coronavirus Intelligent Auto-diagnostic Assistant Application of cloud plus terminal (nCapp) by doctors from different cities (Wuhan, Shanghai, Harbin, Dalian, Wuxi, Qingdao, Rizhao, and Bengbu) during the COVID-19 outbreak in China. By quality control and data anonymization on the platform, a total of 3,249 cases from COVID-19 high-risk groups were collected. These patients had SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results and chest CT scans, both of which were used as the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and COVID-19 pneumonia. In particular, the dataset included 137 indeterminate cases who initially did not have RT-PCR tests and subsequently had positive RT-PCR results, 62 suspected cases who initially had false-negative RT-PCR test results and subsequently had positive RT-PCR results, and 122 asymptomatic cases who had positive RT-PCR test results, amongst whom 31 cases were diagnosed. We also integrated the function of a survey in nCapp to collect user feedback from frontline doctors. Findings We applied the statistical method of a multi-factor regression model to the training dataset (1,624 cases) and developed a prediction model for COVID-19 with 9 clinical indicators that are fast and accessible: 'Residing or visiting history in epidemic regions', 'Exposure history to COVID-19 patient', 'Dry cough', 'Fatigue', 'Breathlessness', 'No body temperature decrease after antibiotic treatment', 'Fingertip blood oxygen saturation<=93%', 'Lymphopenia', and 'C-reactive protein (CRP) increased'. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) for the model was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.89) in the training dataset and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.82, 0.86) in the validation dataset (1,625 cases). To ensure the sensitivity of the model, we used a cutoff value of 0.09. The sensitivity and specificity of the model were 98.0% (95% CI: 96.9%, 99.1%) and 17.3% (95% CI: 15.0%, 19.6%), respectively, in the training dataset, and 96.5% (95% CI: 95.1%, 98.0%) and 18.8% (95% CI: 16.4%, 21.2%), respectively, in the validation dataset. In the subset of the 137 indeterminate cases who initially did not have RT-PCR tests and subsequently had positive RT-PCR results, the model predicted 132 cases, accounting for 96.4% (95% CI: 91.7%, 98.8%) of the cases. In the subset of the 62 suspected cases who initially had false-negative RT-PCR test results and subsequently had positive RT-PCR results, the model predicted 59 cases, accounting for 95.2% (95% CI: 86.5%, 99.0%) of the cases. Considering the specificity of the model, we used a cutoff value of 0.32. The sensitivity and specificity of the model were 83.5% (95% CI: 80.5%, 86.4%) and 83.2% (95% CI: 80.9%, 85.5%), respectively, in the training dataset, and 79.6% (95% CI: 76.4%, 82.8%) and 81.3% (95% CI: 78.9%, 83.7%), respectively, in the validation dataset, which is very close to the published AI model. The results of the online survey 'Questionnaire Star' showed that 90.9% of nCapp users in WeChat mini programs were 'satisfied' or 'very satisfied' with the tool. The WeChat mini program received a significantly higher satisfaction rate than other platforms, especially for 'availability and sharing convenience of the App' and 'fast speed of log-in and data entry'. Discussion With the assistance of nCapp, a mobile-based diagnostic tool developed from a large database that we collected from COVID-19 high-risk groups in China, frontline doctors can rapidly identify asymptomatic patients and avoid misdiagnoses of cases with false-negative RT-PCR results. These patients require timely isolation or close medical supervision. By applying the model, medical resources can be allocated more reasonably, and missed diagnoses can be reduced. In addition, further education and interaction among medical professionals can improve the diagnostic efficiency for COVID-19, thus avoiding the transmission of the disease from asymptomatic patients at the community level.","rel_num_authors":34,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dawei Yang","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Tao Xu","author_inst":"the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University"},{"author_name":"Xun Wang","author_inst":"The Affiliated Wuxi No.2 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Deng Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Ziqiang Zhang","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji University"},{"author_name":"Lichuan Zhang","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated of Dalian University"},{"author_name":"Jie Liu","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Kui Xiao","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Li Bai","author_inst":"Xinqiao Hospital, Army Medical University (Third Military Medical University)"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhang","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Lin Zhao","author_inst":"Rizhao People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lin Tong","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Chaomin Wu","author_inst":"QingPu Branch of Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yaoli Wang","author_inst":"Wound Trauma Medical Center, State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Daping Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chunling Dong","author_inst":"The Second Hospital of Jilin University"},{"author_name":"Maosong Ye","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yu Xu","author_inst":"Xinqiao Hospital, Army Medical University (Third Military Medical University)"},{"author_name":"Zhenju Song","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Hong Chen","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jiwei Wang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Fei Tan","author_inst":"Shanghai Duomu Vision Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Hai Yu","author_inst":"Shanghai Duomu Vision Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Jian Zhou","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jinming Yu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Chunhua Du","author_inst":"the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University"},{"author_name":"Hongqing Zhao","author_inst":"The Affiliated Wuxi No.2 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yu Shang","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Harbin"},{"author_name":"Linian Huang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jianping Zhao","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College Huazhong University of Science & Technology"},{"author_name":"Yang Jin","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Charles A.

This nonspecific immunity gained our interest, especially after initial reports of less cases in countries with universal BCG vaccination. In hopes of possible protective immunity, all staff of the Emirates International Hospital (United Arab Emirates) were offered a booster BCG vaccine in early March 2020. All the hospital staff were then tested for Covid-19 infection by the end of June 2020. Methodology : We divided the subjects into two groups: booster vaccinated, versus unvaccinated. The rate of Covid-19 infection was compared between the groups. Criteria included all staff who were offered the vaccine. Results: 71 subjects received the booster vaccination. This group had zero cases of positive COVID 19 infection. 209 subjects did not receive the vaccination, with 18 positive PCR confirmed COVID 19 cases The infection rate in the unvaccinated group was 8.6% versus zero in the booster vaccinated group.

Dyspnea is challenging to assess remotely, and the accuracy of subjective dyspnea measures in capturing hypoxemia have not been formally evaluated for COVID-19. We explored the accuracy of subjective dyspnea in diagnosing hypoxemia in COVID-19 patients. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of consecutive outpatients with COVID-19 who met criteria for home oxygen saturation monitoring at a university-affiliated acute care hospital in Toronto, Canada from April 3, 2020 to June 8, 2020. Hypoxemia was defined by oxygen saturation <95%. Dyspnea measures were treated as diagnostic tests, and we determined their sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), negative\/positive predictive value (NPV\/PPV), and positive\/negative likelihood ratios (+LR\/-LR) for detecting hypoxemia. Results: During the study period 64\/298 (21.5%) of patients met criteria for home oxygen saturation monitoring, and of these 14\/64 (21.9%) were diagnosed with hypoxemia. The presence\/absence of dyspnea had limited accuracy for diagnosing hypoxemia, with SN 57% (95% CI 30-81%), SP 78% (63%-88%), NPV 86% (72%-94%), PPV 42% (21%-66%), +LR 2.55 (1.3-5.1), -LR 0.55 (0.3-1.0). An mMRC dyspnea score >1 (SP 97%, 95%CI 82%-100%), Roth Maximal Count <12 (SP 100%, 95%CI 75-100%), and Roth Counting time < 8 seconds (SP 93%, 95%CI 66%-100%) had high SP that could be used to rule in hypoxemia, but displayed low SN ([&le;]50%). Conclusions: Subjective dyspnea measures have inadequate accuracy for ruling out hypoxemia in high-risk patients with COVID-19.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization and has caused over 550,000 deaths worldwide as of July 2020. Accurate and scalable point-of-care devices would increase screening, diagnosis, and monitoring of COVID-19 patients. Here, we demonstrate rapid label-free electrochemical detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using a commercially available impedance sensing platform. A 16-well plate containing sensing electrodes was pre-coated with receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and subsequently tested with samples of anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody CR3022 (0.1 g\/ml, 1.0 g\/ml, 10 g\/ml). Subsequent blinded testing was performed on six serum specimens taken from COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients (1:100 dilution factor). The platform was able to differentiate spikes in impedance measurements from a negative control (1% milk solution) for all CR3022 samples. Further, successful differentiation and detection of all positive clinical samples from negative control was achieved. Measured impedance values were consistent when compared to standard ELISA test results showing a strong correlation between them (R2 = 0:9). Detection occurs in less than five minutes and the well-based platform provides a simplified and familiar testing interface that can be readily adaptable for use in clinical settings.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohamed Z.

Two factors prevent accurate diagnosis: the failure of sampling methods (e.g., 40% false negatives from PCR testing of nasopharyngeal swabs) and sampling-time-dependent failures reflecting individual humoral responses of patients (e.g., serological testing outside of the sero-positive stage). Here, we report development of a diagnostic protocol that achieves full PPV and NPV based on a cohort of 500 confirmed COVID-19 cases, and present several discoveries about the sero-conversion dynamics throughout the disease course of COVID-19. The fundamental enabling technology for our study and diagnostic protocol-termed SANE, for Symptom (dpo)-Antibody-Nucleic acid-Epidemiological history-is our development of a peptide-protein hybrid microarray (PPHM) for COVID-19. The peptides comprising PPHMCOVID-19 were selected based on clinical sample data, and give our technology the unique capacity to monitor a patient's humoral response throughout the disease course. Among other assay-development related and clinically relevant findings, our use of PPHMCOVID-19 revealed that 5% of COVID-19 patients are from an \"early sero-reversion\" subpopulation, thus explaining many of the mis-diagnoses we found in our comparative testing using PCR, CLIA, and PPHMCOVID-19. Accordingly, the full SANE protocol incorporates orthogonal technologies to account for these patient variations, and successfully overcomes both the sampling method and sampling time limitations that have previously prevented doctors from achieving unambiguous, accurate diagnosis of COVID-19","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hu Cheng","author_inst":"Division of Nanobiomedicine, Suzhou Institute of Nano-Tech and Nano-Bionics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Suzhou, 215123, China.

Initial evaluation showed that the two models had a net correspondence with the reported data during this period for cumulative infected cases but the number of cumulative deaths was underestimated with the classical SEIR model. Model prediction with the SEIRDP concluded that the number of cumulative infected cases will increase in the next days reaching a number of about 60 k in middle November with a median of about 300 daily cases. Also, the number of estimated deaths will be around 2k.

Novel therapies are urgently needed. Janus-kinase (JAK) inhibitors and Type I interferons have emerged as potential antiviral candidates for COVID-19 patients for their proven efficacy against diseases with excessive cytokine release and by their ability to promote viral clearance in past coronaviruses, respectively. We conducted a systemic review and meta-analysis to evaluate role of these therapies in COVID-19 patients. Methods MEDLINE and MedRxiv were searched until July 30th, 2020, including studies that compared treatment outcomes of humans treated with JAK-inhibitor or Type I interferon against controls. Inclusion necessitated data with clear risk estimates or those that permitted back-calculation. Results We searched 733 studies, ultimately including four randomized and eleven non-randomized clinical trials. JAK-inhibitor recipients had significantly reduced odds of mortality (OR, 0.12; 95%CI, 0.03-0.39, p=0.0005) and ICU admission (OR, 0.05; 95%CI, 0.01-0.26, p=0.0005), and had significantly increased odds of hospital discharge (OR, 22.76; 95%CI, 10.68-48.54, p<0.00001), when compared to standard treatment group. Type I interferon recipients had significantly reduced odds of mortality (OR, 0.19; 95%CI, 0.04-0.85, p=0.03), and increased odds of discharge bordering significance (OR, 1.89; 95%CI, 1.00-3.59, p=0.05). Conclusions JAK-inhibitor treatment is significantly associated with positive clinical outcomes regarding mortality, ICU admission, and discharge. Type I interferon treatment is associated with positive clinical outcomes regarding mortality and discharge. While these data show promise, additional randomized clinical trials are needed to further elucidate the efficacy of JAK-inhibitors and Type I interferons and clinical outcomes in COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lucas Walz","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health; Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Avi J.

We highlight the epidemiological impact of barriers to adoption of public health recommendations by urban slum populations in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and the potential role of community-based initiatives to coordinate efforts that support cases and high-risk contacts. Methods: Daily case updates published by the National Public Health Institute of Liberia were used to inform a stratified stochastic compartmental model representing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in two subpopulations (urban poor versus less socioeconomically vulnerable) of Montserrado County, Liberia. Differential transmission was considered at levels of the subpopulation, household versus community, and events (i.e., funerals). Adoption of home-isolation behavior was assumed to be related to the proportion of each subpopulation residing in housing units with multiple rooms, access to sanitation facilities, and access to basic goods like water and food. Percentage reductions in cumulative infection counts, cumulative counts of severe cases, and maximum daily infection counts for each subpopulation were evaluated across intervention scenarios that included symptom-triggered, community-driven efforts to support high-risk contacts and confirmed cases in self-isolation following the scheduled lifting of the state of emergency. Results: Modeled outbreaks for the status quo scenario differed between the two subpopulations, with increased overall infection burden but decreased numbers of severe cases in the urban poor subpopulation relative to the less socioeconomically vulnerable population after 180 days post-introduction into Liberia. With more proactive self-isolation by mildly symptomatic individuals after lifting of the public health emergency, median reductions in cumulative infections, severe cases, and maximum daily incidence were 7.6% (IQR: 2.2%-20.9%), 7.0% (2.0%-18.5%), and 9.9% (2.5%-31.4%) for cumulative infections, severe cases, and maximum daily incidence, respectively, across epidemiological curve simulations in the urban poor subpopulation and 16.8% (5.5%-29.3%), 15.0% (5.0%-26.4%), and 28.1% (IQR: 9.3%-47.8%) in the less socioeconomically vulnerable population. An increase in the maximum attainable percentage of behavior adoption by the urban slum subpopulation, with the provision of support to facilitate self-isolation or quarantine, was associated with median reductions in cumulative infections, severe cases, and maximum daily incidence were 19.2% (IQR: 10.1%-34.0%), 21.1% (IQR: 13.3%-34.2%), and 26.0% (IQR: 11.5%-48.9%), respectively, relative to the status quo scenario. Conclusions: Broadly supported post-lockdown recommendations that prioritize proactively monitoring symptoms, seeking testing and isolating at home by confirmed cases are limited by resource constraints in urban poor communities. Investing in community-based initiatives that determine needs and coordinate needs-based support for self-identified cases and their contacts could provide a more effective, longer-term strategy for suppressing transmission of COVID-19 in settings with prevalent distrust and socioeconomic vulnerabilities.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Laura Skrip","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Mosoka P Fallah","author_inst":"National Public Health Institute of Liberia"},{"author_name":"Jamie Bedson","author_inst":"Individual Consultant"},{"author_name":"Laurent H\u00e9bert-Dufresne","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Muir Althouse","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Charles S.

For two months, Australians were asked to remain at home and only leave for essential activities. We investigate the impact this had on sexual and reproductive health (SRH). Methods: Australians aged 18+ were eligible to participate in an online survey from 23 April-11 May 2020. Questions included contraceptive use, pregnancy intentions and access to SRH services. We report on the experiences of 518 female participants aged <50 years. Pregnancy intentions and contraceptive use were analysed using descriptive statistics. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to investigate difficulty accessing SRH products and services. Qualitative data were analysed using descriptive thematic analysis. Results: Most participants (55.4%, 287\/518) were aged 18-24 years. Most (76.1%, 379\/498) indicated they were trying to avoid pregnancy. The oral contraceptive pill was the most common single method used (20.8%; 107\/514). Nearly 20% (101\/514) reported they were not using contraception. Older women (OR=0.4; 95%CI: 0.1, 0.9 for 25-34 vs 18-24 years) and those employed (OR=0.4; 95%CI: 0.2, 0.7) had less trouble accessing contraception during lockdown. Women aged 25-34 (OR=0.4; 95%CI: 0.3, 0.7) or 35-49 years (OR=0.3; 95%CI: 0.1, 0.6) were less likely to experience difficulty accessing feminine hygiene products. Qualitative analysis suggested that COVID-19 affected pregnancy plans, with participants delaying childbearing, or deciding to remain childfree. Conclusion: COVID-19 lockdown impacted the SRH of Australian women. Findings highlight the importance of continued access to SRH services and products during global emergencies.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jacqueline Coombe","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Fabian Kong","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Helen Bittleston","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Hennie Williams","author_inst":"Melbourne Sexual Health Centre & The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Jane Tomnay","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Alaina Vaisey","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Sue Malta","author_inst":"National Ageing Research Institute & The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Jane Goller","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Meredith Temple-Smith","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Louise Bourchier","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Andrew Lau","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Jane S Hocking","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Lan Yang","author_inst":"Division of Nanobiomedicine, Suzhou Institute of Nano-Tech and Nano-Bionics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Suzhou, 215123, China."},{"author_name":"Wenwen Xu","author_inst":"Division of Nanobiomedicine, Suzhou Institute of Nano-Tech and Nano-Bionics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Suzhou, 215123, China."},{"author_name":"Shanhui Wu","author_inst":"Department of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, The First Affiliated Hosp"},{"author_name":"Cuiying Liang","author_inst":"Department of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, The First Affiliated Hosp"},{"author_name":"Hui Wang","author_inst":"Department of Medical Laboratory, The Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430014, China."},{"author_name":"Baoqing Sun","author_inst":"Department of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, The First Affiliated Hosp"},{"author_name":"Nanshan Zhong","author_inst":"Department of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, The First Affiliated Hosp"},{"author_name":"Hongwei Ma","author_inst":"Division of Nanobiomedicine, Suzhou Institute of Nano-Tech and Nano-Bionics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Suzhou, 215123, China."},{"author_name":"Jiwei Wang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Fei Tan","author_inst":"Shanghai Duomu Vision Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Hai Yu","author_inst":"Shanghai Duomu Vision Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Jian Zhou","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jinming Yu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Chunhua Du","author_inst":"the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University"},{"author_name":"Hongqing Zhao","author_inst":"The Affiliated Wuxi No.2 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yu Shang","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Harbin"},{"author_name":"Linian Huang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jianping Zhao","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College Huazhong University of Science & Technology"},{"author_name":"Yang Jin","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Charles A.

Nsp15, a uridine-specific endoribonuclease found in all coronaviruses, processes viral RNA to evade detection by RNA-activated host defense systems, making it a promising drug target. Previous work with SARS-CoV-1 established that Nsp15 is active as a hexamer, yet how Nsp15 recognizes and processes viral RNA remains unknown. Here we report a series of cryo-EM reconstructions of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15. The UTP-bound cryo-EM reconstruction at 3.36 [A] resolution provides molecular details into how critical residues within the Nsp15 active site recognize uridine and facilitate catalysis of the phosphodiester bond, whereas the apo-states reveal active site conformational heterogeneity. We further demonstrate the specificity and mechanism of nuclease activity by analyzing Nsp15 products using mass spectrometry. Collectively, these findings advance understanding of how Nsp15 processes viral RNA and provide a structural framework for the development of new therapeutics.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Monica C Pillon","author_inst":"NIEHS\/NIH"},{"author_name":"Meredith N Frazier","author_inst":"NIEHS\/NIH"},{"author_name":"Lucas Dillard","author_inst":"NIEHS\/NIH"},{"author_name":"Jason G Williams","author_inst":"NIEHS\/NIH"},{"author_name":"Seda Kocaman","author_inst":"NIEHS\/NIH"},{"author_name":"Juno M Krahn","author_inst":"NIEHS\/NIH"},{"author_name":"Lalith Perera","author_inst":"NIEHS\/NIH"},{"author_name":"Cassandra K Hayne","author_inst":"NIEHS\/NIH"},{"author_name":"Jacob Gordon","author_inst":"NIEHS\/NIH"},{"author_name":"Zachary D Stewart","author_inst":"NIEHS\/NIH"},{"author_name":"Mack Sobhany","author_inst":"NIEHS\/NIH"},{"author_name":"Leesa J Deterding","author_inst":"NIEHS\/NIH"},{"author_name":"Allen L.

In a theory of the origin of SARS-CoV-2, pangolins were considered a potential intermediate host. To assemble the coronavirus found in pangolins, SARS-CoV-2 were used a reference genome in most of studies, assuming that pangolins CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are the closest neighbors in the evolution. However, this assumption may not be true. We investigated how the selection of reference genome affect the resulting CoV genome assembly. We explored various representative CoV as reference genome, and found significant differences in the resulting assemblies. The assembly obtained using RaTG13 as reference showed better statistics in total length and N50 than the assembly guided by SARS-CoV-2, indicating that RaTG13 maybe a better reference for assembling CoV in pangolin or other potential intermediate hosts.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yuan Liu","author_inst":"North Dakota State University"},{"author_name":"Changhui Yan","author_inst":"North Dakota State University"},{"author_name":"Kie Hoon Jung","author_inst":"Institute for Antiviral Research, Utah State University"},{"author_name":"Paolo La Colla","author_inst":"Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Cagliari"},{"author_name":"Gabriella Collu","author_inst":"Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Cagliari"},{"author_name":"Adel Moussa","author_inst":"Atea Pharmaceuticals, Inc."},{"author_name":"Bruno Canard","author_inst":"Architecture et Fonction des Macromol\u00e8cules Biologiques - CNRS UMR"},{"author_name":"Jean-Pierre Sommadossi","author_inst":"Atea Pharmaceuticals, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jacob Gordon","author_inst":"NIEHS\/NIH"},{"author_name":"Zachary D Stewart","author_inst":"NIEHS\/NIH"},{"author_name":"Mack Sobhany","author_inst":"NIEHS\/NIH"},{"author_name":"Leesa J Deterding","author_inst":"NIEHS\/NIH"},{"author_name":"Allen L.

Thanks to the rapid work of Chinese scientists, the pathogen now called SARS-CoV-2 has been identified and its whole genome has been deposited in public databases by early January 2020. The availability of the genome has allowed researchers to develop Reverse Transcription - Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assays, which are now the gold-standard for molecular diagnosis of the respiratory syndrome COVID19. Because of the rising number of cases and rapid spreading, the world has been facing a shortage of RT-PCR supplies, especially the ones involved in RNA extraction. This has been a major bottleneck to increase testing capacity in many countries that do not significantly manufacture these supplies (Brazil included). Additionally, RT-PCR scalability is highly dependent on equipment that usually perform testing of 96 samples at a time. In this work, we describe a cost-effective molecular NGS-based test for diagnosis of COVID19, which uses a single-step RNA extraction and presents high scalability and accuracy when compared to the gold-standard RT-PCR. A single run of the NGS-based test using the Illumina NextSeq 550 mid-end sequencing equipment is able to multiplex 1,536 patient samples, providing individual semi-qualitative results (detected, not detected). Detected results are provided with fragments per million (FPM) values, which was demonstrated to correlate with RT-PCR Cycle Threshold (CT) values. Besides, usage of the high-end Illumina Novaseq platform may yield diagnostic for up to 6,144 samples in a single run. Performance results when compared with RT-PCR show general accuracy of 96% (or 98% when only samples with CT values for gene N lower than 30 are considered). We have also developed an online platform, called VarsVID, a Varstation feature, to help test executors to easily scale testing numbers. Sample registering, wet-lab worksheets, sample sheet for sequencing and results display are all features provided by VarsVID on Varstation. Altogether, these results will contribute to control COVID19 pandemics.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fernanda de Mello Malta","author_inst":"Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein"},{"author_name":"Deyvid Emanuel Amgarten","author_inst":"Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein"},{"author_name":"Felipe Camilo Val","author_inst":"Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein"},{"author_name":"Rubia Anita Ferraz Santana","author_inst":"Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein"},{"author_name":"Murilo Castro Cervato","author_inst":"Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein"},{"author_name":"Bruna Mascaro Cordeiro de Azevedo","author_inst":"Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein"},{"author_name":"Marcela de Souza Basqueira","author_inst":"Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein"},{"author_name":"Camila Oliveira dos Santos Alves","author_inst":"Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein"},{"author_name":"Maria Soares Nobrega","author_inst":"Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein"},{"author_name":"Joao Renato Rebello Pinho","author_inst":"Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein"},{"author_name":"Mack Sobhany","author_inst":"NIEHS\/NIH"},{"author_name":"Leesa J Deterding","author_inst":"NIEHS\/NIH"},{"author_name":"Allen L.

We aimed to determine the accuracy of post-exertional oxygen saturation for predicting adverse outcome in suspected COVID-19. Methods We undertook an observational cohort study across 70 emergency departments during first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. We collected data prospectively, using a standardised assessment form, and retrospectively, using hospital records, from patients with suspected COVID-19, and reviewed hospital records at 30 days for adverse outcome (death or receiving organ support). Patients with post-exertion oxygen saturation recorded were selected for this analysis. Results We analysed data from 817 patients with post-exertion oxygen saturation recorded after excluding 54 in whom measurement appeared unfeasible. The c-statistic for post-exertion change in oxygen saturation was 0.589 (95% confidence interval 0.465 to 0.713), and the positive and negative likelihood ratios of a 3% or more desaturation were respectively 1.78 (1.25 to 2.53) and 0.67 (0.46 to 0.98). Multivariable analysis showed that post-exertion oxygen saturation was not a significant predictor of adverse outcome when baseline clinical assessment was taken into account (p=0.368). Secondary analysis excluding patients in whom post-exertion measurement appeared inappropriate resulted in a c-statistic of 0.699 (0.581 to 0.817), likelihood ratios of 1.98 (1.26 to 3.10) and 0.61 (0.35 to 1.07), and some evidence of additional prognostic value on multivariable analysis (p=0.019). Conclusions Post-exertion oxygen saturation provides modest prognostic information in the assessment of patients attending the emergency department with suspected COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Steve Goodacre","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Ben Thomas","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Ellen Lee","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Laura Sutton","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Katie Biggs","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Carl Marincowitz","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Amanda Loban","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Simon Waterhouse","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Richard Simmonds","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Jose Schutter","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Sarah Connelly","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Elena Sheldon","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Jamie Hall","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Emma Young","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Andrew Bentley","author_inst":"Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, Wythenshawe Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kirsty Challen","author_inst":"Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Chris Fitzsimmons","author_inst":"Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Tim Harris","author_inst":"Barts Health NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Fiona Lecky","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Andrew Lee","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Ian Maconochie","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Darren Walter","author_inst":"Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Hai Yu","author_inst":"Shanghai Duomu Vision Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Jian Zhou","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jinming Yu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Chunhua Du","author_inst":"the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University"},{"author_name":"Hongqing Zhao","author_inst":"The Affiliated Wuxi No.2 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yu Shang","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Harbin"},{"author_name":"Linian Huang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jianping Zhao","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College Huazhong University of Science & Technology"},{"author_name":"Yang Jin","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Charles A.

Several animal models have been rapidly developed that recapitulate the asymptomatic to moderate disease spectrum. Now, there is a direct need for additional small animal models to study the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and for fast-tracked medical countermeasure development. Here, we show that transgenic mice expressing the human SARS-CoV-2 receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [hACE2]) under a cytokeratin 18 promoter (K18) are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and that infection resulted in a dose-dependent lethal disease course. After inoculation with either 104 TCID50 or 105 TCID50, the SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in rapid weight loss in both groups and uniform lethality in the 105 TCID50 group. High levels of viral RNA shedding were observed from the upper and lower respiratory tract and intermittent shedding was observed from the intestinal tract. Inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in upper and lower respiratory tract infection with high infectious virus titers in nasal turbinates, trachea and lungs. The observed interstitial pneumonia and pulmonary pathology, with SARS-CoV-2 replication evident in pneumocytes, were similar to that reported in severe cases of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration in the lungs and upregulation of Th1 and proinflammatory cytokines\/chemokines. Extrapulmonary replication of SARS-CoV-2 was observed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of several animals at 7 DPI but not at 3 DPI. The rapid inflammatory response and observed pathology bears resemblance to COVID-19. Taken together, this suggests that this mouse model can be useful for studies of pathogenesis and medical countermeasure development.\n\nAuthors SummaryThe disease manifestation of COVID-19 in humans range from asymptomatic to severe. While several mild to moderate disease models have been developed, there is still a need for animal models that recapitulate the severe and fatal progression observed in a subset of patients. Here, we show that humanized transgenic mice developed dose-dependent disease when inoculated with SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19. The mice developed upper and lower respiratory tract infection, with virus replication also in the brain after day 3 post inoculation. The pathological and immunological diseases manifestation observed in these mice bears resemblance to human COVID-19, suggesting increased usefulness of this model for elucidating COVID-19 pathogenesis further and testing of countermeasures, both of which are urgently needed.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Claude Kwe Yinda","author_inst":"RML"},{"author_name":"Julia R Port","author_inst":"RML"},{"author_name":"Trenton J Bushmaker","author_inst":"RML"},{"author_name":"Irene Offei Owusu","author_inst":"RML"},{"author_name":"Victoria A Avanzato","author_inst":"RML"},{"author_name":"Robert J Fischer","author_inst":"RML"},{"author_name":"Jonathan E Schulz","author_inst":"RML"},{"author_name":"Myndi G Holbrook","author_inst":"RML"},{"author_name":"Madison J Hebner","author_inst":"RML"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Rosenke","author_inst":"RML"},{"author_name":"Tina Thomas","author_inst":"RML"},{"author_name":"Andrea Marzi","author_inst":"RML"},{"author_name":"Sonja M Best","author_inst":"RML"},{"author_name":"Emmie de Wit","author_inst":"NIAID, NIH"},{"author_name":"Carl Shaia","author_inst":"RML"},{"author_name":"Neeltje van Doremalen","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Luca Coppeda","author_inst":"University of Rome Tor Vergata"},{"author_name":"Andrea Magrini","author_inst":"University of Rome Tor Vergata"},{"author_name":"Nicola Moricca","author_inst":"Villa dei Pini"},{"author_name":"Stefano Sabatini","author_inst":"Villa dei Pini"},{"author_name":"Felice Rosapepe","author_inst":"Pineta Grande Hospital"},{"author_name":"Pier Luigi Bartoletti","author_inst":"Fimmg"},{"author_name":"Sergio Bernardini","author_inst":"University of Rome Tor Vergata"},{"author_name":"Massimo Andreoni","author_inst":"University of Rome Tor Vergata"},{"author_name":"Piera Valenti","author_inst":"University of Rome La Sapienza"},{"author_name":"Luca Bianchi","author_inst":"University of Rome Tor Vergata"},{"author_name":"Yu Shang","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Harbin"},{"author_name":"Linian Huang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jianping Zhao","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College Huazhong University of Science & Technology"},{"author_name":"Yang Jin","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Charles A.
