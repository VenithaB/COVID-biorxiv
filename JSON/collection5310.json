Current confirmed COVID-19 case counts in the U.S. do not capture the total burden of the pandemic because testing has been primarily restricted to individuals with moderate to severe symptoms due to limited test availability. Using a semi-Bayesian probabilistic bias analysis to account for incomplete testing and imperfect diagnostic accuracy, we estimated 6,275,072 cumulative infections compared to 721,245 confirmed cases (1.9% vs. 0.2% of the population) as of April 18, 2020. Accounting for uncertainty, the number of infections was 3 to 20 times higher than the number of confirmed cases. 86% (simulation interval: 64-99%) of this difference was due to incomplete testing, while 14% (0.3-36%) was due to imperfect test accuracy. Estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infections that transparently account for testing practices and diagnostic accuracy reveal that the pandemic is larger than confirmed case counts suggest.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sean L Wu","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Andrew Mertens","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Yoshika S Crider","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Anna Nguyen","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Nolan N Pokpongkiat","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Djajadi","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Anmol Seth","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Michelle S Hsiang","author_inst":"University of Texas, Southwestern"},{"author_name":"John M Colford","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Art Reingold","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Benjamin F Arnold","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Alan Hubbard","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Jade Benjamin-Chung","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.06.20092841","rel_title":"Modeling the impact of social distancing, testing, contact tracing and household quarantine on second-wave scenarios of the COVID-19 epidemic","rel_date":"2020-05-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.06.20092841","rel_abs":"The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has required the implementation of severe mobility restrictions and social distancing measures worldwide. While these measures have been proven effective in abating the epidemic in several countries, it is important to estimate the effectiveness of testing and tracing strategies to avoid a potential second wave of the COVID-19 epidemic. We integrate highly detailed (anonymized, privacy-enhanced) mobility data from mobile devices, with census and demographic data to build a detailed agent-based model to describe the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the Boston metropolitan area. We find that enforcing strict social distancing followed by a policy based on a robust level of testing, contact-tracing and household quarantine, could keep the disease at a level that does not exceed the capacity of the health care system. Assuming the identification of 50% of the symptomatic infections, and the tracing of 40% of their contacts and households, which corresponds to about 9% of individuals quarantined, the ensuing reduction in transmission allows the reopening of economic activities while attaining a manageable impact on the health care system. Our results show that a response system based on enhanced testing and contact tracing can play a major role in relaxing social distancing interventions in the absence of herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alberto Aleta","author_inst":"ISI Foundation"},{"author_name":"David Martin-Corral","author_inst":"Universidad Carlos III de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Ana Pastore y Piontti","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"FBK"},{"author_name":"Maria Litvinova","author_inst":"ISI Foundation"},{"author_name":"Matteo Chinazzi","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Natalie E Dean","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"M.

This is due to the demand for medical resources in other areas as well as concern for the risk of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 exposure. The interruption of routine care is especially problematic for patients with chronic conditions requiring regular follow-up, such as lung transplant recipients. New methods like telemedicine are needed to provide care to these patients. Methods: A retrospective analysis of video consultations (VC) in comparison to on-site visits (OSV) was performed during a six-week period in a lung transplant center in Germany. VC included a structured work-up questionnaire and vital sign documentation. Results: During the 6-week study period, 75 VC were performed for 53 patients and 75 OSV by 51 patients occurred. By the end of our study period, 77% of physician-patient contacts occurred via VC. Overall, physician-patient consultations were reduced by 47% in comparison to an equivalent time frame in 2019. In 62% of cases, VC resulted in a concrete clinical decision. For two VC patients, the indication for inpatient admission was established during the consultation. One COVID-19 patient in home quarantine was admitted due to respiratory failure detected by VC. Patient satisfaction with VC was high. Conclusions: By transitioning to VC, OSV for lung transplant patients during the COVID-19 pandemic was reduced. VC was well received by the majority of patients. This technology can be adopted to provide care for a wide range of chronic illnesses.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Moritz Z.

Objective: To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19, hospitalized in a tertiary care teaching hospital in southwestern United states serving Underserved population. Methods: Case series of first 50 adults admitted at the University of New Mexico (UNM) Health Science center, the only tertiary care teaching hospital in the state of New Mexico between Jan 19th to April 24th 2020 via retrospective and prospective chart review. Main outcomes and measures: Clinical outcomes during hospitalization, such as invasive mechanical ventilation, kidney replacement therapy and death. Demographics, baseline comorbidities, presenting vital signs, and test results were also collected. Results: A total of 50 patients were included (median age, 55.5; 20-85-year-old, 54% were female). Obesity was the most common comorbidity in 20\/39 (51%), followed by diabetes in 18\/50 (36%) and hypertension 17\/50(34%). Mean onset of symptoms duration before admission 7.39 days (range 1-21days). Most common symptoms on presentation included subjective fevers 40\/42 (95.2%), cough 43\/46 (93%) 43\/46 and shortness of breath 40\/46(87%). At triage only 24% were febrile and 46% patient did not have a single febrile episode throughout hospitalization, 56% had respiratory rate > 20 and 66% had a heart rate > 90. 80% patients required oxygen and 20%required intubation on presentation. On differential analysis 46% had elevated neutrophil counts, and 48% had low lymphocytes counts. Median D dimer, Ferritin, CRP, LDH were all elevated at presentation. 10% of patients had a negative initial chest x ray. 19.3% patients have coinfection with another respiratory viral pathogen. 34 (68%) patient required ICU level of care at some point during hospitalization. More than 70% of patients were treated with antibiotics mainly directed towards community acquired pneumonia but 97.5% patient has negative blood culture and 93.3% has negative sputum cultures. Of admitted patients, 34% (17\/50) were directly admitted to ICU and. Of these ICU patients 82.4% (28\/34) required invasive mechanical ventilation. Patients spent a median of 2 days on the floor prior to ICU transfer, median length of stay in the ICU was 7 days. On comparing characteristics of patients, patients with diabetes, and higher lactate dehydrogenase on admission were more likely to require ICU level of care. No patient deaths were reported on the floor. Of 34 patients in the ICU 13 died while 6 are still receiving care in the hospital, with an overall mortality of 30.2% (13\/43). Out of 13 patients who died, 2 were on HD, 11\/13(84%) patients had acute kidney injury and required CRRT or HD. The median length of stay is 7 days (Range 1-31days), for floor patients 4 days and ICU patients 13 days. Out of 43 patients who completed their clinical course 24\/43(58.1%) were discharged home, 5\/43(11.6%) went to rehabilitation facilities and 30.2% died. 16\/30(53.3%) required oxygen on discharge. Conclusion: This case series provides characteristics and early experience in treating patient admitted to tertiary care teaching hospital in state of NEW Mexico.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rahul Shekhar","author_inst":"UNM"},{"author_name":"Shubhra Upadhyay","author_inst":"UNM"},{"author_name":"Abubaker Sheikh","author_inst":"UNM"},{"author_name":"Jeanette Atencio","author_inst":"UNM"},{"author_name":"Devika Kapuria","author_inst":"UNM"},{"author_name":"Jens Gottlieb","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany; Biomedical Research in Endstage and Obstructive Lung Disease Hannover (BREATH), "},{"author_name":"Bin Cao","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xiaoliang Wu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yan Lu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jin Zhao","author_inst":"zhaoj@szcdc.net"},{"author_name":"Xuan Zou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Tiejian Feng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Benjamin J Cowling","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Shujiang Mei","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"medical education"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.16.20103408","rel_title":"Interpretable Artificial Intelligence for COVID-19 Diagnosis from Chest CT Reveals Specificity of Ground-Glass Opacities","rel_date":"2020-05-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.16.20103408","rel_abs":"Background The use of CT imaging enhanced by artificial intelligence to effectively diagnose COVID-19, instead of or in addition to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), can improve widespread COVID-19 detection and resource allocation. Methods 904 axial lung window CT slices from 338 patients in 17 countries were collected and labeled. The data included 606 images from COVID-19 positive patients (confirmed via RT-PCR), 224 images of a variety of other pulmonary diseases including viral pneumonias, and 74 images of normal patients. We developed, trained, validated, and tested an object detection model which detects features in three categories: ground-glass opacities (GGOs) for COVID-19, GGOs for non-COVID-19 diseases, and features that are inconsistent with a COVID-19 diagnosis. These collected features are passed into an interpretable decision tree model to make a suggested diagnosis. Results On an independent test of 219 images from COVID-19 positive, a variety of pneumonia, and healthy patients, the model predicted COVID-19 diagnoses with an accuracy of 96.80 % (95% confidence interval [CI], 96.75 to 96.86) , AUC-ROC of 0.9664 (95% CI, 0.9659 to 0.9671) , sensitivity of 98.33% (95% CI, 98.29 to 98.40) , precision of 95.93% (95% CI, 95.83 to 95.99), and specificity of 94.95% (95% CI, 94.84 to 95.05). On an independent test of 34 images from asymptomatic COVID-19 positive patients, our model achieved an accuracy of 97.06% (95% CI, 96.81 to 97.06) and a sensitivity of 96.97% (95% CI, 96.71 to 96.97). Similarly high performance was also obtained for out-of-sample countries, and no significant performance difference was obtained between genders. Conclusion We present an interpretable artificial intelligence CT analysis tool to diagnose COVID-19 in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Further, our model is able to differentiate COVID-19 GGOs from similar pathologies suggesting that GGOs can be disease-specific.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anmol Warman","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Pranav Warman","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Ayushman Sharma","author_inst":"Morsani College of Medicine, James A.

The Department of Health Services, Government of Kerala, initially released daily updates through daily textual bulletins for public awareness to control the spread of the disease. However, this unstructured data limits upstream applications, such as visualization, and analysis, thus demanding refinement to generate open and reusable datasets. Materials and Methods: Through a citizen science initiative, we leveraged publicly available and crowd-verified data on COVID-19 outbreak in Kerala from the government bulletins and media outlets to generate reusable datasets. This was further visualized as a dashboard through a frontend web application and a JSON repository, which serves as an API for the frontend. Results: From the sourced data, we provided real-time analysis, and daily updates of COVID-19 cases in Kerala, through a user-friendly bilingual dashboard (https:\/\/covid19kerala.info\/) for non-specialists. To ensure longevity and reusability, the dataset was deposited in an open-access public repository for future analysis. Finally, we provide outbreak trends and demographic characteristics of the individuals affected with COVID-19 in Kerala during the first 138 days of the outbreak.

Design A prospective observational study using data on the daily number of infected patients and deaths from the New York Times daily database. Setting 50 States and the District of Columbia Participants All individuals judged to be positive for the coronavirus or to have died from COVID19. Main outcome measures Number of people diagnosed with or died from COVID19. Results We found that the decision to issue the state-at-home order reflects the Weber-Fechner law of psychophysics. Both the number of infections (p=<0.0001; R2=0.79) and deaths (p<0.0001; R2=0.63) were highly statistically significantly associated with the decision to issue the stay-at-home orders. The results indicate that for each doubling of infections or deaths within their state, an additional four to six governors will issue the stay-at-home order. We also observed a clear dose-response relationship in the Cox model: the larger the number of cases, or deaths, the higher the probability that the stay-at-home order will be made. When the number of deaths reached 256 or the number of infected people was greater than 16,384, the probability of issuing a stay-at-home order was close to 100%. Conclusions When there are not clearly articulated rules to follow, decision-makers in times of crisis such as COVID19 resort to use of simple heuristics consistent with the Weber-Fechner law of psychophysics. The findings are important for the public to understand how their elected officials make important public health decisions.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Benjamin Djulbegovic","author_inst":"City of Hope"},{"author_name":"David J Weiss","author_inst":"California State University, Los Angeles, CA"},{"author_name":"Iztok Hozo","author_inst":"Indiana University, IN"},{"author_name":"Prem Prabhakaran","author_inst":"Department of Advanced Materials and Chemical Engineering, Hannam University, Daejeon, South Korea."},{"author_name":"Sreekanth Chaliyeduth","author_inst":"Centre for Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India"},{"author_name":"Sooraj P Suresh","author_inst":"Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, National Institute of Technology Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India"},{"author_name":"Musfir Mohammed","author_inst":"Embedded Analytics, Machine Learning and Data Sciences, Experion Technologies, TechnoPark, Thiruvananthapuram, India."},{"author_name":"Rajeevan E","author_inst":"Department of Philosophy, Government Brennen College, Kannur University, Kerala, India"},{"author_name":"Sindhu Joseph","author_inst":"Department of Travel and Tourism Management, Govinda Pai Memorial  Government College, Kannur University, Kerala, India"},{"author_name":"Akhil Balakrishnan","author_inst":"Crowcon - A Halma Company, ITPB, Whitefield, Bangalore"},{"author_name":"Jeevan Uthaman","author_inst":"Department of Marine Geophysics, Cochin University of Science and Technology, Kochi, Kerala, India"},{"author_name":"Manoj Karingamadathil","author_inst":"Swathanthra Malayalam Computing, Thrissur, Kerala, India"},{"author_name":"Sunil Thonikkuzhiyil Thomas","author_inst":"Department of Electronics, College of Engineering Attingal, APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India"},{"author_name":"Unnikrishnan Sureshkumar","author_inst":"Astronomical Observatory of the Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Malopolska, Poland"},{"author_name":"Shabeesh Balan","author_inst":"Laboratory for Molecular Psychiatry, RIKEN Center for Brain Science, Wakoshi, Saitama, Japan"},{"author_name":"Neetha Nanoth Vellichirammal","author_inst":"Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Anatomy, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.15.20103341","rel_title":"Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections display specific IgG Fc structures","rel_date":"2020-05-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.15.20103341","rel_abs":"The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has caused a public health crisis that is exacerbated by our poor understanding of correlates of immunity.

In light of ongoing clinical trials examining convalescent serum therapy for COVID-19 patients and expedited SARS-CoV-2 vaccine testing in humans, it is essential to clarify the role of antibodies in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Here we show that adults with PCR-diagnosed COVID-19 produce IgG antibodies with a specific Fc domain repertoire that is characterized by reduced fucosylation, a modification that enhances interactions with the activating Fc{gamma}R, Fc{gamma}RIIIa. Fc fucosylation was reduced when compared with SARS-CoV-2-seropositive children and relative to adults with symptomatic influenza virus infections. These results demonstrate an antibody correlate of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in adults and have implications for novel therapeutic strategies targeting Fc{gamma}RIIIa pathways.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Saborni Chakraborty","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Karlie Edwards","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Anthony S.

However, additional studies are required to facilitate interpretation of results, including how antibody levels impact immunity and disease course. Methods: In this study, a total of 968 subjects were tested for IgG antibodies reactive to SARS-CoV-2. We confirmed analytic specificity using 656 plasma samples from healthy donors, 49 sera from patients with rheumatic disease, and 90 specimens from individuals positive for PCR-based respiratory viral panel. One-hundred seventy-three cases of confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 were tested for IgG. A subgroup of 37 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive cases was tested for nucleocapsid-specific IgM antibody using an in-house developed microarray method. Antibody levels were compared between disease severity groups. Results: All specificity specimens were negative for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies (0\/656, 0%). Cross reactivity was not detected in specimens with antinuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factor, or cases with previous diagnosis of viral infection including human coronavirus. Positive agreement of IgG with PCR was 83% of samples confirmed to be more than 14 days from symptom onset, with less than 100% sensitivity attributable to a case with severe immunosuppression. Virus-specific IgM was positive in a higher proportion of cases less than 3 days from symptom onset. No association was observed between mild and severe disease course with respect to IgG and IgM levels. Conclusions: The studied SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay had 100% specificity and no adverse cross-reactivity. Index values of IgG and IgM antibodies did not predict disease severity in our patient population.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"William S.

This situation can create deadlocks in places where there is a discrepancy among municipal, state and federal policies. The exponential increase of the number of infectious people and deaths in the last days shows that the COVID-19 epidemics is still at its early stage in Brazil and such political disarray can lead to very serious results. In this work, we study the COVID-19 epidemics in Brazilian cities using early-time approximations of the SIR model in networks. Different from other works, the underlying network is constructed by feeding real-world data on local COVID-19 cases reported by Brazilian cities to a regularized vector autoregressive model, which estimates directional COVID-19 transmission channels (links) of every pair of cities (vertices) using spectral network analysis. Our results reveal that social isolation and, especially, the use of masks can effectively reduce the transmission rate of COVID-19 in Brazil. We also build counterfactual scenarios to measure the human impact of these public health measures in terms of reducing the number of COVID-19 cases at the epidemics peak. We find that the efficiency of social isolation and of using of masks differs significantly across cities. For instance, we find that they would potentially decrease the COVID-19 epidemics peak in Sao Paulo (SP) and Brasilia (DF) by 15% and 25%, respectively. We hope our study can support the design of further public health measures.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thiago Christiano Silva","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Leandro Anghinoni","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Liang Zhao","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Lenin Mahimainathan","author_inst":"University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Department of Pathology"},{"author_name":"Ellen Araj","author_inst":"University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Department of Pathology"},{"author_name":"John Markantonis","author_inst":"University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Department of Pathology"},{"author_name":"Chantale Lacelle","author_inst":"University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Department of Pathology"},{"author_name":"Jyoti Balani","author_inst":"University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Department of Pathology"},{"author_name":"Hiren Parikh","author_inst":"University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Department of Pathology"},{"author_name":"E.

The NIOSH test certifying the N95 rating, however, poorly simulates aerosols in healthcare settings, limiting our understanding of the exposure risk for healthcare workers wearing these masks, especially reprocessed ones. We used experimental conditions that simulated the sizes, densities and airflow properties of infectious aerosols in healthcare settings. We analyzed the penetration and leakage of aerosols through pristine and reprocessed N95 respirators. Seven reprocessing methods were investigated. Our findings suggest that pristine and properly reprocessed N95 respirators effectively limit exposure to infectious aerosols, but that care must be taken to avoid the elucidated degradation mechanisms and limit noncompliant wear.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paul Z Chen","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Aldrich Ngan","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Niclas Manson","author_inst":"Hospital for Sick Children"},{"author_name":"Jason T Maynes","author_inst":"Hospital for Sick Children"},{"author_name":"Gregory H Borschel","author_inst":"Hospital for Sick Children"},{"author_name":"Ori D Rotstein","author_inst":"St. Michael's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Frank X Gu","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Hea-Woon Park","author_inst":"Korea Workers Compensation &  Welfare Services Daegu Hospital,  Daegu, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Wonjong Yang","author_inst":"Korea Workers Compensation &  Welfare Services Daegu Hospital,  Daegu, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Joonyoung Jang","author_inst":"Korea Workers Compensation &  Welfare Services Daegu Hospital, Daegu, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Min Ho An","author_inst":"So Ahn Public Health Center, Wando, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Ravi Sarode","author_inst":"University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Department of Pathology"},{"author_name":"Alagarraju Muthukumar","author_inst":"University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Department of Pathology"},{"author_name":"Catherine A.

Objective: to describe the effect of off-label intravenous use of Sarilumab in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia. Design: Observational clinical cohort study. Setting: Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli IRCCS as Italian Covid reference center. Participants: Patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and respiratory distress with PaO2\/FiO2 ratio<300 treated with Sarilumab between March 23rd - April 4th, 2020. Date of final follow-up was April 18, 2020. Main outcomes and measures: We describe the clinical outcomes of 53 patients with SARS-CoV-2 severe pneumonia treated with intravenous Sarilumab in terms of pulmonary function improvement or Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission rate in medical wards setting and of live discharge rate in ICU treated patients as well as in terms of safety. Each patient received Sarilumab 400 mg administered intravenously on day 1, with eventual additional infusion based on clinical judgement, and was followed for at least 14 days, unless previously discharged or dead. No gluco-corticosteroids were used at baseline. Results: Of the 53 SARS-CoV-2pos patients receiving Sarilumab, 39 (73.6%) were treated in medical wards (66.7% with a single infusion) while 14 (26.4%) in ICU (92.6% with a second infusion). The median PaO2\/FiO2 of patients in the Medical Ward was 146(IQR:120-212) while the median PaO2\/FiO2 of patients in ICU was 112(IQR:100-141.5), respectively. Within the medical wards, 7(17.9%) required ICU admission, 4 of whom were re-admitted to the ward within 5-8 days. At 19 days median follow-up, 89.7% of medical inpatients significantly improved (46.1% after 24 hours, 61.5% after 3 days), 70.6% were discharged from the hospital and 85.7% no longer needed oxygen therapy. Within patients receiving Sarilumab in ICU, 64.2% were discharged from ICU to the ward and 35.8% were still alive at the last follow-up. Overall mortality rate was 5.7% after Sarilumab administration: 1(2.5%) patient died in the Medical Ward whilst 2(14.2%) patients died in ICU, respectively. Conclusions and relevance: IL6-R inhibition appears to be a potential treatment strategy for severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and intravenous Sarilumab seems a promising treatment approach showing, in the short term, an important clinical benefit and good safety.","rel_num_authors":41,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elisa Gremese","author_inst":"Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

Currently, there is limited clarity on the pharmacological treatments available for the novel coronavirus. We systematically identified the current evidence and ongoing research on the pharmacological treatments for COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a scoping review using PRISMA-ScR. Observational studies, including cohort studies and case series, as well as experimental studies, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs were searched electronically on April 7, 2020 and by hand on May 1, 2020. PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane library databases were searched along with seven trial registries. The inclusion criteria were patients with confirmed COVID-19 who received pharmacological therapies, including hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, lopinavir\/ritonavir, remdesivir, tocilizumab, and favipiravir. Results: We identified 222 studies on pharmacological treatment of the novel coronavirus. We included 11 of these studies in this review, including the ones on hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine (one cohort), lopinavir\/ritonavir (one RCT, three cohorts, and two case series), remdesivir (one RCT and one case series), tocilizumab (one case series), and favipiravir (one RCT). In the three RCTs carried out in China, both lopinavir\/ritonavir and remdesivir did not show any significant earlier clinical improvement in case of severe infection [Hazard ratio (HR): 1.31, p=0.09 and HR: 1.24, p=0.24, respectively], The clinical recovery rate on day seven was not significantly different between the favipiravir and arbidol groups (p=0.14) for moderate patients, although the duration of pyrexia and cough in the favipiravir group was significantly shorter as compared to the arbidol group (p<0.01). There are 135 ongoing RCTs, including 72 for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, 29 for lopinavir\/ritonavir, 14 for remdesivir, 16 for tocilizumab, and 4 for favipiravir. Conclusion: The clinical effectiveness and safety of these drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 remains unclear owing to the lack of large, high-quality RCTs. However, in the event of emerging infectious diseases, we need to repeatedly and systematically update the best available evidence to avoid misleading information.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Noyuri Yamaji","author_inst":"St. Luke's International University"},{"author_name":"Sachiko Ohde","author_inst":"St. Luke's International University"},{"author_name":"Kimi Estela Kobayashi-Cuya","author_inst":"St. Luke's International University"},{"author_name":"Shota Saito","author_inst":"St. Luke's International University"},{"author_name":"Osamu Takahashi","author_inst":"St. Luke's International University"},{"author_name":"Simone Perniola","author_inst":"Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

Representative population-based data, including asymptomatic individuals for assessing the viral spread and immune response were, however, lacking worldwide. METHODS: Using a panel-based method, we implemented a representative sample of the Luxembourgish population based on age, gender and residency for testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection and antibody status in order to define prevalence irrespective of clinical symptoms. Participants were contacted via email to fill an online questionnaire before biosampling at local laboratories. All participants provided information related to clinical symptoms, epidemiology, socioeconomic and psychological assessments and underwent biosampling, rRT-PCR testing and serology for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: We included a total of 1862 individuals in our representative sample of the general Luxembourgish population. Of these, 5 individuals had a current positive result for infection with SARS-CoV-2 based on rRT-PCR. Four of these individuals were oligosymptomatic and one was asymptomatic. Overall we found a positive IgG antibody status in 35 individuals (1.97%), of which 11 reported to be tested positive by rRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 previously and showed in addition their IgG positive status also a positive status for IgA. Our data indicate a prevalence of 0.3% for active SARS-CoV-2 infection and an infection rate of 2.15% in the Luxembourgish population between 18 and 79 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: Luxembourgish residents show a low rate of acute infections after 7 weeks of confinement and present with an antibody profile indicative of a more recent immune response to SARS-CoV-2. All infected individuals were oligo- or asymptomatic. Bi-weekly follow-up visits over the next 2 months will inform about the viral spread by a- and oligosymptomatic carriers and the individual changes in the immune profile.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chantal J.

Coronaviruses such as the 2003 SARS-CoV showed an increased risk of transmission during cooler days. We sought to analyse the effects of ambient temperature on SARS-COV-2 transmission and deaths related to the virus. Methods The world population of COVID-19 cases and attributable deaths from the 23rd January 2020 to 11th April 2020 were analysed. Temperature 5 days before cases and 23 days prior to deaths (to account for the time lag of incubation period and time from symptoms to death) was compared to the average temperature experienced by the world population. Results The total number of cases during this period was 1,605,788 and total number of deaths was 103,471. The median temperature at the time of COVID-19 infection was 9.12C (10-90th percentile 4.29-17.97C) whilst the median temperature of the world population for the same period was 9.61C warmer at 18.73C (10-90th percentile 4.09-28.49C) with a notional p-value = 5.1 x10-11. The median temperature at the time of a COVID-19 death was 9.72C (10-90th percentile 5.39-14.11C) whilst the median temperature of the world population was 7.55C warmer at 17.27C (10-90th percentile 2.57C-27.76C) with a notional p-value = 1.1 x10-10. 80% of all COVID-19 related cases and deaths occurred between 4.29C and 17.97C. Conclusion A definitive association between infection rate and death from COVID-19 and ambient temperature exists, with the highest risk occurring around 9C. Governments should maintain vigilance with containment strategies when the ambient temperatures correspond to this highest risk.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anver Sethwala","author_inst":"Royal Melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Akbarally","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Nathan Better","author_inst":"Royal Melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Lefkovits","author_inst":"Royal Melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Leeanne Grigg","author_inst":"Royal Melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huzefa Akbarally","author_inst":"Sri Lanka Association for the Advancement of Science"},{"author_name":"Clarissa P.

Using a within-hospital SEIR transition model of SARS-CoV-2 in a typical UK hospital, we predict that approximately 20% of infections in inpatients, and 89% of infections in HCWs were due to nosocomial transmission. Placing suspected COVID-19 patients in single rooms or bays has the potential to reduce hospital-acquired infections in patients by up to 80%. Periodic testing of HCWs has a smaller effect on the patient-burden of COVID-19 but would considerably reduce infection in HCWs by as much as 64% and result in only a small proportion of staff absences (approximately 1% per day). This is considerably fewer than currently observed due to suspected COVID-19 and self-isolation.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stephanie Evans","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Emily Agnew","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Emilia Vynnycky","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Julie V Robotham","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Leeanne Grigg","author_inst":"Royal Melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huzefa Akbarally","author_inst":"Sri Lanka Association for the Advancement of Science"},{"author_name":"Clarissa P.

Our results highlight the significant impact these NPIs had across states, reducing an average R_t >3 to an average of 1.5 by 9-May-2020, but that these interventions failed to reduce R_t <1, congruent with the worsening epidemic Brazil has experienced since. We identify extensive heterogeneity in the epidemic trajectory across Brazil, with the estimated number of days to reach 0.1 % of the state population infected since the first nationally recorded case

Populations heavily exposed to the novel coronavirus provide an opportunity to estimate the mortality from COVID-19 in different age groups. Methods. The mortality reported by May 13 from COVID-19 among Diamond Princess cruise ship passengers, and New York residents and Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) workers was estimated based on publicly available information. Results. The mortality among children (age 0 to 17 yrs) in New York City was 1 in 172,692. The mortality in New York state was 1 in 322,217 for ages 10-19 yrs., and 1 in 36,725 for ages 20-29 yrs. The mortality among New York transit workers was estimated to be 1 in 7,329 for ages 30-39 years; 1 in 1,075 for ages 40-49 yrs.; 1 in 343 for ages 50-59 yrs.; and 1 in 178 for ages 60-69 yrs. Among Diamond Princess passengers, the mortality was estimated to be 1 in 145 for ages 70-79, and 1 in 54 for ages 80-89. Conclusions: Mortality among populations exposed to the novel coronavirus increases with age, ranging from about 1 in 170,000 below the age of 18 years, to 1 in 54 above the age of 80 years.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christopher T Leffler","author_inst":"Virginia Commonwealth University"},{"author_name":"Matthew C Hogan","author_inst":"Virginia

States like Delhi, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu are the spike states as suggested by the range of expected COVID-19 patients and deaths. Impact of return of stranded pilgrims from Nanded (Maharashtra) has also been looked into in the case of Punjab. It has been found that Punjab may see ~ 5 times increase in the lower bound of expected patients till 10th June 2020 due to the return of pilgrims from Maharashtra. Our study provides an insight into the possible number of expected patients and deaths in near future that may be of importance for the respective governments to be ready with the appropriate

Sclerosis (MS) and related disorders with COVID-19 illness. Methods: From March 16 to April 30th, 2020, patients with MS or related disorders at NYU Langone MS Comprehensive Care Center (MSCC) were identified with laboratory-confirmed or suspected COVID-19. The diagnosis was established using a standardized questionnaire or by a review of in-patient hospital records. Results: We identified 76 patients (55 with relapsing MS of which 9 had pediatric-onset;17 with progressive MS; and 4 with related disorders). 37 underwent PCR testing and were confirmed positive. Of the entire group, 64 (84%) patients were on disease-modifying therapy (DMT) including anti-CD20 therapies (n=34, 44.7%) and sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulators (n=10, 13.5%). The most common COVID-19 symptoms were fever and cough, but 21.1% of patients had neurologic symptom recrudescence preceding or coinciding with the infection. A total of 18 (23.7%) were hospitalized; 8 (10.5%) had COVID-19 critical illness or related death. Features more common among those hospitalized or with critical illness or death were older age, presence of comorbidities, progressive disease, and a non-ambulatory status. No DMT class was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization or fatal outcome. Conclusions: Most MS patients with COVID-19 do not require hospitalization despite being on DMTs. Factors associated with critical illness were similar to the general at risk patient population. DMT use did not emerge as a predictor of poor COVID-19 outcome in this preliminary sample.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Erica Parrotta","author_inst":"NYU Langone MS Comprehensive Care Center"},{"author_name":"Ilya Kister","author_inst":"NYU Langone MS Comprehensive Care Center"},{"author_name":"Leigh Charvet","author_inst":"NYU Langone MS Comprehensive Care Center"},{"author_name":"Carrie Sammarco","author_inst":"NYU MS Comprehensive Care Center"},{"author_name":"Valerie Saha","author_inst":"NYU Langone MS Comprehensive Care Center"},{"author_name":"R.E.

ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, there are concerns that patients may be avoiding care for emergent and urgent health conditions due to fear of contagion or as an unintentional consequence of government orders to postpone non-essential services. We therefore sought to evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the number of patient encounters for select emergent or urgent diagnoses at a large tertiary-care academic medical center in Boston. Inpatient diagnoses included acute myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, and outpatient but urgent diagnoses included new referrals for breast and hematologic malignancies. For each condition, we used a difference-in-differences approach to estimate the proportional change in number of encounters during the pandemic (March-April 2020) compared with earlier in the same year (January-February 2020), using equivalent periods in 2019 as a control. After the onset of the pandemic, we observed significant reductions in hospitalizations for MI (difference-in-differences estimate, 0.67; 95%CI, 0.46-0.96; P=0.04) and stroke (difference-in-differences estimate, 0.42; 95%CI, 0.28-0.65; P<0.001) (Table). In the ambulatory setting, there was a reduction in referrals for breast cancer and hematologic cancers, but this did not reach statistical significance until the month after the onset of the pandemic. Our findings suggest an urgent need for public health messaging to ensure that patients continue to seek care for acute emergencies. In addition, decisions by health systems regarding when to reinitiate non-emergent care should carefully factor in the harms of delayed diagnosis and treatment occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dhruv S Kazi","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Rishi K Wadhera","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Changyu Shen","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Kalon K.L.

SARS-CoV-2, the incidence of COVID-19 in Africa has been slower than predicted. We aimed to investigate a possible association between parasitic infections and COVID-19. Methods: An ecological study in which we analysed WHO data on COVID-19 cases in comparison to WHO data on helminths and malaria cases using correlation, regression, and Geographical Information Services analyses. Results: Of the global 3.34 million COVID-19 cases and 238,628 deaths as at May 4th 2020, Africa reported 0.029\/3.3 million (0.88%) cases and 1,064\/238,628 (0.45%) deaths. In 2018, Africa reported 213\/229 million (93%) of all malaria cases, 204\/229 million (89%) of schistosomiasis cases, and 271\/1068 million (25%) of soil-transmitted helminth cases globally. In contrast, Europe reported 1.5\/3.3 million (45%) of global COVID-19 cases and 142,667\/238,628 (59%) deaths. Europe had 5.8\/1068 million (0.55%) soil-transmitted helminths cases and no malaria\/schistosomiasis cases in 2018. We found an inverse correlation between the incidence of COVID-19 and malaria (r -0.17, p =0.002) and COVID-19 and soil-transmitted helminths (r -0.25, p <0.001). Malaria-endemic countries were less likely to have COVID-19 (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.29-0.90; p =0.02). Similarly, countries endemic for soil-transmitted helminths were less likely to have COVID-19 (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.13-0.44; p <0.001), as were countries endemic for schistosomiasis (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.11-0.45; p<0.001). Conclusions: One plausible hypothesis for the comparatively low COVID-19 cases\/deaths in parasite-endemic areas is immunomodulation induced by parasites. Studies to elucidate the relationship between parasitic infections and susceptibility to COVID-19 at an individual level are warranted.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kenneth Ssebambulidde","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Institute, College of Health Sciences, Makerere University"},{"author_name":"Ivan Segawa","author_inst":"Makerere Lung Institute, College of Health Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda"},{"author_name":"Kelvin M Abuga","author_inst":"Kenya Medical Research Institute Centre for Geographic Medicine Research-Coast, KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kilifi, Kenya"},{"author_name":"Vivian Nakate","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Institute, College of Health Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda"},{"author_name":"Anthony Kayiira","author_inst":"St Francis Hospital Nsambya, Kampala, Uganda"},{"author_name":"Jayne Ellis","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Lillian Tugume","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Institute, College of Health Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda"},{"author_name":"Agnes N Kiragga","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Institute, College of Health Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda"},{"author_name":"David B Meya","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Institute, College of Health Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda"},{"author_name":"Kevin Tabb","author_inst":"Beth Israel Lahey Health, Cambridge, MA"},{"author_name":"Robert W.

biggest pandemic of the century. It has already killed more than 250,000 people. Because of this, it is necessary quick and precise diagnosis test. The current gold standard is the RT-PCR with DNA sequencing and identification, but its results takes too long to be available. Tests base on IgM\/IgG antibodies have been used, but their sensitivity and specificity may be very low. Many studies have been demonstrating the Covid-19 impact in hematological parameters. This work proposes an intelligent system to support Covid-19 diagnosis based on blood testing. We tested several machine learning methods, and we achieved high classification performance: 95.159% +- 0.693 of overall accuracy, kappa index of 0.903 +- 0.014, sensitivity of 0.968 +- 0.007, precision of 0.938 +- 0.010 and specificity of 0.936 +- 0.011. These results were achieved using classical and low computational cost classifiers, with Bayes Network being the best of them. In addition, only 24 blood tests were needed. This points to the possibility of a new rapid test with low cost. The desktop version of the system is fully functional and available for free use.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Valter Augusto de Freitas Barbosa","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Juliana Carneiro Gomes","author_inst":"Universidade de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Maira Araujo de Santana","author_inst":"Universidade de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Jeniffer Emidio de Almeida Albuquerque","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo Gomes de Souza","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Emmanuel de Souza","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Wellington Pinheiro dos Santos","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Agnes N Kiragga","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Institute, College of Health Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda"},{"author_name":"David B Meya","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Institute, College of Health Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda"},{"author_name":"Kevin Tabb","author_inst":"Beth Israel Lahey Health, Cambridge, MA"},{"author_name":"Robert W.

(SARS-CoV-2) is the third virus that caused coronavirus-related outbreaks over the past 20 years. The outbreak was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, but rapidly progressed into a pandemic of an unprecedented scale since the 1918 flu pandemic. Besides respiratory complications in COVID-19 patients, clinical characterizations of severe infection cases showed several other comorbidities, including multiple organ failure (liver, kidney, and heart) and septic shock. To better understand COVID-19 pathogenesis in different human organs, we interrogated the presence of the virus in the blood, or any of its components, which might provide a form of trafficking or hiding to the virus. By computationally analyzing high-throughput sequence data from patients with active COVID-19 infection, we found evidence of only traces of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), while the virus RNA was abundant in bronchoalveolar lavage specimens from the same patients. We also devised a \"viral spike-to-actin\" RNA normalization, as a metric to compare across various samples and minimize errors caused by intersample variability in human RNA. To the best of our knowledge, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the PBMC of COVID-19 patients has not been reported before, and this observation could suggest immune presentation, but discounts the possibility of extensive viral infection of lymphocytes or monocytes.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ahmed Moustafa","author_inst":"American University in Cairo"},{"author_name":"Ramy K Aziz","author_inst":"Cairo University"},{"author_name":"Maira Araujo de Santana","author_inst":"Universidade de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Jeniffer Emidio de Almeida Albuquerque","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo Gomes de Souza","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Emmanuel de Souza","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Wellington Pinheiro dos Santos","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Agnes N Kiragga","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Institute, College of Health Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda"},{"author_name":"David B Meya","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Institute, College of Health Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda"},{"author_name":"Kevin Tabb","author_inst":"Beth Israel Lahey Health, Cambridge, MA"},{"author_name":"Robert W.

environment","rel_date":"2020-05-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.12.20097105","rel_abs":"The outbreak of coronavirus infectious disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has rapidly spread throughout over 200 countries, posing a global threat to human health. Till 15th May 2020, there are over 4.5 million confirmed cases, with roughly 300,000 death1. To date, most studies focus on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in indoor environment owing to its main transmission routes via human respiratory droplets and direct contact2,3. It remains unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 can spill over and impose transmission risks to outdoor environments despite potential threats to people and communities. Here, we investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by measuring viral RNA in 73 samples from outdoor environment of three hospitals in Wuhan. We detected SARS-CoV-2 in soils (205-550 copies\/g), aerosols (285-1,130 copies\/m3) and wastewaters (255 to 18,744 copies\/L) in locations close to hospital departments receiving COVID-19 patients or in wastewater treatment sectors. These findings reveal significant viral spillover in hospital outdoor environments that was possibly caused by respiratory droplets from patients or aerosolized particles from wastewater containing SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in other areas or on surfaces with regular disinfection implemented. Soils may behave as viral warehouse through deposition and serve as a secondary source spreading SARS-CoV-2 for a prolonged time. For the first time, our findings demonstrate that there are high-risk areas in hospital outdoor environments to spread SARS-CoV-2, calling for sealing of wastewater treatment unit and complete sanitation to prevent COVID-19 transmission risks.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dayi Zhang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Yunfeng
