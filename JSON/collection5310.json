The fact that, soon afterwards, on May 15, 2020, the two million people Slovenia was the first European country proclaiming the end of COVID-19 epidemic within national borders may be relevant from this perspective. Motivated by this evolution, in this paper we investigate the time dynamics of coronavirus cases in Slovenia with emphasis on how efficient various containment measures act to diminish the number of COVID-19 infections. Noteworthily, the present analysis does not rely on any speculative theoretical assumption; it is solely based on raw epidemiological data. Out of the results presented here, the most important one is perhaps the finding that, while imposing drastic curfews and travel restrictions reduce the infection rate kappa by a factor of four with respect to the unrestricted state, they only improve the kappa-value by ~15 % as compared to the much bearable state of social and economical life wherein (justifiable) wearing face masks and social distancing rules are enforced\/followed. Significantly for behavioral and social science, our analysis of the time dependence kappa = kappa(t) may reveal an interesting self-protection instinct of the population, which became manifest even before the official lockdown enforcement.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ioan Baldea","author_inst":"Heidelberg University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.23.20111211","rel_title":"Are we #stayinghome to Flatten the Curve?","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.23.20111211","rel_abs":"The recent spread of COVID-19 across the U.S. led to concerted efforts by states to \"flatten the curve\" through the adoption of stay-at-home mandates that encourage individuals to reduce travel and maintain social distance. Combining data on changes in travel activity with COVID-19 health outcomes and state policy adoption timing, we characterize nationwide changes in mobility patterns and isolate the portion attributable to statewide mandates. We find evidence of dramatic nationwide declines in mobility prior to adoption of any statewide mandates. Once states adopt a mandate, we estimate further mandate-induced declines between 2.1 and 7.0 percentage points across methods that account for states' differences in travel behavior prior to policy adoption. In addition, we investigate the effects of stay-at-home mandates on changes in COVID-19 health outcomes while controlling for pre-trends and observed pre-treatment mobility patterns. We estimate mandate-induced declines between 0.13 and 0.17 in deaths (5.6 to 6.0 in hospitalizations) per 100 thousand across methods. Across 43 adopting states, this represents 23,366-30,144 fewer deaths (and roughly one million averted hospitalizations) for the months of March and April - which indicates that death rates could have been 42-54% higher had states not adopted statewide policies. We further find evidence that changes in mobility patterns prior to adoption of statewide policies also played a role in reducing COVID-19 mortality and morbidity. Adding in averted deaths due to pre-mandate social distancing behavior, we estimate a total of 48-71,000 averted deaths from COVID-19 for the two-month period. Given that the actual COVID-19 death toll for March and April was 55,922, our estimates suggest that deaths would have been 1.86-2.27 times what they were absent any stay-at-home mandates during this period. These estimates represent a lower bound on the health impacts of stay-at-home policies, as they do not account for spillovers or undercounting of COVID-19 mortality. Our findings indicate that early behavior changes and later statewide policies reduced death rates and helped attenuate the negative consequences of COVID-19. Further, our findings of substantial reductions in mobility prior to state-level policies convey important policy implications for re-opening.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"James Sears","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"J.

Using real-time epidemiological data from Chile, the nation in Latin America with the highest testing rate for COVID-19, we derive delay-adjusted severity estimates by age group as of May 18th, 2020. Methods We employed statistical methods and daily series of age-stratified COVID-19 cases and deaths reported in Chile to estimate the delay-adjusted case fatality rate across six age groups. Results Our most recent estimates of the time-delay adjusted case fatality rate are 0.08% (95% Credible Interval CrI:0.04-0.13%) among persons aged 0-39, 0.61% (95%CrI:0.41-0.87%) for those aged 40-49, 1.06% (95%CrI:0.76-1.40%) for those aged 50-59, 3.79% (95%CrI:3.04-4.66%) for those aged 60-69, 12.22% (95%CrI:10.40-14.38%) for those aged 70-79, and 26.27% (95%CrI:22.95-2980%) for persons aged 80 and over.

High relative humidity promotes COVID-19 transmission when temperature is low, but tends to reduce transmission when temperature is high. Implementing classical control measures can dramatically slow the spread of the disease. However, due to the occurrence of pre-symptomatic infections, the effect of the measures to shorten onset-to-isolation time is markedly reduced and the importance of contact tracing and quarantine and social distancing increases.

Setting - Global setting including 45 countries from all six inhabited continents Population Two (2) or three (3) countries from each geographical region of the continents selected on the basis of population Main outcome - measures correlation factors derived from comparisons between different sets of variables Results - Empirical trends suggested in the existing literature were quantified in a global setting establishing clear trends. Correlation between the proportion of the population affected and median age, prime climate zones, malaria and tuberculosis incidence, BCG coverage and mitigation measures were established. Conclusions The study findings suggest that demographic and climatological factors, high endemicity of TB and Malaria, and universal BCG programmes may have a cushioning effect in the impact of Covid-19 on health systems of poorer and developing nations.

Mathematical models of the disease have been instrumental to guide the implementation of mitigation strategies aimed at slowing the spread of the disease. One of the key parameters of mathematical models is the basic reproduction ratio R0, which measures the degree of infectivity of affected individuals. The goal of mitigation is to reduce R0 as close or below 1 as possible, as it means that new infections are in decline. In the present work, we use the recursive least-squares algorithm to establish the stochastic variability of a time-varying R0(t) from eight different countries: Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Spain, and the United States of America.

This data is updated every day and is available for most countries from multiple sources. In this work we present a two step procedure for model fitting to Covid-19 data. In the first step, time dependent transmission coefficients are constructed directly from the data and, in the second step, measures of those (minimum, maximum, mean, median etc.,) are used to set priors for fitting models to data. We call this approach a \"data driven approach\" or \"data first approach\". This scheme is complementary to Bayesian approach and can be used with or without that for parameter estimation. We use the procedure to fit a set of SIR and SIRD models, with time dependent contact rate, to Covid-19 data for a set of 45 most affected countries. We find that SIR and SIRD models with constant transmission coefficients cannot fit Covid-19 data for most countries (mainly because social distancing, lockdown etc., make those time dependent). We find that any time dependent contact rate, which falls gradually with time, can help to fit SIR and SIRD models for most of the countries.

The reproductive number of COVID-19 provides an estimate on possible extent of the transmission. This study aims to provide the average reproductive number of COVID-19 based on available global level evidence. Methods We searched three databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Science Direct) to find studies reported the reproductive number of COVID-19. The searches were conducted using a pre-specified search strategy that includes keywords of COVID-19 and its reproductive number related terms, which were combined using the Boolean operators. We used meta-analysis to provide average reproduction number of COVID-19. Results Total of 30 studies included in this review whereas 24 of them were included in the meta-analysis. The average estimated reproductive number was 2.70 (95% CI, 2.21-3.30). We found evidence of very high heterogeneity (99.5%) of the reproductive number reported in the included studies. The highest reproductive number was reported for Diamond Princes Cruise Ship, Japan (14.8). In the country-level, higher reproductive number was reported for France (R, 6.32, 95% CI, 5.72-6.98) following Germany (R, 6.07, 95% CI, 5.51-6.69) and Spain (R, 5.08, 95% CI, 4.50-5.73). We also found estimation models, methods, and the number of cases considered to estimate reproductive number were played a role in arising the heterogeneity of the estimated reproductive number. Conclusion The estimated reproductive number indicates an exponential increase of COVID-19 infection in coming days. Comprehensive policies and programs are important to reduce new infections as well as the associated adverse consequences including death.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Md Arif Billah","author_inst":"University Malaysia Terengganu"},{"author_name":"Md Mamun Miah","author_inst":"Khulna University of Engineering and Technology"},{"author_name":"Md Nuruzzaman Khan","author_inst":"Jatiya Kabi Kazi Nazrul Islam University"},{"author_name":"Tutun Das Aka","author_inst":"Noakhali Science and Technology University"},{"author_name":"Md.

Studies with KAP and fear measures are limited only regional or country level, not yet with global or cross-cultural populations. The study is aimed to measure KAP and fear level towards COVID-19 and explore its cross-cultural variances in knowledge by socio-demographic factors among the general population of 8 different countries over 5 continents. Method: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in April 2020 among 1296 participants using the Google form platform. Considering the social distancing formula and pandemic situation, we collect data using popular social media networks. Univariate and bivariate analyses were used to explore the collected data on KAP, fear, and sociodemographic factors. Result: Overall knowledge score was 9.7 (out of 12) and gender differences (female vs male: 9.8 vs 9.5) were significant (p=0.008) in the bivariate analysis. Knowledge score variances found significant in some regions by gender, marital status and education qualification. The highest and lowest mean knowledge scores were recorded in the Middle East (10.0) and Europe (9.3). Despite having a high fear score (22.5 out of 35), 78.35% of respondents were in a positive attitude and 81.7% in good practice level. Fear score rankings: Middle East (1st; 23.8), Europe (2nd; 23.2); Africa (3rd; 22.7); South Asia (4th; 22.1); Oceania (5th; 21.9); and North America (6th; 21.7). We did not find a correlation between fear and knowledge. Limitation: Due to the nature of the online survey, aged and rural populations are under-representing (e.g. more than half of the responders are 16-29 age group). Conclusion: KAP and fear variation exist among geographical regions. Gender, marital status and education qualification are factors in knowledge variances for some regions. KAP and fear measures can assist health education programs considering some sociodemographic factors and regions during an outbreak of highly contagious disease and, which can uplift a positive attitude and good practice.

We report tests of the ability of ozone to inactivate enveloped respiratory viruses (influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus), chosen as more easily handled surrogates for SARS-CoV-2, on N95 respirators and other personal protective equipment (PPE) commonly used in hospitals. At 20 ppm, an ozone concentration easily achieved by standard commercial equipment, the viruses were inactivated with high efficiency as long as the relative humidity was above a threshold value of approximately 50%. In the absence of humidity control, disinfection is more variable and requires considerably longer exposure under relatively dry conditions. This report extends the observations of a previous publication (http:\/\/doi.org\/10.1080\/01919510902747969) to hospital-relevant materials and provides additional details about the relationship of humidity to the antiviral activity of ozone. Home CPAP disinfection devices using ozone can provide effective results for individuals. Ozone did not appear to degrade any of the materials tested except for elastic bands if strained during treatment (such as by the pressure exerted by stapled attachment to N95 respirators).

We quantified excess mortality in regions of England and Wales during the pandemic, for all causes and for non-COVID-19 associated deaths. Methods Weekly mortality data for 1 Jan 2010 to 1 May 2020 for England and Wales were obtained from the Office of National Statistics. Mean-dispersion negative binomial regressions were used to model death counts based on pre-pandemic trends and exponentiated linear predictions were subtracted from: i) all-cause deaths; and ii) all-cause deaths minus COVID-19 related deaths for the pandemic period (07-13 March to 25 April to 8 May). Findings Between 7 March and 8 May 2020, there were 47,243 (95%CI: 46,671 to 47,815) excess deaths in England and Wales, of which 9,948 (95%CI: 9,376 to 10,520) were not associated with COVID-19.

Some viruses may be secreted into milk- others may be contaminants. The effect of thermal pasteurization on viruses in HM has yet to be rigorously reviewed. The objective of this study is to characterize the effect of commonly used pasteurization techniques on viruses in HM and non-HM matrices. Databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science) were searched from inception to April 20th, 2020 for primary research articles assessing the impact of pasteurization on viral load or detection of live virus. Reviews were excluded, as were studies lacking quantitative measurements or those assessing pasteurization as a component of a larger process. Overall, 65,131 reports were identified, and 108 studies included. Pasteurization of HM at a minimum temperature of 56{degrees}C-60{degrees}C is effective at reducing detectable live virus. In cell culture media or plasma, coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS) are highly susceptible to heating at [&ge;]56{degrees}C. Although pasteurization parameters and matrices reported vary, all viruses studied, with the exception of parvoviruses, were susceptible to thermal killing. Future research important for the study of novel viruses should standardize pasteurization protocols and should test viral inactivation using a human milk matrix.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael A.

We employed a clinical cohort of 1,892 SARS-CoV-2 patients and controls, including individuals diagnosed by RT-qPCR at Yale New Haven Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Hefei City (Hefei CDC), Anhui Province (Anhui Province CDC), and Fuyang City (Fuyang CDC). The LFA studied here detects SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies with a specificity of 97.9-100% for IgM, 99.7-100% for IgG, and sensitivities ranging from 94.1-100% for patients >14-days post symptom onset. Sensitivity decreases in patients <14-days post symptom onset, which is likely due to lower IgG\/IgM antibody levels in this population. Finally, we developed a visual intensity reporting system that we believe will be suitable for laboratory and point-of-care settings, and will provide granular information about antibody levels. Overall our results support the widespread utility of this and other LFAs in assessing population-level epidemiological statistics.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christopher Minteer","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Pathology, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Arnau Casanovas-Massana","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health, Department of Epidemiology and Microbial Diseases, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Tao Li","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Department of Clinical Laboratory, Hefei 230032, China."},{"author_name":"David McDonald","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Linda Wang","author_inst":"Biohit Healthcare (Hefei) Co., Ltd, Hefei 230032, China."},{"author_name":"Si Hui Pan","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"David Caianiello","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Jesse Collinski","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Immunology, New Haven, CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Edward deRamon","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Robert Hale","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Rebecca Howell","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Jason Ray","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Joseph Vinetz","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Infectious Diseases, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Morgan Levine","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Pathology, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Albert Ko","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health, Department of Epidemiology and Microbial Diseases, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"David Spiegel","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.23.20111484","rel_title":"Estimation of the case fatality rate based on stratification for the COVID-19 outbreak","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.23.20111484","rel_abs":"This work is motivated by the recent worldwide pandemic of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). When an epidemiological disease is prevalent, estimating the case fatality rate, the proportion of deaths out of the total cases, accurately and quickly is important as the case fatality rate is one of the crucial indicators of the risk of a disease. In this work, we propose an alternative estimator of the case fatality rate that provides more accurate estimate during an outbreak by reducing the downward bias (underestimation) of the naive CFR, the proportion of deaths out of confirmed cases at each time point, which is the most commonly used estimator due to the simplicity. The proposed estimator is designed to achieve the availability of real-time update by using the commonly reported quantities , the numbers of confirmed, cured, deceased cases, in the computation. To enhance the accuracy, the proposed estimator adapts a stratification, that allows the estimator to use information from heterogeneous strata separately. With the COVID-19 cases of China, South Korea and the United States, we numerically show the proposed stratification-based estimator plays a role of providing an early warning about the severity of a epidemiological disease that estimates the final case fatality rate accurately and shows faster convergence to the final case fatality rate.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Byungwon Kim","author_inst":"Seoul National University"},{"author_name":"Seonghong Kim","author_inst":"Seoul National University"},{"author_name":"Woncheol Jang","author_inst":"Seoul National University"},{"author_name":"Sungkyu Jung","author_inst":"Seoul National University"},{"author_name":"Johan Lim","author_inst":"Seoul National University"},{"author_name":"Si Hui Pan","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"David Caianiello","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Jesse Collinski","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Immunology, New Haven, CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Edward deRamon","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Robert Hale","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Rebecca Howell","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Jason Ray","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Joseph Vinetz","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Infectious Diseases, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Morgan Levine","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Pathology, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Albert Ko","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health, Department of Epidemiology and Microbial Diseases, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"David Spiegel","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.25.20111716","rel_title":"Psychological impact of Covid-19 lockdown in India: Different strokes for different folks","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.25.20111716","rel_abs":"The psychological impact of the lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic are widely documented. In India, a family-centric society with a high population density and extreme social stratification, the impact of the lockdown might vary across diverse social groups. However, the patterning in the psychological impact of the lockdown among sexual minorities and persons known to be at higher risk of contracting Covid-19 is not known in the Indian context. We used mixed methods (online survey, n=282 and in-depth interviews, n=14) to investigate whether the psychological impact of the lockdown was different across these groups of Indian adults. We fitted linear and logistic regression models adjusted for sociodemographic covariates. Thematic analysis helped us identify emergent themes in our qualitative narratives. Anxiety was found to be higher among sexual minorities ({beta}=2.44, CI: 0.58, 4.31), high-risk group ({beta}=2.20, CI:0.36, 4.05), and those with history of depression\/loneliness ({beta}=3.89, CI:2.34, 5.44). Addiction to pornography was also found to be higher among sexual minorities ({beta}=2.72, CI: 0.09, 5.36). Qualitative findings suggested that sexual minorities likely used pornography and masturbation to cope with the lockdown, given the limited physical access to sexual partners in a society that stigmatizes homosexuality. Moreover, both qualitative and quantitative study findings suggested that greater frequency of calling family members during lockdown could strengthen social relationships and increase social empathy. The study thereby urgently calls for the attention of policymakers to take sensitive and inclusive health decisions for the marginalized and the vulnerable, both during and after the crisis.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anupam Joya Sharma","author_inst":"IIT Gandhinagar"},{"author_name":"Malavika Ambale Subramanyam","author_inst":"IIT Gandhinagar"},{"author_name":"Woncheol Jang","author_inst":"Seoul National University"},{"author_name":"Sungkyu Jung","author_inst":"Seoul National University"},{"author_name":"Johan Lim","author_inst":"Seoul National University"},{"author_name":"Si Hui Pan","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"David Caianiello","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Jesse Collinski","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Immunology, New Haven, CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Edward deRamon","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Robert Hale","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Rebecca Howell","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Jason Ray","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Joseph Vinetz","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Infectious Diseases, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Morgan Levine","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Pathology, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Albert Ko","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health, Department of Epidemiology and Microbial Diseases, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"David Spiegel","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.22.20104679","rel_title":"COVIDTrach; the outcomes of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheostomy in the UK: Interim Report 22nd May 2020","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.22.20104679","rel_abs":"COVIDTrach is a UK multidisciplinary collaborative project that aims to evaluate the outcomes of tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients.

For controlling COVID-19 outbreaks, many countries have implemented two non-pharmaceutical interventions: suppression like immediate lock-downsin cities at epicentre of outbreak; or mitigation that slows down but not stopping epidemic for reducing peak healthcare demand. Both interventions have apparent pros and cons; the effectiveness of any one intervention in isolation is limited. It is crucial but hard to know how and when to take which level of interventions tailored to the specific situation in each country. We aimed to conduct a feasibility study for robustly accessing the effect of multiple interventions to control the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths, peaks and lengths of COVID-19 breakouts in the UK and other European countries, accounting for balance of healthcare demand. Methods We developed a model to attempt to infer the impact of mitigation, suppression and multiple rolling interventions for controlling COVID-19 outbreaks in the UK. Our model assumed that each intervention has equivalent effect on the reproduction number R across countries and over time; where its intensity was presented by average-number contacts with susceptible individuals as infectious individuals; early immediate intensive intervention led to increased health need and social anxiety. We considered two important features: direct link between Exposed and Recovered population, and practical healthcare demand by separation of infections into mild, moderate and critical cases. Our model was fitted and calibrated with date on cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan to estimate how suppression intervention impacted on the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths over time during January 2020, and April 2020. We combined the calibrated model with data on the cases of COVID-19 in London and non-London regions in the UK during February 2020 and April 2020 to estimate the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths, and healthcare demand by using multiple interventions. We applied the calibrated model to the prediction of infection and healthcare resource changes in other 6 European countries based on actual measures they have implemented during this period. Findings We estimated given that 1) By the date (5th March 2020) of the first report death in the UK, around 7499 people would have already been infected with the virus. After taking suppression on 23rd March, the peak of infection in the UK would have occurred between 28th March and 4th April 2020; the peak of death would have occurred between 18th April and 24th April 2020. 2) By 29th April, no significant collapse of health system in the UK have occurred, where there have been sufficient hospital beds for severe and critical cases. But in the Europe, Italy, Spain and France have experienced a 3 weeks period of shortage of hospital beds for severe and critical cases, leading to many deaths outside hospitals. 3) One optimal strategy to control COVID-19 outbreaks in the UK is to take region-level specific intervention. If taking suppression with very high intensity in London from 23rd March 2020 for 100 days, and 3 weeks rolling intervention between very high intensity and high intensity in non-London regions. The total infections and deaths in the UK were limited to 9.3 million and 143 thousand; the peak time of healthcare demand was due to the 96th day (12th May, 2020), where it needs hospital beds for 68.9 thousand severe and critical cases. 4) If taking a simultaneous 3 weeks rolling intervention between very high intensity and high intensity in all regions of the UK, the total infections and deaths increased slightly to 10 million and 154 thousand; the peak time of healthcare occurs at the 97th day (13th May, 2020), where it needs equivalent hospital beds for severe and critical cases of 73.5 thousand. 5) If too early releasing intervention intensity above moderate level and simultaneously implemented them in all regions of the UK, there would be a risk of second wave, where the total infections and deaths in the UK possibly reached to 23.4 million and 897 thousand. Interpretation: Considering social and economic costs in controlling COVID-19 outbreaks, long-term suppression is not economically viable. Our finding suggests that rolling intervention is an optimal strategy to effectively and efficiently control COVID-19 outbreaks in the UK and potential other countries for balancing healthcare demand and morality ratio. As for huge difference of population density and social distancing between different regions in the UK, it is more appropriate to implement regional level specific intervention with varied intensities and maintenance periods. We suggest an intervention strategy to the UK that take a consistent suppression in London for 100 days and 3 weeks rolling intervention in other regions. This strategy would reduce the overall infections and deaths of COVID-19 outbreaks, and balance healthcare demand in the UK.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Po Yang","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Jun Qi","author_inst":"Oxford University"},{"author_name":"Shuhao Zhang","author_inst":"Yunnan University"},{"author_name":"gaoshan Bi","author_inst":"Yunnan University"},{"author_name":"Xulong Wang","author_inst":"Yunnan University"},{"author_name":"Yun Yang","author_inst":"Yunnan University"},{"author_name":"Bin Sheng","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Xuxin Mao","author_inst":"National Institute of Economic and Social Research"},{"author_name":"Edward deRamon","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Robert Hale","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Rebecca Howell","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Jason Ray","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Joseph Vinetz","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Infectious Diseases, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Morgan Levine","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Pathology, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Albert Ko","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health, Department of Epidemiology and Microbial Diseases, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"David Spiegel","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.23.20110932","rel_title":"Remdesivir use in patients with coronavirus COVID-19 disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.23.20110932","rel_abs":"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has led to significant global mortality and morbidity. Until now, no treatment has proven to be effective in COVID-19. To explore whether the use of remdesivir, initially an experimental broad-spectrum antiviral, is effective in the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials investigating its use. Methods A rapid search of the MEDLINE and EMBASE medical databases was conducted for randomized controlled trials. A systematic approach was used to screen, abstract, and critically appraise the studies. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) method was applied to rate the certainty and quality of the evidence reported per study. Results Two RCTs studies were identified (n=1,299). A fixed-effects meta-analysis revealed reductions in mortality (RR=0.69, 0.49 to 0.99), time to clinical improvement (3.95 less days, from 3.86 days less to 4.05 less days ), serious adverse events (RR=0.77, 0.63 to 0.94) and all adverse events (RR=0.87, 0.79 to 0.96). Conclusion In this rapid systematic review, we present pooled evidence from the 2 included RCT studies that reveal that remdesivir has a modest yet significant reduction in mortality and significantly improves the time to recovery, as well as significantly reduced risk in adverse events and serious adverse events. It is more than likely that as an antiviral, remdesivir is not sufficient on its own and may be suitable in combination with other antivirals or treatments such as convalescent plasma. Research is ongoing to clarify and contextual these promising findings.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paul E Alexander","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Joshua Piticaru","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Kim Lewis","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Komal Aryal","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Priya Thomas","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Wojciech Szczeklik","author_inst":"Jagiellonian University Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jakub Fronczek","author_inst":"Jagiellonian University Medical College"},{"author_name":"Kamil Polok","author_inst":"Jagiellonian University Medical College"},{"author_name":"Waleed Alhazzani","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Manoj Mammen","author_inst":"The State University of New York at Buffalo"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Howell","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Jason Ray","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Joseph Vinetz","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Infectious Diseases, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Morgan Levine","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Pathology, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Albert Ko","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health, Department of Epidemiology and Microbial Diseases, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"David Spiegel","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.24.20112318","rel_title":"Utility of Pan-Family Assays for Rapid Viral Screening: Reducing Delays in Public Health Responses During Pandemics","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.24.20112318","rel_abs":"Background The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has highlighted deficiencies in the testing capacity of many developed countries during the early stages of emerging pandemics. Here we describe the potential for pan-family viral assays to improve early accessibility of large-scale nucleic acid testing. Methods Coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 were used as a case-study for investigating the utility of pan-family viral assays during the early stages of a novel pandemic. Specificity of a pan-coronavirus (Pan-CoV) assay for viral detection was assessed using the frequency of common human coronavirus (HCoV) species in key populations. A reported Pan-CoV assay was assessed to determine sensitivity to SARS-CoV-2 and 59 other coronavirus species. The resilience of the primer target regions of this assay to mutation was assessed in 8893 high quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes to predict ongoing utility during pandemic progression. Findings Due to infection with common HCoV species, a Pan-CoV assay would return a false positive for as few as 1% of asymptomatic adults, but up to 30% of immunocompromised patients displaying symptoms of respiratory disease. Two of the four reported pan-coronavirus assays would have identified SARS-CoV-2 and we demonstrate that with small adjustments to the primers, these assays can accommodate novel variation observed in animal coronaviruses. The assay target region of one well established Pan-CoV assay is highly resistant to mutation compared to regions targeted by other widely applied SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assays. Interpretation Pan-family assays have the potential to greatly assist management of emerging public health emergencies through prioritization of high-resolution testing or isolation measures, despite limitations in test specificity due to cross-reactivity with common pathogens. Targeting highly conserved genomic regions make pan-family assays robust and resilient to mutation of a given virus. This approach may be applicable to other viral families and has utility as part of a strategic stockpile of tests maintained to better contain spread of novel diseases prior to the widespread availability of specific assays.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael Erlichster","author_inst":"MX3 Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Gursharan Chana","author_inst":"MX3 Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Daniela Zantomio","author_inst":"Austin Health"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Goudey","author_inst":"IBM Research Australia"},{"author_name":"Efstratios Skafidas","author_inst":"MX3 Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Wojciech Szczeklik","author_inst":"Jagiellonian University Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jakub Fronczek","author_inst":"Jagiellonian University Medical College"},{"author_name":"Kamil Polok","author_inst":"Jagiellonian University Medical College"},{"author_name":"Waleed Alhazzani","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Manoj Mammen","author_inst":"The State University of New York at Buffalo"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Howell","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Jason Ray","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Joseph Vinetz","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Infectious Diseases, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Morgan Levine","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Pathology, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"Albert Ko","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health, Department of Epidemiology and Microbial Diseases, New Haven CT, USA."},{"author_name":"David Spiegel","author_inst":"Yale University, Department of Chemistry, New Haven CT, USA."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.24.20111245","rel_title":"IgG serology in health care and administrative staff populations from 7 hospital representative of different exposures to SARS-CoV-2 in Lombardy, Italy","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.24.20111245","rel_abs":"Lombardy is one of the regions in Italy most affected by COVID-19.

Subjects filled an anamnestic questionnaire to self-report on COVID-19 symptoms, co-morbidities, smoking, regular or smart-working, and the exposure to COVID-19-infected individuals. We show that the number of individuals exposed to the virus depended on the geographical area where the hospital was located and ranged between 3 to 43% which correlated with the incidence of COVID-19 in Lombardy. There was a higher prevalence of females than males positive for IgG, however the level of antibodies was similar, suggesting a comparable magnitude of the response. We observed 10% of IgG positive asymptomatic individuals and another 20% with one or two symptoms. 81% of individuals presenting both anosmia\/ageusia and fever resulted SARS-CoV-2 infected.

Here, we developed and evaluated a novel microsphere-based antibody assay (MBA) for the detection of immunoglobulin G (IgG) against SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (NP) and spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). Method: We developed a microsphere-based assay (MBA) to determine the levels of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 NP and spike RBD. The seropositive cut-off mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) was set using a cohort of 294 anonymous serum specimens collected in 2018. The specificity was assessed using serum specimens collected from organ donors or influenza patients before 2020. Seropositive rate was determined among patients with COVID-19. Time-to-seropositivity and signal-to-cutoff (S\/CO) ratio were compared between MBA and EIA. Results: MBA had a specificity of 100% (93\/93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 96-100%) for anti-NP IgG and 98.9% (92\/93; 95% CI 94.2-100%) for anti-RBD IgG. The MBA seropositive rate for convalescent serum specimens of COVID-19 patients were 89.8% (35\/39) for anti-NP IgG and 79.5% (31\/39) for anti-RBD IgG. The time-to-seropositivity was shorter with MBA than that of EIA. When compared with EIA, MBA could better differentiate between COVID-19 patients and negative controls with significantly higher S\/CO ratio for COVID-19 patients and lower S\/CO ratio with negative controls. MBA also had fewer specimens in the equivocal range (S\/CO 0.9-1.1) than EIA. Conclusion: MBA is robust and simple, and is suitable for clinical microbiology laboratory for the accurate determination of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody for retrospective diagnosis, serosurveillance, and vaccine trials.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carol Ho Yan Fong","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Thrimendra Kaushika Dissanayake","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Lin-Lei Chen","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Yee-Ki Choi","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Lok-Hin Wong","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Anthony Chin-Ki Ng","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Polly K.P Pang","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Deborah Tip-Yin Ho","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Rosana Wing-Shan Poon","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Tom Wai-Hin Chung","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Siddharth Sridhar","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Kwok-Hung Chan","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Jasper Fuk-Woo Chan","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Ivan Fan-Ngai Hung","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Kwok-Yung Yuen","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Kelvin Kai-Wang To","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.23.20111401","rel_title":"Association of Renin Angiotensin System Blockers with Outcomes in Patients with Covid-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.23.20111401","rel_abs":"Background: Patients with cardiovascular disease are at increased risk of critical illness and mortality from Covid-19 disease. Conflicting findings have raised concerns regarding the association of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) use with likelihood or severity of infection during this pandemic. Objective: To study the cumulative evidence for association of ACEI\/ARB use with outcomes among patients with confirmed Covid-19. Methods: The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were thoroughly searched from November 01, 2019 to May 15, 2020 for studies reporting on outcomes based on ACEI\/ARB use in patients with confirmed Covid-19. Preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis guidelines were used for the present study. Relevant data was collected and pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using random-effects model. Main Outcome measures: In-hospital mortality was the primary end of interest. Second end-point was severe or critical illness defined as either need for intensive care unit, invasive mechanical ventilation, or mortality. Results: Fifteen studies with total of 23,822 patients (N ACEI\/ARB=6,650) were included in the present analysis. Overall, prevalence of ACEI\/ARB use ranged from 7.7% to 46.2% across studies. Among 10 studies, patients using ACEI\/ARB had similar odds of mortality [OR 1.03 (0.69-1.55)] and severe or critical illness [1.18 (0.91-1.54)] compared to those not on ACEI\/ARB. In an analysis restricted to patients with hypertension, ACEI\/ARB use was associated with significantly lower mortality [0.64 (0.45-0.89)], while the odds of severe\/critical illness [0.76(0.52-1.12); p=0.16] remained non-significant compared with non-ACEI\/ARB users. Conclusion: There is no evidence for increased risk of severe illness or mortality in patients using ACEI\/ARB compared with non-users. In patients with hypertension, ACE\/ARB use might be associated with reduced mortality, however these findings need to be confirmed in prospective randomized controlled trials.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aakash Garg","author_inst":"Newark Beth Israel Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Amit Rout","author_inst":"Sinai Hospital"},{"author_name":"Abhishek Sharma","author_inst":"Gunderson Lutheran Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Brittany Fiorello","author_inst":"Cambridge Health Alliance"},{"author_name":"John B.

This paper studies the fate of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in wastewater treatment plants using RT-qPCR with a two-fold goal: i) to check the safety of the water effluent and also of the sludge produced and ii) based on the understanding of the virus particles fate, to identify the most suitable spots for detecting the incidence of COVID-19 and monitor its evolution. On the grounds of the affinity of enveloped virus towards biosolids, we hypothesized that the sludge line acts as a concentrator of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material. Sampling several spots in primary, secondary and sludge treatment at the Ourense (Spain) WWTP showed that, in effect, most of SARS-CoV-2 particles cannot be detected in the water effluent as they are retained by the sludge line. We identified the sludge thickener as a suitable spot for detecting SARS-CoV-2 particles thanks to its higher solids concentration (more virus particles) and longer residence time (less sensitive to dilution caused by precipitation). Although more studies will be needed for confirmation, these results contribute to clarify the role of WWTPs in COVID-19 mitigation.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sabela Balboa","author_inst":"Universidade de Santiago de Compostela"},{"author_name":"Miguel Mauricio-Iglesias","author_inst":"Universidade de Santiago de Compostela"},{"author_name":"Santiago Rodr\u00edguez","author_inst":"Viaqua, S.A."},{"author_name":"Luc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez-Lamas","author_inst":"Galicia Sur Health Research Institute (IIS Galicia Sur), SERGAS-Universidade de Vigo"},{"author_name":"Francisco J Vasallo","author_inst":"Galicia Sur Health Research Institute (IIS Galicia Sur) SERGAS-Universidade de Vigo"},{"author_name":"Benito Regueiro","author_inst":"Universidade de Santiago de Compostela"},{"author_name":"Juan M Lema","author_inst":"Universidade de Santiago de Compostela"},{"author_name":"Deborah Tip-Yin Ho","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Rosana Wing-Shan Poon","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Tom Wai-Hin Chung","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Siddharth Sridhar","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Kwok-Hung Chan","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Jasper Fuk-Woo Chan","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Ivan Fan-Ngai Hung","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Kwok-Yung Yuen","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Kelvin Kai-Wang To","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.24.20092817","rel_title":"Inferring the effective start dates of non-pharmaceutical interventions during COVID-19 outbreaks","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.24.20092817","rel_abs":"During Feb-Apr 2020, many countries implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as school closures and lockdowns, with variable schedules, to control the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Many experts worldwide predict it to happen in India between end of May and end of July. Objectives: The aim of this research was to find an answer that whether India would come across the looming conditions of SARS-COVID-19 in coming days given the prevailing circumstances so far. Methods: The proposed approach used fundamental concept of Statistics by fixing the standard reference to the number of daily new tests conducted by a country. We thus computed the percentage of daily new cases and daily new deaths, in using such references. The trends were studied using simple line chart. The theory of three sigma was also used to build the upper bound for daily new cases and deaths, specifically for India to see the extreme conditions. Results: The analysis was done using data from January to till May 18, 2020 for India, Italy, USA and UK. The trend of India was almost fix between ~2% to ~6% till May 18, 2020. On contrary, Italy, USA and UK were touched the Peak on March 29, 2020 (24.38%), April 26, 2020 (23.51%) and April 24, 2020 (24.91%), respectively and declining since then. Similar trends were also noted in daily new deaths, except Italy. Conclusions: The proposed new concept for fixing universal reference provides a consistent and coherent results. It is thus clear from observed data so far that India is not going to encounter the frightened conditions or peak, like, Italy, USA, and UK for pandemic SARS-COVID-19, given the existing conditions, excluding the current migration.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pramod K.

In the absence of treatment for this virus, there is an urgent need to find alternative public health strategies to control the spread. Here, we have conducted an online search for all relevant public health interventions for COVID-19. We then characterize and summarize the global COVID-19 pandemic situation and recommend potential mitigation strategies in the context of Ethiopia. Methods: Initial search of Pub Med central and Google scholar was undertaken followed by analysis of the text words; COVID-19,SARS-CoV-2, Global lessons and Pandemic; A second search using all identified keywords including COVID-19, Epidemiology, Sociocultural, Ethiopia; thirdly, the reference list of all identified reports and articles were searched. Accordingly, of the 1,402 articles, 39 were included in the analysis for this review. Result: Countries COVID-19 mitigation strategies widely varied. The most common global COVID-19 mitigation strategies include; whole of government approach including individual, community and environmental measures, detecting and isolating cases, contact tracing and quarantine, social and physical distancing measures including for mass gatherings and international travel measures. Models revealed that, social and physical distancing alone could prevent the pandemic from 60-95%, if timely and effectively implemented. Moreover, detecting and isolation of cases were found to be crucial while access to testing was found to the global challenge. Individual measures including proper hand washing were also reported to be effective measures in preventing the pandemic. Asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 ranged from 25% to 80% and as a result, countries are revising the case definition for early detection of mild symptomatic cases of COVID-19 with inclusion of Chills, Muscle pain and new loss of taste or smell in addition to Cough, Shortness of breath, Fever and Sore throat. Global reports also revealed that the incubation period of COVID-19 could go to 24 days. Ethiopia is also unique in the aspects of sociocultural prospects while more than 99.3% of the population has a religion. Moreover, 69% of the population is under the age of 29 years old and the health policy in the country focused on prevention and primary health care. All these could be potential entries and opportunities to combat COVID-19 pandemic in the context of Ethiopia. Conclusion: While recommendations may change depending on the level of outbreak, we conclude that in Most countries have benefited from early interventions and in setups like Africa including Ethiopia where health system capability is limited, community engagement supported by local evidence with strict implementation of social and physical distancing measures is mandatory. Active involvement of religious Institutions and mobilizing youth could be entry to increase public awareness in mitigating COVID-19. Community level case detection could enhance early identification of cases which could be implemented through the health extension program. Isolation and quarantine beyond 14 days could help identify long term carriers of COVID-19. Validation and use of rapid test kits could be vital to increase access for testing. Revision of case definitions for COVID-19 could be important for early detection and identification of mild symptomatic cases.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yimam Getaneh","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute"},{"author_name":"Ajanaw Yizengaw","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute"},{"author_name":"Sisay Adane","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute"},{"author_name":"Kidist Zealiyas","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute"},{"author_name":"Zelalem Abate","author_inst":"Clinton Health Access Initiative"},{"author_name":"Sileshi Leulseged","author_inst":"ICAP-Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Hailemichael Desalegn","author_inst":"St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical Collage"},{"author_name":"Getnet Yimer","author_inst":"Global One Health Initiative,East Africal Regional office"},{"author_name":"Ebba Abate","author_inst":"Ethiopian Public Health Institute"},{"author_name":"Tom Wai-Hin Chung","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Siddharth Sridhar","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Kwok-Hung Chan","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Jasper Fuk-Woo Chan","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Ivan Fan-Ngai Hung","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Kwok-Yung Yuen","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Kelvin Kai-Wang To","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"}]}
