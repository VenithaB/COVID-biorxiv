Method: A rapid systematic review was conducted by searching the PubMed, Embase, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases on April 13, 2020. Three clinical trial registry platforms, including ClinicalTrials.gov, the EU Clinical Trials Register, and the Chinese Clinical Trial Register were also complementarily searched. Results: A total of 10 clinical studies were identified, including 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 1 comparative nonrandomized trial, 5 single-arm trials, and 1 interim analysis. The heterogeneity among studies of the baseline disease severity and reported endpoints made a pooled analysis impossible. CQ and HCQ (with or without azithromycin) showed significant therapeutic benefit in terms of virologic clearance rate, improvement in symptoms and imaging findings, time to clinical recovery, and length of hospital stay in 1 RCT, 4 single-arm trials, and the interim analysis, whereas no treatment benefit of CQ or HCQ was observed in the remaining 4 studies. Limitations of the included studies ranged from small sample size, to insufficient information concerning baseline patient characteristics, to potential for selection bias without detailing the rationale for exclusion, and presence of confounding factors. Conclusion: Based on the studies evaluated, there still lacked solid evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of HCQ and CQ as a treatment for COVID-19 with or without azithromycin. This emphasized the importance of robust RCTs investing HCQ\/CQ to address the evidence uncertainties.

Conflicting reports exist regarding the impact of smoking on the risk of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. METHODS We carried out a population-based study among over 3,000,000 adult members of Clalit Health Services, the largest health provider in Israel. Since the beginning of the disease outbreak, 114,545 individuals underwent RT-PCR testing for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and 4.0% had positive results. We performed a case-control study among patients who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing, to assess the impact of smoking on infection incidence and severity. Individuals with positive tests were matched in a 1:5 ratio to individuals tested negative, of the same sex, age, and ethnicity\/religion. Conditional logistic regressions were performed to evaluate odds ratios for current and previous smoking on the risk of testing positive. Multivariable logistic regressions were performed among patients infected with COVID-19 to estimate the association between smoking and fatal or severe disease requiring ventilation. Regressions were performed with and without adjustment for preexisting medical conditions. RESULTS In the matched cohort, current smokers (9.8%) were significantly less prevalent among members tested positive compared to the general population, and to matched members tested negative (19.4%, P<0.001). Current smoking was associated with significantly reduced odds ratio (OR) for testing positive OR=0.457 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.407-0.514). Among patients tested positive, there was no evidence of significantly increased risk of developing severe or fatal disease. CONCLUSION The risk of infection by COVID-19 appears to be reduced by half among current smokers. This intriguing finding may reveal unique infection mechanisms present for COVID-19 which may be targeted to combat the disease and reduce its infection rate.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ariel Israel","author_inst":"Department of Research and Data, Division of Planning and Strategy, Clalit Health Services, Tel-Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ilan Feldhamer","author_inst":"Department of Research and Data, Division of Planning and Strategy, Clalit Health Services, Tel-Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Amnon Lahad","author_inst":"Departments of Family Medicine, Clalit Health Services and Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel"},{"author_name":"Diane Levin-Zamir","author_inst":"Clalit Health Services; University of Haifa School of Public Health, Israel"},{"author_name":"Gil Lavie","author_inst":"Division of Planning and Strategy, Clalit Health Services, Tel-Aviv, Israel; Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion-Israel Institute of Technolo"},{"author_name":"Anna Nowotarska","author_inst":"Creativ-Ceutical company"},{"author_name":"Mondher Toumi","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.29.20097097","rel_title":"Population mobility reductions during COVID-19 epidemic in France under lockdown","rel_date":"2020-06-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.29.20097097","rel_abs":"On March 17, 2020, French authorities implemented a nationwide lockdown to respond to COVID-19 epidemic emergency and curb the surge of patients requiring critical care, similarly to other countries. Evaluating the impact of lockdown on population mobility is important to help characterize the changes in social dynamics that affected viral diffusion. Using travel flows reconstructed from mobile phone trajectories, we measured how lockdown altered mobility patterns at both local and country scales. Lockdown caused a 65% reduction in countrywide number of displacements, and was particularly effective in reducing work-related short-range mobility, especially during rush hours, and recreational long-range trips. Anomalous increases in long-range movements, localized in both time and space, emerged even before lockdown announcement. Mobility drops were unevenly distributed across regions. They were strongly associated with active population, workers employed in sectors highly impacted by lockdown, and number of hospitalizations per region, and moderately associated with socio-economic level of the region. Major cities largely shrank their pattern of connectivity, reducing it mainly to short-range commuting, despite the persistence of some long-range trips. Our findings indicate that lockdown was very effective in reducing population mobility across scales. Caution should be taken in the timing of policy announcements and implementation. Individual response to policy announcements may generate unexpected anomalous behaviors increasing the risk of geographical diffusion. On the other hand, risk awareness may be beneficial in further decreasing mobility in largely affected regions. Our findings help predicting how and where restrictions will be the most effective in reducing the mobility and mixing of the population, thus aiding tuning recommendations in the upcoming weeks, when phasing out lockdown.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giulia Pullano","author_inst":"INSERM\/ORANGE S.A."},{"author_name":"Eugenio Valdano","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Nicola Scarpa","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Stefania Rubrichi","author_inst":"Orange S.

Limited evidence is available concerning breastfeeding in women with COVID-19. Methods: Twenty-three pregnant women and puerperae were enrolled in the study. To evaluate the effect of breastfeeding on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, the presence of SARS-CoV-2, IgG and IgM in breast milk, maternal blood and infant blood were assessed. Feeding patterns were also recorded in follow-up. Results: No positive detection for SARS-CoV-2 of neonates was found. All breast milk samples were negative for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The presence of IgM ofSARS-CoV-2 in breast milk was correlated with maternal blood. The results of IgG detection for SARS-CoV-2 were negative in all breast milk samples. All the infants were in healthy condition while six of them were fed with whole or partial breast milk. Eight infants received antibody test for SARS-CoV-2 in one month after birth and the results were all negative.

Methods We conducted an observational study at two large urban academic Level 1 trauma centers. Consecutive patients admitted to the ICU with a positive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction test from March 1st, 2020 to April 27, 2020 were included. Individuals younger than 18 years of age, without any documented delirium assessments (CAM-ICU), or without a discharge disposition were excluded. The primary outcomes were delirium rates and delirium duration and the secondary outcome was delirium severity. Outcomes were assessed for up to the first 14 days of ICU stay. Results Of 243 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the ICU, 144 met eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis. Delirium occurred in 73.6% (106\/144) and delirium or coma occurred in 76.4% (110\/144). Sixty-three percent of patients were positive for delirium on the first CAM-ICU assessment. The median duration of delirium and coma was 7 days (IQR: 3-10), and the median delirium duration was 5 days (IQR: 2-7). The median CAM-ICU-7 score was 6 (IQR: 4-7) representing severe delirium. Mechanical ventilation was associated with greater odds of developing delirium (OR: 42.1, 95%CI: 13.0-137.1). Mortality was 26.4% in patients with delirium compared to 15.8% in patients without delirium. Conclusions 73.6% of patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19 experience delirium that persists for approximately 1 week. Invasive mechanical ventilation is significantly associated with odds of delirium. Clinical attention to prevent and manage delirium and reduce delirium duration and severity is urgently needed for patients with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sikandar H Khan","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Heidi Lindroth","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Anthony J Perkins","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yasser Jamil","author_inst":"Lebanese American University"},{"author_name":"Sophia Wang","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Scott Roberts","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark O Farber","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Omar Rahman","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sujuan Gao","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Edward R Marcantonio","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Malaz Boustani","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Roberto Machado","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Babar A Khan","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Marc Kanter","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Lincoln"},{"author_name":"Stuart Kessler","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Elmhurst"},{"author_name":"Ross B Kristal","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Joseph J Lieber","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Elmhurst"},{"author_name":"Vikramjit Mukherjee","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Bellevue"},{"author_name":"Vincent Rizzo Jr.","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Queens"},{"author_name":"Madden Rowell","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"David Stevens","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Kings County"},{"author_name":"Elana Sydney","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Jacobi"},{"author_name":"Andrew Wallach","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Dave A Chokshi","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Nichola Davis","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"- New York City Health + Hospitals Covid-19 Population Health Data Team","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.31.20118802","rel_title":"The Association Between Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers and the Number of Covid-19 Confirmed Cases and Deaths in the United States: Geospatial Study","rel_date":"2020-06-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.31.20118802","rel_abs":"Background: The novel coronavirus SARS-Cov2 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor as an entry point to the cell. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a risk factor for the novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) with poor outcomes. We hypothesized that the rate of ACE inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) use is associated with the rate of Covid-19 confirmed cases and deaths. Methods: We conducted a geospatial study using publicly available county-level data. The Medicare ACEI and ARB prescription rate was exposure. The Covid-19 confirmed case and death rates were outcomes. Spatial autoregression models were adjusted for the percentage of Black residents, children, residents with at least some college degree, median household income, air quality index, CVD hospitalization rate in Medicare beneficiaries, and CVD death rate in a total county population. Findings: After adjustment for confounders, the ACEI use rate did not associate with Covid-19 confirmed case rate (direct county-own effect +0.11 %; 95%CI -0.31 to 0.53; P=0.600, and indirect spillover effect -0.53 %; 95%CI -3.89 to 2.84; P=0.760). The ARB use rate was associated with increased Covid-19 confirmed case rate (direct county-owned effect +0.12 %; 95%CI 0.05-0.19; P=0.002, and indirect spillover effect -0.33 %; 95%CI -2.11 to 1.44; P=0.714). Sensitivity analysis indicated an absence of significant reverse causality bias for analyses with Covid-19 confirmed case rate, but not death rate outcome. Interpretation: Our results highlight the safety of ACEI use for patients with clinical indications for ACEI use. However, an increase in ARB use by 1% was associated with a 0.12 % increase in Covid-19 confirmed cases. The use of ARB, due to known ACE2 upregulation, may facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry into target cells and increase infectivity. Cluster-randomized controlled trial is warranted to answer the question of whether the replacement of ARB by ACEI may reduce the Covid-19 confirmed case rate.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kyle Johnson","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Maedeh Khayyat-Kholghi","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Blake Johnson","author_inst":"Flexport, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Larisa G Tereshchenko","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Sophia Wang","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Scott Roberts","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark O Farber","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Omar Rahman","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sujuan Gao","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Edward R Marcantonio","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Malaz Boustani","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Roberto Machado","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Babar A Khan","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Marc Kanter","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Lincoln"},{"author_name":"Stuart Kessler","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Elmhurst"},{"author_name":"Ross B Kristal","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Joseph J Lieber","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Elmhurst"},{"author_name":"Vikramjit Mukherjee","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Bellevue"},{"author_name":"Vincent Rizzo Jr.","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Queens"},{"author_name":"Madden Rowell","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"David Stevens","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Kings County"},{"author_name":"Elana Sydney","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Jacobi"},{"author_name":"Andrew Wallach","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Dave A Chokshi","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Nichola Davis","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"- New York City Health + Hospitals Covid-19 Population Health Data Team","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"cardiovascular medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.31.20118695","rel_title":"ON THE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HERD IMMUNITY LEVELS REQUIRED TO STOP COVID-19 EPIDEMICS","rel_date":"2020-06-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.31.20118695","rel_abs":"COVID-19 evolved into a pandemic in 2020 affecting more than 150 countries. Given the absence of a vaccine, discussion has taken place on the strategy of allowing the virus to spread in a population, to increase population \"herd immunity\". Knowledge of the minimum proportion of a population required to have recovered from COVID-19 infection in order to attain \"herd\" immunity, P(crit), is important for formulating epidemiological policy. A method for measuring uncertainty about P(crit) based on a widely used package, EpiEstim, is derived. The procedure is illustrated using data from twelve countries at two early times during the COVID-19 epidemic. It is shown that simple plug-in measures of confidence on estimates of P(crit) are misleading, but that a full characterization of statistical uncertainty can be derived from EpiEstim, which reports percentiles only. Because of the important levels of uncertainty, it is risky to design epidemiological policy based on guidance provided by a single point estimate.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"DANIEL GIANOLA","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON"},{"author_name":"Maedeh Khayyat-Kholghi","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Blake Johnson","author_inst":"Flexport, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Larisa G Tereshchenko","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Sophia Wang","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Scott Roberts","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark O Farber","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Omar Rahman","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sujuan Gao","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Edward R Marcantonio","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Malaz Boustani","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Roberto Machado","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Babar A Khan","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Marc Kanter","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Lincoln"},{"author_name":"Stuart Kessler","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Elmhurst"},{"author_name":"Ross B Kristal","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Joseph J Lieber","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Elmhurst"},{"author_name":"Vikramjit Mukherjee","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Bellevue"},{"author_name":"Vincent Rizzo Jr.","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Queens"},{"author_name":"Madden Rowell","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"David Stevens","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Kings County"},{"author_name":"Elana Sydney","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Jacobi"},{"author_name":"Andrew Wallach","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Dave A Chokshi","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Nichola Davis","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"- New York City Health + Hospitals Covid-19 Population Health Data Team","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.29.20100735","rel_title":"Psychosocial factors and hospitalisations for COVID-19: Prospective cohort study of the general population","rel_date":"2020-06-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.29.20100735","rel_abs":"Objective: To examine the association of a range of psychosocial factors with hospitalisation for COVID-19. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: England. Participants: UK Biobank comprises around half a million people who were aged 40 to 69 years at study induction between 2006 and 2010 when information on psychosocial factors and covariates were captured. Main outcome measure: Hospitalisation for COVID-19 in England between 16th March and 26th April 2020 as provided by Public Health England. Results: There were 908 hospitalisations for COVID-19 in an analytical sample of 431,051 people. In age- and sex-adjusted analyses, an elevated risk of COVID-19 was related to disadvantaged levels of education (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval: 2.05; 1.70, 2.47), income (2.00; 1.63, 2,47), area deprivation (2.20; 1.86, 2.59), occupation (1.39; 1.14, 1.69), psychological distress (1.58; 1.32, 1.89), mental health (1.50; 1.25, 1.79), neuroticism (1.19; 1.00, 1.42), and performance on two tests of cognitive function: verbal and numerical reasoning (2.66; 2.06, 3.34) and reaction speed (1.27; 1.08, 1.51). These associations were graded (p-value for trend <=0.038) such that effects were apparent across the full psychosocial continua. After mutual adjustment for these characteristics plus ethnicity, comorbidity, and lifestyle factors, only the relationship between lower cognitive function as measured using the reasoning test and a doubling in the risk of the infection remained (1.98; 1.38, 2.85). Conclusion: A range of psychosocial factors revealed associations with hospitalisations for COVID-19 of which the relation with cognitive function was most robust to statistical adjustment.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"George David Batty","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Ian Deary","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Michelle Luciano","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Drew Altschul","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Mika Kivimaki","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Catharine Gale","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Mark O Farber","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Omar Rahman","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sujuan Gao","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Edward R Marcantonio","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Malaz Boustani","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Roberto Machado","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Babar A Khan","author_inst":"Indiana University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Marc Kanter","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Lincoln"},{"author_name":"Stuart Kessler","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Elmhurst"},{"author_name":"Ross B Kristal","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Joseph J Lieber","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Elmhurst"},{"author_name":"Vikramjit Mukherjee","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Bellevue"},{"author_name":"Vincent Rizzo Jr.","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Queens"},{"author_name":"Madden Rowell","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"David Stevens","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Kings County"},{"author_name":"Elana Sydney","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Jacobi"},{"author_name":"Andrew Wallach","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Dave A Chokshi","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Nichola Davis","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"- New York City Health + Hospitals Covid-19 Population Health Data Team","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.01.20118844","rel_title":"On Reliability of the COVID-19 Forecasts","rel_date":"2020-06-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.01.20118844","rel_abs":"In this expository article, we are aiming to show with an example that even short term forecasts regarding the COVID-19 spread pattern may sometimes not be very reliable.

From May 9 to May 13, the nearly exponential character of the spread was found to be absent. Hence it can be concluded that the COVID-19 spread pattern, even after more than four months from the start of the outbreak, is not quite predictable.

Various hematological parameters alteration has been documented in the Chinese literature in SARS-Cov-2 infection. However, there is a need for research to evaluate the pattern of the hematological parameters of COVID-19 patients in the Indian population. Aims & Objectives: The objective of the study is to see the Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), Platelet Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR), and other hematological parameters alteration of COVID-19 patients along with their clinical course in the Indian scenario. Methods: A single-center prospective study of 32 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Super Speciality Pediatric Hospital & Post Graduate Teaching Institute NOIDA, from March to April, were enrolled for the study. The demographic data, the clinical status of the patients during admission and follow up, baseline, and follow up hematological findings were recorded. Statistical analysis of the data was carried out, and relevant findings were presented. Results: Demographic characterization shows a mean age of 37.7 years, male (41.9%), female (58.1%)with the majority of patients are mildly symptomatic to asymptomatic(93%). The CBC values and NLR, PLR at baseline between the male and the female patients, are not showing any statistically significant difference as the 95% C.I. A statistically significant increment in the lab parameters is observed in follow-up visits. Conclusion: The majority of the patients are younger and have mild clinical presentation with female predominance. Pediatric cases have mild symptomology. Baseline CBC findings show mild neutrophilia, lymphopenia, eosinopenia, and normal to mild thrombocytopenia. An increase in CBC parameters, NLR was noted in follow up cases. Anemia was not noted in baseline CBC and in the follow-up group. A onetime PLR is not indicative of disease progression.

Methods: Cancer patient who required treatment, were evaluated for potential COVID-19 infection in a 90-day period, starting from beginning of this epidemic in Iran, January, to April 19, 2020. For treatment of solid tumor patients, if they did not have symptoms related to COVID-19, just chest X-ray was requested. If they showed COVID-19 related symptoms, High Resolution CT scan of lungs was requested. For hematology cancer patients, PCR test for COVID-19 infection was requested as well. Protection measures were considered for personnel of oncology wards. Results: In this study, 279 patients were followed up in this 90-day period. No COVID-19 infection was observed in 92 cases of breast cancer, 72 cases of colon cancer, 14 cases of gastric cancer and 12 cases of pancreaticobiliary cancer .However, in 11 cases of lung cancer, 5 cases brain tumors and 12 cases ovarian cancer; 3 case of COVID-19 were observed.

The virus inoculated on plastic surface was harvested at predefined time-points and tested to evaluate viral titres on Vero cells by TCID50. Our results confirm that fomite transmission of the emerging SARS-CoV2 is possible, since the virus remains viable on surfaces up to 84 hours at both RT and JT. Moreover, a remarkable difference between the two temperatures exists, suggesting that virus vitality can be influenced by the environmental temperature. Our results support the hypothesis that in the hot season the increase of temperature could influence the environmental endurance of SARS-CoV2 and reduce Covid-19 transmission probability.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fabio Magurano","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita'"},{"author_name":"Melissa Baggieri","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita'"},{"author_name":"Antonella Marchi","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita'"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Rezza","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita'"},{"author_name":"Loredana Nicoletti","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita'"},{"author_name":"- Covid-19 Study Group","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Dennis T Maglinte","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Dejerianne Ostrow","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Jaclyn A Biegel","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles; University of California, Keck School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alexander R Judkins","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles; University of California, Keck School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey M Bender","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles; University of California, Keck School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xiaowu Gai","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles; University of California, Keck School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Dien Bard","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles; University of California, Keck School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Marc Kanter","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Lincoln"},{"author_name":"Stuart Kessler","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Elmhurst"},{"author_name":"Ross B Kristal","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Joseph J Lieber","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Elmhurst"},{"author_name":"Vikramjit Mukherjee","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Bellevue"},{"author_name":"Vincent Rizzo Jr.","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Queens"},{"author_name":"Madden Rowell","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"David Stevens","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Kings County"},{"author_name":"Elana Sydney","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Jacobi"},{"author_name":"Andrew Wallach","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Dave A Chokshi","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Nichola Davis","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"- New York City Health + Hospitals Covid-19 Population Health Data Team","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.29.124107","rel_title":"Synergistic effects of anionic surfactants on coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) virucidal efficiency of sanitizing fluids to fight COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-06-01","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.29.124107","rel_abs":"Our surrounding environment, especially often-touched contaminated surfaces, plays an important role in the transmission of pathogens in society. The shortage of effective sanitizing fluids, however, became a global challenge quickly after the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) outbreak in December 2019. In this study, we present the effect of surfactants on coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) virucidal efficiency in sanitizing fluids. Sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS), sodium laureth sulfate (SLS), and two commercial dish soap and liquid hand soap were studied with the goal of evaporation rate reduction in sanitizing liquids to maximize surface contact time. Twelve fluids with different recipes composed of ethanol, isopropanol, SDBS, SLS, glycerin, and water of standardized hardness (WSH) were tested for their evaporation time and virucidal efficiency. Evaporation time increased by 17-63% when surfactant agents were added to the liquid. In addition, surfactant incorporation enhanced the virucidal efficiency between 15-27% according to the 4-field test in the EN 16615:2015 European Standard method. Most importantly, however, we found that surfactant addition provides a synergistic effect with alcohols to inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This study provides a simple, yet effective solution to improve the virucidal efficiency of commonly used sanitizers.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Reza Jahromi","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Vahid Mogharab","author_inst":"Jahrom University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hossein Jahromi","author_inst":"Auburn University"},{"author_name":"Arezoo Avazpour","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Azad University of Mashhad"},{"author_name":"Loredana Nicoletti","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita'"},{"author_name":"- Covid-19 Study Group","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Dennis T Maglinte","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Dejerianne Ostrow","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Jaclyn A Biegel","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles; University of California, Keck School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alexander R Judkins","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles; University of California, Keck School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey M Bender","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles; University of California, Keck School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xiaowu Gai","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles; University of California, Keck School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Dien Bard","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles; University of California, Keck School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Marc Kanter","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Lincoln"},{"author_name":"Stuart Kessler","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Elmhurst"},{"author_name":"Ross B Kristal","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Joseph J Lieber","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Elmhurst"},{"author_name":"Vikramjit Mukherjee","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Bellevue"},{"author_name":"Vincent Rizzo Jr.","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Queens"},{"author_name":"Madden Rowell","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"David Stevens","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Kings County"},{"author_name":"Elana Sydney","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Jacobi"},{"author_name":"Andrew Wallach","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Dave A Chokshi","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Nichola Davis","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"- New York City Health + Hospitals Covid-19 Population Health Data Team","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"bioengineering"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.01.127829","rel_title":"Targeted Intracellular Degradation of SARS-CoV-2 RBD via Computationally-Optimized Peptide Fusions","rel_date":"2020-06-01","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.01.127829","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has elicited a global health crisis of catastrophic proportions.

Owing to unavailability of the vaccine, we propose a de novo synthesised avian orthoavulavirus 1 (AOaV-1)-based topical respiratory vaccine candidate against CoVID-19. Avirulent strain of Newcastle disease virus, proto-type virus of AOaV-1, was engineered to express full length spike (S) glycoprotein which is highly neutralizing and major protective antigen of the SARS-CoV-2. Broad-scale in vitro characterization of recombinant vaccine candidate demonstrated efficient co-expression of the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) of AOaV-1 and S protein of SARS-CoV-2, and comparable replication kinetics were observed in cell culture model. The recombinant vaccine candidate virus actively replicated and spread within cells independently of exogenous trypsin. Interestingly, incorporation of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 into the recombinant AOaV-1 particles attributed the sensitivity to anti-SARS-CoV-2 antiserum and more prominently to anti-AOaV-1 antiserum. Finally, our results demonstrated that the recombinant vaccine vector stably expressed S protein after multiple propagation in chicken embryonated eggs, and this expression did not significantly impact the in vitro growth characteristics of the recombinant. Taken together, the presented respiratory vaccine candidate is highly attenuated in primates per se, safe and lacking pre-existing immunity in human, and carries the potential for accelerated vaccine development against CoVID-19 for clinical studies.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammed A Rohaim","author_inst":"Lancaster University"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Munir","author_inst":"Lancaster University"},{"author_name":"Eleonora Fornasari","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Forest Ray","author_inst":"Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York City, 10032, United States"},{"author_name":"Federico M Giorgi","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"David Belnap","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Michael Vershinin","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Saveez Saffarian","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Jaclyn A Biegel","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles; University of California, Keck School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alexander R Judkins","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles; University of California, Keck School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey M Bender","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles; University of California, Keck School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xiaowu Gai","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles; University of California, Keck School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Dien Bard","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles; University of California, Keck School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Marc Kanter","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Lincoln"},{"author_name":"Stuart Kessler","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Elmhurst"},{"author_name":"Ross B Kristal","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Joseph J Lieber","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Elmhurst"},{"author_name":"Vikramjit Mukherjee","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Bellevue"},{"author_name":"Vincent Rizzo Jr.","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Queens"},{"author_name":"Madden Rowell","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"David Stevens","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Kings County"},{"author_name":"Elana Sydney","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Jacobi"},{"author_name":"Andrew Wallach","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Dave A Chokshi","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Nichola Davis","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"- New York City Health + Hospitals Covid-19 Population Health Data Team","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.31.126342","rel_title":"Improved and Simplified Diagnosis of Covid-19 using TE Extraction from Dry Swabs","rel_date":"2020-06-01","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.31.126342","rel_abs":"Rigorous testing is the way forward to fight the Covid-19 pandemic.

The spike in research publications following the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak, however, has been like no other. The global crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic has mobilised scientific efforts in an unprecedented way. In less than five months, more than 12,000 research items have been indexed while the number increasing every day. With the crisis affecting all aspects of life, research on Covid-19 seems to have become a focal point of interest across many academic disciplines. Here, scientometric aspects of the Covid-19 literature are analysed and contrasted with those of the two previous major Coronavirus diseases, i.e. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). The focus is on the co-occurrence of key-terms, bibliographic coupling and citation relations of journals and collaborations between countries. Certain recurring patterns across all three literatures were discovered. All three outbreaks have commonly generated three distinct and major cohort of studies: (i) studies linked to the public health response and epidemic control, (ii) studies associated with the chemical constitution of the virus and (iii) studies related to treatment, vaccine and clinical care. While studies affiliated with the category (i) seem to have been the first to emerge, they overall received least numbers of citations compared to those of the two other categories. Covid-19 studies seem to have been distributed across a broader variety of journals and subject areas. Clear links are observed between the geographical origins of each outbreak or the local geographical severity of each outbreak and the magnitude of research originated from regions. Covid-19 studies also display the involvement of authors from a broader variety of countries compared to SARS and MRS.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Milad Haghani","author_inst":"The University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Michiel C.

SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to elevated markers of cardiac injury associated with higher risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients. It is unclear whether cardiac injury may have been caused by direct infection of cardiomyocytes or is mainly secondary to lung injury and inflammation. Here we investigate whether human cardiomyocytes are permissive for SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nMethodsInfection was induced by two strains of SARS-CoV-2 (FFM1 and FFM2) in human induced pluripotent stem cells-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CM) and in two models of human cardiac tissue.\n\nResultsWe show that SARS-CoV-2 infects hiPS-CM as demonstrated by detection of intracellular double strand viral RNA and viral spike glycoprotein protein expression. Increasing concentrations of virus RNA are detected in supernatants of infected cardiomyocytes, which induced infections in CaCo-2 cell lines documenting productive infections. SARS-COV-2 infection induced cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic effects and abolished cardiomyocyte beating. RNA sequencing confirmed a transcriptional response to viral infection as demonstrated by the up-regulation of genes associated with pathways related to viral response and interferon signaling, apoptosis and reactive oxygen stress. SARS-CoV-2 infection and cardiotoxicity was confirmed in a iPS-derived human 3D cardiosphere tissue models. Importantly, viral spike protein and viral particles were detected in living human heart slices after infection with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nConclusionsThe demonstration that cardiomyocytes are permissive for SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro warrants the further in depth monitoring of cardiotoxic effects in COVID-19 patients.\n\nClinical PerspectiveO_ST_ABSWhat is New?C_ST_ABSO_LIThis study demonstrates that human cardiac myocytes are permissive for SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nC_LIO_LIThe study documents that SARS-CoV-2 undergoes a full replicatory circle and induces a cytotoxic response in cardiomyocytes.\nC_LIO_LIInfection was confirmed in two cardiac tissue models, including living human heart slices.\nC_LI\n\nWhat are the Clinical Implications?O_LIThe study may provide a rational to explain part of the cardiotoxicity observed in COVID-19 patients\nC_LIO_LIThe demonstration of direct cardiotoxicity induced by SARS-CoV-2 warrants an in depth further analysis of cardiac tissue of COVID-19 patients and a close monitoring for putative direct cardiomyocyte injury.\nC_LIO_LIThe established models can be used to test novel therapeutic approaches targeting COVID-19.\nC_LI","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Denisa Bojkova","author_inst":"University Frankfurt"},{"author_name":"Julian Wagner","author_inst":"University Frankfurt"},{"author_name":"Mariana Shumliakivska","author_inst":"University Frankfurt"},{"author_name":"Galip Aslan","author_inst":"University Frankfurt"},{"author_name":"Umber Saleem","author_inst":"UKE Hamburg"},{"author_name":"Arne Hansen","author_inst":"UKE Hamburg"},{"author_name":"Guillermo Luxan","author_inst":"Goethe University Frankfurt"},{"author_name":"Stefan Guenther","author_inst":"MPI Heart and Lung Research"},{"author_name":"Minh Duc Pham","author_inst":"University Frankfurt"},{"author_name":"Jaya Krishnan","author_inst":"University Frankfurt"},{"author_name":"Patrick Harter","author_inst":"University Frankfurt"},{"author_name":"Utz Ermel","author_inst":"University Frankfurt"},{"author_name":"Achilleas S Frangakis","author_inst":"Goethe University Frankfurt"},{"author_name":"Andreas Zeiher","author_inst":"University Frankfurt"},{"author_name":"Hendrik Milting","author_inst":"Clinic for Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Bad Oyenhausen"},{"author_name":"Jindrich Cinatl Jr.","author_inst":"Klinikum der Goethe-Universitaet"},{"author_name":"Andreas Dendorfer","author_inst":"Walter-Brendel-Centre, Hospital of the Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich"},{"author_name":"Thomas Eschenhagen","author_inst":"UKE Hamburg"},{"author_name":"Sandra Ciesek","author_inst":"Goethe Universtiy Frankfurt"},{"author_name":"Stefanie Dimmeler","author_inst":"Goethe University Frankfurt"},{"author_name":"David Stevens","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Kings County"},{"author_name":"Elana Sydney","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals\/Jacobi"},{"author_name":"Andrew Wallach","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Dave A Chokshi","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Nichola Davis","author_inst":"New York City Health + Hospitals"},{"author_name":"- New York City Health + Hospitals Covid-19 Population Health Data Team","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"cell biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.29.123810","rel_title":"Dose-dependent response to infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the ferret model: evidence of protection to re-challenge","rel_date":"2020-06-01","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.29.123810","rel_abs":"In December 2019 an outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China. The causative agent was subsequently identified and named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which rapidly spread worldwide causing a pandemic. Currently there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics available against SARS-CoV-2 but numerous candidate vaccines are in development and repurposed drugs are being tested in the clinic. There is a vital need for authentic COVID-19 animal models to further our understanding of pathogenesis and viral spread in addition to pre-clinical evaluation of candidate interventions.\n\nHere we report a dose titration study of SARS-CoV-2 to determine the most suitable infectious dose to use in the ferret model. We show that a high (5x106 pfu) and medium (5x104 pfu) dose of SARS-CoV-2 induces consistent upper respiratory tract (URT) viral RNA shedding in both groups of six challenged animals, whilst a low dose (5x102 pfu) resulted in only one of six displaying signs of URT viral RNA replication. The URT shedding lasted up to 21 days in the high dose animals with intermittent positive signal from day 14. Sequential culls revealed distinct pathological signs of mild multifocal bronchopneumonia in approximately 5-15% of the lung, observed on day 3 in high and medium dosed animals, with presence of mild broncho-interstitial pneumonia on day 7 onwards. No obvious elevated temperature or signs of coughing or dyspnoea were observed although animals did present with a consistent post-viral fatigue lasting from day 9-14 in the medium and high dose groups. After virus shedding ceased, re-challenged ferrets were shown to be fully protected from acute lung pathology. The endpoints of URT viral RNA replication in addition to distinct lung pathology and post viral fatigue were observed most consistently in the high dose group. This ferret model of SARS-CoV-2 infection presents a mild clinical disease (as displayed by 80% of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2). In addition, intermittent viral shedding on days 14-21 parallel observations reported in a minority of clinical cases.","rel_num_authors":49,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kathryn A

world health and its economy. Its main protease (Mpro), which functions as a dimer, cleaves viral precursor proteins in the process of viral maturation. It is a good candidate for drug development owing to its conservation and the absence of a human homolog. An improved understanding of the protein behaviour can accelerate the discovery of effective therapies in order to reduce mortality. 100 ns all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of 50 homology modelled mutant Mpro dimers were performed at pH 7 from filtered sequences obtained from the GISAID database. Protease dynamics were analysed using RMSD, RMSF, Rg, the averaged betweenness centrality and geometry calculations. Domains from each Mpro protomer were found to generally have independent motions, while the dimer-stabilising N-finger region was found to be flexible in most mutants. A mirrored interprotomer pocket was found to be correlated to the catalytic site using compaction dynamics, and can be a potential allosteric target. The high number of titratable amino acids of Mpro may indicate an important role of pH on enzyme dynamics, as previously reported for SARS-CoV. Independent coarse-grained Monte Carlo simulations suggest a link between rigidity\/mutability and enzymatic function.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Olivier Sheik

The objective of this study to assess the prevention knowledge and practices towards the COVID-19 among the residents of Ethiopia.Methods An online cross-sectional study was conducted among the sample of Ethiopian residents via social platforms of the author\u2019s network with the popular media such as Facebook, in Ethiopia from the April 15-22, 2020 and successfully recruited 341 responses. The snowball sampling was employed to recruit the participants. The data were analyzed using STATA version 14. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the level of knowledge and practices.Results The majority of the respondents (80.35%) were male. The overall prevention knowledge of the participants towards the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was high. About 91.2% of the participant was heard about the novel coronavirus disease and Social Medias\u2019 were the main source of the information. About 90% of the participants had a good prevention knowledge of maintaining social distance and frequent hand washing. The practices of the participants towards the COVID-19 prevention were very low. Out of 341 participants, only 61% and 84% of the participants were practicing social distance and frequent hand washing, respectively.Conclusions Majority of the participants had knew the ways of protecting themselves from the novel coronavirus. But, there was deficiencies of changing these prevention knowledge to practice. This indicates that there was gap between knowledge and implementation of prevention strategies in the community. The concerned body should focus on providing education for the community regarding the implementation of the prevention knowledge to practice.AbbreviationsFFNCFamily, friends, neighbor, and

COVID-19. The evolutionary trend of the virus genome may have implications for infection control policy but remains obscure. We introduce an estimation of fold change of translational efficiency based on synonymous variant sites to characterize the adaptation of the virus to hosts. The increased translational efficiency of the M and N genes suggests that the population of SARS-CoV-2 benefits from mutations toward favored codons, while the ORF1ab gene has slightly decreased the translational efficiency. In the coding region of the ORF1ab gene upstream of the -1 frameshift site, the decreasing of the translational efficiency has been weakening parallel to the growth of the epidemic, indicating inhibition of synthesis of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and promotion of replication of the genome. Such an evolutionary trend suggests that multiple infections increased virulence in the absence of social distancing.","rel_num_authors":0,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel

users to acquire glycoproteomics data. Complex glycans, however, add a dimension of complexity to the data analysis workflow. In a sense, complex glycans are post-translationally modified post-translational modifications, reflecting a series of biosynthetic reactions in the secretory pathway that are spatially and temporally regulated. One problem is that complex glycan is micro-heterogeneous, multiplying the complexity of the proteome. Another is that glycopeptide glycans undergo dissociation during tandem MS that must be considered for tandem MS interpretation algorithms and quantitative tools. Fortunately, there are a number of algorithmic tools available for analysis of glycoproteomics LC-MS data. We summarize the principles for glycopeptide data analysis and show use of our GlycReSoft tool to analyze SARS-CoV-2 spike protein site-specific glycosylation.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joshua A.

including progenitors of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. However, the evolution and diversification of these coronaviruses remains poorly understood. We used a Bayesian statistical framework and sequence data from all known bat-CoVs (including 630 novel CoV sequences) to study their macroevolution, cross-species transmission, and dispersal in China. We find that host-switching was more frequent and across more distantly related host taxa in alpha-than beta-CoVs, and more highly constrained by phylogenetic distance for beta-CoVs. We show that inter-family and -genus switching is most common in Rhinolophidae and the genus Rhinolophus. Our analyses identify the host taxa and geographic regions that define hotspots of CoV evolutionary diversity in China that could help target bat-CoV discovery for proactive zoonotic disease surveillance. Finally, we present a phylogenetic analysis suggesting a likely origin for SARS-CoV-2 in Rhinolophus spp. bats.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alice
