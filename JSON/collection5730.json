We aimed to understand the potential impact of health and demographic factors on the infection and mortality rates of COVID-19 at the population level. Methods We collected total number of confirmed cases and deaths related to COVID-19 at the county level in the US from January 21, 2020 to April 23, 2020. We extracted health and demographic measures for each US county. Multivariable linear mixed effects models were used to investigate potential correlations of health and demographic characteristics with the infection and mortality rates of COVID-19 in US counties. Results Our models showed that several health and demographic factors were positively correlated with the infection rate of COVID-19, such as low education level and percentage of Black. In contrast, several factors, including percentage of smokers and percentage of food insecure, were negatively correlated with the infection rate of COVID-19. While the number of days since first confirmed case and the infection rate of COVID-19 were negatively correlated with the mortality rate of COVID-19, percentage of elders (65 and above) and percentage of rural were positively correlated with the mortality rate of COVID-19. Conclusions At the population level, health and demographic factors could impact the infection and mortality rates of COVID-19 in US counties.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zidian Xie","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Dongmei Li","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.06.20093021","rel_title":"Selection of homemade mask materials for preventing transmission of COVID-19: a laboratory study","rel_date":"2020-05-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.06.20093021","rel_abs":"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has swept the whole world with high mortality. Since droplet transmission is the main route of transmission, wearing a mask serves as a crucial preventive measure. However, the virus has spread quite quickly, causing severe mask shortage. Finding alternative materials for homemade masks while ensuring the significant performance indicators will help alleviate the shortage of masks. Referring to the national standard for the \"Surgical Mask\" of China, 17 materials to be selected for homemade masks were tested in four key indicators: pressure difference, particle filtration efficiency, bacterial filtration efficiency and resistance to surface wetting. Eleven single-layer materials met the standard of pressure difference ([&le;]49 Pa), of which 3 met the standard of resistance to surface wetting ([&ge;]3), 1 met the standard of particle filtration efficiency ([&ge;]30%), but none met the standard of bacterial filtration efficiency ([&ge;]95%). Based on the testing results of single-layer materials, fifteen combinations of paired materials were tested. The results showed that three double-layer materials including double-layer medical non-woven fabric, medical non-woven fabric plus non-woven shopping bag, and medical non-woven fabric plus granular tea towel could meet all the standards of pressure difference, particle filtration efficiency, and resistance to surface wetting, and were close to the standard of the bacterial filtration efficiency. In conclusion, if resources are severely lacking and medical masks cannot be obtained, homemade masks using available materials, based on the results of this study, can minimize the chance of infection to the maximum extent.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dijia Wang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"},{"author_name":"Yanjun You","author_inst":"Sichuan Testing Center of Medical Devices,Chengdu, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoli Zhou","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"},{"author_name":"Zhiyong Zong","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"},{"author_name":"Hao Huang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"},{"author_name":"Hui Zhang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"},{"author_name":"Xin Yong","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu ,China"},{"author_name":"Yifan Cheng","author_inst":"Chinese Evidence-Based Medicine Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu ,China"},{"author_name":"Liu Yang","author_inst":"Chinese Evidence-Based Medicine Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu ,China"},{"author_name":"Qiong Guo","author_inst":"Chinese Evidence-Based Medicine Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu ,China"},{"author_name":"Youlin Long","author_inst":"Chinese Evidence-Based Medicine Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu ,China"},{"author_name":"Yan Liu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"},{"author_name":"Jin Huang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"},{"author_name":"Liang Du","author_inst":"Center for Medical Device Supervision and Evaluation,Chinese Evidence-Based Medicine Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu , China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20089243","rel_title":"Rapid increase of Care Homes reporting outbreaks a sign of eventual substantial disease burden","rel_date":"2020-05-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20089243","rel_abs":"Enclosed societies (i.e. locations that are connected to wider community only by subgroups of their population and that are dominated by within society transmission) have the potential, upon establishment of a respiratory disease, to suffer a large proportion of the population within becoming infected.

This study evidences the value of our integrative approach in prioritising and repurposing drug targets, which will be particularly applicable when genetic association studies of COVID-19 are available in the near future.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jie Zheng","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Yuemiao Zhang","author_inst":"Renal Division, Peking University First Hospital, Peking University Institute of Nephrology, Key Laboratory of Renal Disease, Ministry of Health of China, Key L"},{"author_name":"Yi Liu","author_inst":"MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit (IEU), Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Oakfield House, Oakfield Grove, Bristol, BS8 2BN, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Denis Baird","author_inst":"MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit (IEU), Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Oakfield House, Oakfield Grove, Bristol, BS8 2BN, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Xingzi Liu","author_inst":"Renal Division, Peking University First Hospital, Peking University Institute of Nephrology, Key Laboratory of Renal Disease, Ministry of Health of China, Key L"},{"author_name":"Lin Wang","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Infectious Disease Centre, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking University Health Science Centre, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Hong Zhang","author_inst":"Renal Division, Peking University First Hospital, Peking University Institute of Nephrology, Key Laboratory of Renal Disease, Ministry of Health of China, Key L"},{"author_name":"George Davey Smith","author_inst":"MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit (IEU), Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Oakfield House, Oakfield Grove, Bristol, BS8 2BN, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Tom Gaunt","author_inst":"MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit (IEU), Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Oakfield House, Oakfield Grove, Bristol, BS8 2BN, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Qiong Guo","author_inst":"Chinese Evidence-Based Medicine Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu ,China"},{"author_name":"Youlin Long","author_inst":"Chinese Evidence-Based Medicine Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu ,China"},{"author_name":"Yan Liu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"},{"author_name":"Jin Huang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"},{"author_name":"Liang Du","author_inst":"Center for Medical Device Supervision and Evaluation,Chinese Evidence-Based Medicine Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu , China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"genetic and genomic medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.06.20092833","rel_title":"Studying the pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019 - a protocol for the Berlin prospective COVID-19 patient cohort (Pa- COVID-19)","rel_date":"2020-05-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.06.20092833","rel_abs":"Purpose Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide causing a global health emergency. Pa-COVID-19 aims to provide comprehensive data on clinical course, pathophysiology, immunology and outcome of COVID-19, in order to identify prognostic biomarkers, clinical scores, and therapeutic targets for improved clinical management and preventive interventions. Methods Pa-COVID-19 is a prospective observational cohort study of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection treated at Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin. We collect data on epidemiology, demography, medical history, symptoms, clinical course, pathogen testing and treatment. Systematic, serial blood sampling will allow deep molecular and immunological phenotyping, transcriptomic profiling, and comprehensive biobanking. Longitudinal data and sample collection during hospitalization will be supplemented by long-term follow-up. Results Outcome measures include the WHO clinical ordinal scale on day 15 and clinical, functional and health-related quality of life assessments at discharge and during follow-up. We developed a scalable dataset to (i) suit national standards of care (ii) facilitate comprehensive data collection in medical care facilities with varying resources and (iii) allow for rapid implementation of interventional trials based on the standardized study design and data collection. We propose this scalable protocol as blueprint for harmonized data collection and deep phenotyping in COVID-19 in Germany. Conclusion We established a basic platform for harmonized, scalable data collection, pathophysiological analysis, and deep phenotyping of COVID-19, which enables rapid generation of evidence for improved medical care and identification of candidate therapeutic and preventive strategies. The electronic database accredited for interventional trials allows fast trial implementation for candidate therapeutic agents.","rel_num_authors":38,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Florian Kurth","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, AND Department of Tropical Medicine, Bernhard Nocht Institute"},{"author_name":"Maria Roennefarth","author_inst":"Clinical Study Center (CSC), Berlin Institute of Health, and Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Thibeault","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Victor M.

Although lungs seem to be the main target of the infection very few information are available about liver involvement in COVID-19 infection, that could possibly evocate a systemic disease targeting a lot of organs. Since now there are no reports of large series of histological evaluation of liver morphology in this setting. Knowledge of histological liver findings connected to clinical data is crucial in management of this disease. Post-mortem wedge liver biopsies from 48 patients died for COVID-19 infection were available from two main hospitals located in northern Italy, Lombardy; all sample were obtained during autopsies. No patient has a significant clinical complain of liver disease or signs of liver failure before and during hospitalization; for each of them laboratory data focused on liver were available. All liver samples showed minimal inflammation features; on the other side, many histological pictures compatible with vascular alterations were observed, characterized by portal vein braches number increase associated with lumen massive dilatation, partial or complete recent luminal thrombosis of portal and sinusoidal vessels, fibrosis of portal tract, focally severely enlarged and fibrotic. Our preliminary results concerning histological liver involvement in COVID-19 infection confirm the clinical impression that liver failure is not a main concern and this organ is not the target of significant inflammatory damage; histopatological findings are highly suggestive for marked alteration of intrahepatic blood vessel network secondary to systemic alterations induced by virus that could target, besides lung parenchyma, cardiovascular system, coagulation cascade or endothelial layer of blood vessels.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"aurelio sonzogni","author_inst":"Ospedale Papa Giovanni XXIII Bergamo"},{"author_name":"Maria Roennefarth","author_inst":"Clinical Study Center (CSC), Berlin Institute of Health, and Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Thibeault","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Victor M.

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study SETTING: The population-based UK Biobank study was linked to English covid-19 test results. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals resident in England and alive in 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cases (n=605) were defined by a positive covid-19 test result conducted between 16th March and 16th April 2020, during a restricted testing policy for hospitalised individuals with severe disease. RESULTS: A total of 406,793 participants were included. Mean age on 1st January 2020 was 68 years (range 48 to 85 years). 55% were women. In multivariable models, major independent risk factors for hospitalisation with covid-19 were male sex (odds ratio 1.52; 95% confidence interval 1.28 to 1.81; P<0.001), South Asian ethnicity (2.02; 1.28 to 3.17; P=0.002) or black ethnicity (3.09; 2.18 to 4.38; P<0.001) compared to white ethnicity, greater residential deprivation (1.92 for most deprived quartile compared to least deprived quartile; 1.50 to 2.47; P<0.001), higher BMI (2.04 for BMI >35 compared to <25 Kg\/m2; 1.50 to 2.77; P<0.001), former smoking (1.39 compared to never smoked; 1.16 to 1.66; P<0.001), and comorbidities hypertension (1.28; 1.06 to 1.53; P=0.009) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1.81; 1.34 to 2.44; P<0.001). Increased risk was observed with increasing number of antihypertensive medications used rather than any individual class. CONCLUSION: Understanding why these factors confer increased risk of severe covid-19 in the population may help elucidate the underlying mechanisms as well as inform strategy and policy to prevent this disease and its consequences. We found no evidence of increased risk with specific classes of antihypertensive medication.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anthony P Khawaja","author_inst":"Moorfields Eye Hospital and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"},{"author_name":"Alasdair N Warwick","author_inst":"Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"},{"author_name":"Pirro G Hysi","author_inst":"Department of Twin Research & Genetic Epidemiology, King's College London, St. Thomas' Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Alan Kastner","author_inst":"NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, London"},{"author_name":"Andrew Dick","author_inst":"NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, London"},{"author_name":"Peng T Khaw","author_inst":"NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, London"},{"author_name":"Adnan Tufail","author_inst":"NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, London"},{"author_name":"Paul J Foster","author_inst":"NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, London"},{"author_name":"Kay-Tee Khaw","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Lucie Kretzler","author_inst":"Clinical Study Center (CSC), Berlin Institute of Health, and Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Chantip Dang-Heine","author_inst":"Clinical Study Center (CSC), Berlin Institute of Health, and Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin,  Germany"},{"author_name":"Matthias Rose","author_inst":"Department of Psychosomatic Medicine, Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Michael Hummel","author_inst":"Central Biobank Charite (ZeBanC), Institute of Pathology, Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Hocke","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ralf H.

This study also will address disparities raised before about variances in mortalities among countries with same BCG protocols. Methods :This study was set to look out for impact of TB prevalence on Covid-19 mortality on the context of countries vaccination status. Countries were divided into five groups according to BCG status. Covid-19 deaths are tested against TB prevalence through using (Non Linear Regression Modules) of predicted shapes behavior for each group. Results :Slopes values have highly significant influences between TB prevalence and Covid-19 deaths for overall studied group, and among countries currently given 1 BGG (2 groups) and ones with previous history of vaccinations, being significant in currently given more than 1 BCG and in countries without vaccination. There are meaningful nonlinear regression shapes which are logarithmic in whole countries and in countries with current just 1 vaccine setting. It is inverse in other 2 groups currently given vaccine. It is power and cubic in countries never given and with previously given vaccines respectively. All groups and whole sample shows either perfect or extremely perfect R-square (Determination Coefficient) values with significant in at least at P-values<0.05.

Two months later, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced SARS-CoV-2 as the name for the new virus and COVID-19 for the associated illness. On March 12, 2020, the WHO officially declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. The scientific community has raced to find effective therapeutic agents against the virus. Gautret et al 2020 is among one of the first purportedly positive trials of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. However, it is imperative that a thorough analysis and understanding of trial data be undertaken prior to making claims about safety and efficacy. Our group assessed the statistical robustness of the trial using the Fragility Index (FI). The FI provides a numerical quantification of a clinical trial's conclusions. The index is based on iterative statistical calculations to determine the minimum number of events within a trial that would theoretically need to change from positive to negative in order for the trial's endpoint to convert from significant to non-significant; the higher the index, the more statistically robust the study results. For the Gautret et al trial, one endpoint had an FI of 1, two had indices of 2, and another had an index of 4. The primary endpoint of viral clearance on day 6 had an FI of 4. This indicates that if 4 events were to change from positive to negative, the conclusion of the trial would become mathematically non-significant. This index is comparable to many other published trials of established agents; the median FI across the reported literature appears to be 2. In conclusion, the trial results reported by Gautret et al are statistically robust, assuming that data quality is not compromised; however, the study was an open-label trial with non-homogenous groups, with analysis conducted per-protocol. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 Reverse Transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) testing was not conducted in a systematic way amongst the two groups. Further analyses of this trial and future trials of antiviral agents with potential activity against SARS-CoV-2 should be performed with complementary epidemiologic and statistical techniques to determine whether the trial's results are clinically important and\/or should be explored in depth. Given the statistically robust results reported by Gautret et al, despite the study's inherent methodological and analytical flaws, hydroxychloroquine should be studied as a potential agent against COVID-19 in larger clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ronald Chow","author_inst":"Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, University of Western Ontario"},{"author_name":"Sameer Elsayed","author_inst":"Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, University of Western Ontario"},{"author_name":"Michael Lock","author_inst":"Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, University of Western Ontario"},{"author_name":"Alan Kastner","author_inst":"NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, London"},{"author_name":"Andrew Dick","author_inst":"NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, London"},{"author_name":"Peng T Khaw","author_inst":"NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, London"},{"author_name":"Adnan Tufail","author_inst":"NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, London"},{"author_name":"Paul J Foster","author_inst":"NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, London"},{"author_name":"Kay-Tee Khaw","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Lucie Kretzler","author_inst":"Clinical Study Center (CSC), Berlin Institute of Health, and Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Chantip Dang-Heine","author_inst":"Clinical Study Center (CSC), Berlin Institute of Health, and Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin,  Germany"},{"author_name":"Matthias Rose","author_inst":"Department of Psychosomatic Medicine, Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Michael Hummel","author_inst":"Central Biobank Charite (ZeBanC), Institute of Pathology, Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Hocke","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ralf H.

Preliminary data suggest a relationship between the BCG vaccine and the prevalence of Covid-19. The BCG vaccine is used in the prevention of tuberculosis, a disease that is most prevalent in developing countries. To determine the potential protective role of BCG vaccination, this study investigated the occurrence of Covid-19 and the relationship between the spread of Covid-19 in countries that offer BCG vaccination and those that do not. The study also performed a phylogenetic analysis of the strains involved in the Covid-19 outbreak from the representative countries. To achieve the objectives, the study utilized publicly available data on population size, vaccination coverage, and Covid-19 cases. Phylogenetic analysis was used to determine if some SARS-CoV-2 strains were more prevalent than others. The study revealed a significant negative trend between countries that offer the BCG vaccine to the general population and the reported cases of Covid-19. The study proposes future molecular and immunological analyses to determine the potential role of BCG vaccination in protection against Covid-19. This will determine if BCG has antiviral properties, with the possibility of recommending it for widespread use if supported by scientific data.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Richard M Mariita","author_inst":"Microbial BioSolutions"},{"author_name":"Jonathan M Musila","author_inst":"Fayetteville State University"},{"author_name":"Michael Lock","author_inst":"Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, University of Western Ontario"},{"author_name":"Alan Kastner","author_inst":"NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, London"},{"author_name":"Andrew Dick","author_inst":"NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, London"},{"author_name":"Peng T Khaw","author_inst":"NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, London"},{"author_name":"Adnan Tufail","author_inst":"NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, London"},{"author_name":"Paul J Foster","author_inst":"NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, London"},{"author_name":"Kay-Tee Khaw","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Lucie Kretzler","author_inst":"Clinical Study Center (CSC), Berlin Institute of Health, and Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Chantip Dang-Heine","author_inst":"Clinical Study Center (CSC), Berlin Institute of Health, and Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin,  Germany"},{"author_name":"Matthias Rose","author_inst":"Department of Psychosomatic Medicine, Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Michael Hummel","author_inst":"Central Biobank Charite (ZeBanC), Institute of Pathology, Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Hocke","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ralf H.

Up to March 11, 2020, 2019-nCov thoroughly broke out in Italy with over 10,000 confirmed cases notwithstanding the gradually block of the country since March 9, 2020. Estimation of possible infection population and prospective suggestion of handling spread based on exist data are of crucial importance. Considering of the biology parameters obtained based on Chinese clinical data in Wuhan, other scholars' work and real spread feature of 2019-nCov in Italy, we built a more applicable model called SEIJR with log-normal distributed time delay to forecast the trend of spreading. Adopting Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), we estimated the early period average spreading velocity (0) and conducted inversion analysis of time point (T0) when the virus first hit the Italy. Based on fixed 0 and T0, we then obtained the average spreading velocity 1 after the lock by PSO. For the aim of offering expeditious advice, we generated the prediction trends with different  which we considered would be helpful in addressing the infection. Not only solved the complex, nondifferentiable equation of epidemic model, our research also performs well in inversion analysis based on PSO which conveys informative outcomes for further discussion on precatious action. To conclude, the first day of spread is around February 1, 2020 with the early period average spreading velocity 0=0.330 which is higher than most cities in China except Wuhan. After locking the country and attaching great attention to public precaution, the 1 sharply descended to 0.278, indicting the effectiveness of these measures.

Although 61,888 confirmed cases had been reported in Brazil by 28 April 2020, little was known about the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in the country. To better understand the recent epidemic in the second most populous state in southeast Brazil (Minas Gerais, MG), we looked at existing epidemiological data from 3 states and sequenced 40 complete genomes from MG cases using Nanopore. We found evidence of multiple independent introductions from outside MG, both from genome analyses and the overly dispersed distribution of reported cases and deaths. Epidemiological estimates of the reproductive number using different data sources and theoretical assumptions all suggest a reduction in transmission potential since the first reported case, but potential for sustained transmission in the near future. The estimated date of introduction in Brazil was consistent with epidemiological data from the first case of a returning-traveler from Lombardia, Italy. These findings highlight the unique reality of MGs epidemic and reinforce the need for real-time and continued genomic surveillance strategies as a way of understanding and therefore preparing against the epidemic spread of emerging viral pathogens.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joilson Xavier","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Genetica Celular e Molecular, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Marta Giovanetti","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Flavivirus, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil;"},{"author_name":"Talita Adelino","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Vagner Fonseca","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Genetica Celular e Molecular, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Alana Vitor Barbosa da Costa","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Adriana Aparecida Ribeiro","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Katlin Nascimento Felicio","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Clara Guerra Duarte","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Marcos Vinicius Ferreira Silva","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Salgado","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Genetica Celular e Molecular, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Mauricio Teixeira Lima","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Ronaldo de Jesus","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Genetica Celular e Molecular, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Allison Fabri","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Flavivirus, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Cristiane Franco Soares Zoboli","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Thales Gutemberg Souza Santos","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Felipe Iani","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Ana Maria Bispo de Filippis","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Flavivirus, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Marilda Agudo Mendonca Teixeira de Siqueira","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Virus Respiratorios e Sarampo, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz Fiocruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Andre Luiz de Abreu","author_inst":"Coordenacao Geral dos Laboratorios de Saude Publica\/Secretaria de Vigilancia em Saude, Ministerio da Saude, (CGLAB\/SVS-MS) Brasilia, Distrito Federal, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Vasco de Azevedo","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Genetica Celular e Molecular, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Dario Brock Ramalho","author_inst":"Secretaria de Estado de Saude de Minas Gerais; Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Carlos F.

This paper presents a prospective service evaluation during establishment of urgent dental care in the North-East of England over a six-week period. Aim: To monitor patient volumes, demographics and outcomes at the North-East urgent dental care service and confirm appropriate care pathways. Main Outcome Methods: Data were collected on key characteristics of patients accessing urgent care from 23rd March to 3rd May 2020. Analysis was with descriptive statistics. Results: There were 1746 patient triages, (1595 telephone and 151 face-to-face) resulting in 1322 clinical consultations. The most common diagnoses were: symptomatic irreversible pulpitis or apical periodontitis. 65% of clinical consultations resulted in extractions, 0.5% an aerosol generating procedure. Patients travelled 25km on average to access care, however this reduced as more urgent care centres were established. The majority of patients were asymptomatic of COVID-19 and to our knowledge no staff acquired infection due to occupational exposure. Conclusion: The urgent dental care centre effectively managed urgent and emergency dental care, with appropriate patient pathways established over the 6-week period. Dental preparedness for future pandemic crisis could be improved and informed by this data.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emily Carter","author_inst":"Newcastle Dental Hospital"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Currie","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Abisola Asuni","author_inst":"Newcastle Dental Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rachel Goldsmith","author_inst":"Newcastle Dental Hospital"},{"author_name":"Grace Toon","author_inst":"Newcastle Dental Hospital"},{"author_name":"Catherine Horridge","author_inst":"Newcastle Dental Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sarah Simpson","author_inst":"Newcastle Dental Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christopher Donnell","author_inst":"Newcastle Dental Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mark Greenwood","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Graham Walton","author_inst":"Newcastle Dental Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ben Cole","author_inst":"Newcastle Dental Hospital"},{"author_name":"Justin Durham","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Richard Holliday","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Cristiane Franco Soares Zoboli","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Thales Gutemberg Souza Santos","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Felipe Iani","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Ana Maria Bispo de Filippis","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Flavivirus, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Marilda Agudo Mendonca Teixeira de Siqueira","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Virus Respiratorios e Sarampo, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz Fiocruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Andre Luiz de Abreu","author_inst":"Coordenacao Geral dos Laboratorios de Saude Publica\/Secretaria de Vigilancia em Saude, Ministerio da Saude, (CGLAB\/SVS-MS) Brasilia, Distrito Federal, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Vasco de Azevedo","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Genetica Celular e Molecular, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Dario Brock Ramalho","author_inst":"Secretaria de Estado de Saude de Minas Gerais; Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Carlos F.

PPE-preparedness was defined as the adherence to guidelines, training HCWs, procuring PPE stocks and responding appropriately to a suspected case (transportation and admission to hospital). Design: Cross-sectional web-based survey. Setting: ICUs in Australia, New Zealand (NZ), Singapore, Hong Kong (HK), India and Philippines with a 24\/7 Emergency\/Casualty Department, and capable of mechanically ventilating patients for more than 24 hours. Interventions: Questionnaire sent to intensivists in 633 Level II\/III ICUs in 6 Asia-Pacific countries by email, WhatsApp and text messaging. Main outcome measures: 263 intensivists responded, of whom 231 were eligible for analysis. Response rates were 68%-100% in all countries except India, where it was 24%. 97% either conformed to or exceeded WHO recommendations for PPE-practice. 59% employed airborne precautions irrespective of aerosol-generation-procedures. There were variations in negative-pressure room use (highest in HK\/Singapore), training (best in NZ), and PPE stock-awareness (best in HK\/Singapore\/NZ). High-flow-nasal-oxygenation and non-invasive ventilation were not options in most HK (66.7%, 83.3% respectively) and Singapore ICUs (50%, 80% respectively), but were considered in other countries to a greater extent. 38% reported not having specialized airway teams. Showering and buddy-systems were underutilized. Clinical waste disposal training was suboptimal (38%). Conclusions: Most intensivists from six Asia-Pacific countries appeared to be aware of the WHO PPE-guidelines by either conforming to\/exceeding the recommendations. Despite this, there were widespread variabilities across ICUs and countries in several domains, particularly related to PPE-training and preparedness. Standardising PPE guidelines may translate to better training, better compliance and policies that improve HCW safety. Adopting low-cost approaches such as buddy-systems should be encouraged. More importantly, better pandemic preparedness and building systems with deeply embedded culture of safety is essential to ensure the safety and well-being of HCWs during such pandemics.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arvind Rajamani","author_inst":"Nepean Clinical School University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Ashwin SUBRAMANIAM","author_inst":"Frankston Hospital and Monash University, VIC"},{"author_name":"Kiran Shekar","author_inst":"The Prince Charles Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jumana Haji","author_inst":"ECMO program director, Consultant anesthesia and critical care 8.\tAster CMI hospital Bangalore"},{"author_name":"Jinghang Luo","author_inst":"Basic Physician Trainee 9.\tWestern Health, VIC"},{"author_name":"Shailesh BIHARI","author_inst":"Flinders university and Flinders Medical center, Bedford Park SA 5042"},{"author_name":"Wai Tat Wong","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Navya GULLAPALLI","author_inst":"Final Year Medical Student Monash University, Clayton VIC"},{"author_name":"Markus RENNER","author_inst":"Senior clinical lecturer Otago University, NZ."},{"author_name":"Claudia Maria ALCANCIA","author_inst":"Makati Medical Center, Philippines"},{"author_name":"Kollengode RAMANATHAN","author_inst":"National University Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Justin Durham","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Richard Holliday","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Cristiane Franco Soares Zoboli","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Thales Gutemberg Souza Santos","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Felipe Iani","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Ana Maria Bispo de Filippis","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Flavivirus, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Marilda Agudo Mendonca Teixeira de Siqueira","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Virus Respiratorios e Sarampo, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz Fiocruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Andre Luiz de Abreu","author_inst":"Coordenacao Geral dos Laboratorios de Saude Publica\/Secretaria de Vigilancia em Saude, Ministerio da Saude, (CGLAB\/SVS-MS) Brasilia, Distrito Federal, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Vasco de Azevedo","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Genetica Celular e Molecular, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Dario Brock Ramalho","author_inst":"Secretaria de Estado de Saude de Minas Gerais; Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Carlos F.

Though current evidence on the epidemiology of the disease is emerging, very little is known about the predictors of recovery. We describe the epidemiology of confirmed CoVID-19 patients in Republic of Korea and identify predictors of recovery. Materials and methods: Using publicly available data for confirmed CoVID-19 cases from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from January 20, 2020 to April 30, 2020, we undertook descriptive analyses of cases stratified by sex, age group, place of exposure, date of confirmation and province. Correlation was tested among all predictors (sex, age group, place of exposure and province) with the Pearsons correlation coefficient. Associations between recovery from CoVID-19 and predictors were estimated using a multivariable logistic regression model. Results: Majority of the confirmed cases were females (56 percent), from 20-29 age group (24.3 percent), and primarily from three provinces Gyeongsangbuk (36.9 percent), Gyeonggi (20.5 percent) and Seoul (17.1 percent). Case fatality ratio was 2.1 percent and 41.6 percent cases recovered. Older patients, patients from certain provinces such as Daegu, Gyeonggi, Gyeongsangbuk, Jeju, Jeollabuk and Jeollanam, and those contracting the disease from healthcare settings had lower recovery. Conclusions: Our study adds to the very limited evidence base on potential predictors of recovery among confirmed CoVID-19 cases. We call additional research to explore the predictors of recovery and support development of policies to protect the vulnerable patient groups.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ashis Das","author_inst":"The World Bank"},{"author_name":"Saji Saraswathy Gopalan","author_inst":"World Bank"},{"author_name":"Kiran Shekar","author_inst":"The Prince Charles Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jumana Haji","author_inst":"ECMO program director, Consultant anesthesia and critical care 8.\tAster CMI hospital Bangalore"},{"author_name":"Jinghang Luo","author_inst":"Basic Physician Trainee 9.\tWestern Health, VIC"},{"author_name":"Shailesh BIHARI","author_inst":"Flinders university and Flinders Medical center, Bedford Park SA 5042"},{"author_name":"Wai Tat Wong","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Navya GULLAPALLI","author_inst":"Final Year Medical Student Monash University, Clayton VIC"},{"author_name":"Markus RENNER","author_inst":"Senior clinical lecturer Otago University, NZ."},{"author_name":"Claudia Maria ALCANCIA","author_inst":"Makati Medical Center, Philippines"},{"author_name":"Kollengode RAMANATHAN","author_inst":"National University Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Justin Durham","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Richard Holliday","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Cristiane Franco Soares Zoboli","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Thales Gutemberg Souza Santos","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Felipe Iani","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Ana Maria Bispo de Filippis","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Flavivirus, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Marilda Agudo Mendonca Teixeira de Siqueira","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Virus Respiratorios e Sarampo, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz Fiocruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Andre Luiz de Abreu","author_inst":"Coordenacao Geral dos Laboratorios de Saude Publica\/Secretaria de Vigilancia em Saude, Ministerio da Saude, (CGLAB\/SVS-MS) Brasilia, Distrito Federal, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Vasco de Azevedo","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Genetica Celular e Molecular, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Dario Brock Ramalho","author_inst":"Secretaria de Estado de Saude de Minas Gerais; Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Carlos F.

A number of studies and reviews have been performed regarding the use of medical grade masks like surgical masks, N95 respirators etc. However, the use of cloth masks has received little attention. Objectives: The purpose of this review is to analyze the available data regarding the use of cloth masks for the prevention of respiratory infections. We intended to use data from both clinical and non-clinical studies to arrive at our conclusion. Methods: We used PubMed, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar as our source databases. Both clinical and non-clinical studies, which had data regarding the efficacy of cloth masks, were selected. Articles not containing analyzable data including opinion articles, review articles etc. were excluded. After screening the search results, ten studies could be included in our review. Data relevant to our objective was extracted from each study including clinical efficacy, compliance, filtration efficacy etc. Data from some studies were simplified for the purpose of comparison. Extracted data was summarized and categorized for detailed analysis. Qualitative synthesis of the data was performed. But the heterogeneity between the studies did not allow for a meta-analysis. Discussion: The review was limited by a lack of sufficient clinical studies. Lack of standardization between studies was another limitation. Although cloth masks generally perform poorer than the medical grade masks, they may be better than no masks at all. Filtration efficacy varied greatly depending on the material used, with some materials showing a filtration efficacy above 90%. However, leakage could reduce efficacy of masks by about 50%. Standardization of cloth masks and appropriate use is essential for cloth masks to be effective. However, result of a randomized controlled trial suggest that they may be ineffective in the healthcare setting.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Agnibho Mondal","author_inst":"School of Tropical Medicine, Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Arnavjyoti Das","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University"},{"author_name":"Rama Prosad Goswami","author_inst":"School of Tropical Medicine, Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Jumana Haji","author_inst":"ECMO program director, Consultant anesthesia and critical care 8.\tAster CMI hospital Bangalore"},{"author_name":"Jinghang Luo","author_inst":"Basic Physician Trainee 9.\tWestern Health, VIC"},{"author_name":"Shailesh BIHARI","author_inst":"Flinders university and Flinders Medical center, Bedford Park SA 5042"},{"author_name":"Wai Tat Wong","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Navya GULLAPALLI","author_inst":"Final Year Medical Student Monash University, Clayton VIC"},{"author_name":"Markus RENNER","author_inst":"Senior clinical lecturer Otago University, NZ."},{"author_name":"Claudia Maria ALCANCIA","author_inst":"Makati Medical Center, Philippines"},{"author_name":"Kollengode RAMANATHAN","author_inst":"National University Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Justin Durham","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Richard Holliday","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Cristiane Franco Soares Zoboli","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Thales Gutemberg Souza Santos","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Felipe Iani","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Ana Maria Bispo de Filippis","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Flavivirus, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Marilda Agudo Mendonca Teixeira de Siqueira","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Virus Respiratorios e Sarampo, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz Fiocruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Andre Luiz de Abreu","author_inst":"Coordenacao Geral dos Laboratorios de Saude Publica\/Secretaria de Vigilancia em Saude, Ministerio da Saude, (CGLAB\/SVS-MS) Brasilia, Distrito Federal, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Vasco de Azevedo","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Genetica Celular e Molecular, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Dario Brock Ramalho","author_inst":"Secretaria de Estado de Saude de Minas Gerais; Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Carlos F.

One of them is the contribution to transmission from individuals experiencing asymptomatic infections. We aimed to characterise the proportion and infectiousness of asymptomatic infections using data from the outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Methods: We used a transmission model of COVID-19 with asymptomatic and presymptomatic states calibrated to outbreak data from the Diamond Princess, to quantify the contribution of asymptomatic infections to transmission. Data available included the date of symptom onset for symptomatic disease for passengers and crew, the number of symptom agnostic tests done each day, and date of positive test for asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals. Findings: On the Diamond Princess 74% (70-78%) of infections proceeded asymptomatically, i.e. a 1:3.8 case-to-infection ratio. Despite the intense testing 53%, (51-56%) of infections remained undetected, most of them asymptomatic. Asymptomatic individuals were the source for 69% (20-85%) of all infections. While the data did not allow identification of the infectiousness of asymptomatic infections, assuming no or low infectiousness resulted in posterior estimates for the net reproduction number of an individual progressing through presymptomatic and symptomatic stages in excess of 15. Interpretation: Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections may contribute substantially to transmission. This is essential to consider for countries when assessing the potential effectiveness of ongoing control measures to contain COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jon C Emery","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Timothy W Russel","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yang Liu","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Joel Hellewell","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Carl AB Pearson","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"- CMMID 2019-nCoV working group","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Gwen M Knight","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adam J Kucharski","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Funk","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stefan Flasche","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rein M G J Houben","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Richard Holliday","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Cristiane Franco Soares Zoboli","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Thales Gutemberg Souza Santos","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Felipe Iani","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Ana Maria Bispo de Filippis","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Flavivirus, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Marilda Agudo Mendonca Teixeira de Siqueira","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Virus Respiratorios e Sarampo, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz Fiocruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Andre Luiz de Abreu","author_inst":"Coordenacao Geral dos Laboratorios de Saude Publica\/Secretaria de Vigilancia em Saude, Ministerio da Saude, (CGLAB\/SVS-MS) Brasilia, Distrito Federal, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Vasco de Azevedo","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Genetica Celular e Molecular, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Dario Brock Ramalho","author_inst":"Secretaria de Estado de Saude de Minas Gerais; Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Carlos F.

We describe our optimizations of the LAMP reaction and saliva pretreatment protocols that enabled rapid and sensitive detection of < 102 viral genomes per reaction in contrived saliva controls. Moreover, our saliva pretreatment protocol enabled sensitive viral detection by conventional quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) without RNA extraction. We validated the high performance of these assays on clinical samples and demonstrate a promising approach to overcome the current bottlenecks limiting widespread testing.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matthew A Lalli","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"S Joshua Langmade","author_inst":"Washington University in St Louis"},{"author_name":"Xuhua Chen","author_inst":"Washington University in St Louis"},{"author_name":"Catrina C Fronick","author_inst":"Washington University in St Louis"},{"author_name":"Christopher S Sawyer","author_inst":"Washington University in St Louis"},{"author_name":"Lauren C Burcea","author_inst":"Washington University in St Louis"},{"author_name":"Michael N Wilkinson","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Robert S Fulton","author_inst":"Washington University in St Louis"},{"author_name":"Michael Heinz","author_inst":"Washington University in St Louis"},{"author_name":"William J Buchser","author_inst":"Washington University in St Louis"},{"author_name":"Richard D Head","author_inst":"Washington University in St Louis"},{"author_name":"Robi D Mitra","author_inst":"Washington University in St Louis"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Milbrandt","author_inst":"Washington University in St Louis"},{"author_name":"Cristiane Franco Soares Zoboli","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Thales Gutemberg Souza Santos","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Felipe Iani","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Ana Maria Bispo de Filippis","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Flavivirus, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Marilda Agudo Mendonca Teixeira de Siqueira","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Virus Respiratorios e Sarampo, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz Fiocruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Andre Luiz de Abreu","author_inst":"Coordenacao Geral dos Laboratorios de Saude Publica\/Secretaria de Vigilancia em Saude, Ministerio da Saude, (CGLAB\/SVS-MS) Brasilia, Distrito Federal, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Vasco de Azevedo","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Genetica Celular e Molecular, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Dario Brock Ramalho","author_inst":"Secretaria de Estado de Saude de Minas Gerais; Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Carlos F.

Methods: Amidst the disease outbreak, 41 out of 105 COVID-19 patients in a local designated hospital in China were successfully assessed using a constellation of psychometric questionnaires to determine their psychological morbidities and fatigue. Several potential biopsychosocial risk factors (including pre-existing disabilities, CT severity score of pneumonia, social support, coping strategies) were assessed through multivariable logistic regression analyses to clarify their association with mental health in patients. Results: 43.9% of 41 patients presented with impaired general mental health, 12.2% had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, 26.8% had anxiety and\/or depression symptoms, and 53.6% had fatigue. We did not find any association between pneumonia severity and psychological morbidities or fatigue in COVID-19 patients. However, high perceived stigmatization was associated with an increased risk of impaired general mental health and high perceived social support was associated with decreased risk. Besides, negative coping inclination was associated with an increased risk of PTSD symptoms; high perceived social support was associated with a decreased risk of anxiety and\/or depression symptoms. Conclusions: Psychological morbidities and chronic fatigue are common among COVID-19 patients. Negative coping inclination and being stigmatized are primary risk factors while perceived social support is the main protective factor.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rongfeng Qi","author_inst":"Department of Medical Imaging, Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University; Department of Radiology, Jinling Hospital, Southern Medical University."},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"Jinling Hospital, Southern Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China; The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children Hospital of Wenzhou Medical Universit"},{"author_name":"Saiduo Liu","author_inst":"Departments of Infectious Disease, Wenzhou Central Hospital, 32 West Jiangbin Road, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China."},{"author_name":"Paul M Thompson","author_inst":"Imaging Genetics Center, Mark and Mary Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute, University of Southern California"},{"author_name":"Long Jiang Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Medical Imaging, Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University"},{"author_name":"Fei Xia","author_inst":"Department of Medical Imaging, Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University"},{"author_name":"Fang Cheng","author_inst":"Departments of Infectious Disease, Wenzhou Central Hospital, 32 West Jiangbin Road, Wenzhou, Zhejiang"},{"author_name":"Ailing Hong","author_inst":"Departments of Infectious Disease, Wenzhou Central Hospital, 32 West Jiangbin Road, Wenzhou, Zhejiang"},{"author_name":"Wesley Surento","author_inst":"Imaging Genetics Center, Mark and Mary Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute, University of Southern California, Marina del Rey, CA, 90292, USA."},{"author_name":"Song Luo","author_inst":"Department of Medical Imaging, Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"},{"author_name":"Zhi Yuan Sun","author_inst":"Department of Medical Imaging, Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"},{"author_name":"Chang Sheng Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Medical Imaging, Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"},{"author_name":"Lingjiang Li","author_inst":"Mental Health Institute, the Second Xiangya Hospital, National Technology Institute of Psychiatry, Key Laboratory of Psychiatry and Mental Health of Hunan Provi"},{"author_name":"Xiangao Jiang","author_inst":"Departments of Infectious Disease, Wenzhou Central Hospital, 32 West Jiangbin Road, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China."},{"author_name":"Guang Ming Lu","author_inst":"Department of Medical Imaging, Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"},{"author_name":"Felipe Iani","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Ana Maria Bispo de Filippis","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Flavivirus, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Marilda Agudo Mendonca Teixeira de Siqueira","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Virus Respiratorios e Sarampo, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz Fiocruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Andre Luiz de Abreu","author_inst":"Coordenacao Geral dos Laboratorios de Saude Publica\/Secretaria de Vigilancia em Saude, Ministerio da Saude, (CGLAB\/SVS-MS) Brasilia, Distrito Federal, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Vasco de Azevedo","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Genetica Celular e Molecular, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Dario Brock Ramalho","author_inst":"Secretaria de Estado de Saude de Minas Gerais; Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Carlos F.

This article reports the effectiveness of a pulsed xenon ultraviolet (PX-UV) disinfection system in reducing the load of SARS-CoV-2 on hard surfaces and N95 respirators. Chamber slides and N95 respirator material were directly inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 and exposed to different durations of PX-UV disinfection. For hard surfaces, disinfection for 1, 2, and 5 minutes resulted in 3.53 Log10, >4.54 Log10, and >4.12 Log10 reductions in viral load, respectively. For N95 respirators, disinfection for 5 minutes resulted in >4.79 Log10 reduction in viral load. We found that PX-UV significantly reduces SARS-CoV-2 on hard surfaces and N95 respirators. With the potential to rapidly disinfectant environmental surfaces and N95 respirators, PX-UV devices are a promising technology for the reduction of environmental and PPE bioburden and to enhance both HCW and patient safety by reducing the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sarah Simmons","author_inst":"Xenex Disinfection Services, Inc., San Antonio, TX"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Carrion Jr.","author_inst":"Department of Virology and Immunology, Texas Biomedical Research Institute, San Antonio, TX"},{"author_name":"Kendra Alfson","author_inst":"Department of Virology and Immunology, Texas Biomedical Research Institute, San Antonio, TX"},{"author_name":"Hilary Staples","author_inst":"Department of Virology and Immunology, Texas Biomedical Research Institute, San Antonio, TX"},{"author_name":"Chetan Jinadatha","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Central Texas Veterans Healthcare System, Temple, TX, Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, Texas A&M Health Science Center, Brya"},{"author_name":"William Jarvis","author_inst":"Jason and Jarvis Associates, Hilton Head Island, SC"},{"author_name":"Priya Sampathkumar","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN"},{"author_name":"Roy Chemaly","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control and Employee Health, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX"},{"author_name":"Fareed Khawaja","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control and Employee Health, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX"},{"author_name":"Mark Povroznik","author_inst":"Department of Quality, WVU Medicine: United Hospital Center, Bridgeport, WV"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Jackson","author_inst":"Department of Quality, HonorHealth, Scottsdale, AZ"},{"author_name":"Keith Kaye","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Department of Infectious Diseases, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI"},{"author_name":"Robert Rodriguez","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Mark Stibich","author_inst":"Xenex Disinfection Services, Inc., San Antonio, TX"},{"author_name":"Guang Ming Lu","author_inst":"Department of Medical Imaging, Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"},{"author_name":"Felipe Iani","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Ana Maria Bispo de Filippis","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Flavivirus, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Marilda Agudo Mendonca Teixeira de Siqueira","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Virus Respiratorios e Sarampo, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz Fiocruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Andre Luiz de Abreu","author_inst":"Coordenacao Geral dos Laboratorios de Saude Publica\/Secretaria de Vigilancia em Saude, Ministerio da Saude, (CGLAB\/SVS-MS) Brasilia, Distrito Federal, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Vasco de Azevedo","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Genetica Celular e Molecular, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Dario Brock Ramalho","author_inst":"Secretaria de Estado de Saude de Minas Gerais; Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Carlos F.

The most severe measures to date include all restaurants, pubs and cafes being ordered to close on 20th March, followed by a \"stay at home\" order on the 23rd March and the closure of all non-essential retail outlets for an indefinite period. Government agencies are presently analysing how best to develop an exit strategy from these measures and to determine how the epidemic may progress once measures are lifted. Mathematical models are currently providing short and long term forecasts regarding the future course of the COVID-19 outbreak in the UK to support evidence-based policymaking. Methods: We present a deterministic, age-structured transmission model that uses real-time data on confirmed cases requiring hospital care and mortality to provide up-to-date predictions on epidemic spread in ten regions of the UK. We simulated a suite of scenarios to assess the impact of differing approaches to relaxing social distancing measures from 7th May 2020, on the estimated number of patients requiring inpatient and critical care treatment, and deaths. With regard to future epidemic outcomes, we investigated the impact of reducing compliance, ongoing shielding of elder age groups, reapplying stringent social distancing measures using region based triggers and the role of asymptomatic transmission. Findings: We find that significant relaxation of social distancing measures on 7th May can lead to a rapid resurgence of COVID-19 disease and the health system being quickly overwhelmed by a sizeable, second epidemic wave. In all considered age-shielding based strategies, we projected serious demand on critical care resources during the course of the pandemic. The reintroduction and release of strict measures on a regional basis, based on ICU bed occupancy, results in a long epidemic tail, until the second half of 2021, but ensures that the health service is protected by reintroducing social distancing measures for all individuals in a region when required. Conclusions: Our work supports the decision to apply stringent non-pharmaceutical measures in March 2020 to suppress the epidemic. We provide strong evidence to support the need for a cautious, measured approach to relaxation of lockdown measures, to protect the most vulnerable members of society and support the health service through subduing demand on hospital beds, in particular bed occupancy in intensive care units.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matt J Keeling","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Edward Hill","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Erin Gorsich","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Bridget Penman","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Glen Guyver-Fletcher","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Alex Holmes","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Trystan Leng","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Hector McKimm","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Tamborrino","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Louise Dyson","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Michael Tildesley","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Graves","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Mariko Siyue Koh","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sungwon Yoon","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Andrew Fu Wah Ho","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Daniel Shu Wei Ting","author_inst":"Singapore National Eye Centre"},{"author_name":"Jenny Guek Hong Low","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Marcus Eng Hock Ong","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Andre Luiz de Abreu","author_inst":"Coordenacao Geral dos Laboratorios de Saude Publica\/Secretaria de Vigilancia em Saude, Ministerio da Saude, (CGLAB\/SVS-MS) Brasilia, Distrito Federal, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Vasco de Azevedo","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Genetica Celular e Molecular, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Dario Brock Ramalho","author_inst":"Secretaria de Estado de Saude de Minas Gerais; Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Carlos F.

In anticipation of subsequent waves, reliable prediction of disease severity is essential for critical care capacity management and may enable earlier targeted interventions to improve patient outcomes. The purpose of this study is to develop and externally validate a prognostic model\/clinical tool for predicting COVID-19 critical disease at presentation to medical care. Methods: This is a retrospective study of a prognostic model for the prediction of COVID-19 critical disease where critical disease was defined as ICU admission, ventilation, and\/or death. The derivation cohort was used to develop a multivariable logistic regression model. Covariates included patient comorbidities, presenting vital signs, and laboratory values. Model performance was assessed on the validation cohort by concordance statistics. The model was developed with consecutive patients with COVID-19 who presented to University of California Irvine Medical Center in Orange County, California. External validation was performed with a random sample of patients with COVID-19 at Emory Healthcare in Atlanta, Georgia. Results: Of a total 3208 patients tested in the derivation cohort, 9% (299\/3028) were positive for COVID-19. Clinical data including past medical history and presenting laboratory values were available for 29% (87\/299) of patients (median age, 48 years [range, 21-88 years]; 64% [36\/55] male). The most common comorbidities included obesity (37%, 31\/87), hypertension (37%, 32\/87), and diabetes (24%, 24\/87). Critical disease was present in 24% (21\/87). After backward stepwise selection, the following factors were associated with greatest increased risk of critical disease: number of comorbidities, body mass index, respiratory rate, white blood cell count, % lymphocytes, serum creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, high sensitivity troponin I, ferritin, procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein. Of a total of 40 patients in the validation cohort (median age, 60 years [range, 27-88 years]; 55% [22\/40] male), critical disease was present in 65% (26\/40). Model discrimination in the validation cohort was high (concordance statistic: 0.94, 95% confidence interval 0.87-1.01). A web-based tool was developed to enable clinicians to input patient data and view likelihood of critical disease. Conclusions and Relevance: We present a model which accurately predicted COVID-19 critical disease risk using comorbidities and presenting vital signs and laboratory values, on derivation and validation cohorts from two different institutions.

For countries that have implemented restrictions on its population in a step-wise manner, monitoring of COVID-19 prevalence is of importance to guide decision on when to impose new, or when to abolish old, restrictions. We are here determining whether measures of odor intensity in a large sample can serve as one such measure. Online measures of how intense common household odors are perceived and symptoms of COVID-19 were collected from 2440 Swedes. Average odor intensity ratings were then compared to predicted COVID-19 population prevalence over time in the Swedish population and were found to closely track each other (r=-0.83). Moreover, we found that there was a large difference in rated intensity between individuals with and without COVID-19 symptoms and number of symptoms was related to odor intensity ratings. Finally, we found that individuals progressing from reporting no symptoms to subsequently reporting COVID-19 symptoms demonstrated a large drop in olfactory performance. These data suggest that measures of odor intensity, if obtained in a large and representative sample, can be used as an indicator of COVID-19 disease in the general population. Importantly, this simple measure could easily be implemented in countries without widespread access to COVID-19 testing or implemented as a fast early response before wide-spread testing can be facilitated.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Behzad Iravani","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Artin Arshamian","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Ahron Ravia","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Eva Mishor","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Kobi Snitz","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Sagit Shushan","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Edith Wolfson Medical Center, Holon, Israel"},{"author_name":"Yehudah Roth","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Edith Wolfson Medical Center, Holon, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ofer Perl","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Danielle Honigstein","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Reut Weissgross","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Shiri Karagach","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Gernot Ernst","author_inst":"Vestre Viken, Kongsberg hospital and Psychological institute, University in Oslo, Norway"},{"author_name":"Masako Okamoto","author_inst":"Department of Applied Biological Chemistry, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Zachary Mainen","author_inst":"Champalimaud Research, Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown, Lisbon, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Erminio Monteleone","author_inst":"Department of Agriculture, Food, Environment and Forestry, University of Florence, Italy"},{"author_name":"Caterina Dinnella","author_inst":"Department of Agriculture, Food, Environment and Forestry, University of Florence, Italy"},{"author_name":"Sara Spinelli","author_inst":"Department of Agriculture, Food, Environment and Forestry, University of Florence, Italy"},{"author_name":"Franklin Marino-Sanchez","author_inst":"Rhinology and Skull Base Surgery Unit.

Using this proposed index (snr), it was possible to carry out a data-driven comparison among different countries in their efforts of dealing with the crisis. The primary focus of this study was to assess the interventions' effectiveness by the decision makers along with the health system's efficiency of the countries that experienced a relatively high pressure on their systems. In this study, 19 countries were selected based on predefined criteria that included: (1) reported confirmed cases should exceed 5,000, and (2) confirmed cases per 1 million people should exceed 200, at the time this study was concluded. According to the proposed, snr index, the findings showed that Germany and South Korea were ahead of the game, compared to other countries such as the USA, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, and UK. Some other countries, such as Canada, Austria, Switzerland managed to slightly pivot their interventions at a later stage in effective manners according to the snr index. The study explains the foundation, and the underlying calculations of the proposed, snr index. Moreover, the study shows how reliably the snr index measures the interventions' effectiveness and health system's efficiency during the crisis or during any health-related crisis. An additional, yet interesting finding from this study, was that the snr curve showed a persistent four-episode (segment) structure during the pandemic. This finding could suggest a benchmark of the expected pattern of the fight against the virus spread during the pandemic that could offer a significant tool, for the decision makers. Finally, it is worth mentioning that the implementation of this proposed index is only valid and meaningful during a crisis. In a none-crisis time, the required data to calculate the snr index is not available and rather mathematically misleading.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Khaled Wahba","author_inst":"Algoma university"},{"author_name":"Artin Arshamian","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Ahron Ravia","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Eva Mishor","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Kobi Snitz","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Sagit Shushan","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Edith Wolfson Medical Center, Holon, Israel"},{"author_name":"Yehudah Roth","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Edith Wolfson Medical Center, Holon, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ofer Perl","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Danielle Honigstein","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Reut Weissgross","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Shiri Karagach","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Gernot Ernst","author_inst":"Vestre Viken, Kongsberg hospital and Psychological institute, University in Oslo, Norway"},{"author_name":"Masako Okamoto","author_inst":"Department of Applied Biological Chemistry, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Zachary Mainen","author_inst":"Champalimaud Research, Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown, Lisbon, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Erminio Monteleone","author_inst":"Department of Agriculture, Food, Environment and Forestry, University of Florence, Italy"},{"author_name":"Caterina Dinnella","author_inst":"Department of Agriculture, Food, Environment and Forestry, University of Florence, Italy"},{"author_name":"Sara Spinelli","author_inst":"Department of Agriculture, Food, Environment and Forestry, University of Florence, Italy"},{"author_name":"Franklin Marino-Sanchez","author_inst":"Rhinology and Skull Base Surgery Unit.

Relevant data were extracted and analysed by narrative synthesis. Our results included six studies in the review of which four studies were of good or fair quality. All eligible studies included were for coronavirus involving the use of either chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine to treat common symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath and fatigue. Outcomes most commonly reported were improved lung function, viral clearance, and hospital discharge. Strong evidence to support the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 is lacking. Fast track trials are riddled with bias and may not conform to rigorous guidelines which may lead to inadequate data being reported.

And its viewing numbers tend to increase exponentially in extraordinary situations. Our aim in this study was to evaluate the contents of the most frequently viewed YouTube videos during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: In this study, contents of the most frequently viewed Turkish and English videos regarding COVID-19 pandemics are examined and scored with modified DISCERN, MICI and VPI. Results: The mean DISCERN score of Turkish videos is similar to English videos (2.55 and 2.43 respectively). Total MICI score tends to be higher in Turkish videos. 86.9% of all 168 videos and 65.2% of all 23 misleading videos were released by news channels. Average view counts, view ratios, and VPIs of misleading videos are higher than the useful videos. Conclusions: Since there is not a peer-review system on YouTube, it is very important for the content of videos that are released through news channels to be accurate because the important messages can be spread among people in society through them. Especially some Turkish videos included many different rumors and faulty statements. During the extraordinary situations such as the pandemics, the videos of official health authorities and international institutions should be more visible in YouTube.

Methods: From 16th to 24th March 2020, 241 consecutive patients addressed to hospital for COVID-19 suspicion had both chest CT and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. Eight observers (2 thoracic and 2 general senior radiologists, 2 junior radiologists and 2 emergency physicians) retrospectively categorized each CT into one out of 3 categories (evocative, compatible for COVID-19 pneumonia, and not evocative or normal). Observer agreement for categorization between all readers and pairs of readers with similar experience was evaluated with the Kappa coefficient. The results of a consensus categorization were correlated to RT-PCR. Results: Observer agreement across the 3 categories was good between all readers (kappa value 0.68 95%CI 0.67-0.70) and good to very good between pairs of readers (0.64-0.85). It was very good (0.81 95%CI 0.79-0.83), fair (0.32 95%CI 0.29-0.34) and good (0.74 95%CI 0.71-0.76) for the categories evocative, compatible and not evocative or normal, respectively. RT-PCR was positive in 97%, 50% and 27% of cases classified in the respective categories. Observer agreement was lower (p=0.045) and RT-PCR positive cases were less frequently categorized evocative in presence of an underlying pulmonary disease (p<0.001). Conclusion: Inter-observer agreement for chest CT reporting using categorization of findings is good in patients suspected of COVID-19. Among patients considered for hospitalization in an epidemic context, CT categorized evocative is highly predictive of COVID-19, whereas the predictive value of CT decreases between the categories compatible and not evocative.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marie-Pierre Debray","author_inst":"APHP, Hopital Bichat, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Helena Tarabay","author_inst":"APHP, Hopital Bichat, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Lisa Males","author_inst":"APHP, Hopital Bichat, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Nisrine Chalhoub","author_inst":"APHP, Hopital Bichat, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Elyas Mahdjoub","author_inst":"APHP, Hopital Bichat, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Thomas Pavlovsky","author_inst":"APHP, Hopital Bichat, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Benoit Visseaux","author_inst":"APHP, Hopital Bichat, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Donia Bouzid","author_inst":"APHP, Hopital Bichat, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Raphael Borie","author_inst":"APHP, Hopital Bichat, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Catherine Wackenheim","author_inst":"APHP, Hopital Bichat, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Bruno Crestani","author_inst":"APHP, Hopital Bichat, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Christophe Rioux","author_inst":"APHP, Hopital Bichat, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Loukbi Saker","author_inst":"APHP, Hopital Bichat, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Christophe Choquet","author_inst":"APHP, Hopital Bichat, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Jimmy Mullaert","author_inst":"APHP, Hopital Bichat, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Antoine Khalil","author_inst":"APHP, Hopital Bichat, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Sara Spinelli","author_inst":"Department of Agriculture, Food, Environment and Forestry, University of Florence, Italy"},{"author_name":"Franklin Marino-Sanchez","author_inst":"Rhinology and Skull Base Surgery Unit.
