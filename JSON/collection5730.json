Finding appropriate measures that effectively contain the spread of the epidemic without putting a too severe pressure on social and economic life is major challenge for modern predictive approaches. To assess the impact of confinement (March 17th till May 11th) and deconfinement, we develop a novel rate model to monitor and predict the spread of the epidemic and its impact on the health care system. The model accounts for age-dependent interactions between population groups and predicts consequences for various infection categories such as number of infected, hospitalized, load of intensive care units (ICU), number of death, recovered and more. We use online health care data for the five most infected regions of France to calibrate the model. At day of deconfinement (May 11th), we find that 13% (around 4.8M) of the population is infected in the five most affected regions of France (extrapolating to 5.8M for France). The model predicts that if the reproduction rate R0 is reduced by at least a factor of 2.5-3 for all age groups, which could be achieved by wearing masks and social distancing, a significant second peak could be prevented. However, if the reduction in R0 for the age group 0-25 would be less and below 2 (school openings), a second peak is unavoidable in which case the ICU will be saturated. In that context testing should be focused on children, but it will nevertheless have a limited impact on reducing the spread.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Juergen Reingruber","author_inst":"Ecole Normale Superieure"},{"author_name":"Andrea Papale","author_inst":"ENS"},{"author_name":"David holcman","author_inst":"ENS"},{"author_name":"Graham Roberts","author_inst":"University College Cork, HRC-Clinical Research Facility, Republic of Ireland"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.13.20100222","rel_title":"Silent Disease and Loss of Taste and Smell are Common Manifestations of SARS-COV-2 Infection in a Quarantine Facility: First report from Saudi Arabia","rel_date":"2020-05-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.13.20100222","rel_abs":"Abstract BACKGROUND The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Saudi Arabia was first identified in a traveler from Al Qatif city, on March 2nd, 2020. The disease has quickly spread and reached multiple cities within a few weeks. In an attempt to limit the spread of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia, the government has implemented strict regulations. Starting March 15th, all travelers coming back to the kingdom were tested for COVID-19 and were quarantined in a government-designated facility. The same rule was applied to all positive cases identified by contact tracing. In this study, we aimed to assess the prevalence of asymptomatic carriers, epidemiological characteristics, clinical presentations, and viral clearance of SARS-COV-2 positive quarantined individuals in a quarantine facility in the eastern province. METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional study on 128 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 subjects who were quarantined in a government-designated facility. The study period was from March 16th until April 18th, 2020. We collected data on demographics and on clinical symptoms. Also, samples for PCR tests were collected upon admission and were repeated every 72 hours if they were still positive. All negative samples were repeated within 24 hours for confirmation. RESULTS Sixty-nine of the 128 residents (54%) were completely asymptomatic until the end of the study. The remaining 59 residents (46%) had only mild symptoms. The most common symptom was a sudden loss of smell and taste, accounting for 47.5%. The median time to virus clearance was significantly different between the two groups. Symptomatic residents cleared the virus at a median of 17 days (95% CI,12.4-21.6) from the first positive PCR vs. 11days (95% CI, 8.7-13.3) in the asymptomatic group (P=0.011). False-negative test results occurred in 18.8% of the total residents and false-positive results in 3%. CONCLUSION The prevalence of asymptomatic carriers is high in our study. Testing, and isolating travelers and contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases, regardless of symptoms, were very effective measures for early disease identification and containment. Loss of taste and smell was the most common presentation in our mild symptomatic residents, and it might be predictive of mild disease. The persistent positive PCRs observed in the mild asymptomatic residents despite being symptoms free, warrant further studies to determine its implications on disease spread and control.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alanoud A Alshami","author_inst":"King Fahad Specialist Hospital Dammam"},{"author_name":"Rabab A Alattas","author_inst":"King Fahad Specialist Dammam"},{"author_name":"Hadeel F Anan","author_inst":"king Fahad Specialist Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hadi S Al Qahtani","author_inst":"King Fahad Specialist Hospital Dammam"},{"author_name":"Mobarak A Al Mulhim","author_inst":"King Fahad Specialist Hospital Dammam"},{"author_name":"Abdulbari A Alahilmi","author_inst":"King Faisal University in Al Ahsa"},{"author_name":"Ahmed H Alfaraj","author_inst":"King Fahad Specialist Hospital Dammam"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.13.20100255","rel_title":"Manifestations of mortality based global data of COVID-19; unifying global model through single parameter","rel_date":"2020-05-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.13.20100255","rel_abs":"Critical inspection of the world data of COVID-19 mortality rates per population number has been made and used to express extensive variations in mortality over the globe in terms of a powered parameter {lambda} varying from 0 to 1.2 expressed as a measure of strength of primary infection, originating from China source.

Tracing of contacts and consequential tracing and breaking of infection-chains is a promising and comparably straightforward strategy to help containing the disease, although its precise impact on the epidemic is unknown. In order to quantify the benefits of tracing and similar policies we developed an agent-based model that not only validly depicts the spread of the disease, but allows for exploratory analysis of containment policies. We will describe our model and perform case studies in which we use the model to quantify impact of contact tracing in different characteristics and draw valuable conclusions about contact tracing policies in general.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Martin Richard Bicher","author_inst":"TU Wien"},{"author_name":"Claire Rippinger","author_inst":"dwh GmbH"},{"author_name":"Christoph Urach","author_inst":"dwh GmbH"},{"author_name":"Dominik Brunmeir","author_inst":"dwh GmbH"},{"author_name":"Uwe Siebert","author_inst":"UMIT University for Health Sciences, Institute of Public Health, Medical Decision Making and Health Technology Assessment"},{"author_name":"Niki Popper","author_inst":"TU Wien"},{"author_name":"Ahmed H Alfaraj","author_inst":"King Fahad Specialist Hospital Dammam"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.12.20099036","rel_title":"Stepping out of lockdown should start with school re-openings while maintaining distancing measures.

Currently with just under 7000 cases and 100 deaths, Australia is seeing less than 20 new cases per day. This is a positive outcome, but makes estimation of current effective reproduction numbers difficult to estimate. Australia, like much of the world is poised to step out of lockdown and looking at which measures to relax first. We use age-based contact matrices, calibrated to Chinese data on reproduction numbers and difference in infectiousness and susceptibility of children to generate next generation matrices (NGMs) for Australia. These matrices have a spectral radius of 2.49, which is hence our estimated basic reproduction number for Australia. The effective reproduction number (Reff) for Australia during the April\/May lockdown period is estimated by other means to be around 0.8. We simulate the impact of lockdown on the NGM by first applying observations through Google Mobility Report for Australia at 3 locations: home (increased contacts by 18%), work (reduced contacts by 34%) and other (reduced contacts by 40%), and we reduce schools to 3% reflecting attendance rates during lockdown. Applying macro-distancing to the NGM leads to a spectral radius of 1.76. We estimate that the further reduction of the reproduction number to current levels of Reff = 0.8 is achieved by a micro-distancing factor of 0.26. That is, in a given location, people are 26% as likely as usual to have an effective contact with another person. We apply both macro and micro-distancing to the NGMs to examine the impact of different exit strategies. We find that reopening schools is estimated to reduce Reff from 0.8 to 0.78. This is because increase in school contact is offset by decrease in home contact. The NGMs all estimate that adults aged 30-50 are responsible for the majority of transmission. We also find that micro-distancing is critically important to maintain Reff <1. There is considerable uncertainty in these estimates and a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis is presented.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emma Sue McBryde","author_inst":"James Cook University"},{"author_name":"James M Trauer","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Adeshina Adekunle","author_inst":"James Cook University"},{"author_name":"Romain Ragonnet","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Michael T Meehan","author_inst":"James Cook University"},{"author_name":"Niki Popper","author_inst":"TU Wien"},{"author_name":"Ahmed H Alfaraj","author_inst":"King Fahad Specialist Hospital Dammam"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.14.20102012","rel_title":"Mental health in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic: early observations","rel_date":"2020-05-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.14.20102012","rel_abs":"Background: Previous pandemics have resulted in significant consequences for mental health.

Methods: A community cohort study was conducted with adults aged [&ge;]18 years recruited through a mainstream and social media campaign between 3\/4\/20-30\/4\/20. Consenting participants completed an online survey measuring depression, anxiety and stress and explanatory variables hypothesised to be related to these mental health outcomes. Outcomes: N=3097 eligible individuals participated. The cohort was predominantly female (85%); mean age forty-four years; 10% from minority ethnic groups; 50% described themselves as key-workers and 20% identified as having clinical risk factors putting them at increased risk of COVID-19. Mean scores for depression, stress and anxiety significantly exceeded population norms. Analysis of non-modifiable factors indicated that being younger and female were associated with all outcomes, with the final multivariable models accounting for 7-13% of variance. When adding modifiable factors, significant independent effects emerged for positive mood, perceived loneliness and worry about getting COVID-19 for all outcomes, with the final multivariable models accounting for 54-57% of variance. Interpretation: Increased psychological morbidity was evident in this UK cohort, with younger people and women at particular risk. Interventions targeting perceptions of: loneliness, risk of COVID-19, worry about COVID-19, and positive mood may be effective.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ru Jia","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care, University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Kieran Ayling","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care, University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Trudie Chalder","author_inst":"Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London"},{"author_name":"Adam Massey","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care, University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Broadbent","author_inst":"Department of Psychological Medicine, University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Carol Coupland","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care, University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Kavita Vedhara","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care, University of Nottingham"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.14.20101998","rel_title":"Obesity and COVID-19: The role of visceral adipose tissue","rel_date":"2020-05-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.14.20101998","rel_abs":"INTRODUCTION: During the unprecedented health crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic it was suggested that obesity might aggravate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2). Therefore, this study aims to investigate the association between Compute Tomography (CT)-based measurements of visceral and subcutaneous fat as measures of obesity and COVID-19 severity. METHODS: 30 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and a mean age of 65.59 plus\/minus 13.06 years from a level one medical center in Berlin, Germany, were retrospectively analyzed and included in the present analysis. SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction from throat swaps or deep nasal swabs on the day of admission. Severe clinical courses of COVID-19 were defined by hospitalization in intensive care unit (ICU) and invasive mechanical ventilation. All patients received low-dose chest CT-based fat measurements at the level of the first lumbar vertebra. RESULTS: An increase in visceral fat area (VFA) by one square decimeter was associated with a 22.53-fold increased risk for ICU treatment and a 16.11-fold increased risk for mechanical ventilation (adjusted for age and sex). For upper abdominal circumference, each additional centimeter of circumference showed a 1.13-fold increased risk for ICU treatment and a 1.25-fold increased risk for mechanical ventilation. There was no significant correlation of subcutaneous fat area (SFA) or body mass index (BMI) with severe clinical courses of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that visceral adipose tissue and upper abdominal circumference specifically increasing the risk of COVID-19 severity. CT-based quantification of visceral adipose tissue and upper abdominal circumference in routinely acquired chest CTs may therefore be a simple tool for risk assessment in SARS-CoV-2-patients.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Antonia Petersen","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin - Department of Radiology, Hindenburgdamm 30, 12203 Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Keno Bressem","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin - Department of Radiology, Hindenburgdamm 30, 12203 Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jakob Albrecht","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin - Department of Radiology, Hindenburgdamm 30, 12203 Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Hans-Martin Thiess","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin - Department of Radiology, Hindenburgdamm 30, 12203 Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Janis Vahldiek","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin - Department of Radiology, Hindenburgdamm 30, 12203 Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Bernd Hamm","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, ChariteCentrum Diagnostische und interventionelle Radiologie und Nuklearmedizin CC 6"},{"author_name":"Marcus Makowski","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Department of Diagnostic and  Interventional Radiology, 81675 Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Niehues","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin - Department of Radiology, Hindenburgdamm 30, 12203 Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Stefan Niehues","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin - Department of Radiology, Hindenburgdamm 30, 12203 Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Lisa Christine Adams","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Campus Charite Mitte - Department of Radiology, Chariteplatz 1, 10117 Berlin, Germany, Berlin Institute of Health (BIH), "}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"radiology and imaging"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.12.20094219","rel_title":"Factors affecting COVID-19 outcomes in cancer patients \t- A first report from Guys Cancer Centre in London","rel_date":"2020-05-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.12.20094219","rel_abs":"Background: There is insufficient evidence to support clinical decision-making for cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19 due to the lack of large studies.

Logistic\/Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify which demographic and\/or clinical characteristics were associated with COVID-19 severity\/death. Results: 128 (82%) presented with mild\/moderate COVID-19 and 28 (18%) with severe disease.

The aim of this study was to determine the clinical and economic value of a shutdown that is successful in \"flattening\" or \"squashing the curve\" in Germany. Methods: In the base case, the study compared a successful shutdown to a worst-case scenario with no ICU capacity left to treat COVID-19 patients. To this end, a decision model was developed using, e.g., information on age-specific fatality rates, ICU outcomes, and the herd protection threshold. The value of an additional life year was borrowed from new, innovative oncological drugs, as cancer reflects a condition with a similar morbidity and mortality burden in the general population in the short term as COVID-19. Results: A shutdown that is successful in \"flattening the curve\" is projected to yield an average health gain between 0.02 and 0.08 life years (0.2 to 0.9 months) per capita in the German population. The corresponding economic value ranges between 1543 and 8027 euros per capita or, extrapolated to the total population, 4% to 19% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019. A shutdown that is successful in \"squashing the curve\" is expected to yield a minimum health gain of 0.10 life years (1.2 months) per capita, corresponding to 24% of the GDP in 2019. Results are particularly sensitive to mortality data and the prevalence of undetected cases. Conclusion: A successful shutdown is forecasted to yield a considerable gain in life years in the German population.

However, there is limited data on health information, beliefs, and behaviors that might indicate different exposure to risk. Methods: A sample of 5,198 respondents in the United States (80% population representative, 20% oversample of hotspot areas in New York City, Seattle, New Orleans, and Detroit) was conducted from March 29th to April 13th to measure differences in knowledge, beliefs and behavior regarding COVID-19. Linear regression was used to understand racial, geographic, political, and socioeconomic differences in COVID-19 reported incidence knowledge, and behaviors after adjusting for state-specific and survey date fixed effects. Results: The largest differences in COVID-19 knowledge and behaviors are associated with race\/ethnicity, gender, and age. African-Americans, men, and people <55 years old are less likely to know how the disease is spread, less likely to know symptoms of COVID-19, wash their hands less frequently, and leave the home more often. Differences by income, political orientation, and living in a hotspot area are much smaller. Conclusions: There are wide gaps in COVID-19 reported incidence, knowledge regarding disease spread and symptoms, and in social distancing behavior. The findings suggest more effort is needed to increase accurate information and encourage appropriate behaviors among minority communities, men, and younger people.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Cutler","author_inst":"Harvard"},{"author_name":"Stefanie Stantcheva","author_inst":"Harvard"},{"author_name":"Marcella Alsan","author_inst":"Harvard"},{"author_name":"David Yang","author_inst":"Harvard"},{"author_name":"Paul Ross","author_inst":"Guy's and St. Thomas NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"James Spicer","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Shahram Kordasti","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Danielle Crawley","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Harriet Wylie","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Fidelma Cahill","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Anna Haire","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Kamarul Zaki","author_inst":"Guy's and St. Thomas NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Fareen Rahman","author_inst":"Guy's and St. Thomas NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ailsa Lumsden","author_inst":"Guy's and St. Thomas NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Debra Josephs","author_inst":"Guy's and St. Thomas NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Deborah Enting","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Mary Lei","author_inst":"Guy''s and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Sharmistha Ghosh","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Claire Harrison","author_inst":"Guy's and St. Thomas NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Angela Swampillai","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Elinor Sawyer","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Andrea D'Souza","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Simon Gomberg","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Paul Fields","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"David Wrench","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Kavita Raj","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Mary Gleeson","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Kate Bailey","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Richard Dillon","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Matthew Streetly","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Anna Rigg","author_inst":"Guy's and St. Thomas NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Richard Sullivan","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Saoirse Dolly","author_inst":"Guy's and St. Thomas NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Mieke Van Hemelrijck","author_inst":"King's College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.14.20100834","rel_title":"COVID-19 management in a UK NHS Foundation Trust with a High Consequence Infectious Diseases centre: a detailed descriptive analysis","rel_date":"2020-05-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.14.20100834","rel_abs":"Background: Recent large national and international cohorts describe the baseline characteristics and outcome of hospitalised patients with COVID-19, however there is little granularity to these reports. We aimed to provide a detailed description of a UK COVID-19 cohort, focusing on clinical decisions and patient journeys. Methods: We retrospectively analysed the management and 28-day outcomes of 316 consecutive adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to a large NHS Foundation Trust with a tertiary High Consequence Infectious Diseases centre in the North of England. Findings: Most patients were elderly (median age 75) with multiple comorbidities. One quarter were admitted from residential or nursing care. Symptoms were consistent with COVID-19, with cough, fever and\/or breathlessness in 90.5% of patients. Two thirds of patients had severe disease on admission. Mortality was 81\/291 (27.8%). Most deaths were anticipated; decisions to initiate respiratory support were individualised after consideration of patient wishes, premorbid frailty and comorbidities, with specialist palliative care input where appropriate. 22\/291 (7.6%) patients were intubated and 11\/22 (50%) survived beyond discharge. Multiple logistic regression identified age as the most significant risk factor for death (OR 1.09 [95% CI 1.06 - 1.12] per year increase, p < 0.001). Interpretation: These findings provide important clinical context to outcome data. Deaths were anticipated, occurring in patients with advance decisions on ceilings of treatment. Age was the most significant risk factor for death, confirming that demographic factors in the population are a major influence on hospital mortality rates. Funding: Funding was not required.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kenneth F.

Clinical characteristics that impact disease course could offer guidance for clinical decision making and future research endeavors and unveil disease pathways. Objective: To examine risk factors associated with adverse clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Data sources: We performed a systematic review in PubMed from January 1 until April 19, 2020. Study selection: Observational studies that examined the association of any clinical characteristic with an adverse clinical outcome were considered eligible. We scrutinized studies for potential overlap. Data extraction and synthesis: Information on the effect of clinical factors on clinical endpoints of patients with COVID-19 was independently extracted by two researchers. When an effect size was not reported, crude odds ratios were calculated based on the available information from the eligible articles. Study-specific effect sizes from non-overlapping studies were synthesized applying the random-effects model. Main outcome and measure: The examined outcomes were severity and progression of disease, admission to ICU, need for mechanical ventilation, mortality, or a composite outcome. Results: We identified 88 eligible articles, and we performed a total of 256 meta-analyses on the association of 98 unique risk factors with five clinical outcomes. Seven meta-analyses presented the strongest epidemiological evidence in terms of statistical significance (P-value <0.005), between-study heterogeneity (I2 <50%), sample size (more than 1000 COVID-19 patients), 95% prediction interval excluded the null value, and absence of small-study effects. Elevated C-reactive protein (OR, 6.46; 95% CI, 4.85 - 8.60), decreased lymphocyte count (OR, 4.16; 95% CI, 3.17 - 5.45), cerebrovascular disease (OR, 2.84; 95% CI, 1.55 - 5.20), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR, 4.44; 95% CI, 2.46 - 8.02), diabetes mellitus (OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.54 - 2.70), hemoptysis (OR, 7.03; 95% CI, 4.57 - 10.81), and male sex (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.30 - 1.75) were associated with risk of severe COVID-19. Conclusions and relevance: Our results highlight factors that could be useful for prognostic model building, help guide patients' selection for randomized clinical trials, as well as provide alternative treatment targets by shedding light to disease pathophysiology.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vanesa Bellou","author_inst":"University of Ioannina Medical School"},{"author_name":"Ioanna Tzoulaki","author_inst":"University of Ioannina Medical School"},{"author_name":"Evangelos Evangelou","author_inst":"University of Ioannina Medical School"},{"author_name":"Lazaros Belbasis","author_inst":"University of Ioannina Medical School"},{"author_name":"Richard Capstick","author_inst":"The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK"},{"author_name":"Gabriella Marchitelli","author_inst":"The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK"},{"author_name":"Ang Li","author_inst":"The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK"},{"author_name":"Andrew Barr","author_inst":"The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK"},{"author_name":"Alsafi Eid","author_inst":"The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK"},{"author_name":"Sajeel Ahmed","author_inst":"The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK"},{"author_name":"Dalvir Bajwa","author_inst":"The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK"},{"author_name":"Omer Mohammed","author_inst":"The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK"},{"author_name":"Neil Alderson","author_inst":"The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK"},{"author_name":"Clare Lendrem","author_inst":"NIHR In Vitro Diagnostics Cooperative, Newcastle University, UK"},{"author_name":"Dennis Lendrem","author_inst":"National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre, Newcastle University, UK"},{"author_name":"COVID-19 Control Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"COVID-19 Clinical Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Lucia Pareja-Cebrian","author_inst":"The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK"},{"author_name":"Andrew Welch","author_inst":"The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK"},{"author_name":"Joanne Field","author_inst":"The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK"},{"author_name":"Brendan A.I.

Our analysis of a large retrospective cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients treated with HCQ did not show benefits in mortality or the need for mechanical ventilation when compared to a matched cohort of patients who did not receive HCQ.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shailendra Singh","author_inst":"Charleston Area Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ahmad Khan","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, West Virginia University Health Sciences Center Charleston Division, Charleston, WV"},{"author_name":"Monica Chowdhry","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, West Virginia University Health Sciences Center Charleston Division, Charleston, WV"},{"author_name":"Arka Chatterjee","author_inst":"Division of Cardiovascular Disease, University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Yu Yamashita","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Tatsuya Fukumoto","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Kaori Sato","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Satoshi Oguri","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Keisuke Taki","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Hajime Senjo","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Kasumi Hayasaka","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Junichi Sugita","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Satoshi Konno","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Mutsumi Nishida","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Takanori Teshima","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"COVID-19 Control Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"COVID-19 Clinical Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Lucia Pareja-Cebrian","author_inst":"The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK"},{"author_name":"Andrew Welch","author_inst":"The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK"},{"author_name":"Joanne Field","author_inst":"The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK"},{"author_name":"Brendan A.I.

Methods: A stochastic version of the SEIR model CovidSIM v1.1 designed specifically for COVID-19 was utilised. It was seeded with New Zealand (NZ) population data and relevant parameters sourced from the NZ and international literature. Results: For what we regard as the most plausible scenario with an effective reproduction number of 2.0, the results suggest that 95% of outbreaks from a single imported case would be detected in the period up to day 33 after introduction. At the time point of detection, there would be a median number of 6 infected cases in the community (95%UI: 1-68). To achieve this level of detection, an on-going programme of 7,800 tests per million people per week for the NZ population would be required. The vast majority of this testing (96%) would be of symptomatic cases in primary care settings and the rest in hospitals. Despite the large number of tests required, there are plausible strategies to enhance testing yield and cost-effectiveness eg, (i) adjusting the eligibility criteria via symptom profiles; (ii) and pooling of test samples. Conclusions: This model-based analysis suggests that a surveillance system with a very high level of routine testing is probably required to detect an emerging or re-emerging SARS-CoV-2 outbreak within one month of a border control failure in a nation.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nick Wilson","author_inst":"University of Otago, Wellington"},{"author_name":"Markus Schwehm","author_inst":"ExploSYS"},{"author_name":"Ayesha J Verrall","author_inst":"University of Otago, Wellington"},{"author_name":"Matthew Parry","author_inst":"University of Otago, Dunedin"},{"author_name":"Michael G Baker","author_inst":"University of Otago, Wellington"},{"author_name":"Martin Eichner","author_inst":"Epimos"},{"author_name":"Kaori Sato","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Satoshi Oguri","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Keisuke Taki","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Hajime Senjo","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Kasumi Hayasaka","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Junichi Sugita","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Satoshi Konno","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Mutsumi Nishida","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Takanori Teshima","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"COVID-19 Control Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"COVID-19 Clinical Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Lucia Pareja-Cebrian","author_inst":"The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK"},{"author_name":"Andrew Welch","author_inst":"The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK"},{"author_name":"Joanne Field","author_inst":"The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK"},{"author_name":"Brendan A.I.

During this period the Irish government implemented a series of policies designed to delay the spread of the pandemic culminating in a stay-at-home order that greatly restricted mobility for the majority of the population. In this paper we evaluate the policies enacted using evidence obtained from a number of novel sources, including census and real-time traffic data. The evidence suggests that the policies have impeded the spread of the virus, which has mostly been confined to Dublin and its commuter belt. At the same time, the virus has become concentrated in a number of clusters associated with nursing homes and workplaces that remained open during the delay phase. This evidence is used to hypothesise on the likely impact of the pandemic on high density and poor neighbourhoods in Dublin.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gerald Mills","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Walter Cullen","author_inst":"UCD"},{"author_name":"Niamh Moore","author_inst":"UCD"},{"author_name":"Ronan Foley","author_inst":"Maynooth University"},{"author_name":"Michael G Baker","author_inst":"University of Otago, Wellington"},{"author_name":"Martin Eichner","author_inst":"Epimos"},{"author_name":"Kaori Sato","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Satoshi Oguri","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Keisuke Taki","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Hajime Senjo","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Kasumi Hayasaka","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Junichi Sugita","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Satoshi Konno","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Mutsumi Nishida","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Takanori Teshima","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"COVID-19 Control Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"COVID-19 Clinical Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Lucia Pareja-Cebrian","author_inst":"The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK"},{"author_name":"Andrew Welch","author_inst":"The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK"},{"author_name":"Joanne Field","author_inst":"The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK"},{"author_name":"Brendan A.I.

The burden of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been geographically disproportionate. Certain weather factors and population characteristics are thought to drive transmission, but studies examining these factors are limited. We aimed to identify weather, sociodemographic, and geographic drivers of COVID-19 at the global scale using a comprehensive collection of country\/territory-level data, and to use discovered associations to estimate the timing of community transmission. Methods. We examined COVID-19 cases and deaths reported up to May 2, 2020 across 205 countries and territories in relation to weather data collected from capital cities for the eight weeks prior to and four weeks after the date of the first reported case, as well as country\/territory-level population, geographic, and planetary data. We performed univariable and multivariable regression modeling and odds ratio analyses to investigate associations with COVID-19 cases, deaths, and epidemic growth rate. We also conducted maximum likelihood analysis to estimate the timing of initial community spread. Findings. Lower temperature (p<0.0001), lower humidity (p=0.006), higher altitude (p=0.0080), higher percentage of urban population (p<0.0001), increased air travelers (p=0.00019), and higher prevalence of obesity (p<0.0001) were strong independent predictors of national COVID-19 incidence, mortality, and epidemic growth rate. Temperature at 5-7 weeks before the first reported case best predicted epidemic growth, suggesting that significant community transmission was occurring on average 1-2 months prior to detection. Interpretation. The results of this ecologic analysis demonstrate that global COVID-19 burden and timing of country-level epidemic growth can be predicted by weather and population factors. In particular, we find that cool, dry, and higher altitude environments, as well as more urban and obese populations, may be conducive to more rapid epidemic spread.

To understand the overall impact on mortality of the pandemic of COVID-19, we estimated the excess mortality registered in Portugal during the first month of the epidemic, from March 16 until April 14 using two different methods. Methods: We compared the observed and expected daily deaths (historical average number from daily death registrations in the past 10 years) and used 2 standard deviations confidence limit for all-cause mortality by age and specific mortality cause, considering the last 6 years. An adapted ARIMA model was also tested to validate the estimated number of all-cause deaths during the study period. Results: Between March 16 and April 14, there was an excess of 1,255 all-cause deaths, 14% more than expected. The number of daily deaths often surpassed the 2 standard deviations confidence limit. The excess mortality occurred mostly in people aged 75+. Forty-nine percent (49%) of the estimated excess deaths were registered as due to COVID-19, The other 51% registered as other natural causes. Conclusion: Even though Portugal took early containment measures against COVID-19, and the population complied massively with those measures, there was significant excess mortality during the first month of the pandemic, mostly among people aged 75+.

The efficacy of inactivation or eradication against various pathogens should be evaluated thoroughly to understand the level of afforded disinfection. Methods commonly used in the sterilization of medical devices such as ionizing radiation, vaporized hydrogen peroxide, and ethylene oxide can provide a high level of disinfection, defined as a 6 log10 reduction, against bacterial spores, considered the most resistant microorganisms. CDC guidance on the decontamination and reuse of N95s also includes the use of moist heat (60{degrees}C, 80% relative humidity, 15-30 min) as a possible recommendation based on literature showing preservation of fit efficiency and inactivation of H1N1 on spiked masks.

Rapid Assessment of the Inhalation Resistance Performance of Uncertified Medical Face Masks in the Context of Restricted Resources Imposed during a Public Health Emergency","rel_date":"2020-05-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.13.20100602","rel_abs":"In the case of a public health emergency such as the COVID-19 pandemic, access to large quantities of appropriate personal protection equipment (PPE) has presented a significant problem. A shortage of face masks and respirators has been widely reported across the world. A concerted effort to manufacture high volumes has not unsurprisingly put pressure on the supply chain and the important certification processes. PPE procured or donated as uncertified stock requires rigorous, expedient and scientifically informed evidence before decisions can be made regarding suitable deployment, expensive certification, return or possible destruction of stock. This paper reports a series of experiments devised in reaction to this situation. In this study, an experimental methodology for the assessment of the filtration performance of samples of real-world, uncertified, fluid resistant surgical masks (FRSM type IIR) was evaluated in the resource limited (lockdown) environment of the COVID-19 pandemic. A steady-state flow rig was adapted to incorporate a bespoke filter flow chamber for mounting face masks in order to evaluate the resistance to air flow as an indicator of mask inhalation performance. Pure air was drawn through a specified control surface area at known flow rate conditions; the resistance to the air flow through the masks was measured as the resulting pressure drop. Over 60 tests were performed from 4 different, randomly sampled batches and compared to a control sample of EN Type IIR certified FRSM masks. Steady-state volumetric airflow rates of 30 and 95 lmin-1 were chosen to represent deep breathing and vigorous exercise conditions respectively. The results showed that the sample masks produced a pressure drop of between 26% to 58% compared to the control batch at the lower flow rate and 22% to 55% at the higher rate. The results for each sample were consistent across both flow rates. Within the group of masks tested, two sets (between 48% and 58% of the reference set) showed the potential to be professionally assessed for appropriate deployment in a suitable setting. Although the absolute values of pressure drop measured by this method are unlikely to correlate with other testing approaches, the observed, indicative trends and relative performance of the masks is key to this approach. Critically, this method does not replace certification but it has enabled a public body to quickly make decisions; certify, re-assign, refund, thus saving time and resources. The total time spent conducting the tests was less than 8 hours and the low cost method proposed can be repurposed for low resource regions.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Steven Begg","author_inst":"University of Brighton"},{"author_name":"Nwabueze G Emekwuru","author_inst":"Coventry University"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Miche","author_inst":"University of Brighton"},{"author_name":"Bill Whitney","author_inst":"University of Brighton"},{"author_name":"Obuks Ejohwomu","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Hui Min Leung","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Orhun K Muratoglu","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital\/Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Amy Tsurumi","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital\/Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Laurence G Rahme","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital\/Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Tareq Jaber","author_inst":"Charles River Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Cassidy Collins","author_inst":"Charles River Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Amanda Budzilowicz","author_inst":"Charles River Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Julian Gjore","author_inst":"Charles River Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Mutsumi Nishida","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Takanori Teshima","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"COVID-19 Control Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"COVID-19 Clinical Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Lucia Pareja-Cebrian","author_inst":"The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK"},{"author_name":"Andrew Welch","author_inst":"The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK"},{"author_name":"Joanne Field","author_inst":"The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK"},{"author_name":"Brendan A.I.

In this paper, we review the experience of a comprehensive cancer center. Methods: A prospective registry was set up at Institut Curie at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. All cancer patients with suspected or proven COVID-19 were entered and actively followed for 28 days. Results: Among 9,842 patients treated at Institut Curie between mid-March and early May 2020, 141 (1.4%) were diagnosed with COVID-19, based on RT-PCR testing and\/or CT-scan. In line with our case-mix, breast cancer (40%) was the most common tumor type, followed by hematological and lung malignancies (both 13%). Patients with active cancer therapy or\/and advanced cancer accounted for 88% and 69% of patients, respectively. At diagnosis, 79% of patients had COVID-19 related symptoms, with an extent of lung parenchyma involvement [&le;]50% in 90% of patients. Blood count variations and C-reactive protein elevation were the most common laboratory abnormalities. Antibiotics and antiviral agents were administered in 48% and 7% of patients, respectively. At the time of analysis, 26 patients (18%) have died from COVID-19, and 81 (57%) were cured. Independent prognostic factors at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis associated with death or intensive care unit admission were extent of COVID-19 pneumonia and decreased O2 saturation. Conclusions: COVID-19 incidence and presentation in cancer patients appear to be very similar to those in the general population. The outcome of COVID-19 is primarily driven by the initial severity of infection rather than patient or cancer characteristics.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Clemence Basse","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Sarah Diakite","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Vincent Servois","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Maxime Frelaut","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Aurelien Noret","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Audrey Bellesoeur","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Pauline Moreau","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Marie-Ange Massiani","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Anne-Sophie Bouyer","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"perrine vuagnat","author_inst":"institut curie"},{"author_name":"SAndra Malak","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Francois-Clement Bidard","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Dominique Vanjak","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Irene Kriegel","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Alexis Burnod","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Geoffroy Bilger","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Toulsie Ramtohul","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Gille Dhonneur","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Carole Bouleuc","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Cassoux","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Xavier Paoletti","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Laurence Bozec","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Paul Cottu","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Christopher Gibbins","author_inst":"The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK"},{"author_name":"Matthias L.

This makes them inappropriate for evaluating testing and contact tracing strategies to contain an outbreak. An alternative used in practice is the application of agent- or individual-based models (ABM). However ABMs are complex, less well-understood and much more computationally expensive. This paper presents a new method for accurately including the effects of Testing, contact-Tracing and Isolation (TTI) strategies in standard compartmental models. We derive our method using a careful probabilistic argument to show how contact tracing at the individual level is reflected in aggregate on the population level. We show that the resultant SEIR-TTI model accurately approximates the behaviour of a mechanistic agent-based model at far less computational cost. The computationally efficiency is such that it be easily and cheaply used for exploratory modelling to quantify the required levels of testing and tracing, alone and with other interventions, to assist adaptive planning for managing disease outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Simone Sturniolo","author_inst":"Science and Technology Facilities Council, Swindon, UK"},{"author_name":"William Waites","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Tim Colbourn","author_inst":"Institute of Global Health, UCL"},{"author_name":"David Manheim","author_inst":"University of Haifa Health and Risk Communication Research Center, Haifa, Israel"},{"author_name":"Jasmina Panovska-Griffiths","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Audrey Bellesoeur","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Pauline Moreau","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Marie-Ange Massiani","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Anne-Sophie Bouyer","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"perrine vuagnat","author_inst":"institut curie"},{"author_name":"SAndra Malak","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Francois-Clement Bidard","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Dominique Vanjak","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Irene Kriegel","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Alexis Burnod","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Geoffroy Bilger","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Toulsie Ramtohul","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Gille Dhonneur","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Carole Bouleuc","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Cassoux","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Xavier Paoletti","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Laurence Bozec","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Paul Cottu","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Christopher Gibbins","author_inst":"The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK"},{"author_name":"Matthias L.

A clinical score predictive of COVID-19 based on readily assessed variables may be useful in settings with restricted or no access to molecular diagnostic tests. Methods: A score based on demographics and symptoms was developed in a cross-sectional study including patients attended in a dedicated COVID-19 screening unit. A backward stepwise logistic regression model was constructed and values for each variable were assigned according to their {beta} coefficient values in the final model. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed and its area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. Results: A total of 464 patients were included: 98 (21.1%) COVID-19 and 366 (78.9%) non-COVID-19 patients. The score included variables independently associated with COVID-19 in the final model: age equal or above 60 years (2 points), fever (2), dyspnea (1), fatigue (1 point) and coryza (-1). Score values were significantly higher in COVID-19 than non-COVID-19 patients: median (Interquartile Range), 3 (2-4), and 1 (0-2), respectively; P<0.001. The score had an AUC of 0.80 (95% Confidence Interval [CI], 0.76-0.86). The specificity of scores equal or greater than 4 and 5 points were 90.4 (95%CI, 87.0-93.3) and 96.2 (95%CI, 93.7-97.9), respectively. Conclusions: This preliminary score based on patients symptoms is a feasible tool that may be useful in setting with restricted or no access to molecular tests in a pandemic period, owing to the high specificity. Further studies are required to validate the score in other populations.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexandre P Zavascki","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"Marcelo B Gazzana","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Joao Pedro Bidart","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Patricia S Fernandes","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Aline Galiotto","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Cristiane T Kawski","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Luiz A Nasi","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Diego R Falci","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Anne-Sophie Bouyer","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"perrine vuagnat","author_inst":"institut curie"},{"author_name":"SAndra Malak","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Francois-Clement Bidard","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Dominique Vanjak","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Irene Kriegel","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Alexis Burnod","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Geoffroy Bilger","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Toulsie Ramtohul","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Gille Dhonneur","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Carole Bouleuc","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Cassoux","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Xavier Paoletti","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Laurence Bozec","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Paul Cottu","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Christopher Gibbins","author_inst":"The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK"},{"author_name":"Matthias L.

Australia and South Korea are ideal candidates for detailed consideration. Both have completed the first wave of the epidemic, they have extensive Covid-19 testing and tracking programs so that confirmed case load data are reliable, and neither country has had any significant case load stress in their hospital systems. Methods: For each country, mortality hazard models were estimated using a parameterized distributed lag model where the number of daily deaths was dependent on the number of confirmed cases in each of the preceding six weeks. Age cohort CFRs were also examined. Findings: We observed major difference in the mortality rates when comparing South Korea to Australia in both the simple age adjusted fatality rates and in the disease hazard curve. On a like-for-like basis, the CFR for South Korea appears to be close to double the Australian rate (aggregate; 2.4% vs 1.4%). Interpretation: Neither differences in the time pattern of the peaking of the case load of confirmed cases, nor differences in the size of age cohorts of confirmed cases explain the difference in mortality observed.

Methods Population studies with sample size of at least 500 and published as peer-reviewed papers or preprints as of July 11, 2020 were retrieved from PubMed, preprint servers, and communications with experts. Studies on blood donors were included, but studies on healthcare workers were excluded. The studies were assessed for design features and seroprevalence estimates. Infection fatality rate was estimated from each study dividing the number of COVID-19 deaths at a relevant time point by the number of estimated people infected in each relevant region. Correction was also attempted accounting for the types of antibodies assessed. Secondarily, results from national studies were also examined from preliminary press releases and reports whenever a country had no other data presented in full papers of preprints. Results 36 studies (43 estimates) were identified with usable data to enter into calculations and another 7 preliminary national estimates were also considered for a total of 50 estimates. Seroprevalence estimates ranged from 0.222% to 47%. Infection fatality rates ranged from 0.00% to 1.63% and corrected values ranged from 0.00% to 1.31%. Across 32 different locations, the median infection fatality rate was 0.27% (corrected 0.24%). Most studies were done in pandemic epicenters with high death tolls. Median corrected IFR was 0.10% in locations with COVID-19 population mortality rate less than the global average (<73 deaths per million as of July 12, 2020), 0.27% in locations with 73-500 COVID-19 deaths per million, and 0.90% in locations exceeding 500 COVID-19 deaths per million. Among people <70 years old, infection fatality rates ranged from 0.00% to 0.57% with median of 0.05% across the different locations (corrected median of 0.04%). Conclusions The infection fatality rate of COVID-19 can vary substantially across different locations and this may reflect differences in population age structure and case-mix of infected and deceased patients as well as multiple other factors. Estimates of infection fatality rates inferred from seroprevalence studies tend to be much lower than original speculations made in the early days of the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"John Ioannidis","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"John Beggs","author_inst":"Monarch Institute, Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Joao Pedro Bidart","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Patricia S Fernandes","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Aline Galiotto","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Cristiane T Kawski","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Luiz A Nasi","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Diego R Falci","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Anne-Sophie Bouyer","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"perrine vuagnat","author_inst":"institut curie"},{"author_name":"SAndra Malak","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Francois-Clement Bidard","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Dominique Vanjak","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Irene Kriegel","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Alexis Burnod","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Geoffroy Bilger","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Toulsie Ramtohul","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Gille Dhonneur","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Carole Bouleuc","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Cassoux","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Xavier Paoletti","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Laurence Bozec","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Paul Cottu","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Christopher Gibbins","author_inst":"The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK"},{"author_name":"Matthias L.

This study proposes an integrated deterministic-stochastic approach to forecast the long-term trajectories of the COVID-19 cases for Italy and Spain. The deterministic component of the daily-cases univariate time-series is assessed by an extended version of the SIR (SIRCX) model, whereas its stochastic component is modeled using an autoregressive (AR) time series model. The proposed integrated SIRCX-AR (ISA) approach based on two operationally distinct modeling paradigms utilizes the superiority of both the deterministic SIRCX and stochastic AR models to find the long-term trajectories of the epidemic curves. Experimental analysis based on the proposed ISA model shows significant improvement in the long-term forecasting of COVID-19 cases for Italy and Spain in comparison to the ODE-based SIRCX model.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Indrajit Ghosh","author_inst":"Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Tanujit Chakraborty","author_inst":"Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Joao Pedro Bidart","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Patricia S Fernandes","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Aline Galiotto","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Cristiane T Kawski","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Luiz A Nasi","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Diego R Falci","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento"},{"author_name":"Anne-Sophie Bouyer","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"perrine vuagnat","author_inst":"institut curie"},{"author_name":"SAndra Malak","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Francois-Clement Bidard","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Dominique Vanjak","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Irene Kriegel","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Alexis Burnod","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Geoffroy Bilger","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Toulsie Ramtohul","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Gille Dhonneur","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Carole Bouleuc","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Cassoux","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Xavier Paoletti","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Laurence Bozec","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Paul Cottu","author_inst":"Institut Curie"},{"author_name":"Christopher Gibbins","author_inst":"The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK"},{"author_name":"Matthias L.

Symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, pneumonia, and multi-organ failure. The infection spreads from one person to another via respiratory droplets. Alternative medicine (AMs) viz., Ayurveda, Homeopathy, Unani, and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), are being promoted for the prevention of COVID-19. The aim of this systematic scoping review was to identify and summarize the scientific evidences promoting the use of AMs for the prevention of COVID-19. Methods: A comprehensive search of electronic search engines (PubMed and Web of Science) was performed. In addition, freewheeling searches of the government health ministries and government websites was done to retrieve the available information. Records available until 12th March 2020 were considered. Reports proposing the use of AMs for prevention or treatment of COVID-19 across all countries were included. Screening (primary and secondary) of the records and data extraction from the eligible studies were done by a single reviewer followed by a random quality check (10%) by the second reviewer. Results: Overall, 8 records (7 from China and 1 from India) exploring the use of AMs for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 were identified. Different medicines were explored by different AM systems. Conclusions: Several AMs options are proposed for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. However, their efficacy and safety still needs scientific validation through rigorous randomized controlled trials. This review may help inform decisions about the importance of research and development of AMs for COVID-19 prevention and treatment.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amrita Nandan","author_inst":"Society for Life Sciences and Human Health (non profitable charitable trust registered at govt of India), Allahabad, U.P.
