There is an urgency to identify potential antibodies to neutralize the virus and also as a diagnostic tool candidate. At present palliative treatments using existing antiviral drugs are under trails to treat SARS-CoV-2.Whole Genome sequence of Wuhan market sample of SARS-CoV-2 was obtained from NCBI Gene ID MN908947.3.Spike protein sequence PDB ID 6VSB obtained from RCSB database. Spike protein sequence had shown top V gene match with IGLV1-44*01, IGLV1-47*02 and has VL type chain. Whole Genome sequence had shown top V gene match with IGHV1-38-4*01 and has VH type chain. VD chain had shown link to allele HLA-A0206 80%, HLA-A0217 80%, HLA-A2301 75%, HLA-A0203 75%, HLA-A0202 70% and HLA-A0201 55% of binding levels. Some conserved regions of spike protein had shown strong binding affinity with HLA-A-0*201, HLA-A24, HLA-B-5701 and HLA-B-5703 alpha chains. Synthetic Fab construct BCR type antibody IgG (CR5840) had shown Polyspecific binding activity with spike glycoprotein when compared with available Anti-SARS antibody CR3022.Thus we propose CR5840 Fab constructed antibody as potential neutralizing antibody for SARS-CoV-2. Based on germline analysis we also propose cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitope peptide selective system as effective tool for the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hemanth K Manikyam","author_inst":"Faculty of Science, North East Frontier Technical University, Arunachal Pradesh, India."},{"author_name":"Sunil K Joshi","author_inst":"University of Miami School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.03.075473","rel_title":"Computational analysis on the ACE2-derived peptides for neutralizing the ACE2 binding to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-05-04","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.03.075473","rel_abs":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the COVID-19, is spreading globally and has infected more than 3 million people. It has been discovered that SARS-CoV-2 initiates the entry into cells by binding to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) through the receptor binding domain (RBD) of its spike glycoprotein. Hence, drugs that can interfere the SARS-CoV-2-RBD binding to hACE2 potentially can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 from entering human cells. Here, based on the N-terminal helix 1 of human ACE2, we designed nine short peptides that have potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 binding. Molecular dynamics simulations of peptides in the their free and SARS-CoV-2 RBD-bound forms allow us to identify fragments that are stable in water and have strong binding affinity to the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. The important interactions between peptides and RBD are highlighted to provide guidance for the design of peptidomimetics against the SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"cecylia s. lupala","author_inst":"beijing computational science research center"},{"author_name":"Vikash Kumar","author_inst":"Beijing computational science research center"},{"author_name":"xuanxuan li","author_inst":"tsinghua university"},{"author_name":"xiaodong su","author_inst":"peking university"},{"author_name":"haiguang liu","author_inst":"beijing computational science research center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"biophysics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.29.20084061","rel_title":"Psychological Stress and Gender Differences during COVID-19 Pandemic in Chinese Population","rel_date":"2020-05-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.29.20084061","rel_abs":"About 83000 COVID-19 patients were confirmed in China up to May 2020. The effects of this public health crisis - and the varied efforts to contains its spread - have altered individuals \"normal\" daily functioning. This impact on social, psychological, and emotional well-being remain relatively unexplored, especially the ways in which Chinese men and women experience and respond to potential behavioral-related stressors. A cross-sectional study was conducted in late February 2020. Demographic characteristics and residential living conditions were measured along with psychological stress and behavior responses to the COVID-19 epidemic. 3088 questionnaires were received: 1749 females (56.6%) and 1339 males (43.4%). The mean level of stress, as measured by a visual analog scale, was 3.4 (SD=2.4) - but differed significantly by sex. Besides sex, factors positively associated with stress included: age ([&le;]45 years), employment (unsteady income, unemployed), risk infection population (exposed to COVID-19, completed medical observation), difficulties encountered (diseases, work\/study, financial, mental), behaviors(higher desire for COVID-19 knowledge, more time spent on the COVID-19). \"Protective\" factors included frequently contact with colleagues, calmness, and psychological resilience. Males and females also differed significantly in adapting to current living\/working status, coping with heating, and psychological support service needs. Among Chinese, self-reported stress related to the COVID-19 epidemic were significantly related to sex, age, employment, resilience and coping styles. Future responses to such public health threats may wish to provide sex- and\/or age-appropriate supports for psychological health and emotional well-being to those at greatest risk of experiencing stress.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kangxing Song","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, the First Medical Center, Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rui Xu","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Basic Medicine, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Terry D.

Mitigating interventions may change the exponent during the rising phase and a plateau can replace a peak. With interventions comes the risk that relaxation causes a second-wave. In the UK Covid-19 epidemic, infections cannot be counted, but their influence is seen in the curve of the mortality data. This work simulated social distancing and the lockdown in the UK Covid-19 epidemic to explore strategies for relaxation. Methods Cumulative mortality data was transposed 20 days earlier to identify three doubling periods separated by the 17th March - social distancing, and 23rd March - lockdown. A set of stochastic processes simulated viral transmission between interacting individuals using Covid-19 incubation and illness durations. Social distancing and restrictions on interactions were imposed and later relaxed. Principal Findings Daily mortality data, consistent with that seen in the UK Covid-19 epidemic to 24th April 2020 was simulated. This output predicts that under a lockdown maintained till early July 2020, UK deaths will exceed 31,000, but leave a large susceptible population and a requirement for vaccination or quarantine. An earlier staged relaxation carries a risk of a second-wave. The model allows exploration of strategies for lifting the lockdown. Interpretation Social distancing and the lockdown have had an impressive impact on the UK Covid-19 epidemic and saved lives, caution is now needed in planning its relaxation.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anthony D Lander","author_inst":"Birmingham Women's and Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rui Xu","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Basic Medicine, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Terry D.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-COV-2) was found at very high concentrations in swab and sputum of such cases. Objective: We aimed to estimate in a mathematical modeling study the virus release from such cases into different aerosol sizes by normal breathing and coughing, and what exposure can result from this in a room shared with such as case. Data Sources and Model: We combined the size-distribution of exhaled breath microdroplets for coughing and normal breathing with viral sputum concentrations as approximation for lung lining liquid to obtain an estimate of emitted virus levels. The resulting emission data fed a single-compartment model of airborne concentrations in a room of 50 m3, the size of a small office or medical exam room. Results: The estimated viral load in microdroplets emitted by simulated patients while breathing normally was on typical 0.0000049 copies\/cm3 and could go up to 0.637 copies\/cm3. The corresponding numbers for coughing simulated patients were 0.277 copies\/cm3 and 36,030\/cm3, respectively, per cough. The resulting concentrations in a room with a coughing emitter were always very high, up to 7.44 million copies\/m3. However, also regular breathing microdroplets from high emitters was modelled to lead to 1248 copies\/m3. Conclusions and Relevance: In this modelling study, breathing and coughing were estimated to release large numbers of viruses, ranging from thousands to millions of virus copies\/m3 in a room with an emitter having a high viral load, depending on ventilation and microdroplet formation process. These findings suggest that strict respiratory protection may be needed when there is a chance to be in the same room with a patient - whether symptomatic or not - especially for a prolonged time.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael Riediker","author_inst":"Swiss Centre for Occupational and Environmental Health"},{"author_name":"Dai-Hua Tsai","author_inst":"Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University Hospital of Psychiatry Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Gediminas Skarbalius","author_inst":"Lithuanian Energy Institute, Breslaujos st. 3, LT-44403 Kaunas, Lithuania"},{"author_name":"Edgaras Misiulis","author_inst":"Lithuanian Energy Institute, Breslaujos st. 3, LT-44403 Kaunas, Lithuania"},{"author_name":"Robertas Navakas","author_inst":"Lithuanian Energy Institute, Breslaujos st. 3, LT-44403 Kaunas, Lithuania"},{"author_name":"Fengsu Hou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Kangning Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fengying Bi","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Rong Jiao","author_inst":"The First Clinical College, Hainan Meidical University"},{"author_name":"Shiyan Yan","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Basic Medicine, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yang Jiang","author_inst":"Department of Behavioral Science, College of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"occupational and environmental health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.27.20081372","rel_title":"How Social Media and 3D Printing Tackles the PPE Shortage during Covid - 19 Pandemic","rel_date":"2020-05-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.27.20081372","rel_abs":"During the recent Covid-19 pandemic, additive Technology and Social Media were used to tackle the shortage of Personal Protective Equipment.

Many attempts have been devoted to modeling the dynamics of new infection rates, death rates, and the impact of the disease on health systems and the world economy. Most of these modeling concepts use the Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) and Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) compartmental models; however, wide imprecise outcomes in forecasting can occur with these models in the context of poor data, low testing levels, and a nonhomogeneous population. Objectives: To predict Brazilian ICU beds demand over time and during COVID-19 pandemic peak. Methods: In the present study, we describe a Bayesian COVID-19 model combined with a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm to forecast quantitative predictions of infections, number of deaths and the demand for critical care beds in the next month in the Brazilian context of scarce data availability. We also estimated COVID-19 spread tendency in the state of Sao Paulo and forecasted the demand for critical care beds, as Sao Paulo is the epicenter of the Latin America pandemic. Results: Our model estimated that the number of infected individuals would be approximately 6.5 million (median) on April 25, 2020, and would reach 16 to 17 million (median) by the end of August 2020 in Brazil. The probability that an infected individual requires ICU-level care in Brazil is 0.5833% . Our model suggests that the current level of mitigation seen in Sao Paulo is sufficient to reach Rt < 1, thus attaining a peak in the short term. In Sao Paulo state, the total number of deaths is estimated to be around 9,000 (median) with the 2.5% quantile being 6,600 deaths and the 97.5% quantile being around 13,350 deaths. Also, Sao Paulo will not attain its maximum capacity of ICU beds if the current trend persists over the long term. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic should peak in Brazil between May 8 and May 20, 2020 with a fatality rate lower than that suggested in the literature. The northern and northeastern regions of Brazil will suffer from a lack of available ICU beds, whereas the southeastern, southern, and central-western regions appear to have sufficient ICU beds only if they share private system beds with the publicly funded Unified Heath System (SUS). The model predicts that, if the current policies and population behavior are maintained throughout the forecasted period, by the end of August 2020, Brazil will have around 7.6% to 8.2% of its population immune to COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samy Dana","author_inst":"Fundacao Getulio Vargas (EASP-FGV), Brazil"},{"author_name":"Alexandre B Simas","author_inst":"Mathematics Department, Federal University of Paraiba, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Bruno A Filardi","author_inst":"Scientific Director of Cancer Institute, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo N Rodriguez","author_inst":"Director of Ubarana Hospital, Taubate, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Leandro Lane da Costa Valiengo","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo, Institute of Psychiatry, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Jose Gallucci-Neto","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo, Institute of Psychiatry, Brazil"},{"author_name":"A.

The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of olfactory loss in an out-patient population who presented to a coronavirus testing center during a 2-week period and to evaluate the diagnostic value of the symptom sudden smell loss for screening procedures. Methods: In this cross-sectional controlled cohort study, 500 patients who presented with symptoms of a common cold to a corona testing center and fulfilled corona testing criteria, completed a standardized diagnostic questionnaire which included the patients main symptoms, time course and an additional self-assessment of the patients current smell, taste function and nasal breathing compared to the level before onset of symptoms. Results: Out of the 500 patients, 69 presented with olfactory loss. Twenty-two of them subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Only twelve out of the patients without olfactory loss tested positive, resulting in a frequency of 64.7% for the symptom sudden smell loss in COVID-19 patients. Compared to COVID-19 patients without smell loss, they were significantly younger and less severely affected. Changes in nasal airflow were significantly more pronounced in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients with olfactory complaints compared to the patients with smell loss who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. By excluding patients with a blocked nose, the symptom sudden smell loss can be attested a high specificity (97%) and a sensitivity of 65% with a PPV of 63% and NPV of 97% for COVID-19. Conclusion: Considering the high frequency of smell loss in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients, acute olfactory impairment should be included in the WHO symptoms list and should be recognized as an early symptom of the disease. In contrast to other acute viral smell impairment, COVID-19 associated smell loss seems to be only rarely accompanied by a severely blocked nose.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Antje Haehner","author_inst":"TU Dresden"},{"author_name":"Julia Draf","author_inst":"TU Dresden"},{"author_name":"Sarah Draeger","author_inst":"TU Dresden"},{"author_name":"Katja de With","author_inst":"TU Dresden"},{"author_name":"Thomas Hummel","author_inst":"TU Dresden"},{"author_name":"Jose Gallucci-Neto","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo, Institute of Psychiatry, Brazil"},{"author_name":"A.

A parallel search of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) literature was performed for comparison of outcomes. Data sources: MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. The search for COVID-19 studies was performed between 1st November 2019 and 24th March 2020. The search for MERS studies was performed one year earlier between 1st November 2018 and 24th March 2019. Main outcome measures: Investigator-responsiveness was assessed by measuring the volume and type of published research. Editorial-responsiveness was assessed by measuring the time from manuscript submission to acceptance and the availability of original data to support the study results. Publisher-responsiveness was assessed by measuring the time from manuscript acceptance to first publication and the provision of open access. Results: In total, 398 of 2835 COVID-19 and 55 of 1513 MERS search results were eligible. Most COVID-19 studies were clinical reports (n=242; 60.8%) and the majority of these were case series (n=105; 43.4%) and single cases (n=65; 26.9%). The times from manuscript submission to acceptance (median: 5 days (IQR: 3-11) vs 71.5 days (38-106); P<0.001) and acceptance to publication (median: 5 days (IQR: 2-8) vs. 22.5 days (4-48.5-; P<0.001) were strikingly shorter for COVID-19.

Using a data-based mathematical model, our study has made predictions on the number of cases that are expected to rise in India till 14th June 2020. The epidemiological data of daily cases have been utilized from 25th March (i.e., the first day of lockdown) to 23rd April 2020. In the study, we have stimulated two possible scenarios (optimistic and pessimistic) for the prediction. As per the optimistic approach of modelling, COVID-19 may end in the first week of June 2020 with a total of 77,900 infected cases including 2,442 fatalities. However, the results under the pessimistic scenario are a bit scary as it shows that a total of 283,300 infected cases with 10,180 fatalities till 14th June. To win the battle, 10 weeks of complete lockdown is much needed at least in the infected states and the union territories of India. Alternatively, the isolation of clusters (hotspot regions) is required if India wants a resume of some essential activities.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anupam Singh","author_inst":"Centre for Data Analytics-SVSM, Shri Vaishnav Vidyapeeth Vishwavidyalaya (SVVV University), Indore, India"},{"author_name":"Jhilik Dey","author_inst":"IICB-Translational Research Unit of Excellence, Division of Cell Biology and Physiology, CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Kolkata, India"},{"author_name":"Shivam Bhardwaj","author_inst":"Sage University, Indore, India"},{"author_name":"Jim P Tiernan","author_inst":"Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"David G Jayne","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Stephen J Chapman","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Yu Wang","author_inst":"Guanghua School of Management, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Yumou Qiu","author_inst":"Iowa State Univeristy"},{"author_name":"Song Chen","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Yang Jiang","author_inst":"Department of Behavioral Science, College of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.27.20081984","rel_title":"Distinguishing L and H phenotypes of COVID-19 using a single x-ray image","rel_date":"2020-05-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.27.20081984","rel_abs":"Recent observations have shown that there are two types of COVID-19 response: an H phenotype with high lung elastance and weight, and an L phenotype with low measures. H-type patients have pneumonia-like thickening of the lungs and require ventilation to survive; L-type patients have clearer lungs that may be injured by mechanical assistance. As treatment protocols differ between the two types, and the number of ventilators is limited, it is vital to classify patients appropriately. To date, the only way to confirm phenotypes is through high-resolution computed tomography. Here, we identify L- and H-type patients from their frontal chest x-rays using feature-embedded machine learning. We then apply the categorization to multiple images from the same patient, extending it to detect and monitor disease progression and recovery. The results give an immediate criterion for coronavirus triage and provide a methodology for respiratory diseases beyond COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammad Tariqul Islam","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Jason W.

Methods: Here we used data from proactive sampling carried out in New York City from fall 2016 to spring 2018. We combined weekly nasal swab collection with self-reports of respiratory symptoms from 191 participants to investigate the profile of recurring infections with endemic coronaviruses. Results: During the study, 12 individuals tested positive multiple times for the same coronavirus. We found no significant difference between the probability of testing positive at least once and the probability of a recurrence for the beta-coronaviruses HKU1 and OC43 at 34 weeks after enrollment\/first infection. We also found no significant association between repeat infections and symptom severity but strong association between symptom severity and belonging to the same family. Conclusion: This study provides evidence that re-infections with the same endemic coronavirus are not atypical in a time window shorter than 1 year and that the genetic basis of innate immune response may be a greater determinant of infection severity than immune memory acquired after a previous infection.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marta Galanti","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Shaman","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Qian Ren","author_inst":"Qilu Children's Hospital of Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Junjie Yang","author_inst":"Qilu Normal University"},{"author_name":"Yanqin Lu","author_inst":"Shandong Medicinal Biotechnology Centre, Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Lei Zhang","author_inst":"Shandong Institute of Industrial Technology for Health Sciences and Precision Medicine"},{"author_name":"Zhongtao Gai","author_inst":"Qilu Children's Hospital of Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Yumou Qiu","author_inst":"Iowa State Univeristy"},{"author_name":"Song Chen","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Yang Jiang","author_inst":"Department of Behavioral Science, College of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.03.074930","rel_title":"Design of an Epitope-Based Peptide Vaccine against the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2): A Vaccine Informatics Approach","rel_date":"2020-05-03","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.03.074930","rel_abs":"The recurrent and recent global outbreak of SARS-COV-2 has turned into a global concern which has infected more than one million people all over the globe, and this number is increasing in hours. Unfortunate no vaccine or specific treatment is available, which make it more deadly. An immunoinformatics approach has shown significant breakthrough in peptide-based epitope mapping and opens the new horizon in vaccine development. In this study, we have identified a total of 15 antigenic peptides (including T and B Cells) in the surface glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 which found to be 100% conserved with other SARS coronaviruses. Furthermore, the population coverage analysis has found that CD4+ T-cell peptides showed higher cumulative population coverage over to CD8+ peptides in the 16 different geographical regions in the world. Notably, only 09 out of 15 peptides (LTDEMIAQY, IRASANLAA, FGAISSVLN, VKQLSSNFG, FAMQMAYRF, FGAGAALQ, VITPGTNTS, WTAGAAAYY and QTQTNSPRRARS) that have 80% - 90% identity with experimentally identified epitopes of different organisms including SARS-CoV and this will likely be beneficial for a quick progression of the vaccine design. Moreover, docking analysis suggested that these peptides are tightly bound in the groove of HLA molecules which can induce the T-cell response. Overall this study allows us to determine potent peptide antigen targets in surface glycoprotein on intuitive grounds which open up a new horizon in COVID-19 research. However, this study needs experimental validation by in vitro and in vivo.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arbaaz Khan","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi-110025"},{"author_name":"Aftab Alam","author_inst":"Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Basic Sciences, JMI University, New Delhi-110025."},{"author_name":"Nikhat Imam","author_inst":"Institute of Computer Science & Information Technology, Department of Mathematics, Magadh University, Bodh Gaya (Bihar, India)."},{"author_name":"Mohd Faizan Siddiqui","author_inst":"International Medical Faculty, Osh State University, Osh City, 723500, Kyrgyz Republic (Kyrgyzstan)"},{"author_name":"Romana Ishrat","author_inst":"Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Basic Sciences, JMI University, New Delhi-110025."},{"author_name":"Lei Zhang","author_inst":"Shandong Institute of Industrial Technology for Health Sciences and Precision Medicine"},{"author_name":"Zhongtao Gai","author_inst":"Qilu Children's Hospital of Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Yumou Qiu","author_inst":"Iowa State Univeristy"},{"author_name":"Song Chen","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Yang Jiang","author_inst":"Department of Behavioral Science, College of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.03.074567","rel_title":"Large scale genomic analysis of 3067 SARS-CoV-2 genomes reveals a clonal geodistribution and a rich genetic variations of hotspots mutations","rel_date":"2020-05-03","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.03.074567","rel_abs":"In late December 2019, an emerging viral infection COVID-19 was identified in Wuhan, China, and became a global pandemic. Characterization of the genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 is crucial in following and evaluating it spread across countries. In this study, we collected and analyzed 3,067 SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from 55 countries during the first three months after the onset of this virus. Using comparative genomics analysis, we traced the profiles of the whole-genome mutations and compared the frequency of each mutation in the studied population. The accumulation of mutations during the epidemic period with their geographic locations was also monitored. The results showed 782 variant sites, of which 512 (65.47%) had a non-synonymous effect. Frequencies of mutated alleles revealed the presence of 38 recurrent non-synonymous mutations, including ten hotspot mutations with a prevalence higher than 0.10 in this population and distributed in six SARS-CoV-2 genes. The distribution of these recurrent mutations on the world map revealed certain genotypes specific to the geographic location. We also found co-occurring mutations resulting in the presence of several haplotypes. Moreover, evolution over time has shown a mechanism of mutation co-accumulation which might affect the severity and spread of the SARS-CoV-2.\n\nOn the other hand, analysis of the selective pressure revealed the presence of negatively selected residues that could be taken into considerations as therapeutic targets\n\nWe have also created an inclusive unified database (http:\/\/genoma.ma\/covid-19\/) that lists all of the genetic variants of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes found in this study with phylogeographic analysis around the world.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Meriem Laamarti","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Tarek Alouane","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Souad Kartti","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"M.W.

Currently, over three million people have been identified for SARS-CoV-2 infection but SARS-CoV-2-specific vaccines and neutralizing antibodies are still lacking. SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells by interacting with angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) via the S1 receptor-binding domain (RBD) of its surface spike glycoprotein. Therefore, blocking the interaction of SARS-CoV-2-RBD and ACE2 by antibody would cause a directly neutralizing effect against virus. In the current study, we selected the ACE2 interface of SARS-CoV-2-RBD as the targeting epitope for neutralizing antibody screening. We performed site-directed screening by phage display and finally obtained one IgG antibody (4A3) and several domain antibodies. Among them, 4A3 and three domain antibodies (4A12, 4D5, and 4A10) were identified to act as neutralizing antibodies due to their capabilities to block the interaction between SARS-CoV-2-RBD and ACE2-positive cells. The domain antibody 4A12 was predicted to have the best accessibility to all three ACE2-interfaces on the spike homotrimer. Pseudovirus and authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays showed that all four antibodies could potently protect host cells from virus infection. Overall, we isolated multiple formats of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies via site-directed antibody screening, which could be promising candidate drugs for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaoyu Liu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Human Functional Genomics of Jiangsu Province, National Health Commission Key Laboratory of Antibody Techniques, School of Basic Medical Scien"},{"author_name":"Fang Gao","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Human Functional Genomics of Jiangsu Province, National Health Commission Key Laboratory of Antibody Techniques, School of Basic Medical Scien"},{"author_name":"Liming Gou","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Human Functional Genomics of Jiangsu Province, National Health Commission Key Laboratory of Antibody Techniques, School of Basic Medical Scien"},{"author_name":"Yin Chen","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Enteric Pathogenic Microbiology, Ministry of Health Institute of Pathogenic Microbiology, Jiangsu Province Center for Disease Control and Prev"},{"author_name":"Yayun Gu","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, International Joint Research Center on Environment and Human Health, School of Public Health, State Key Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Lei Ao","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Human Functional Genomics of Jiangsu Province, National Health Commission Key Laboratory of Antibody Techniques, School of Basic Medical Scien"},{"author_name":"Hongbing Shen","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, International Joint Research Center on Environment and Human Health, Center for Global Health, School of Public He"},{"author_name":"Zhibin Hu","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, International Joint Research Center on Environment and Human Health, School of Public Health, State Key Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Xiling Guo","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Enteric Pathogenic Microbiology, Ministry of Health Institute of Pathogenic Microbiology, Jiangsu Province Center for Disease Control and Prev"},{"author_name":"Wei Gao","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Human Functional Genomics of Jiangsu Province, National Health Commission Key Laboratory of Antibody Techniques, School of Basic Medical Scien"},{"author_name":"Rachid El Jaoudi","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Imane Allali","author_inst":"Laboratory of Human Pathologies Biology, Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, and Genomic Center of Human Pathologies, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy, "},{"author_name":"Nabila Marchoudi","author_inst":"Anoual Laboratory of Radio-Immuno Analysis, Casablanca, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Jamal Fekkak","author_inst":"Anoual Laboratory of Radio-Immuno Analysis, Casablanca, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Houda Benrahma Sr.","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences (UM6SS), Casablanca, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Chakib Nejjari","author_inst":"International School of Public Health, Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences (UM6SS), Casablanca, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Saaid Amzazi","author_inst":"Laboratory of Human Pathologies Biology, Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, and Genomic Center of Human Pathologies, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy, "},{"author_name":"Lahcen Belyamani","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Military Hospital Mohammed V, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Azeddine Ibrahimi","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.27.20081505","rel_title":"Simulating a community mental health service during the COVID-19 pandemic: effects of clinician-clinician encounters, clinician-patient-family encounters, symptom-triggered protective behaviour, and household clustering","rel_date":"2020-05-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.27.20081505","rel_abs":"Background. Face-to-face healthcare, including psychiatric provision, must continue despite reduced interpersonal contact during the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus) pandemic. Community-based services might use domiciliary visits, consultations in healthcare settings, or remote consultations. Services might also alter direct contact between clinicians. Aims. We examined the effects of appointment types and clinician-clinician encounters upon infection rates. Methods. We modelled a COVID-19-like disease in a hypothetical community healthcare team, their patients, and patients' household contacts (family). In one condition, clinicians met patients and briefly met family (e.g. home visit or collateral history). In another, patients attended alone (e.g. clinic visit), segregated from each other. In another, face-to-face contact was eliminated (e.g. videoconferencing). We also varied clinician-clinician contact; baseline and ongoing \"external\" infection rates; whether overt symptoms reduced transmission risk behaviourally (e.g. via personal protective equipment, PPE); and household clustering. Results. Service organization had minimal effects on whole-population infection under our assumptions but materially affected clinician infection. Appointment type and inter-clinician contact had greater effects at low external infection rates and without a behavioural symptom response. Clustering magnified the effect of appointment type. We discuss infection control and other factors affecting appointment choice and team organization. Conclusions. Distancing between clinicians can have significant effects on team infection. Loss of clinicians to infection likely has an adverse impact on care, not modelled here. Appointments must account for clinical necessity as well as infection control. Interventions to reduce transmission risk can synergize, arguing for maximal distancing and behavioural measures (e.g. PPE) consistent with safe care.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rudolf Nicholas Cardinal","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK; Cambridgeshire & Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Caroline E Meiser-Stedman","author_inst":"Cambridgeshire & Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"David M Christmas","author_inst":"Cambridgeshire & Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Annabel C Price","author_inst":"Cambridgeshire & Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Chess Denman","author_inst":"Cambridgeshire & Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Benjamin R Underwood","author_inst":"Cambridgeshire & Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Chen Shanquan","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Soumya Nicholas Banerjee","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Simon R White","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Li Su","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Tamsin J.

Results: The mental health of young and middle-aged individuals was significantly worse than that of older individuals during the pandemic. There was also some indication that individuals who were not currently working were significantly more likely to report a high level of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Part-time and temporary contract-based workers were also more likely to suffer from depressive symptoms.

We developed an agent-based simulation model to project the infection spread. The model utilizes COVID19-specific parameters and data from Georgia on population interactions and demographics. The simulation study covered a seven and a half-month period, testing different social distancing scenarios, including baselines (no-intervention or school closure only) and combinations of shelter-in-place and voluntary quarantine with different timelines and compliance levels. The following outcomes are compared at the state and community levels: the number and percentage of cumulative and daily new symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, hospitalizations, and deaths; COVID19-related demand for hospital beds, ICU beds, and ventilators. The results suggest that shelter-in-place followed by voluntary quarantine reduced peak infections from approximately 180K under no intervention and 113K under school closure, respectively, to below 53K, and delayed the peak from April to July or later. Increasing shelter-in-place duration from four to five weeks yielded 2-9% and 3-11% decrease in cumulative infection and deaths, respectively. Regardless of the shelter-in-place duration, increasing voluntary quarantine compliance decreased daily new infections from almost 53K to 25K, and decreased cumulative infections by about 50%. The cumulative number of deaths ranged from 6,660 to 19,430 under different scenarios. Peak infection date varied across scenarios and counties; on average, increasing shelter-in-place duration delayed the peak day by 6 days. Overall, shelter-in-place followed by voluntary quarantine substantially reduced COVID19 infections, healthcare resource needs, and severe outcomes.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pinar Keskinocak","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Buse Eylul Oruc Aglar","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Arden Baxter","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"John Asplund","author_inst":"Department of Technology and Mathematics, Dalton State College, Dalton, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Nicoleta Serban","author_inst":"Georgia Institue of Technology"},{"author_name":"Benjamin R Underwood","author_inst":"Cambridgeshire & Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Chen Shanquan","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Soumya Nicholas Banerjee","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Simon R White","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Li Su","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Tamsin J.

The aim of this study was to derive and validate risk prediction models for poor outcome and death in adult inpatients with COVID-19. Methods Model derivation using data from Wuhan, China used logistic regression with death and poor outcome (death or severe disease) as outcomes. Predictors were demographic, comorbidity, symptom and laboratory test variables. The best performing models were externally validated in data from London, UK. Findings 4.3% of the derivation cohort (n=775) died and 9.7% had a poor outcome, compared to 34.1% and 42.9% of the validation cohort (n=226). In derivation, prediction models based on age, sex, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, platelet count, C-reactive protein and creatinine had excellent discrimination (death c-index=0.91, poor outcome c-index=0.88), with good-to-excellent calibration. Using two cut-offs to define low, high and very-high risk groups, derivation patients were stratified in groups with observed death rates of 0.34%, 15.0% and 28.3% and poor outcome rates 0.63%, 8.9% and 58.5%. External validation discrimination was good (c-index death=0.74, poor outcome=0.72) as was calibration. However, observed rates of death were 16.5%, 42.9% and 58.4% and poor outcome 26.3%, 28.4% and 64.8% in predicted low, high and very-high risk groups. Interpretation Our prediction model using demography and routinely-available laboratory tests performed very well in internal validation in the lower-risk derivation population, but less well in the much higher-risk external validation population. Further external validation is needed. Collaboration to create larger derivation datasets, and to rapidly externally validate all proposed prediction models in a range of populations is needed, before routine implementation of any risk prediction tool in clinical care.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Huayu Zhang","author_inst":"Centre for Medical Informatics, Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh, Scotland, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Ting Shi","author_inst":"Centre for Global Health, Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh, Scotland, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Wu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xin Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Peoples Liberation Army Joint Logistic Support Force 920th Hospital, Yunnan, China"},{"author_name":"Kun Wang","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Daniel Bean","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics and Health Informatics, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, Kings College London, London, England, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Richard Dobson","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics and Health Informatics, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, Kings College London, London, England, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"James T Teo","author_inst":"Department of Stroke and Neurology, Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, England, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Jiaxing Sun","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Pei Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Chenghong Li","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Wuhan Sixth Hospital, Jianghan University, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Kevin Dhaliwal","author_inst":"Centre for Inflammation Research, Queens Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh, Scotland, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Honghan Wu","author_inst":"Centre for Medical Informatics, Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh, Scotland, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Qiang Li","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Bruce Guthrie","author_inst":"Centre for Population Health Sciences, Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh, Scotland, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Chakib Nejjari","author_inst":"International School of Public Health, Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences (UM6SS), Casablanca, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Saaid Amzazi","author_inst":"Laboratory of Human Pathologies Biology, Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, and Genomic Center of Human Pathologies, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy, "},{"author_name":"Lahcen Belyamani","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Military Hospital Mohammed V, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."},{"author_name":"Azeddine Ibrahimi","author_inst":"Medical Biotechnology Laboratory (MedBiotech), Bioinova Research Center, Rabat Medical & Pharmacy School, Mohammed Vth University in Rabat, Morocco."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.28.20083246","rel_title":"Systematic investigations of COVID-19 in 283 cancer patients","rel_date":"2020-05-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.28.20083246","rel_abs":"Background: Cancer patients are considered to be highly susceptible to viral infections, however, the comprehensive features of COVID-19 in these patients remained largely unknown. The present study aimed to assess the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 in a large cohort of cancer patients. Design, Setting, and Participants: Data of consecutive cancer patients admitted to 33 designated hospitals for COVID-19 in Hubei province, China from December 17, 2019 to March 18, 2020 were retrospectively collected. The follow-up cutoff date was April 02, 2020. The clinical course and survival status of the cancer patients with COVID-19 were measured, and the potential risk factors of severe events and death were assessed through univariable and multivariable analyses. Results: A total of 283 laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients (50% male; median age, 63.0 years [IQR, 55.0 to 70.0]) with more than 20 cancer types were included. The overall mortality rate was 18% (50\/283), and the median hospitalization stay for the survivors was 26 days. Amongst all, 76 (27%) were former cancer patients with curative resections for over five years without recurrence. The current cancer patients exhibited worse outcomes versus former cancer patients (overall survival, HR=2.45, 95%CI 1.10 to 5.44, log-rank p=0.02; mortality rate, 21% vs 9%). Of the 207 current cancer patients, 95 (46%) have received recent anti-tumor treatment, and the highest mortality rate was observed in the patients receiving recent chemotherapy (33%), followed by surgery (26%), other anti-tumor treatments (19%), and no anti-tumor treatment (15%). In addition, a higher mortality rate was observed in patients with lymphohematopoietic malignancies (LHM) (53%, 9\/17), and all seven LHM patients with recent chemotherapy died. Multivariable analysis indicated that LHM (p=0.001) was one of the independent factors associating with critical illness or death. Conclusions: This is the first systematic study comprehensively depicting COVID-19 in a large cancer cohort. Patients with tumors, especially LHM, may have poorer prognosis of COVID-19. Additional cares are warranted and non-emergency anti-tumor treatment should be cautiously used for these patients under the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":45,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jie

threat to global health security. There are a very few prognostic models on CoVID-19 using machine learning. Objectives: To predict mortality among confirmed CoVID-19 patients in South Korea using machine learning and deploy the best performing algorithm as an open-source online prediction tool for decision-making. Materials and methods: Mortality for confirmed CoVID-19 patients (n=3,299) between January 20, 2020 and April 30, 2020 was predicted using five machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, support vector machine, K nearest neighbor, random forest and gradient boosting). Performance of the algorithms was compared, and the best performing algorithm was deployed as an online prediction tool. Results: The random forest algorithm was the best performer in terms of predictive ability (accuracy=0.981), discrimination (area under ROC curve=0.886), calibration (Matthews Correlation Coefficient=0.459; Brier Score=0.063) and. The best performer algorithm (random forest) was deployed as the online CoVID-19 Community Mortality Risk Prediction tool named CoCoMoRP (https:\/\/ashis-das.shinyapps.io\/CoCoMoRP\/). Conclusions: We describe the development and deployment of an open-source machine learning tool to predict mortality risk among CoVID-19 confirmed patients using publicly available surveillance data. This tool can be utilized by potential stakeholders such as health providers and policy makers to triage patients at the community level in addition to other approaches.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"ASHIS DAS","author_inst":"The World Bank"},{"author_name":"Shiba Mishra","author_inst":"Credit Suisse Private

Diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection (mostly RT-PCR and Computed Tomography) are not widely available in numerous countries, expensive and with imperfect performance Methods: This multicenter retrospective study aimed to determine a pre-test probability score for SARS-CoV-2 infection based on clinical and biological variables. Patients were recruited from emergency and infectious disease departments and were divided into a training and a validation cohort. Demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, and results of blood tests (complete white blood cell count, serum electrolytes and CRP) were collected. The pre-test probability score was derived from univariate analyses between patients and controls, followed by multivariate binary logistic analysis to determine the independent variables associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Points were assigned to each variable to create the PARIS score. ROC curve analysis determined the area under the curve (AUC) Findings: One hundred subjects with clinical suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the training cohort, and 300 other consecutive individuals were included in the validation cohort. Low lymphocyte (<1.3 G\/L), eosinophil (<0.06G\/L), basophil (<0.04G\/L) and neutrophil counts (<5G\/L) were associated with a high probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection. No clinical variable was statistically significant. The score had a good performance in the validation cohort (AUC=0.889 (CI: [0.846-0.932]; STD=0.022) with a sensitivity and Positive Predictive Value of high-probability score of 80.3% and 92.3% respectively. Furthermore, a low-probability score excluded SARS-CoV-2 infection with a Negative Predictive Value of 99.5% Interpretation: The PARIS score based on complete white blood cell count has a good performance to categorize the pre-test probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection. It could help clinicians avoid diagnostic tests in patients with a low-probability score and conversely keep on testing individuals with high-probability score but negative RT-PCR or CT. It could prove helpful in countries with a low-availability of PCR and\/or CT during the current period of pandemic","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mickael

pandemic is an unprecedented global challenge. Highly variable in its presentation, spread and clinical outcome, novel point-of-care diagnostic classifiers are urgently required. Here, we describe a set of COVID-19 clinical classifiers discovered using a newly designed low-cost high-throughput mass spectrometry-based platform. Introducing a new sample preparation pipeline coupled with short-gradient high-flow liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, our methodology facilitates clinical implementation and increases sample throughput and quantification precision. Providing a rapid assessment of serum or plasma samples at scale, we report 27 biomarkers that distinguish mild and severe forms of COVID-19, of which some may have potential as therapeutic targets. These proteins highlight the role of complement factors, the coagulation system, inflammation modulators as well as pro-inflammatory signalling upstream and downstream of Interleukin 6. Application of novel methodologies hence transforms proteomics from a research tool into a rapid-response, clinically actionable technology adaptable to infectious outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":32,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christoph B.

In this study we objecti-fied and quantified the magnitude and underreporting of the smelling dysfunction caused by COVID-19 using a standardized test. Methods: We conducted a prospective cross-sectional study comparing the proportion of anos-mia using Sniffin-sticks in those reporting a loss of smell, in those who did not as well as in unin-fected controls. The outcome of anosmic versus not anosmic patients were recorded during hospital stay and at day 15 on a six-category ordinal scale. The study was approved by the insti-tutional review board, all participants consented to the study. Results: 40% of 45 consecutive hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 0% of 45 uninfected con-trols consenting were diagnosed with anosmia. 44% of anosmic and 50% of hyposmic patients did not report having smelling problems. Anosmia or hyposmia was not predictive of a severe COVID-19 manifestation. Conclusions: The majority of COVID-19 patients have an objective anosmia and hyposmia, which often occurs unnoticed. These symptoms may be related to the neuroinvasive propensity of SARS-COV-2 and the unusual presentation of COVID-19 disease manifestations.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel Hornuss","author_inst":"Section of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine II, Medical Center, University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Berit Lange","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Nils Schroeter","author_inst":"Department of Neurology and Neurophysiology, Medical Center, University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Siegbert Rieg","author_inst":"Section of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine II, Medical Center, University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Winfried V.

At the current time a number of qRT-PCR assays have been developed to identify SARS-CoV-2, targeting multiple positions in the viral genome. While the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is moderate, given the large number of transmission chains it is prudent to monitor circulating viruses for variants that might compromise these assays. Here we report the identification of a C-to-T transition at position 26,340 of the SARS-CoV-2 genome which is associated with failure of the cobas SARS-CoV-2 E-gene qRT-PCR in eight patients. As the cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay targets two positions in the genome, the individuals carrying this variant were still called as SARS-CoV-2 positive. Whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 showed all to carry closely related viruses. Examination of viral genomes deposited on GISAID showed this mutation has arisen independently at least four times. This work highlights the necessity of monitoring SARS-CoV-2 for the emergence of SNPs which might adversely affect RT-PCRs used in diagnostics. Additionally, it argues that two regions in SARS-CoV-2 should be targeted to avoid false negatives.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria Artesi","author_inst":"University of Li\u00e8ge"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Bontems","author_inst":"University Hospital of Li\u00e8ge"},{"author_name":"Paul Gobbels","author_inst":"St-Nikolaus Hospital, Eupen"},{"author_name":"Marc Franckh","author_inst":"St-Nikolaus Hospital"},{"author_name":"Piet Maes","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Raphael Boreux","author_inst":"University Hospital of Li\u00e8ge"},{"author_name":"Cecile Meex","author_inst":"University Hospital of Li\u00e8ge"},{"author_name":"Pierrette Melin","author_inst":"University Hospital of Li\u00e8ge"},{"author_name":"Marie-Pierre Hayette","author_inst":"University Hospital of Li\u00e8ge"},{"author_name":"Vincent Bours","author_inst":"University of Li\u00e8ge"},{"author_name":"Keith Durkin","author_inst":"University of Li\u00e8ge"},{"author_name":"Christiane Kilian","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin, Department of Biochemistry, 10117 Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Federica Agostini","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin, Department of Biochemistry, 10117 Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Aleksej Zelezniak","author_inst":"Department of Biology and Biological Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg SE-412 96, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Thibeault","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin, Berlin, Dept. of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, 10117 Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Moritz Pfeiffer","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin, Berlin, Dept. of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, 10117 Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Stefan Hippenstiel","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin, Berlin, Dept. of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, 10117 Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Hocke","author_inst":"Charite Universitaetsmedizin, Berlin, Dept. of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Medicine, 10117 Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Christof von Kalle","author_inst":"Berlin Institute of Health (BIH), and  Charite Universitaetsmedizin, Clinical Study Center (CSC), 10117 Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Archie Campbell","author_inst":"Centre for Genomic and Experimental Medicine, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh United Kingdom and Usher Institute, Universi"},{"author_name":"Caroline Hayward","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH4 2XU, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"David J.

We have performed deep characterization of B cell responses through high-dimensional flow cytometry to reveal substantial heterogeneity in both effector and immature populations. More notably, critically ill patients displayed hallmarks of extrafollicular B cell activation as previously described in autoimmune settings. Extrafollicular activation correlated strongly with large antibody secreting cell expansion and early production of high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Yet, these patients fared poorly with elevated inflammatory biomarkers, multi-organ failure, and death. Combined, the findings strongly indicate a major pathogenic role for immune activation in subsets of COVID-19 patients. Our study suggests that, as in autoimmunity, targeted immunomodulatory therapy may be beneficial in specific patient subpopulations that can be identified by careful immune profiling.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matthew Woodruff","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Richard Ramonell","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Kevin Cashman","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Doan Nguyen","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Ankur Saini","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Natalie Haddad","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Ariel Ley","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Shuya Kyu","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"J.
