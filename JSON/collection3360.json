Tmprss1, Tmprss3, and Tmprss5 are expressed in the spiral ganglion neurons and the organ of Corti in the inner ear; however, Ace2, Tmprss2, and Furin expression profiles in the middle ear remain unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze Ace2, Tmprss2, and Furin expression in the middle and inner ear of mice.\n\nStudy DesignAnimal research.\n\nSettingDepartment of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, University of Tokyo.\n\nMethodsWe performed immunohistochemical analysis to examine the distribution of Ace2, Tmprss2, and Furin in the eustachian tube, middle ear space, and cochlea of mice.\n\nResultsAce2 was expressed in the cytoplasm in the middle ear epithelium, eustachian tube epithelium, stria vascularis, and spiral ganglion.

Protein S binds to angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2, ACE2, of the host cell, followed by proteolysis of the spike protein, drastic protein conformational change with exposure of the fusion peptide of the virus, and entry of the virion into the host cell. The structural elements that govern conformational plasticity of the spike protein are largely unknown. Here, we present a methodology that relies upon graph and centrality analyses, augmented by bioinformatics, to identify and characterize large H-bond clusters in protein structures. We apply this methodology to protein S ectodomain and find that, in the closed conformation, the three protomers of protein S bring the same contribution to an extensive central network of H-bonds, has a relatively large H-bond cluster at the receptor binding domain, and a cluster near a protease cleavage site. Markedly different H-bonding at these three clusters in open and pre-fusion conformations suggest dynamic H-bond clusters could facilitate structural plasticity and selection of a protein S protomer for binding to the host receptor, and proteolytic cleavage. From analyses of spike protein sequences we identify patches of histidine and carboxylate groups that could be involved in transient proton binding.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Konstantine Karathanou","author_inst":"Freie Universitaet Berlin, Department of Physics, Theoretical Molecular Biophysics"},{"author_name":"Michalis Lazaratos","author_inst":"Freie Universitaet Berlin, Department of Physics, Theoretical Molecular Biophysics Group"},{"author_name":"Eva Bertalan","author_inst":"Freie Universitaet Berlin, Department of Physics, Theoretical Molecular Biophysics"},{"author_name":"Malte Siemers","author_inst":"Freie Universitaet Berlin, Department of Physics, Theoretical Molecular Biophysics Group"},{"author_name":"Krzysztof Buzar","author_inst":"Freie Universitaet Berlin, Department of Physics, Theoretical Molecular Biophysics Group"},{"author_name":"Gebhard F.X.

Here we report a nanoluciferase SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2-Nluc) that is genetically stable and replicates similarly to the wild-type virus in cell culture. We demonstrate that the optimized reporter virus assay in Vero E6 cells can be used to measure neutralizing antibody activity in patient sera and produces results in concordance with a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Compared with the low-throughput PRNT (3 days), the SARS-CoV-2-Nluc assay has substantially shorter turnaround time (5 hours) with a high-throughput testing capacity. Thus, the assay can be readily deployed for large-scale vaccine evaluation and neutralizing antibody testing in humans. Additionally, we developed a high-throughput antiviral assay using SARS-CoV-2-Nluc infection of A549 cells expressing human ACE2 receptor (A549-hACE2). When tested against this reporter virus, remdesivir exhibited substantially more potent activity in A549-hACE2 cells compared to Vero E6 cells (EC50 0.115 vs 1.28 M), while this difference was not observed for chloroquine (EC50 1.32 vs 3.52 M), underscoring the importance of selecting appropriate cells for antiviral testing. Using the optimized SARS-CoV-2-Nluc assay, we evaluated a collection of approved and investigational antivirals and other anti-infective drugs. Nelfinavir, rupintrivir, and cobicistat were identified as the most selective inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2-Nluc (EC50 0.77 to 2.74 M). In contrast, most of the clinically approved antivirals, including tenofovir alafenamide, emtricitabine, sofosbuvir, ledipasvir, and velpatasvir were inactive at concentrations up to 10 M. Collectively, this high-throughput platform represents a reliable tool for rapid neutralization testing and antiviral screening for SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pei-Yong Shi","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Xuping Xie","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Antonio E.

Immunofluorescence staining of human tissues revealed a prominent expression of CD209L in the lung and kidney epithelial and endothelial cells of small and medium-sized vessels, whereas CD209 was detected only in a limited number of cell types.

Consequently, much research has gone into the development of pre-clinical assays for the discovery of new or repurposing of FDA-approved therapies. Preventing viral entry into a host cell would be an effective antiviral strategy. One mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 entry occurs when the spike protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 binds to an ACE2 receptor followed by cleavage at two cut sites (\"priming\") that causes a conformational change allowing for viral and host membrane fusion. TMPRSS2 has an extracellular protease domain capable of cleaving the spike protein to initiate membrane fusion. A validated inhibitor of TMPRSS2 protease activity would be a valuable tool for studying the impact TMPRSS2 has in viral entry and potentially be an effective antiviral therapeutic. To enable inhibitor discovery and profiling of FDA-approved therapeutics, we describe an assay for the biochemical screening of recombinant TMPRSS2 suitable for high throughput application. We demonstrate effectiveness to quantify inhibition down to subnanomolar concentrations by assessing the inhibition of camostat, nafamostat and gabexate, clinically approved agents in Japan. Also, we profiled a camostat metabolite, FOY-251, and bromhexine hydrochloride, an FDA-approved mucolytic cough suppressant. The rank order potency for the compounds tested are: nafamostat (IC50 = 0.27 nM), camostat (IC50 = 6.2 nM), FOY-251 (IC50 = 33.3 nM) and gabexate (IC50 = 130 nM). Bromhexine hydrochloride showed no inhibition of TMPRSS2. Further profiling of camostat, nafamostat and gabexate against a panel of recombinant proteases provides insight into selectivity and potency.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jonathan H.

Yields of biotin-labeled probes from transient transfection ranged from [~]0.5 mg\/L for the complete ectodomain to >5 mg\/L for several subregions. Probes were characterized for antigenicity and ACE2 recognition, and the structure of the spike ectodomain probe was determined by cryo-electron microscopy.

Beyond the lung, COVID-19 impacts diverse tissues including the kidney. ACE2 is a key member of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) which regulates blood pressure, largely through its effects on the kidney. RAAS blockers such as ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs) are widely used therapies for hypertension, cardiovascular and chronic kidney diseases, and therefore, there is intense interest in their effect on ACE2 expression and its implications for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity. Here, we analyzed single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq of human kidney to interrogate the association of ACEi\/ARB use with ACE2 expression in specific cell types. First, we performed an integrated analysis aggregating 176,421 cells across 49 donors, 8 studies and 8 centers, and adjusting for sex, age, donor and center effects, to assess the relationship of ACE2 with age and sex at baseline. We observed a statistically significant increase in ACE2 expression in tubular epithelial cells of the thin loop of Henle (tLoH) in males relative to females at younger ages, the trend reversing, and losing significance with older ages. ACE2 expression in tLoH increases with age in females, with an opposite, weak effect in males. In an independent cohort, we detected a statistically significant increase in ACE2 expression with ACEi\/ARB use in epithelial cells of the proximal tubule and thick ascending limb, and endothelial cells, but the association was confounded in this small cohort by the underlying disease. Our study illuminates the dynamics of ACE2 expression in specific kidney cells, with implications for SARS-CoV-2 entry and pathogenicity.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ayshwarya Subramanian","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Katherine Vernon","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Michal Slyper","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Julia Waldman","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Malte D Luecken","author_inst":"Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen"},{"author_name":"Kirk Gosik","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Dan Dubinsky","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Michael S Cuoco","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Jason Purnell","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Lan Nguyen","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Danielle Dionne","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Orit Rozenblatt-Rosen","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"- Human Cell Atlas Lung Biological Network","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Aviv Regev","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Anna Greka","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Ahmed S.

As other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is enveloped, replicates in the cytoplasm and assembles at intracellular membranes. Here, we structurally characterize the viral replication compartment and report critical insights into the budding mechanism of the virus, and the structure of extracellular virions close to their native state by in situ cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging. We directly visualized RNA filaments inside the double membrane vesicles, compartments associated with viral replication. The RNA filaments show a diameter consistent with double-stranded RNA and frequent branching likely representing RNA secondary structures. We found that assembled S trimers in lumenal cisternae do not alone induce membrane bending but laterally reorganize on the envelope during virion assembly. The viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs) are accumulated at the curved membrane characteristic for budding sites suggesting that vRNP recruitment is enhanced by membrane curvature. Subtomogram averaging shows that vRNPs are distinct cylindrical assemblies. We propose that the genome is packaged around multiple separate vRNP complexes, thereby allowing incorporation of the unusually large coronavirus genome into the virion while maintaining high steric flexibility between the vRNPs.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Steffen Klein","author_inst":"Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Mirko Cortese","author_inst":"Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Sophie L.

However, an analogous insertion was present in the Spike protein of the more distant Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus MERS-CoV. We show that a crucial third arginine at the left middle position, comprising a motif RRxR is required for furin recognition in vitro, while the general motif RxxR in common with MERS-CoV is not sufficient for cleavage. Further, we describe a surprising finding that the two serines at the edges of the insert SPRRAR{downarrow}SV can be efficiently phosphorylated by proline-directed and basophilic protein kinases. Both phosphorylations switch off furins ability to cleave the site.

For fruitful and rapid investigation of viral pathomechanisms, a collaborative and interdisciplinary approach is required. Therefore, we have developed ViralLink: a systems biology workflow which reconstructs and analyses networks representing the effect of viruses on intracellular signalling. These networks trace the flow of signal from intracellular viral proteins through their human binding proteins and downstream signalling pathways, ending with transcription factors regulating genes differentially expressed upon viral exposure. In this way, the workflow provides a mechanistic insight from previously identified knowledge of virally infected cells. By default, the workflow is set up to analyse the intracellular effects of SARS-CoV-2, requiring only transcriptomics counts data as input from the user: thus, encouraging and enabling rapid multidisciplinary research. However, the wide-ranging applicability and modularity of the workflow facilitates customisation of viral context, a priori interactions and analysis methods. Through a case study of SARS-CoV-2 infected bronchial\/tracheal epithelial cells, we evidence the functionality of the workflow and its ability to identify key pathways and proteins in the cellular response to infection. The application of ViralLink to different viral infections in a cell-type specific manner using different available transcriptomics datasets will uncover key mechanisms in viral pathogenesis. The workflow is available on GitHub (https:\/\/github.com\/korcsmarosgroup\/ViralLink) in an easily accessible Python wrapper script, or as customisable modular R and Python scripts.Author summary Collaborative and multidisciplinary science provides increased value for experimental datasets and speeds the process of discovery. Such ways of working are especially important at present due to the urgency of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Here, we present a systems biology workflow which models the effect of viral proteins on the infected host cell, to aid collaborative and multidisciplinary research. Through integration of gene expression datasets with context-specific and context-agnostic molecular interaction datasets, the workflow can be easily applied to different datasets as they are made available. Application to diverse SARS-CoV-2 datasets will increase our understanding of the mechanistic details of the infection at a cell type specific level, aid drug target discovery and help explain the variety of clinical manifestations of the infection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Agatha Treveil","author_inst":"Earlham Institute \/ Quadram Institute"},{"author_name":"Balazs Bohar","author_inst":"Earlham Institute \/ Eotvos Lorand University"},{"author_name":"Padhmanand Sudhakar","author_inst":"Earlham Institute \/ Quadram Institute \/ KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Lejla Gul","author_inst":"Earlham Institute"},{"author_name":"Luca Csabai","author_inst":"Earlham Institute \/ Eotvos Lorand University"},{"author_name":"Marton Olbei","author_inst":"Earlham Institute \/ Quadram Institute"},{"author_name":"Martina Poletti","author_inst":"Earlham Institute \/ Quadram Institute"},{"author_name":"Matthew Madgwick","author_inst":"Earlham Institute \/ Quadram Institute"},{"author_name":"Tahila Andrighetti","author_inst":"Earlham Institute \/ Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Hautefort","author_inst":"Earlham Institute"},{"author_name":"Dezso Modos","author_inst":"Earlham Institute \/ Quadram Institute"},{"author_name":"Tamas Korcsmaros","author_inst":"Earlham Institute \/ Quadram Institute"},{"author_name":"- Human Cell Atlas Lung Biological Network","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Aviv Regev","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Anna Greka","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Ahmed S.

The mutations Spike_D614G and NSP12_P323L were present in all the 22 analyzed sequences, followed by N_G204R and N_R203K which occurred in 9 among the 22 sequences. The mutations NSP10_R134S, NSP15_D335N, NSP16_I169L, NSP3_L431H, NSP3_P1292L and Spike_V6F occurred one time in our sequences with no record in other sequence worldwide. These mutations should be investigated to figure out their potential effects on all around the world virulence. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that Moroccan SARS-CoV-2 genomes included 9 viruses pertaining to clade 20A, 9 to clade 20B and 2 to clade 20C. This finding suggest that the epidemic spread in Morocco did not show a predominant SARS-CoV-2 route. For multiple and unrelated introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Morocco via different routes have occurred, giving rise to the diversity of virus genomes in the country. Furthermore, very likely, the SARS-CoV-2 virus circulated in cryptic way in Morocco starting from the fifteen January before the discovering of the first case the second of March.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bouabid Badaoui Sr.","author_inst":"Mohamed V University in Rabat"},{"author_name":"Khalid Sadki Sr.","author_inst":"Mohamed V University in Rabat"},{"author_name":"Chouhra Talbi Sr.","author_inst":"Mohamed V University in Rabat"},{"author_name":"Lina Tazi Sr.","author_inst":"Mohamed V University in Rabat"},{"author_name":"Driss Salah Sr.","author_inst":"Mohamed V University in Rabat"},{"author_name":"Marton Olbei","author_inst":"Earlham Institute \/ Quadram Institute"},{"author_name":"Martina Poletti","author_inst":"Earlham Institute \/ Quadram Institute"},{"author_name":"Matthew Madgwick","author_inst":"Earlham Institute \/ Quadram Institute"},{"author_name":"Tahila Andrighetti","author_inst":"Earlham Institute \/ Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Hautefort","author_inst":"Earlham Institute"},{"author_name":"Dezso Modos","author_inst":"Earlham Institute \/ Quadram Institute"},{"author_name":"Tamas Korcsmaros","author_inst":"Earlham Institute \/ Quadram Institute"},{"author_name":"- Human Cell Atlas Lung Biological Network","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Aviv Regev","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Anna Greka","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Ahmed S.

There is now an established secondary syndrome of COVID-19 characterised by thrombosis, vascular dysfunction and hypertension, seen in those most severely affected. Advancing age in adults is the single most significant risk factor for hospitalisation and death with COVID-19. In light of the cardiovascular\/thrombotic sequalae associated with severe COVID-19 disease and the overwhelming risk that increased age carries, in this study, our aim was to obtain mechanistic insight by interrogating gene expression profiles in cardiovascular tissues and cells. Our focus was on the two putative receptors for SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 and BSG along with a selected range of genes thought to be involved in virus binding\/processing. In this study we have made four important observations: (i)Cardiovascular tissues and\/or endothelial cells express the required genes for SARS-CoV-2 infection, (ii) SASR-CoV-2 receptor pathways, ACE2\/TMPRSS2 and BSG\/PPIB(A) polarise to lung\/epithelium and vessel\/endothelium respectively, (iii) expression of SARS-CoV-2 host genes are, on the whole, relatively stable with age and (iv) notable exceptions were ACE2 which decreases with age in some tissues and BSG which increases with age in endothelial cells. Our data support the idea that that BSG is the dominate pathway utilised by SARS-CoV-2 in endothelial cells and are the first to demonstrate a positive correlation with age. We suggest BSG expression in the vasculature is a critical driver which explains the heightened risk of severe disease and death observed in those >40 years of age. Since BSG is utilised by other pathogens our findings have implications beyond the current pandemic. Finally, because BSG is functions in a range of cardiovascular diseases and fibrosis, our observations may have relevance to our understanding of the diseases associated with aging.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Blerina Ahmetaj-Shala","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ricky-Kumar Vaja","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Santosh S Atanur","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Peter M George","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Nicholas S Kirkby","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jane A.

Their tropism is primarily determined by the ability of the spike (S) protein to bind to a host cell surface receptor. The rapid outbreak of emerging novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV 2 in China inculcates the need for the development of hasty and effective intervention strategies. Medicinal plants and natural compounds have been traditionally used to treat viral infections. Here, we generated VSV based pseudotyped viruses (pvs) of SARS-, MERS-, and SARS-2 CoVs to screen entry inhibitors from natural products. In the first series of experiments, we demonstrated that pseudotyped viruses specifically bind on their receptors and enter into the cells. SARS and MERS polyclonal antibodies neutralize SARSpv and SARS-2pv, and MERSpv respectively. Incubation of soluble ACE2 inhibited entry of SARS and SARS-2 pvs but not MERSpv. In addition, expression of ACE2 and DPP4 in non-permissive BHK21 cells enabled infection by SARSpv, SARS-2pv, and MERSpv respectively. Next, we showed the antiviral properties of known enveloped virus entry inhibitors, Spirulina and Green tea extracts against CoVpvs. SARSpv, MERSpv, and SARS-2pv entry were blocked with higher efficiency when preincubated with either green tea or spirulina extracts. Green tea provided a better inhibitory effect than the spirulina extracts by binding to the S1 domain of spike and blocking the interaction of spike with its receptor. Further studies are required to understand the exact mechanism of viral inhibition. In summary, we demonstrate that pseudotyped virus is an ideal tool for screening viral entry inhibitors. Moreover, spirulina and green tea could be promising antiviral agents against emerging viruses.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jeswin Joseph","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India"},{"author_name":"Karthika Thankamani","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India"},{"author_name":"Ariya Ajay","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India"},{"author_name":"Valiyathara Rajan Akshay Das","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India"},{"author_name":"Victor Stalin Raj","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India"},{"author_name":"Jane A.

This has impeded our ability to accurately track the emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the availability of unprecedented numbers of SARS-CoV-2 genomes on a global scale, evolutionary reconstructions are hindered by the slow accumulation of sequence divergence over its relatively short transmission history. When confronted with these issues, incorporating additional contextual data may critically inform phylodynamic reconstructions. Here, we present a new approach to integrate individual travel history data in Bayesian phylogeographic inference and apply it to the early spread of SARS-CoV-2, while also including global air transportation data. We demonstrate that including travel history data for each SARS-CoV-2 genome yields more realistic reconstructions of virus spread, particularly when travelers from undersampled locations are included to mitigate sampling bias. We further explore methods to ameliorate the impact of sampling bias by augmenting the phylogeographic analysis with lineages from undersampled locations in the analyses. Our reconstructions reinforce specific transmission hypotheses suggested by the inclusion of travel history data, but also suggest alternative routes of virus migration that are plausible within the epidemiological context but are not apparent with current sampling efforts. Although further research is needed to fully examine the performance of our travel-aware phylogeographic analyses with unsampled diversity and to further improve them, they represent multiple new avenues for directly addressing the colossal issue of sample bias in phylogeographic inference.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Philippe Lemey","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Samuel Hong","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Verity Hill","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Guy Baele","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Chiara Poletto","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Vittoria Colizza","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"John T McCrone","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Kristian G Andersen","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Michael Worobey","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Martha I Nelson","author_inst":"Fogarty International Center"},{"author_name":"Andrew Rambaut","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Marc A.

To study the effect of COVID-19, we varied the heart rate, the contractility and the pulmonary resistances in suitable ranges.\n\nResultsOur computations on individuals with both otherwise normal and impaired cardiac functions revealed that COVID-19 worsen cardiac function, as shown by a decrease of some cardiac biomarkers values such as cardiac output and ejection fraction. In the case of existing impaired cardiac function, the presence of COVID-19 lead to values outside the normal ranges.\n\nConclusionsComputational models revealed to be an effective tool to study the effect of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system. Such effect could be significant for patients with impaired cardiac function. This is especially useful to perform a sensitivity analysis of the hemodynamics for different conditions.\n\nCONDENSED ABSTRACTEmerging studies address how COVID-19 infection might impact the cardiovascular system. This relates particularly to the development of myocardial injury, acute coronary syndrome, myocarditis, arrhythmia, and heart failure. Prospective treatment approach is advised for these patients. By the assessment of conventional important biomarkers obtained with new sources as a 0-dimentional computational model, we propose a new study protocol as an effective method to evaluate short-term prognosis. The clinical protocol proposed will help to rapidly identify which patients require intensive monitoring, diagnostic strategy and most adequate therapy.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Francesco Regazzoni","author_inst":"MOX, Dipartimento di Matematica, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Christian Vergara","author_inst":"MOX, Dipartimento di Matematica, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy and LABS, Dipartimento di Chimica, Materiali e Ingegneria Chimica, Politecnico di Milano, M"},{"author_name":"Paolo Zunino","author_inst":"MOX, Dipartimento di Matematica, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marco Guglielmo","author_inst":"Centro Cardiologico Monzino IRCSS, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Roberto Scrofani","author_inst":"Ospedale L.

We aimed to describe the characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 antibody negative probable COVID-19 patients and give some suggestions to manage suspected COVID-19 patients. Methods We analyzed 616 confirmed COVID-19 patients and 35 SARS-CoV-2 antibody negative probable COVID-19 patients who were admitted in Wuhan Union Hospital from February 13, 2020 to February 16, 2020. Telephone interviews were conducted and medical records were reviewed for epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and radiographic data. Results Of the 35 SARS-CoV-2 antibody negative probable COVID-19 patients, all of them had tested at least 3 times of nucleic acid, 3 were believed to be non-SARS-CoV-2 infection. Compared with confirmed patients, antibody negative probable patients were younger (P=0.017), exhibited similar symptoms and chest CT images, had higher lymphocyte count (P=0.004) and albumin level (P<0.001), showed lower lactate dehydrogenase level (P=0.011) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P<0.001). During hospitalization, all the 35 patients had contacted with confirmed COVID-19 patients, but all used general face mask for protection and maintained a social distance of more than one meter from each other. All the isolation wards were kept ventilation and disinfected once a day. After discharged from hospital, all of them had negative nucleic acid tests and no one developed symptoms again. Conclusions The conditions of patients with AbN probable COVID-19 were less critical than those of patients with confirmed COVID-19. Room ventilation and daily disinfection, wearing face masks, and maintaining social distance might be helpful to prevent patients from hospital acquired COVID-19 infection.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Limin Duan","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, NHC Key Laboratory of Pulmonary Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of S"},{"author_name":"Shuai Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, NHC Key Laboratory of Pulmonary Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of S"},{"author_name":"Mengfei Guo","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, NHC Key Laboratory of Pulmonary Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of S"},{"author_name":"E Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, NHC Key Laboratory of Pulmonary Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of S"},{"author_name":"Jinshuo Fan","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, NHC Key Laboratory of Pulmonary Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of S"},{"author_name":"Xuan Wang","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, NHC Key Laboratory of Pulmonary Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of S"},{"author_name":"Ling Wang","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Feng Wu","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, NHC Key Laboratory of Pulmonary Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of S"},{"author_name":"Yang Jin","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jean-Luc Canivet","author_inst":"University Hospital of Liege"},{"author_name":"Andrew Rambaut","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Marc A.

We wanted to see which contribution public health variables make in addition to health systems, health, and population variables to explain Covid-19 cases and deaths Method: We modelled the relationship of various predictors (health systems variables, population and population health indicators) together with variables indicating public health measures (school closures, border closures, country lockdown) in 40 European and other countries, using Generalized Linear Models and minimized information criteria to select the best fitting and most parsimonious models. Results: We fitted two models with log-linearly linked variables on gamma-distributed outome variables (CoV2 cases and Covid-19 related deaths, standardized on population). CoV2-cases were best predicted by number of tests (b = 2*10-7, p =.00005), life-expectancy in a country (b = 0.19, p < .000001), and border closure (b = -0.93, p = .001). Population standardized deaths were best predicted by time, the virus had been in the country (b = 0.02, p = .02), life expectancy (b = 0.2, p = .000005), smoking (b = -0.08, p = .00001), and school closures (b = 2.54, p = .0001). Model fit statistics and model adequacy were good (model 1: Chi2\/DF = 0.43; model 2: Chi2\/DF = 0.88). Discussion and Interpretation: Only few variables were good predictors. Of the public health variables only border closure had the potential of preventing cases and none were predictors for preventing deaths. School closures, likely as a proxy for social distancing in severely ill patients, was associated with increased deaths. Conclusion: The pandemic seems to run its autonomous course and only border closure has the potential to prevent cases. None of them contributes to preventing deaths.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Harald Walach","author_inst":"Poznan University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Stefan Hockertz","author_inst":"tpi consult, Bollschweil, Germany"},{"author_name":"Mengfei Guo","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, NHC Key Laboratory of Pulmonary Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of S"},{"author_name":"E Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, NHC Key Laboratory of Pulmonary Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of S"},{"author_name":"Jinshuo Fan","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, NHC Key Laboratory of Pulmonary Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of S"},{"author_name":"Xuan Wang","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, NHC Key Laboratory of Pulmonary Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of S"},{"author_name":"Ling Wang","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Feng Wu","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, NHC Key Laboratory of Pulmonary Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of S"},{"author_name":"Yang Jin","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jean-Luc Canivet","author_inst":"University Hospital of Liege"},{"author_name":"Andrew Rambaut","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Marc A.

We analyze the numbers of infected people who tested positive (cases) in selected eleven countries (Japan, USA, Russia, Brazil, China, Italy, Indonesia, Spain,South Korea, UK, and Sweden). By using the double exponential function called the Gompertz function, fG(x)=exp(-e-x), the number of cases is well described as N(t)=N0 fG({gamma}(t-t0)), where N0, {gamma} and t0 are the final number of cases, the damping rate of the infection probability and the peak time of the daily number of new cases, dN(t)\/dt, respectively. The scaled data of cases in most of the analyzed countries are found to collapse onto a common scaling function fG(x) with x={gamma}(t-t0) being the scaling variable in the range of fG(x) {+\/-} 0.05. The recently proposed indicator so-called the K value, the increasing rate of cases in one week, is also found to show universal behavior. The mechanism for the Gompertz function to appear is discussed from the time dependence of the produced pion numbers in nucleus-nucleus collisions, which is also found to be described by the Gompertz function.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Akira Ohnishi","author_inst":"Yukawa Institute for Theretical Physics, Kyoto University"},{"author_name":"Yusuke Namekawa","author_inst":"Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics, Kyoto University"},{"author_name":"Tokuro Fukui","author_inst":"Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics, Kyoto University"},{"author_name":"E Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, NHC Key Laboratory of Pulmonary Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of S"},{"author_name":"Jinshuo Fan","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, NHC Key Laboratory of Pulmonary Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of S"},{"author_name":"Xuan Wang","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, NHC Key Laboratory of Pulmonary Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of S"},{"author_name":"Ling Wang","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Feng Wu","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, NHC Key Laboratory of Pulmonary Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of S"},{"author_name":"Yang Jin","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jean-Luc Canivet","author_inst":"University Hospital of Liege"},{"author_name":"Andrew Rambaut","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Marc A.

To understand how host responses contribute to COVID-19 pathophysiology, we used a multi-omics approach to identify molecular markers in peripheral blood and plasma samples that distinguish COVID-19 patients experiencing a range of disease severities. A large number of expressed genes, proteins, metabolites and extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) were identified that exhibited strong associations with various clinical parameters. Multiple sets of tissue-specific proteins and exRNAs varied significantly in both mild and severe patients, indicative of multi-organ damage. The continuous activation of IFN-I signalling and neutrophils, as well as a high level of inflammatory cytokines, were observed in severe disease patients. In contrast, COVID-19 in mild patients was characterised by robust T cell responses. Finally, we show that some of expressed genes, proteins and exRNAs can be used as biomarkers to predict the clinical outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data refine our understanding of the pathophysiology and clinical progress of COVID-19 and will help guide future studies in this area.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yan-Mei Chen","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and

After its arrival in South America in February 2020 the virus has expanded throughout the region infecting over 900,000 individuals with approximately 41,000 reported deaths to date. In response to the rapidly growing number of cases, a number of different primer-probe sets have been developed. However, despite being highly specific most of these primer-probe sets are known to exhibit variable sensitivity. Currently, there are more than 700 SARS-CoV2 whole genome sequences deposited in databases from Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Colombia, Uruguay, Peru and Argentina. To test how regional viral diversity may impact oligo binding sites and affect test performance, we reviewed all available primer-probe sets targeting the E, N and RdRp genes against available South American SARS-CoV-2 genomes checking for nucleotide variations in annealing sites. Results from this in silico analysis showed no nucleotide variations on the E-gene target region, in contrast to the N and RdRp genes which showed massive nucleotide variations within oligo binding sites. In lines with previous data, our results suggest that E-gene stands as the most conserved and reliable target when considering single-gene target testing for molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in South America.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Juan David Ramirez","author_inst":"Universidad del Rosario"},{"author_name":"Marina Munoz","author_inst":"Universidad del Rosario"},{"author_name":"Carolina Hernandez","author_inst":"Universidad del Rosario"},{"author_name":"Carolina Florez","author_inst":"Universidad del Rosario"},{"author_name":"Sergio Gomez","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Angelica Rico","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Lisseth Pardo","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Esther C Barros","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Alberto Paniz-Mondolfi","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicina at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jinwen Feng","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Yanpeng An","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Jingcheng Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Zhenqiang Su","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Shanyue Sun","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Fahui Dai","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Qinsheng Chen","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Qinwei Lu","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Pengcheng Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Yun Ling","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center"},{"author_name":"Zhong Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Huiru Tang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Leming Shi","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Li Jin","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Edward C Holmes","author_inst":"Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity"},{"author_name":"Chen Ding","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Tong-Yu Zhu","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Yong-Zhen Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Lauren Chang","author_inst":"Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Olubukula Abiona","author_inst":"Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Kizzmekia S.

Purpose: To estimate the central tendency and dispersion for incubation period of COVID-19 and, in turn, assess the effect of a certain length of quarantine for close contacts in active monitoring. Data Sources: PubMed, Embase, medRxiv, bioRxiv, and arXiv, searched up to April 26, 2020 Study Selection: COVID-19 studies that described either individual-level incubation period data or summarized statistics for central tendency and dispersion measures of incubation period were recruited. Data Extraction: From each recruited study, either individual-level incubation period data or summarized statistics for central tendency and dispersion measures were extracted, as well as population characteristics including sample size, average age, and male proportion. Data Synthesis: Fifty-six studies encompassing 4 095 cases were included in this meta-analysis. The estimated median incubation period for general transmissions was 5.8 days [95% confidence interval (95%CI), 5.3 to 6.2 d]. Median and dispersion were higher for SARS-CoV-2 incubation compared to other viral respiratory infections. Furthermore, about 20 in 10 000 contacts in active monitoring would develop symptoms after 14 days, or below 1 in 10 000 for young-age infections or asymptomatic transmissions. Limitation: Small sample sizes for subgroups; some data were possibly used repeatedly in different studies; limited studies for outside mainland China; non-negligible intra-study heterogeneity. Conclusion: The long, dispersive incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 contributes to the global spread of COVID-19. Yet, a 14-day quarantine period is sufficient to trace and identify symptomatic infections, which while could be justified according to a better understanding of the crucial parameters.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yongyue Wei","author_inst":"Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Liangmin Wei","author_inst":"Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yihan Liu","author_inst":"Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Lihong Huang","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Sipeng Shen","author_inst":"Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ruyang Zhang","author_inst":"Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jiajin Chen","author_inst":"Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yang Zhao","author_inst":"Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hongbing Shen","author_inst":"Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Feng Chen","author_inst":"Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yanpeng An","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Jingcheng Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Zhenqiang Su","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Shanyue Sun","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Fahui Dai","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Qinsheng Chen","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Qinwei Lu","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Pengcheng Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Yun Ling","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center"},{"author_name":"Zhong Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Huiru Tang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Leming Shi","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Li Jin","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Edward C Holmes","author_inst":"Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity"},{"author_name":"Chen Ding","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Tong-Yu Zhu","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Yong-Zhen Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Lauren Chang","author_inst":"Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Olubukula Abiona","author_inst":"Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Kizzmekia S.

We examined host transcriptomes in moderate and severe COVID-19 cases with a view to identifying pathways that affect its progression. RNA extracted from whole blood of COVID-19 cases was analysed by microarray analysis. Moderate and severe cases were compared with healthy controls and differentially regulated genes (DEGs) categorized into cellular pathways. DEGs in COVID-19 cases were mostly related to host immune activation and cytokine signaling, pathogen uptake, host defenses, blood and vasculature genes, and SARS-CoV-2- and other virus- affected pathways. The DEGs in these pathways were increased in severe compared with moderate cases. In a severe COVID-19 patient with an unfavourable outcome we observed dysregulation of genes in platelet homeostasis and cardiac conduction and fibrin clotting with disease progression.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kiran Iqbal Masood","author_inst":"The Aga Khan University, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Syed Faisal Mahmood","author_inst":"The Aga Khan University"},{"author_name":"Saba Shahid","author_inst":"The Aga Khan University, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Nosheen Nasir","author_inst":"The Aga Khan University, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Najia Ghanchi","author_inst":"The Aga Khan University, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Asghar Nasir","author_inst":"The Aga Khan University, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Bushra Jamil","author_inst":"The Aga Khan University, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Iffat Khanum","author_inst":"The Aga Khan University, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Safina Razzak","author_inst":"The Aga Khan University, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Akbar Kanji","author_inst":"The Aga Khan University, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Zahra Hasan","author_inst":"The Aga Khan University"},{"author_name":"Jingcheng Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Zhenqiang Su","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Shanyue Sun","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Fahui Dai","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Qinsheng Chen","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Qinwei Lu","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Pengcheng Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Yun Ling","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center"},{"author_name":"Zhong Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Huiru Tang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Leming Shi","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Li Jin","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Edward C Holmes","author_inst":"Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity"},{"author_name":"Chen Ding","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Tong-Yu Zhu","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Yong-Zhen Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Lauren Chang","author_inst":"Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Olubukula Abiona","author_inst":"Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Kizzmekia S.

In the background of the current COVID-19 pandemic, serological tests are being used to assess past infection and immunity against SARS-CoV-2. This knowledge is paramount to determine the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 through the post pandemic period. Several individuals belonging to households with an index COVID-19 patient, reported symptoms of COVID-19 but discrepant serology results. Methods. Here we investigated the humoral and cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 in seven families, including nine index patients and eight contacts, who had evidence of serological discordances within the households. Ten unexposed healthy donors were enrolled as controls. Results. All index patients recovered from a mild COVID-19. They all developed anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and a significant T cell response detectable up to 69 days after symptom onset. Six of the eight contacts reported COVID-19 symptoms within 1 to 7 days after the index patients but all were SARS-CoV-2 seronegative. Six out of eight contacts developed a SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response against structural and\/or accessory proteins that lasts up to 80 days post symptom onset suggesting a past SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusion. Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 can induce virus-specific T cell responses without seroconversion. T cell responses may be more sensitive indicators of SARS-Co-V-2 exposure than antibodies. Our results indicate that epidemiological data relying only on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may lead to a substantial underestimation of prior exposure to the virus","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Floriane Gallais","author_inst":"Strasbourg University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Aurelie Velay","author_inst":"Strasbourg University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Marie-Josee Wendling","author_inst":"Strasbourg University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Nazon","author_inst":"Strasbourg University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Marialuisa Partisani","author_inst":"Strasbourg University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Jean Sibilia","author_inst":"Strasbourg University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Sophie Candon","author_inst":"CHU de Rouen"},{"author_name":"Samira Fafi-Kremer","author_inst":"Strasbourg University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Safina Razzak","author_inst":"The Aga Khan University, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Akbar Kanji","author_inst":"The Aga Khan University, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Zahra Hasan","author_inst":"The Aga Khan University"},{"author_name":"Jingcheng Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Zhenqiang Su","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Shanyue Sun","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Fahui Dai","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Qinsheng Chen","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Qinwei Lu","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Pengcheng Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Yun Ling","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center"},{"author_name":"Zhong Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Huiru Tang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Leming Shi","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Li Jin","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Edward C Holmes","author_inst":"Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity"},{"author_name":"Chen Ding","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Tong-Yu Zhu","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Yong-Zhen Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Human Phenome Institute, Fudan University, Shan"},{"author_name":"Lauren Chang","author_inst":"Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Olubukula Abiona","author_inst":"Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Kizzmekia S.

However, point-of-care (POC) testing in places such as emergency units, outpatient clinics, airport security points or the entrance of any public building is a major challenge. The need for thermal cycling and nucleic acid isolation hampers the use of standard PCR-based methods for this purpose. Methods: To avoid these obstacles, we tested PCR-independent methods for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from primary material (nasopharyngeal swabs) including loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and specific high-sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking (SHERLOCK). Results: Whilst specificity of standard LAMP assays appears to be satisfactory, sensitivity does not reach the current gold-standard quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays yet. We describe a novel multiplexed LAMP approach and validate its sensitivity on primary samples. This approach allows for fast and reliable identification of infected individuals. Primer optimization and multiplexing helps to increase sensitivity significantly. In addition, we directly compare and combine our novel LAMP assays with SHERLOCK. Conclusion: In summary, this approach reveals one-step multiplexed LAMP assays as a prime-option for the development of easy and cheap POC test kits.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bernhard Schermer","author_inst":"University Hospital of Cologne"},{"author_name":"Francesca Fabretti","author_inst":"University Hospital of Cologne"},{"author_name":"Maximilian Damagnez","author_inst":"University of Cologne"},{"author_name":"Veronica Di Cristanziano","author_inst":"Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Eva Heger","author_inst":"University of Cologne"},{"author_name":"Sita Arjune","author_inst":"University Hospital Cologne"},{"author_name":"Nathan A Tanner","author_inst":"New England Biolabs"},{"author_name":"Thomas Imhof","author_inst":"University of Cologne"},{"author_name":"Manuel Koch","author_inst":"University of Cologne"},{"author_name":"Alim Ladha","author_inst":"MIT, Boston"},{"author_name":"Julia Joung","author_inst":"MIT, Boston"},{"author_name":"Jonathan S.
