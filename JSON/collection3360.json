However, microbial composition of the respiratory tract and other infected tissues, as well as their possible pathogenic contributions to varying degrees of disease severity in COVID-19 patients remain unclear. Method Between January 27 and February 26, 2020, serial clinical specimens (sputum, nasal and throat swab, anal swab and feces) were collected from a cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, including 8 mildly and 15 severely ill patients (requiring ICU admission and mechanical ventilation), in the Guangdong province, China. Total RNA was extracted and ultra-deep metatranscriptomic sequencing was performed in combination with laboratory diagnostic assays. Co-infection rates, the prevalence and abundance of microbial communities in these COVID-19 patients were determined. Findings Notably, respiratory microbial co-infections were exclusively found in 84.6% of severely ill patients (11\/13), among which viral and bacterial co-infections were detected by sequencing in 30.8% (4\/13) and 69.2% (9\/13) of the patients, respectively. In addition, for 23.1% (3\/13) of the patients, bacterial co-infections with Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) and Staphylococcus epidermidis were also confirmed by bacterial culture. Further, a time-dependent, secondary infection of B. cenocepacia with expressions of multiple virulence genes in one severely ill patient was demonstrated, which might be the primary cause of his disease deterioration and death one month after ICU admission. Interpretation Our findings identified distinct patterns of co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 and various respiratory pathogenic microbes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in relation to disease severity. Detection and tracking of BCC-associated nosocomial infections are recommended to improve the pre-emptive treatment regimen and reduce fatal outcomes of hospitalized patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Here we study how its causal agent, SARS-CoV-2, has diversified genetically since its first emergence in December 2019. We have created a pipeline combining both phylogenetic and structural analysis to identify possible human-adaptation related mutations in a data set consisting of 4,894 SARS-CoV-2 complete genome sequences. Although the phylogenetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 is low, the whole genome phylogenetic tree can be divided into five clusters\/clades based on the tree topology and clustering of specific mutations, but its branches exhibit low genetic distance and bootstrap support values. We also identified 11 residues that are high-frequency substitutions, with four of them currently showing some signal for potential positive selection. These fast-evolving sites are in the non-structural proteins nsp2, nsp5 (3CL-protease), nsp6, nsp12 (polymerase) and nsp13 (helicase), in accessory proteins (ORF3a, ORF8) and in the structural proteins N and S. Temporal and spatial analysis of these potentially adaptive mutations revealed that the incidence of some of these sites was declining after having reached an (often local) peak, whereas the frequency of other sites is continually increasing and now exhibit a worldwide distribution. Structural analysis revealed that the mutations are located on the surface of the proteins that modulate biochemical properties. We speculate that this improves binding to cellular proteins and hence represents fine-tuning of adaptation to human cells. Our study has implications for the design of biochemical and clinical experiments to assess whether important properties of SARS-CoV-2 have changed during the epidemic.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jin Zhao","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China."},{"author_name":"xiaofeng zhai","author_inst":"Nanjing Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Jiyong Zhou","author_inst":"Key laboratory of Animal Virology of Ministry of Agriculture, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China."},{"author_name":"James R Thompson","author_inst":"The MITRE Corporation"},{"author_name":"Huahui Ren","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Weiqun He","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Zhaoyong Zhang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Airu Zhu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Jingxian Zhao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Fei Xiao","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Molecular Imag"},{"author_name":"Fangming Yang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Tianzhu Liang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Feng Ye","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Bei Zhong","author_inst":"The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Qingyuan People's Hospital, Qingyuan, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Shicong Ruan","author_inst":"Yangjiang People's Hospital, Yangjiang, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Mian Gan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Jiahui Zhu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Fang Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Fuqiang Li","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Daxi Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Jiandong Li","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Peidi Ren","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Shida Zhu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Huanming Yang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Karsten Kristiansen","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Hein M Tun","author_inst":"HKU-Pasteur Research Pole, School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China."},{"author_name":"Weijun Chen","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen, China."},{"author_name":"Nanshan Zhong","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Disease, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xun Xu","author_inst":"BGI-shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yi-min Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Junhua LI","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Jincun Zhao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.03.20146035","rel_title":"Age Matters: COVID-19 Prevalence in a Vaping Adolescent Population -

Our study aims to investigate the relationship of vaping with the prevalence of COVID-19 infection across the United States and in the District of Columbia. Methods: COVID-19 case counts by state and the District of Columbia were obtained via the Worldometers website on 04\/30\/2020. Prevalence of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents were calculated using estimated 2019 population data from the US Census Department. Age ranges analyzed were: high school age children, Ages 18-24, Ages 25-44, and Ages 45-65. Spearman correlation analysis was conducted to determine if the rate of vaping was correlated with a higher prevalence of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population. Findings: The Spearman correlation analysis demonstrated that persons vaping between 18 years and 24 years of age had a correlation coefficient of 0.278 with prevalence of COVID-19 infection (p=0.048). Vaping high school students had a correlation coefficient of 0.153 with prevalence of COVID-19 (p=0.328). Persons vaping in the age group 25-45 years had a correlation coefficient of 0.101 in association to COVID-19 prevalence (p=0.478). And finally, persons vaping between the age 45-65 years old had a correlation coefficient 0.130 with respect to COVID-19 prevalence (p=0.364). Interpretation: Increased COVID-19 prevalence is associated with vaping in the adolescent population between ages 18 and 24. Further prospective studies need to be performed in order investigate the severity of outcomes of vaping in association with COVID-19 infection.

Multiple and interconnected challenges face the care home sector in the prevention and management of outbreaks of COVID-19, including adequate supply of personal protective equipment, staff shortages, and insufficient or lack of timely COVID-19 testing. Care homes are particularly vulnerable to infectious diseases. Aim: To analyse the mortality of older care home residents in Wales during COVID-19 lockdown and compare this across the population of Wales and the previous 4-years. Study Design and Setting: We used anonymised Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and administrative data from the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank to create a cross-sectional cohort study. We anonymously linked data for Welsh residents to mortality data up to the 14th June 2020. Methods: We calculated survival curves and adjusted Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for the risk of mortality. We adjusted hazard ratios for age, gender, social economic status and prior health conditions. Results: Survival curves show an increased proportion of deaths between 23rd March and 14th June 2020 in care homes for older people, with an adjusted HR of 1.72 (1.55, 1.90) compared to 2016. Compared to the general population in 2016-2019, adjusted care home mortality HRs for older adults rose from 2.15 (2.11,2.20) in 2016-2019 to 2.94 (2.81,3.08) in 2020. Conclusions: The survival curves and increased HRs show a significantly increased risk of death in the 2020 study periods.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joe Hollinghurst","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Jane Lyons","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Richard Fry","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Ashley Akbari","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Mike Gravenor","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Alan Watkins","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Fiona Verity","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Ronan A Lyons","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Abhishek Kulkarni","author_inst":"Southern Illinois University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Robert Robinson","author_inst":"SIU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fangming Yang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Tianzhu Liang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Feng Ye","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Bei Zhong","author_inst":"The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Qingyuan People's Hospital, Qingyuan, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Shicong Ruan","author_inst":"Yangjiang People's Hospital, Yangjiang, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Mian Gan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Jiahui Zhu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Fang Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Fuqiang Li","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Daxi Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Jiandong Li","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Peidi Ren","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Shida Zhu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Huanming Yang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Karsten Kristiansen","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Hein M Tun","author_inst":"HKU-Pasteur Research Pole, School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China."},{"author_name":"Weijun Chen","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen, China."},{"author_name":"Nanshan Zhong","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Disease, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xun Xu","author_inst":"BGI-shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yi-min Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Junhua LI","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Jincun Zhao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.03.184846","rel_title":"The potential role of miR-21-3p in coronavirus-host interplay","rel_date":"2020-07-04","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.03.184846","rel_abs":"ABSTRACTHost miRNAs are known as important regulators of virus replication and pathogenesis. They can interact with various viruses by several possible mechanisms including direct binding the viral RNA. Identification of human miRNAs involved in coronavirus-host interplay is becoming important due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In this work we performed computational prediction of high-confidence direct interactions between miRNAs and seven human coronavirus RNAs. In order to uncover the entire miRNA-virus interplay we further analyzed lungs miRNome of SARS-CoV infected mice using publicly available miRNA sequencing data. We found that miRNA miR-21-3p has the largest probability of binding the human coronavirus RNAs and being dramatically up-regulated in mouse lungs during infection induced by SARS-CoV. Further bioinformatic analysis of binding sites revealed high conservativity of miR-21-3p binding regions within RNAs of human coronaviruses and their strains.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stepan Nersisyan","author_inst":"Higher School of Economics"},{"author_name":"Narek Engibaryan","author_inst":"Higher School of Economics"},{"author_name":"Aleksandra Gorbonos","author_inst":"Higher School of Economics"},{"author_name":"Ksenia Kirdey","author_inst":"Higher School of Economics"},{"author_name":"Alexey Makhonin","author_inst":"Higher School of Economics"},{"author_name":"Alexander Tonevitsky","author_inst":"Higher School of Economics"},{"author_name":"Fiona Verity","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Ronan A Lyons","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Abhishek Kulkarni","author_inst":"Southern Illinois University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Robert Robinson","author_inst":"SIU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fangming Yang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Tianzhu Liang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Feng Ye","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Bei Zhong","author_inst":"The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Qingyuan People's Hospital, Qingyuan, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Shicong Ruan","author_inst":"Yangjiang People's Hospital, Yangjiang, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Mian Gan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Jiahui Zhu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Fang Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Fuqiang Li","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Daxi Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Jiandong Li","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Peidi Ren","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Shida Zhu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Huanming Yang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Karsten Kristiansen","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China."},{"author_name":"Hein M Tun","author_inst":"HKU-Pasteur Research Pole, School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China."},{"author_name":"Weijun Chen","author_inst":"BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen, China."},{"author_name":"Nanshan Zhong","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Disease, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xun Xu","author_inst":"BGI-shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Yi-min Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Junhua LI","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Jincun Zhao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.04.187989","rel_title":"A pH-dependent switch mediates conformational masking of SARS-CoV-2 spike","rel_date":"2020-07-04","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.04.187989","rel_abs":"The SARS-CoV-2 spike employs mobile receptor-binding domains (RBDs) to engage the ACE2 receptor and to facilitate virus entry.

Nonetheless, D614G affinity for ACE2 was reduced due to a faster dissociation rate. Assessment of the S protein trimer by cryo-electron microscopy showed that D614G disrupts a critical interprotomer contact and that this dramatically shifts the S protein trimer conformation toward an ACE2-binding and fusion-competent state. Consistent with the more open conformation, neutralization potency of antibodies targeting the S protein receptor-binding domain was not attenuated. These results indicate that D614G adopts conformations that make virion membrane fusion with the target cell membrane more probable but that D614G retains susceptibility to therapies that disrupt interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein with the ACE2 receptor.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Leonid Yurkovetskiy","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Xue Wang","author_inst":"Thermo Fisher Scientific"},{"author_name":"Kristen E Pascal","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc."},{"author_name":"Christopher Tompkins-Tinch","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Thomas Nyalile","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Yetao Wang","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Alina Baum","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc"},{"author_name":"William E Diehl","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Ann Dauphin","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Claudia Carbone","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Kristen Veinotte","author_inst":"University of Massachetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Shawn B Egri","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Stephen F Schaffner","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Jacob E Lemieux","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"James Munro","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Ashique Rafique","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc."},{"author_name":"Abhi Barve","author_inst":"Thermo Fisher Scientific"},{"author_name":"Pardis C Sabeti","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Christos Kyratsous","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc"},{"author_name":"Natalya Dudkina","author_inst":"Thermo Fisher Scientific"},{"author_name":"Kuang Shen","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Luban","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Medical School"},{"author_name":"David D.

The rapid increase in chilblain\/pernio-like cases during the COVID-19 pandemic is likely SARS-CoV-2-associated. The relationship between skin symptom onset and COVID-19 PCR\/antibody test timing, however, remains uncharacterized. We established an international registry for cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19.2, 3 Providers reported time between dermatologic symptom onset and positive\/negative COVID-19 laboratory results, when available. From 8 April-30 June, 2020, 906 laboratory-confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases with dermatologic manifestations were reported, 534 of which were chilblains\/pernio.3 Among PCR-tested patients, 57%(n=208) overall and 15%(n=23) of chilblains\/pernio cases were PCR-positive. Antibody positivity was 37%(n=39) overall and 19%(n=15) for chilblains\/pernio. We evaluated 163 patients with timing information on PCR and\/or antibody testing (Table 1). For patients with suspected COVID-19 and any cutaneous manifestation, PCR-positive testing occurred median 6 (IQR 1-14) days after dermatologic symptoms started while PCR-negative testing occurred median 14 (IQR 7-24) days later. For patients with pernio\/chilblains, PCR-positivity was noted 8 (IQR 5-14) days after symptoms and negativity median 14 (IQR 7-28) days later. Antibody testing (IgM or IgG) was positive median 30 (IQR 19-39) days after symptom onset for all dermatologic manifestations and 27 (IQR 24-33) days after chilblains\/pernio onset. Like Hubiche et al, our data highlight the low frequency of SARS-CoV-2 PCR+ testing in COVID-19 patients with cutaneous manifestations. Positive predictive values for COVID-19 PCR are influenced by viral shedding kinetics, which are difficult to assess in non-respiratory presentations.4 Our data reveal that early PCR testing is more likely to be positive than later testing, even when date-of-onset is defined by cutaneous manifestations rather than systemic symptoms. Most COVID-19 antibody data are from systemically-ill patients; the kinetics of antibody production in mild-to-moderate COVID-19 infections remain unclear.5 Here, positive antibodies resulted median 30 days from disease onset, beyond the frequently used 14-21 day testing window. In outpatients with true infection, many factors influence the likelihood of a positive antibody result: antibody production, test availability, assay sensitivity, and timing of care-seeking in relation to symptom-onset. These variables influence our interpretation of individual test results and our understanding of the association between pernio and COVID-19. More population-level testing data is necessary to optimize diagnostic test timing. Positive identification of COVID-19 in minimally-symptomatic patients, including patients with skin findings, is critical to the public health effort.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Esther E Freeman","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Devon E McMahon","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Lindy P Fox","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Marlys S Fassett","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Thomas Nyalile","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Yetao Wang","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Alina Baum","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc"},{"author_name":"William E Diehl","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Ann Dauphin","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Claudia Carbone","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Kristen Veinotte","author_inst":"University of Massachetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Shawn B Egri","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Stephen F Schaffner","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Jacob E Lemieux","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"James Munro","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Ashique Rafique","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc."},{"author_name":"Abhi Barve","author_inst":"Thermo Fisher Scientific"},{"author_name":"Pardis C Sabeti","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Christos Kyratsous","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc"},{"author_name":"Natalya Dudkina","author_inst":"Thermo Fisher Scientific"},{"author_name":"Kuang Shen","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Luban","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Medical School"},{"author_name":"David D.

During the COVID-19 pandemic some countries have reduced access to supplemental oxygen (e.g. oxygen rationing), whereas other nations have maintained and even improved access to supplemental oxygen. We examined whether such variation in the access to supplemental oxygen had any bearing on mortality in COVID-19. Methods Three independent investigators searched for, identified and extracted the nationally recommended target oxygen levels for the commencement of oxygen in COVID-19 pneumonia from the 29 worst affected countries. Mortality estimates were calculated from three independent sources. We then applied linear regression analysis to examine for potential association between national targets for the commencement of oxygen and case fatality rates. Results Of the 26 nations included, 15 had employed conservative oxygen strategies to manage COVID-19 pneumonia. Of them, Belgium, France, USA, Canada, China, Germany, Mexico, Spain, Sweden and the UK guidelines advised commencing oxygen when oxygen saturations (SpO2) fell to 91% or less. Target SpO2 ranged from 92% to 95% in the other 16 nations. Linear regression analysis demonstrated a strong inverse correlation between the national target for the commencement of oxygen and national case fatality rates (Spearmans Rho = -0.622, p < 0.001). Conclusion Our study highlights the disparity in oxygen provision for COVID-19 patients between the nations analysed, and indicates such disparity in access to supplemental oxygen may represent a modifiable factor associated with mortality during the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"- The Gibraltar COVID-19 Research Group: Health Systems","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Daniel Goyal","author_inst":"University of Gibraltar, Medicine and Public Health"},{"author_name":"Lindy P Fox","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Marlys S Fassett","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Thomas Nyalile","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Yetao Wang","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Alina Baum","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc"},{"author_name":"William E Diehl","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Ann Dauphin","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Claudia Carbone","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Kristen Veinotte","author_inst":"University of Massachetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Shawn B Egri","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Stephen F Schaffner","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Jacob E Lemieux","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"James Munro","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Ashique Rafique","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc."},{"author_name":"Abhi Barve","author_inst":"Thermo Fisher Scientific"},{"author_name":"Pardis C Sabeti","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Christos Kyratsous","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc"},{"author_name":"Natalya Dudkina","author_inst":"Thermo Fisher Scientific"},{"author_name":"Kuang Shen","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Luban","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Medical School"},{"author_name":"David D.

Here, we demonstrate a five-parameter sub-epidemic wave modeling framework that provides a simple characterization of unfolding trajectories of COVID-19 epidemics that are progressing across the world at different spatial scales. We calibrate the model to daily reported COVID-19 incidence data to generate six sequential weekly forecasts for five European countries and five hotspot states within the United States. The sub-epidemic approach captures the rise to an initial peak followed by a wide range of post-peak behavior, ranging from a typical decline to a steady incidence level to repeated small waves for sub-epidemic outbreaks. We show that the sub-epidemic model outperforms a three-parameter Richards model, in terms of calibration and forecasting performance, and yields excellent short- and intermediate-term forecasts that are not attainable with other single-peak transmission models of similar complexity. Overall, this approach predicts that a relaxation of social distancing measures would result in continuing sub-epidemics and ongoing endemic transmission. We illustrate how this view of the epidemic could help data scientists and policymakers better understand and predict the underlying transmission dynamics of COVID-19, as early detection of potential sub-epidemics can inform model-based decisions for tighter distancing controls.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gerardo Chowell","author_inst":"Georgia State University"},{"author_name":"Richard Rothenberg","author_inst":"Georgia State University"},{"author_name":"Kimberlyn Roosa","author_inst":"Georgia State University"},{"author_name":"Amna Tariq","author_inst":"Georgia State University"},{"author_name":"James M Hyman","author_inst":"Tulane University"},{"author_name":"Ruiyan Luo","author_inst":"Georgia State University"},{"author_name":"Alina Baum","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc"},{"author_name":"William E Diehl","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Ann Dauphin","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Claudia Carbone","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Kristen Veinotte","author_inst":"University of Massachetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Shawn B Egri","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Stephen F Schaffner","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Jacob E Lemieux","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"James Munro","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Ashique Rafique","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc."},{"author_name":"Abhi Barve","author_inst":"Thermo Fisher Scientific"},{"author_name":"Pardis C Sabeti","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Christos Kyratsous","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc"},{"author_name":"Natalya Dudkina","author_inst":"Thermo Fisher Scientific"},{"author_name":"Kuang Shen","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Luban","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Medical School"},{"author_name":"David D.

Parents worry about the virus (86.4%) vs. CYP (69.4%), whilst (89%) parents are vigilant for symptoms of the virus vs. CYP(69.4%). A thematic analysis of the qualitative comments covered 34 subthemes, forming eight-overarching themes: Virus 1)risk of infection, 2)information, guidance and advice, 3)change in health care provision, and 4)fears and anxieties; Lockdown and isolation 5)psychological and social impact, 6)keeping safe under lockdown, 7)provisions and dependence on others, 8)employment and income. Conclusions Parents and CYP were worried about the virus, although CYP less so. Parents and children however, were frustrated with the lack of specific and paediatric focused information and guidance, expressing disappointment with the adult centric information available. Parents also felt alone, especially with their concerns around the implications of cardiac service suspension and the implication for their childs health. In order to better support children and their families, resources need to be developed to address families and CYP concerns for their health during this pandemic.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luise Marino","author_inst":"University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Richard Wagland","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"David Culliford","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Tara Bharucha","author_inst":"University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Sam Sodergren","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Anne-Sophie Darlington","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Alina Baum","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc"},{"author_name":"William E Diehl","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Ann Dauphin","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Claudia Carbone","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Kristen Veinotte","author_inst":"University of Massachetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Shawn B Egri","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Stephen F Schaffner","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Jacob E Lemieux","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"James Munro","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Ashique Rafique","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc."},{"author_name":"Abhi Barve","author_inst":"Thermo Fisher Scientific"},{"author_name":"Pardis C Sabeti","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Christos Kyratsous","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc"},{"author_name":"Natalya Dudkina","author_inst":"Thermo Fisher Scientific"},{"author_name":"Kuang Shen","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Luban","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Medical School"},{"author_name":"David D.

The survey found severely stressed doctors to be younger (<45years), of female gender working in the ICU setting and insecure regarding their finances. Concern regarding PPE shortages and ethical dilemmas of rationing care are factors inducing severe stress amongst doctors working in ICU settings. This is the first such survey done in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic from the Indian sub-continent. The findings have important implications on the International healthcare community, especially across Africa, Asia & South America where the contagion continues to wreak havoc.

Methods and Findings A retrospective research design was used to compare the clinical characteristics of tinnitus between patients from March to April 2020 under pandemic pressure and those from the matching period in 2019. Tinnitus severity was evaluated using the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) questionnaire and the minimum masking level (MML) measure while anxiety was quantified using the Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). The assessments were repeated after a 2-month interval, in which sound therapy was applied to a subgroup of patients. In all, 94 and 70 cases were reported in the 2020 and 2019 groups, respectively. The effects of the pandemic on emotional status were evident from a higher incidence of anxiety and much higher SAS scores in the 2020 group. There was also an increase in the THI scores in the 2020 group, but the between-year difference was smaller than that of the SAS score. Moreover, there was no between-year difference in MML or the treatment effect, as measured via both THI and MML. Furthermore, the reduction in SAS score in the second assessment was significantly smaller in the 2020 group. However, a positive correlation between the initial SAS score and the improvement was seen within the 2020 group. Conclusions Anxiety increased greatly in tinnitus subjects due to the COVID 19 pandemic. However, this was not associated with an increase in tinnitus severity in 2020. Instead, there was no between-year difference in the THI score or MML or in the improvement of either measure after treatment. The smaller improvement in SAS score and the positive correlation with the initial SAS score in the 2020 group suggests that the SAS score change in this group might largely be due to the natural relief of pressure as the pandemic decelerated in China. Therefore, the anxiety change induced by the COVID 19 pandemic is not likely to have a strong impact on tinnitus.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Li Xia","author_inst":"Sichuan Provincial People Hospital and Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"School of Communication Science and Disorders, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia B3H 4R2, Canada"},{"author_name":"Dong Chuan","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Sichuan Provincial People Hospital and Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences, Chengdu, Sichuan, 610072, China"},{"author_name":"Jiangang Fan","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Sichuan Provincial People Hospital and Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences, Chengdu, Sichuan, 610072, China"},{"author_name":"Zhengnong Chen","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People Hospital, 200233, Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Naresh Shanmugam","author_inst":"Dr.Rela Institute & Medical Centre"},{"author_name":"Akila Rajakumar","author_inst":"Dr.Rela Institute & Medical Centre"},{"author_name":"Mettu Srinivas Reddy","author_inst":"Dr.Rela Institute & Medical Centre"},{"author_name":"Ilankumaran Kaliamoorthy","author_inst":"Dr.Rela Institute & Medical Centre"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Rela","author_inst":"Dr.Rela Institute & Medical Centre"},{"author_name":"Kristen Veinotte","author_inst":"University of Massachetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Shawn B Egri","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Stephen F Schaffner","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Jacob E Lemieux","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"James Munro","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Ashique Rafique","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc."},{"author_name":"Abhi Barve","author_inst":"Thermo Fisher Scientific"},{"author_name":"Pardis C Sabeti","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Christos Kyratsous","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc"},{"author_name":"Natalya Dudkina","author_inst":"Thermo Fisher Scientific"},{"author_name":"Kuang Shen","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Luban","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Medical School"},{"author_name":"David D.

Besides the SIRD model does not include some aspects of COVID-19, as the symptomatic and asymptomatic subgroups of individuals and the incubation period, for example, in this work we intend to use a classical and easy to handle model to introduce a thorough method of adjustment that allows us to achieve reliable fitting for the real data and to obtain insights about the current trends for the pandemic in each locality. Our results demonstrate that for localities for which the ERN is about 2, only rigid measures are efficient to avoid overwhelming the health care system. These findings corroborate the relevance of keeping the value of the ERN below 1 and applying containment measures early.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rafael Marques Da Silva","author_inst":"Federal University of Paran\u00e1"},{"author_name":"Oleg Dukhin","author_inst":"Moscow State University of Medicine and Dentistry, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Ivan Molodtsov","author_inst":"Clinical City Hospital named after I.V.

The inflammatory response to COVID-19 infection in children remains poorly characterised. Methods We retrospectively analysed the medical records of 127 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients aged 1 month to 16 years from Wuhan and Jingzhou of Hubei Province. Patients presented between January 25th and March 24th 2020. Information on clinical features, laboratory results, plasma cytokines\/chemokines and lymphocyte subsets were analysed. Findings Children admitted to hospital with COVID-19 were more likely to be male (67.7%) and the median age was 7.3 [IQR 4.9] years. All but one patient with severe disease was aged under 2 and the majority (5\/7) had significant co-morbidities. Despite 53% having viral pneumonia on CT scanning only 2 patients had low lymphocyte counts and no differences were observed in the levels of plasma proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha; and interferon (IFN)-gamma; between patients with mild, moderate or severe disease. Interpretations We demonstrated that the immune responses of children to COVID-19 infection is significantly different from that seen in adults. Our evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 does not trigger a robust inflammatory response or \"cytokine storm\" in children with COVID-19, and this may underlie the generally better outcomes seen in children with this disease. These data also imply anti-cytokine therapies may not be effective in children with moderate COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guoqing Qian","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yang Xu","author_inst":"Wuhan Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Weihua Hu","author_inst":"First Hospital of Jingzhou"},{"author_name":"Ian Hall","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Jiang Yue","author_inst":"Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Hongyun Lu","author_inst":"Zhuhai People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Liemin Ruan","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maoqing Ye","author_inst":"East China Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jin Mei","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jianfeng Xu","author_inst":"NorthShore University HealthSystem"},{"author_name":"Alexey Mazus","author_inst":"Moscow City Center for AIDS Prevention and Control, Moscow Department of Healthcare, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Ilia Spiridonov","author_inst":"Center for Theoretical Problems of Physico-Chemical Pharmacology RAS, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Fazly Ataullakhanov","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA"},{"author_name":"Leonid Margolis","author_inst":"Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, USA"},{"author_name":"Alexander Shpektor","author_inst":"Moscow State University of Medicine and Dentistry, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Elena Vasilieva","author_inst":"Moscow State University of Medicine and Dentistry, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Pardis C Sabeti","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Christos Kyratsous","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc"},{"author_name":"Natalya Dudkina","author_inst":"Thermo Fisher Scientific"},{"author_name":"Kuang Shen","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Luban","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Medical School"},{"author_name":"David D.

Objectives: We explored the SARS-CoV-2 genomic load as a risk factor for adverse patient outcomes. Methods: A retrospective cohort study among adult patients admitted to the hospital between March 31st to April 10th, 2020 with COVID-19 pneumonia was conducted. We segregated patients into 3 genomic load groups: low (Cycle threshold (Ct) [&ge;]35), intermediate (25 < Ct < 35), and high (Ct [&le;] 25) using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Measurements: A composite outcome of death, intubation, and\/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was used. Secondary outcomes included the severity of pneumonia on admission, as measured by the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI). Main Results: Of 457 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia from March 31st to April 10th, 2020, 316 met inclusion criteria. Included patients were followed for a median of 25 days (IQR 21-28). High genomic load at presentation was associated with higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (p=0.005), transplant recipient status (p<0.001), and duration of illness less than 7 days (p=0.005). Importantly, patients with high genomic load were more likely to reach the primary endpoint (p=0.001), and had higher PSI scores on admission (p=0.03). In multivariate analysis, a high genomic load remained an independent predictor of the primary outcome. Results remained significant in sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that a high genomic load of SARS-CoV-2 at the time of admission is an independent predictor of adverse outcomes, that above and beyond age, comorbidity, and severity of illness on presentation, may be used to risk-stratify patients, and call for a quantitative diagnostic assay to become available.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ioannis M Zacharioudakis","author_inst":"NYU Grossman School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Prithiv J Prasad","author_inst":"NYU Grossman School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fainareti N Zervou","author_inst":"NYU Grossman School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Atreyee Basu","author_inst":"NYU Grossman School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Inglima","author_inst":"NYU Grossman School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Scott A Weisenberg","author_inst":"NYU Grossman School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Maria E Aguero-Rosenfeld","author_inst":"NYU Grossman School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Liemin Ruan","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maoqing Ye","author_inst":"East China Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jin Mei","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jianfeng Xu","author_inst":"NorthShore University HealthSystem"},{"author_name":"Alexey Mazus","author_inst":"Moscow City Center for AIDS Prevention and Control, Moscow Department of Healthcare, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Ilia Spiridonov","author_inst":"Center for Theoretical Problems of Physico-Chemical Pharmacology RAS, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Fazly Ataullakhanov","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA"},{"author_name":"Leonid Margolis","author_inst":"Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, USA"},{"author_name":"Alexander Shpektor","author_inst":"Moscow State University of Medicine and Dentistry, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Elena Vasilieva","author_inst":"Moscow State University of Medicine and Dentistry, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Pardis C Sabeti","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Christos Kyratsous","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc"},{"author_name":"Natalya Dudkina","author_inst":"Thermo Fisher Scientific"},{"author_name":"Kuang Shen","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Luban","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Medical School"},{"author_name":"David D.

In this retrospective case-control study, we used de-identified electronic health records (EHR) from the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Health System between March 9th, 2020 and June 14th, 2020 to identify risk factors for COVID-19 susceptibility (severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) PCR test positive), inpatient admission, and severe outcomes (treatment in an intensive care unit or intubation). Of the 26,602 individuals tested by PCR for SARS-CoV-2, 992 were COVID-19 positive (3.7% of Tested), 220 were admitted in the hospital (22% of COVID-19 positive), and 77 had a severe outcome (35% of Inpatient). Consistent with previous studies, males and individuals older than 65 years old had increased risk of inpatient admission. Notably, individuals self-identifying as Hispanic or Latino constituted an increasing percentage of COVID-19 patients as disease severity escalated, comprising 24% of those testing positive, but 40% of those with a severe outcome, a disparity that remained after correcting for medical co-morbidities. Cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and renal disease were premorbid risk factors present before SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing associated with COVID-19 susceptibility. Less well-established risk factors for COVID-19 susceptibility included pre-existing dementia (odds ratio (OR) 5.2 [3.2-8.3], p=2.6 x 10-10), mental health conditions (depression OR 2.1 [1.6-2.8], p=1.1 x 10-6) and vitamin D deficiency (OR 1.8 [1.4-2.2], p=5.7 x 10-6). Renal diseases including end-stage renal disease and anemia due to chronic renal disease were the predominant premorbid risk factors for COVID-19 inpatient admission. Other less established risk factors for COVID-19 inpatient admission included previous renal transplant (OR 9.7 [2.8-39], p=3.2x10-4) and disorders of the immune system (OR 6.0 [2.3, 16], p=2.7x10-4). Prior use of oral steroid medications was associated with decreased COVID-19 positive testing risk (OR 0.61 [0.45, 0.81], p=4.3x10-4), but increased inpatient admission risk (OR 4.5 [2.3, 8.9], p=1.8x10-5). We did not observe that prior use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers increased the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, being admitted to the hospital, or having a severe outcome. This study involving direct EHR extraction identified known and less well-established demographics, and prior diagnoses and medications as risk factors for COVID-19 susceptibility and inpatient admission. Knowledge of these risk factors including marked ethnic disparities observed in disease severity should guide government policies, identify at-risk populations, inform clinical decision making, and prioritize future COVID-19 research.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Timothy S Chang","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Yi Ding","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Malika K Freund","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Ruth Johnson","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Tommer Schwarz","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Julie M Yabu","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Chad Hazlett","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey N Chiang","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Ami Wulf","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"- UCLA Health Data Mart Working Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Daniel H Geschwind","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Manish J Butte","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Bogdan Pasaniuc","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Raisa Loginov","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL), Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Satu Kurkela","author_inst":"HUS Diagnostic Center, HUSLAB, Clinical Microbiology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Finland"},{"author_name":"Alexander Shpektor","author_inst":"Moscow State University of Medicine and Dentistry, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Elena Vasilieva","author_inst":"Moscow State University of Medicine and Dentistry, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Pardis C Sabeti","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Christos Kyratsous","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc"},{"author_name":"Natalya Dudkina","author_inst":"Thermo Fisher Scientific"},{"author_name":"Kuang Shen","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Luban","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Medical School"},{"author_name":"David D.

Methods: Antibody testing was performed on three clinical cohorts of COVID-19 disease: hospitalised patients with PCR confirmation, hospitalized patients with a clinical diagnosis but negative PCR, and symptomatic healthcare workers (HCWs). Pre-pandemic respiratory infection sera were tested as negative controls. The sensitivity of the assay was calculated at different time points (<5 days, 5-9 days, 10-14 days, 15-19 days, >20 days, >42 days), and compared between cohorts. Results: Performance of the Abbot Architect SARS-CoV-2 assay varied significantly between cohorts. For PCR confirmed hospitalised patients (n = 114), early sensitivity was low: <5 days: 44.4% (95%CI: 18.9%-73.3%), 5-9 days: 32.6% (95%CI, 20.5%-47.5%), 10-14 days: 65.2% (95% CI 44.9%-81.2%), 15-20 days: 66.7% (95% CI: 39.1%-86.2%) but by day 20, sensitivity was 100% (95%CI, 86.2-100%). In contrast, 17 out of 114 symptomatic healthcare workers tested at >20 days had negative results, generating a sensitivity of 85.1% (95%CI, 77.4% - 90.5%). All pre-pandemic sera were negative, a specificity of 100%. Seroconversion rates were similar for PCR positive and PCR negative hospitalised cases. Conclusions: The sensitivity of the Abbot Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay increases over time, with sensitivity not peaking until 20 days post symptoms. Performance varied markedly by setting, with sensitivity significantly worse in symptomatic healthcare workers than in the hospitalised cohort. Clinicians, policymakers, and patients should be aware of the reduced sensitivity in this setting.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fergus Hamilton","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Peter Muir","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Marie Attwood","author_inst":"North Bristol NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Alan Noel","author_inst":"North Bristol NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Barry Vipond","author_inst":"Public Heath England"},{"author_name":"Richard Hopes","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Ed Moran","author_inst":"North Bristol NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Nick Maskell","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Deborah Warwick","author_inst":"North Bristol NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Mahableshwar Albur","author_inst":"North Bristol NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Turner","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Alasdair P MacGowan","author_inst":"North Bristol NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"David T Arnold","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Raisa Loginov","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL), Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Satu Kurkela","author_inst":"HUS Diagnostic Center, HUSLAB, Clinical Microbiology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Finland"},{"author_name":"Alexander Shpektor","author_inst":"Moscow State University of Medicine and Dentistry, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Elena Vasilieva","author_inst":"Moscow State University of Medicine and Dentistry, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Pardis C Sabeti","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Christos Kyratsous","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc"},{"author_name":"Natalya Dudkina","author_inst":"Thermo Fisher Scientific"},{"author_name":"Kuang Shen","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Luban","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Medical School"},{"author_name":"David D.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of corticosteroids in non-intensive care unit (ICU) patients with COVID19 pneumonia complicated by acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF). Methods: This was a single center retrospective cohort study, comprising of 205 patients admitted to the general wards with COVID19 pneumonia. The primary outcome was a composite of ICU transfer, intubation, or inhospital mortality. Cox proportional hazard regression was implemented. Result: Among 205 patients, 60 (29.27%) were treated with corticosteroid. The mean age was ~57 years, and ~75% were men. Thirteen patients (22.41%) developed a primary composite outcome in the corticosteroid cohort vs. 54 (37.5%) patients in the non-corticosteroid cohort (P=0.039). The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for the development of the composite primary outcome was 0.15 (95% CI, 0.07 to 0.33; P <0.001). The adjusted hazard ratio for ICU transfer was 0.16 (95% CI, 0.07 to 0.34; P < 0.001), intubation was 0.31 (95% CI, 0.14 to 0.70; P=0.005), death was 0.53 (95% CI, 0.22 to 1.31; P=0.172), and discharge was 3.65 (95% CI, 2.20 to 6.06; P<0.001). The corticosteroid cohort had increasing SpO2\/FiO2 over time compared to the non-corticosteroid cohort who experience decreasing SpO2\/FiO2 over time. Conclusion: Among non-ICU patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by AHRF, treatment with corticosteroid was associated with a significantly lower risk of the primary composite outcome of ICU transfer, intubation, or inhospital death.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Monil Majmundar","author_inst":"New York Medical College, Metropolitan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tikal Kansara","author_inst":"New York Medical College, Metropolitan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Joanna M Lenik","author_inst":"New York Medical College, Metropolitan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hansang Park","author_inst":"New York Medical College, Metropolitan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kuldeep Ghosh","author_inst":"New York Medical College, Metropolitan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rajkumar Doshi","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Palak Shah","author_inst":"SBKS Medical College and Research Institute, Dhiraj General Hospital, Vadodara, Gujarat, India"},{"author_name":"Ashish Kumar","author_inst":"Saint John's Medical College, Banglore, Karnataka, India"},{"author_name":"Hossam Amin","author_inst":"New York Medical College, Metropolitan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shobhana Chaudhari","author_inst":"New York Medical College, Metropolitan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Imnette Habtes","author_inst":"New York Medical College, Metropolitan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alasdair P MacGowan","author_inst":"North Bristol NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"David T Arnold","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Raisa Loginov","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL), Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Satu Kurkela","author_inst":"HUS Diagnostic Center, HUSLAB, Clinical Microbiology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Finland"},{"author_name":"Alexander Shpektor","author_inst":"Moscow State University of Medicine and Dentistry, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Elena Vasilieva","author_inst":"Moscow State University of Medicine and Dentistry, Moscow, Russia"},{"author_name":"Pardis C Sabeti","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Christos Kyratsous","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc"},{"author_name":"Natalya Dudkina","author_inst":"Thermo Fisher Scientific"},{"author_name":"Kuang Shen","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Med School"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Luban","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Medical School"},{"author_name":"David D.

Firearm violence is a significant public health and safety problem in the United States. A surge in firearm purchases following the onset of the coronavirus pandemic may increase rates of firearm violence. Objective. To estimate the association between changes in firearm purchasing and interpersonal firearm violence during the coronavirus pandemic. Design. Cross-sectional time series study. We estimate the difference between observed rates of firearm purchases and those predicted by seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average models. Using negative binomial models, we then estimate the association between excess firearm purchases and rates of interpersonal firearm violence within states, controlling for confounders. Setting. The 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia. Hawaii and Alaska are excluded due to missing or incomplete data. Exposure. The difference between observed and expected rates of firearm purchases in March through May 2020, approximated by National Instant Criminal Background Check System records. Main Outcome and Measure. Fatal and nonfatal injuries from interpersonal firearm violence, recorded in the Gun Violence Archive. Results. We estimate that there were 2.1 million excess firearm purchases from March through May 2020--a 64.3% increase over expected volume, and an increase of 644.4 excess purchases per 100,000 population. We estimate a relative rate of death and injury from firearm violence of 1.015 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.005 to 1.025) for every 100 excess purchases per 100,000, in models that incorporate variation in purchasing across states and control for effects of the pandemic common to all states. This reflects an increase of 776 fatal and nonfatal injuries (95% CI: 216 to 1,335) over the number expected had no increase in purchasing occurred. Conclusions and Relevance. We find a significant increase in firearm violence in the United States associated with the coronavirus pandemic-related surge in firearm purchasing. Our findings are consistent with existing research. Firearm violence prevention strategies may be particularly important during the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julia P.

Information regarding the burden of COVID-19 epidemic in HCWs living in Mexico is scarce. Here, we aimed to explore the epidemiology, symptoms, and risk factors associated with adverse outcomes in HCWs in Mexico City. METHODS: We explored data collected by the National Epidemiological Surveillance System in Mexico City, in HCWs who underwent real-time RT-PCR test. We explored COVID-19 outcomes in HCWs and the performance of symptoms to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: As of September 20th, 2020, 57,758 HCWs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and 17,531 were confirmed (30.35%); 6,610 were nurses (37.70%), 4,910 physicians (28.0%), 267 dentists (1.52%) and 5,744 laboratory personnel and other HCWs (32.76%). Overall, 2,378 HCWs required hospitalization (4.12%), 2,648 developed severe COVID-19 (4.58%), and 336 required mechanical-ventilatory support (0.58%). Lethality was recorded in 472 (0.82%) cases. We identified 635 asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections (3.62%). Compared with general population, HCWs had higher incidence, testing, asymptomatic and mortality rates. No individual symptom offers adequate performance to detect SARS-CoV2. Older HCWs with chronic non-communicable diseases and severe respiratory symptoms were associated with higher risk for adverse outcome; physicians were at higher risk compared with nurses and other HCWs. CONCLUSIONS: We report a high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCWs in Mexico City. Symptoms as a screening method is not efficient to discern those HCWs with a positive PCR-RT test. Particular attention should focus on HCWs with risk factors to prevent adverse outcomes.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Neftali Eduardo Antonio-Villa","author_inst":"MD\/PhD (PECEM), Faculty of Medicine, National Autonomous University of Mexico."},{"author_name":"Omar Yaxmehen Bello-Chavolla","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Geriatria"},{"author_name":"Arsenio Vargas-Vazquez","author_inst":"MD\/PhD (PECEM), Faculty of Medicine, National Autonomous University of Mexico."},{"author_name":"Carlos A.

A predictive model of the disease would help allocate medical resources and determine social distancing measures more efficiently. In this paper, we gathered case data from Jan 22, 2020 to April 14 for 6 countries to compare different models' proficiency in COVID-19 cases prediction. We assessed the performance of 3 machine learning models including hidden Markov chain model (HMM), hierarchical Bayes model, and long-short-term-memory model (LSTM) using the root-mean-square error (RMSE). The LSTM model had the consistently smallest prediction error rates for tracking the dynamics of incidents cases in 4 countries. In contrast, hierarchical Bayes model provided the most realistic prediction with the capability of identifying a plateau point in the incidents growth curve.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yuan Tian","author_inst":"The University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Ishika Luthra","author_inst":"The University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Xi Zhang","author_inst":"The University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Carlos A.
