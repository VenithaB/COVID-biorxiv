Apart from China, there are currently three other severely affected areas, namely Italy, South Korea, and Iran. This poses a huge threat to China's and even global public health security, challenges scientific research work such as disease surveillance and tracking, clinical treatment, and vaccine development, and it also brings huge uncertainty to the global economy. As of March 11, 2020, the epidemic situation in China is nearing its end, but the epidemic situation abroad is in the outbreak period. Italy has even taken measures to close the city nationwide, with a total of 118,020 cases of infection worldwide. 1.2 Method This article selects the data of newly confirmed cases of COVID-19 at home and abroad as the data sample. Among them: the data of newly confirmed cases abroad is represented by Italy, and the span is from February 13 to March 10. The data of newly confirmed cases at home are divided into two parts: Hubei Province and other provinces except Hubei Province, spanning from January 23 to March 3, and with February 12 as the cutting point, it is divided into two periods, the growth period and the recession period. The rescaled range (R \/ S) analysis method and the dimensionless fractal Hurst exponent are used to measure the correlation of time series to determine whether the time series conforms to the fractal Brownian motion, that is, a biased random process. Contrast analysis of the meaning of H value in different stages and different overall H values in the same stage. 1.3 Results Based on R \/ S analysis and calculated Hurst value of newly confirmed cases in Hubei and non-Hubei provinces, it was found that the H value of Hubei Province in the first stage was 0.574, which is greater than 0.5, indicating that the future time series has a positive correlation and Fractal characteristics; The H value in the second stage is 1.368, which is greater than 1, which indicates that the future epidemic situation is completely preventable and controllable, and the second stage has a downward trend characteristic, which indicates that there is a high probability that the future time series will decline. The H values of the first and second stages of non-Hubei Province are 0.223 and 0.387, respectively, which are both less than 0.5, indicating that the time series of confirmed cases in the future is likely to return to historical points, and the H value in the second stage is greater than that in the first stage, indicating that the time series of confirmed cases in the second stage is more long-term memory than the time series of confirmed cases in the first stage. The daily absolute number of newly confirmed cases in Italy was converted to the daily growth rate of confirmed cases to eliminate the volatility of the data. The H value was 1.853, which was greater than 1, indicating that the time series of future confirmed cases is similar to the trend of historical changes. The daily rate of change in cases will continue to rise. 1.4 Conclusion According to the different interpretation of the H value obtained by the R \/ S analysis method, hierarchical isolation measures are adopted accordingly. When the H value is greater than 0.5, it indicates that the development of the epidemic situation in the area has more long-term memory, that is, when the number of confirmed cases in the past increases rapidly, the probability of the time series of confirmed cases in the future will continue the historical trend. Therefore, it is necessary to formulate strict anti-epidemic measures in accordance with the actual conditions of various countries, to detect, isolate, and treat early to reduce the base of infectious agents.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaofeng Ji","author_inst":"Sichuan Academy of Social Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zhou Tang","author_inst":"Sichuan Academy of Social Sciences"},{"author_name":"Kejian Wang","author_inst":"Sichuan Academy of Social Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xianbin Li","author_inst":"Sichuan Academy of Social Sciences"},{"author_name":"Houqiang Li","author_inst":"Sichuan Academy of Social Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.16.20037036","rel_title":"Transmissibility of 2019 Novel Coronavirus: zoonotic vs. human to human transmission, China, 2019-2020","rel_date":"2020-03-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.16.20037036","rel_abs":"Objectives: The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) originating from Wuhan has rapidly spread throughout China. While the origin of the outbreak remains uncertain, accumulating evidence links a wet market in Wuhan for the early spread of 2019-nCoV. Similarly, the influence of the marketplace on the early transmission dynamics is yet to be investigated. Methods: Using the daily series of COVID-19 incidenceincluding contact history with the market, we have conducted quantitative modeling analyses to estimate the reproduction numbers (R) for the market-to-human and human-to-human transmission together with the reporting probability and the early effects of public health interventions. Results: Our mean R estimates for China in 2019-2020 are estimated at 0.37 (95%CrI: 0.02-1.78) for market-to-human transmission, and 3.87 (95%CrI: 3.18-4.78) for human-to-human transmission, respectively. Moreover we estimated that the reporting rate cases stemming from market-to-human transmission was 3-31 fold higher than that for cases stemming from human-to-human transmission, suggesting that contact history with the wet market played a key role in identifying COVID-19 cases. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the proportions of asymptomatic and subclinical patients constitute a substantial component of the epidemic's magnitude. Findings suggest that the development of rapid diagnostic tests could help bring the epidemic more rapidly under control.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kenji Mizumoto","author_inst":"Kyoto University"},{"author_name":"Katsushi Kagaya","author_inst":"Kyoto University"},{"author_name":"Gerardo Chowell","author_inst":"Georgia State University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Xianbin Li","author_inst":"Sichuan Academy of Social Sciences"},{"author_name":"Houqiang Li","author_inst":"Sichuan Academy of Social Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.16.20037168","rel_title":"Roles of meteorological conditions in COVID-19 transmission on a worldwide scale","rel_date":"2020-03-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.16.20037168","rel_abs":"The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2\/ 2019-nCoV) identified in December 2019 has caused great damage to public health and economy worldwide. Previous research has suggested an involvement of meteorological conditions in the spread of droplet-mediated viral diseases, such as influenza. However, as for the recent novel coronavirus, few studies have discussed systematically about the role of daily weather in the epidemic transmission of the virus. Here, we examine the relationships of meteorological variables with the severity of the outbreak on a worldwide scale. The confirmed case counts, which indicates the severity of COVID-19 spread, and four meteorological variables, i.e., air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and visibility, were collected daily between January 20 and March 11 (52 days) for 430 cities and districts all over China, 21 cities\/ provinces in Italy, 21 cities\/ provinces in Japan, and 51 other countries around the world. Four different time delays of weather (on the day, 3 days ago, 7 days ago, and 14 days ago) as to the epidemic situation were taken for modeling and we finally chose the weather two weeks ago to model against the daily epidemic situation as its correlated with the outbreak best. Taken Chinese cities as a discovery dataset, it was suggested that temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity combined together could best predict the epidemic situation. The meteorological model could well predict the outbreak around the world with a high correlation (r2>0.6) with the real data. Using this model, we further predicted the possible epidemic situation in the future 12 days in several high-latitude cities with potential outbreak. This model could provide more information for government's future decisions on COVID-19 outbreak control.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Biqing Chen","author_inst":"Research Center of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine, the Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hao Liang","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine, the Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xiaomin Yuan","author_inst":"Research Center of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine, the Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yingying Hu","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine, the Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Miao Xu","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine, the Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yating Zhao","author_inst":"School of Atmospheric Sciences, Nanjing University"},{"author_name":"Binfen Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine, the Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fang Tian","author_inst":"Research Center of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine, the Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xuejun Zhu","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Research Center of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine, the Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of C"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.17.20036954","rel_title":"Evaluation of recombinant nucleocapsid and spike proteins for serological diagnosis of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)","rel_date":"2020-03-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.17.20036954","rel_abs":"Background: The colloidal gold immunochromatography assay (GICA) is a rapid diagnostic tool for novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections. However, with significant numbers of false negatives, improvements to GICA are needed. Methods: Six recombinant HCoV-19 nucleocapsid and spike proteins were prepared and evaluated. The optimal proteins were employed to develop a sandwich-format GICA strip to detect total antibodies (IgM and IgG) against HCoV-19. GICA performance was assessed with comparison of viral RNA detection. Results: Recombinant HCoV-19 proteins were obtained, including three prokaryotically expressed rN, rN1, rN2 nucleocapsid proteins, and three eukaryotically expressed rS1, rS-RBD, rS-RBD-mFc spike proteins. The recombinant proteins with the highest ELISA titers (rS1 and rS-RBD-mFc) against coronavirus-specific IgM and IgG were chosen for GICA development. The GICA has a sensitivity and specificity of 86.89% (106\/122) and 99.39% (656\/660), respectively. Furthermore, 65.63% (21\/32) of the clinically confirmed but RT-PCR negative samples were GICA positive. Conclusions: The eukaryotically-expressed spike proteins (rS1and rS-RBD-mFc) are more suitable than the prokaryotically expressed nucleocapsid proteins for HCoV-19 serological diagnosis. The GICA sandwich used to detect total antibodies is a powerful complement to the current standard RNA-based tests.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pingping Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Qi Gao","author_inst":"Beijing Hotgen Biotechnology Inc."},{"author_name":"Tang Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan University School of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yuehua Ke","author_inst":"Huoshenshan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fei Mo","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ruizhong Jia","author_inst":"Huoshenshan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wanbing Liu","author_inst":"General Hospital of Central Threater Command of the PLA"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"General Hospital of Central Threater Command of the PLA"},{"author_name":"Shangen Zheng","author_inst":"General Hospital of Central Theater Command of PLA"},{"author_name":"Yuzhen Liu","author_inst":"Shijiazhuang Fifth Hospital"},{"author_name":"Luping Li","author_inst":"The Sixth People's Hospital of Shenyang"},{"author_name":"Yao Wang","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Lei Xu","author_inst":"Beijing Hotgen Biotechnology Inc."},{"author_name":"Kun Hao","author_inst":"Beijing Hotgen Biotechnology Inc."},{"author_name":"Ruifu Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Shiyue Li","author_inst":"Wuhan University School of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Changqing Lin","author_inst":"Beijing Hotgen Biotechnology Inc."},{"author_name":"Yong Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.16.20036780","rel_title":"Effect of continuous renal replacement therapy on all-cause mortality in COVID-19 patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation: a retrospective cohort study","rel_date":"2020-03-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.16.20036780","rel_abs":"Background: For the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19), critically ill patients had a high mortality rate. We aimed to assess the association between prolonged intermittent renal replacement therapy (PIRRT) and mortality in patients with COVID 19 undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we included all patients with COVID 19 undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation from February 12nd to March 2nd, 2020. All patients were followed until death or March 28th, and all survivors were followed for at least 30 days. Results: For 36 hospitalized COVID 19 patients with invasive mechanical ventilation, the mean age was 69.4 (10.8) years, and 30 patients (83.3%) were men. Twenty two (61.1%) patients received PIRRT (PIRRT group) and 14 cases (38.9%) were managed with conventional strategy (non PIRRT group). There were no differences in age, sex, comorbidities, complications, treatments and most of the laboratory findings. During median follow up period of 9.5 (interquartile range 4.3 33.5) days, 13 of 22 (59.1%) patients in the PIRRT group and 11 of 14 (78.6%) patients in the non-PIRRT group died. Kaplan Meier analysis demonstrated prolonged survival in patients in the PIRRT group compared with that in the non PIRRT group (P = 0.042). The association between PIRRT and a reduced risk of mortality remained significant in three different models, with adjusted hazard ratios varying from 0.332 to 0.398. Higher levels of IL2 receptor, TNFa, procalcitonin, prothrombin time, and NT proBNP were significantly associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients with PIRRT. Conclusion: PIRRT may be beneficial for the treatment of COVID 19 patients with invasive mechanical ventilation. Further prospective multicenter studies with larger sample sizes are required.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yi Yang","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1095 Jiefang Ave., Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Jia Shi","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1095 Jiefang Ave., Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Shuwang Ge","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Shuiming Guo","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1095 Jiefang Ave., Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Xue Xing","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1095 Jiefang Ave., Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Yanan Wang","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1095 Jiefang Ave., Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Anying Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1095 Jiefang Ave., Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Qingquan Liu","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1095 Jiefang Ave., Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Junhua Li","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1095 Jiefang Ave., Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Yong Ning","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1095 Jiefang Ave., Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Fan He","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University"},{"author_name":"Gang Xu","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1095 Jiefang Ave., Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Lei Xu","author_inst":"Beijing Hotgen Biotechnology Inc."},{"author_name":"Kun Hao","author_inst":"Beijing Hotgen Biotechnology Inc."},{"author_name":"Ruifu Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Shiyue Li","author_inst":"Wuhan University School of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Changqing Lin","author_inst":"Beijing Hotgen Biotechnology Inc."},{"author_name":"Yong Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.15.20036376","rel_title":"Development and validation of a rapid single-step reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) system potentially to be used for reliable and high-throughput screening of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-03-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.15.20036376","rel_abs":"The recent pandemic of COVID-19 has involved tens of thousands of patients in numerous countries and the causative virus, SARS COV-2 is highly transmissible.

In France, there is an increasing concern regarding the capacity of the healthcare system to sustain the outbreak, especially regarding intensive care units (ICU). The aim of this study was to estimate the dynamics of the epidemic in France, and to assess its impact on healthcare resources for each French metropolitan Region. We developed a deterministic, age-structured, Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model based on catchment areas of each COVID-19 referral hospitals. We performed one month ahead predictions (up to April 14, 2020) for three different scenarios (R0=1.5, R0=2.25, R0=3), where we estimated the daily number of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths, the needs in ICU beds per Region and the reaching date of ICU capacity limits. At the national level, the total number of infected cases is expected to range from 22,872 in the best case (R0=1.5) to 161,832 in the worst case (R0=3), while the total number of deaths would vary from 1,021 to 11,032, respectively. At the regional level, all ICU capacities may be overrun in the worst scenario. Only seven Regions may lack ICU beds in the mild scenario (R0=2.25) and only one in the best case. In the three scenarios, Corse may be the first Region to see its ICU capacities overrun. The two other Regions, whose capacity will be overrun shortly after are Grand-Est and Bourgogne-Franche-Comte.

If it exceeds 1, the number of incident cases will inevitably grow over time, and a large epidemic is possible. To prevent the expansion of an epidemic, R must be reduced to a level below 1. To estimate the reproduction number, the probability distribution function of the generation interval of an infectious disease is required to be available; however, this distribution is often unknown. In this letter, given the incomplete information for the generation interval, we propose a maximum entropy method to estimate the reproduction number. Based on this method, given the mean value and variance of the generation interval, we first determine its probability distribution function and in turn estimate the real-time values of reproduction number of COVID-19 in China. By applying these estimated reproduction numbers into the susceptible-infectious-removed epidemic model, we simulate the evolutionary track of the epidemic in China, which is well in accordance with that of the real incident cases. The simulation results predict that China's epidemic will gradually tend to disappear by May 2020 if the quarantine measures can continue to be executed.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yong Tao","author_inst":"Southwest University"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Roux","author_inst":"Univ Rennes, EHESP, REPERES - EA 7449"},{"author_name":"Pascal Cr\u00e9pey","author_inst":"Univ Rennes, EHESP, REPERES - EA 7449"},{"author_name":"Jim McMenamin","author_inst":"Health Protection Scotland, NHS National Services Scotland"},{"author_name":"Rory R.

Methods.The ChiCTR database was comprehensively searched, and the COVID-19 research registration information as of February 24, 2020 was counted. Descriptive analysis of registration time trends and geographical distribution. Chi-square test was used to compare the statistical differences between different study types, intervention methods, research phases and major sponsors. Frequency studies were used to analyze the characteristics of CMT and BI therapy. Results.232 COVID-19 studies registered at the ChiCTR Center were collected. The overall number of COVID-19 registrations was increased. Hubei Province, China has the largest number of registrations, followed by Guangdong, Zhejiang and Sichuan. There were significant differences between the number of participants (P=0.000), study duration (P=0.008), study assignment (P=0.000), and blind method (P=0.000) for different study types. Significant differences could be seen in the dimensions of multicenter study(P=0.022), of participants numbe(P=0.000), study duration(P=0.000) and study assignment(P=0.001) for the four intervention methods. There were significant differences in study assignment (P=0.043) between the early and late studies. CMT drugs with high research frequency are chloroquine, lopinavir \/ ritonavir, and I-IFN, which are all in phase 4; BI was Cell therapy, plasma therapy, Thymosin, and M\/P-AB, which are all in early stages. Conclusion.There were problems of unclear classification of research types and irregular registration behavior. Also, within the studies researched, heterogeneity exists for various dimensions. Different research types, intervention methods, and research stages lead to significant differences in some dimensions of the COVID-19 study. Finally, statistical high-frequency research drugs can provide more treatment options and evidence-based evidence for the clinical practice.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"gao song","author_inst":"Puer Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"meng qun cheng","author_inst":"Puer Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"xian wen wei","author_inst":"Puer Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Angus Cameron","author_inst":"Ausvet Europe"},{"author_name":"Mattia Prosperi","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Marco Salemi","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Faiz Elfaki","author_inst":"Qatar University"},{"author_name":"Emma McBryde","author_inst":"James Cook University"},{"author_name":"Damon Eisen","author_inst":"James Cook University"},{"author_name":"Hao Pei","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine,Wuxi No.5 People's Hospital,Jiangsu,China"},{"author_name":"Xiaojing Li","author_inst":"Department of Dermatology,Affiliated Hospital of Hebei University of Engineering,Hebei, China"},{"author_name":"Cornelia Lass-Florl","author_inst":"Institute of Hygiene and Medical Microbiology,Medical University of Innsbruck,Innsbruck, Austria"},{"author_name":"Lei Xu","author_inst":"Beijing Hotgen Biotechnology Inc."},{"author_name":"Kun Hao","author_inst":"Beijing Hotgen Biotechnology Inc."},{"author_name":"Ruifu Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Shiyue Li","author_inst":"Wuhan University School of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Changqing Lin","author_inst":"Beijing Hotgen Biotechnology Inc."},{"author_name":"Yong Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.17.20037408","rel_title":"How to improve adherence with quarantine: Rapid review of the evidence","rel_date":"2020-03-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.17.20037408","rel_abs":"Objectives: The January 2020 outbreak of coronavirus has once again thrown the vexed issue of quarantine into the spotlight, with many countries asking their citizens to self-isolate if they have potentially come into contact with the infection. However, adhering to quarantine is difficult. Decisions on how to apply quarantine should be based on the best available evidence to increase the likelihood of people adhering to protocols. We conducted a rapid review to identify factors associated with adherence to quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks. Study design: Rapid evidence review. Methods: We searched Medline, PsycINFO and Web of Science for published literature on the reasons for and factors associated with adherence to quarantine during an infectious disease outbreak. Results: We found 3163 papers and included 14 in the review. Adherence to quarantine ranged from as little as 0 up to 92.8%. The main factors which influenced or were associated with adherence decisions were the knowledge people had about the disease and quarantine procedure, social norms, perceived benefits of quarantine and perceived risk of the disease, as well as practical issues such as running out of supplies or the financial consequences of being out of work. Conclusions: People vary in their adherence to quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks. To improve this, public health officials should provide a timely, clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols; emphasise social norms to encourage this altruistic behaviour; increase the perceived benefit that engaging in quarantine will have on public health; and ensure that sufficient supplies of food, medication and other essentials are provided.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rebecca Webster","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Samantha Brooks","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Louise Smith","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Lisa Woodland","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Simon Wessely","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"James Rubin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Faiz Elfaki","author_inst":"Qatar University"},{"author_name":"Emma McBryde","author_inst":"James Cook University"},{"author_name":"Damon Eisen","author_inst":"James Cook University"},{"author_name":"Hao Pei","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine,Wuxi No.5 People's Hospital,Jiangsu,China"},{"author_name":"Xiaojing Li","author_inst":"Department of Dermatology,Affiliated Hospital of Hebei University of Engineering,Hebei, China"},{"author_name":"Cornelia Lass-Florl","author_inst":"Institute of Hygiene and Medical Microbiology,Medical University of Innsbruck,Innsbruck, Austria"},{"author_name":"Lei Xu","author_inst":"Beijing Hotgen Biotechnology Inc."},{"author_name":"Kun Hao","author_inst":"Beijing Hotgen Biotechnology Inc."},{"author_name":"Ruifu Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Shiyue Li","author_inst":"Wuhan University School of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Changqing Lin","author_inst":"Beijing Hotgen Biotechnology Inc."},{"author_name":"Yong Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.17.20037309","rel_title":"Machine Learning the Phenomenology of COVID-19 From Early Infection Dynamics","rel_date":"2020-03-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.17.20037309","rel_abs":"We present a robust data-driven machine learning analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic from its early infection dynamics, specifically infection counts over time.

Reproductive number (R) is an outbreak metric estimating the transmission of a pathogen. Initial R values were published based on the early outbreak in China with limited number of cases with whole genome sequencing. Initial comparisons failed to show a direct relationship viral genomic diversity and epidemic severity was not established for SARS-Cov-2. Methods: Each country's COVID-19 outbreak status was classified according to epicurve stage (index, takeoff, exponential, decline). Instantaneous R estimates (Wallinga and Teunis method) with a short and standard serial interval examined asymptomatic spread. Whole genome sequences were used to quantify the pathogen genome identity score that were used to estimate transmission time and epicurve stage. Transmission time was estimated based on evolutionary rate of 2 mutations\/month. Findings: The country-specific R revealed variable infection dynamics between and within outbreak stages. Outside China, R estimates revealed propagating epidemics poised to move into the takeoff and exponential stages. Population density and local temperatures had variable relationship to the outbreaks. GENI scores differentiated countries in index stage with cryptic transmission. Integration of incidence data with genome variation directly increases in cases with increased genome variation. Interpretation: R was dynamic for each country and during the outbreak stage. Integrating the outbreak dynamic, dynamic R, and genome variation found a direct association between cases and genome variation. Synergistically, GENI provides an evidence-based transmission metric that can be determined by sequencing the virus from each case. We calculated an instantaneous country-specific R at different stages of outbreaks and formulated a novel metric for infection dynamics using viral genome sequences to capture gaps in untraceable transmission. Integrating epidemiology with genome sequencing allows evidence-based dynamic disease outbreak tracking with predictive evidence.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"DJ Darwin R Bandoy","author_inst":"UC Davis"},{"author_name":"Bart C Weimer","author_inst":"UC Davis"},{"author_name":"Louise Smith","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Lisa Woodland","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Simon Wessely","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"James Rubin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Faiz Elfaki","author_inst":"Qatar University"},{"author_name":"Emma McBryde","author_inst":"James Cook University"},{"author_name":"Damon Eisen","author_inst":"James Cook University"},{"author_name":"Hao Pei","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine,Wuxi No.5 People's Hospital,Jiangsu,China"},{"author_name":"Xiaojing Li","author_inst":"Department of Dermatology,Affiliated Hospital of Hebei University of Engineering,Hebei, China"},{"author_name":"Cornelia Lass-Florl","author_inst":"Institute of Hygiene and Medical Microbiology,Medical University of Innsbruck,Innsbruck, Austria"},{"author_name":"Lei Xu","author_inst":"Beijing Hotgen Biotechnology Inc."},{"author_name":"Kun Hao","author_inst":"Beijing Hotgen Biotechnology Inc."},{"author_name":"Ruifu Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Shiyue Li","author_inst":"Wuhan University School of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Changqing Lin","author_inst":"Beijing Hotgen Biotechnology Inc."},{"author_name":"Yong Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.17.20037432","rel_title":"Favipiravir versus Arbidol for COVID-19: A Randomized Clinical Trial","rel_date":"2020-03-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.17.20037432","rel_abs":"Background No clinically proven effective antiviral strategy exists for the epidemic Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label multicenter trial involving adult patients with COVID-19. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive conventional therapy plus Umifenovir (Arbidol) (200mg*3\/day) or Favipiravir (1600mg*2\/first day followed by 600mg*2\/day) for 10 days. The primary outcome was clinical recovery rate of Day 7. Latency to relief for pyrexia and cough, the rate of auxiliary oxygen therapy (AOT) or noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NMV) were the secondary outcomes. Safety data were collected for 17 days. Results 240 enrolled COVID-19 patients underwent randomization; 120 patients were assigned to receive Favipiravir (116 assessed), and 120 to receive Arbidol (120 assessed). Clinical recovery rate of Day 7 does not significantly differ between Favipiravir group (71\/116) and Arbidol group (62\/120) (P=0.1396, difference of recovery rate: 0.0954; 95% CI: -0.0305 to 0.2213). Favipiravir led to shorter latencies to relief for both pyrexia (difference: 1.70 days, P<0.0001) and cough (difference: 1.75 days, P<0.0001). No difference was observed of AOT or NMV rate (both P>0.05). The most frequently observed Favipiravir-associated adverse event was raised serum uric acid (16\/116, OR: 5.52, P=0.0014). Conclusions Among patients with COVID-19, Favipiravir, compared to Arbidol, did not significantly improve the clinically recovery rate at Day 7.

However, to date, there was hardly any study in characterizing the immune responses, especially adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we collected blood from COVID-19 patients who have recently become virus-free and therefore were discharged, and analyzed their SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody and T cell responses. We observed SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral and cellular immunity in the patients. Both were detected in newly discharged patients, suggesting both participate in immune-mediated protection to viral infection. However, follow-up patients (2 weeks post discharge) exhibited high titers of IgG antibodies, but with low levels of virus-specific T cells, suggesting that they may enter a quiescent state. Our work has thus provided a basis for further analysis of protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19, especially in the severe cases. It has also implications in designing an effective vaccine to protect and treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chen Dong","author_inst":"Institute for immunology, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Ling Ni","author_inst":"Institute for immunology, School of medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Fang Ye","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Chui Yang Liu Hospital affiliated to Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Meng-Li Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yu Feng","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Yong-Qiang Deng","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hui Zhao","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Peng Wei","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Jiwan Ge","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoli Li","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Lin Sun","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Pengzhi Wang","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Peng Liang","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Chui Yang Liu Hospital affiliated to Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Han Guo","author_inst":"Department of Orthopedics, Chui Yang Liu Hospital affiliated to Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Xinquan Wang","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Cheng-Feng Qin","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Fang Chen","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Chui Yang Liu Hospital affiliated to Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"allergy and immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.16.20037176","rel_title":"Hundreds of severe pediatric COVID-19 infections in Wuhan prior to the lockdown","rel_date":"2020-03-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.16.20037176","rel_abs":"Before January 22, 2020, only one pediatric case of COVID-19 was reported in mainland China. However, a retrospective surveillance study identified six children who had been hospitalized for COVID-19 in one of three central Wuhan hospitals between January 7th and January 15th. Given that Wuhan has over 395 other hospitals, there may have been far more severe pediatric cases than reported. There were six and 43 children out of 336 who tested positive for COVID-19 and influenza, respectively among all pediatric admissions during the 9-day period. By using this ratio in a detailed analysis of influenza surveillance data and COVID-19 epidemic dynamics (see Appendix), we estimate that there were 313 [95% CI: 171-520] children hospitalized for COVID-19 in Wuhan during January 7-15, 2020 (Figure). Under an epidemic doubling time of 7.31 days4, we estimate that there were 1105 [95% CI: 592, 1829] cumulative pediatric COVID-19 hospitalizations prior to the January 23rd lockdown, which far surpasses the 425 confirmed cases reported across all age groups, none of which were children under age 15. Children are strikingly absent from COVID-19 reports and limited data suggest that pediatric infections are overwhelmingly mild5. Thus, our estimates for hundreds of severe pediatric cases likely translates to thousands or even tens of thousands of mildly infected children, suggesting that the force of infection from children may be grossly underestimated and the infection fatality rate overestimated from confirmed case counts alone. This highlights the urgent need for more robust surveillance to gauge the true extent and severity of COVID-19 in all ages.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhanwei Du","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Ciara Nugent","author_inst":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Benjamin J Cowling","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Lauren Ancel Meyers","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Yu Feng","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Yong-Qiang Deng","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hui Zhao","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Peng Wei","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Jiwan Ge","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoli Li","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Lin Sun","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Pengzhi Wang","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Peng Liang","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Chui Yang Liu Hospital affiliated to Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Han Guo","author_inst":"Department of Orthopedics, Chui Yang Liu Hospital affiliated to Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Xinquan Wang","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Cheng-Feng Qin","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Fang Chen","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Chui Yang Liu Hospital affiliated to Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.18.20038125","rel_title":"Non-severe vs severe symptomatic COVID-19: 104 cases from the outbreak on the cruise ship \"Diamond Princess\" in Japan","rel_date":"2020-03-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.18.20038125","rel_abs":"Background: The ongoing outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global threat.

We compared the clinical features on admission among patients who were diagnosed with asymptomatic, mild, and severe COVID-19 at the end of observation. Methods: This retrospective, single-center study included 104 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from the mass infection on the Diamond Princess cruise ship from February 11 to February 25, 2020. Clinical records, laboratory data, and radiological findings were analyzed. Clinical outcomes were followed up until February 26, 2020. Clinical features on admission were compared among those with different disease severity at the end of observation. Univariate analysis identified factors associated with symptom onset and disease progression. Findings: The median age was 68 years, and 54 patients were male. Briefly, 43, 41, and 20 patients on admission and 33, 43, and 28 patients at the end of observation had asymptomatic, mild, and severe COVID-19, respectively. Serum lactate hydrogenase levels were significantly higher in 10 patients who were asymptomatic on admission but developed symptomatic COVID-19 compared with 33 patients who remained asymptomatic throughout the observation period. Older age, consolidation on chest computed tomography, and lymphopenia on admission were more frequent in patients with severe COVID-19 than those with mild COVID-19 at the end of observation. Interpretation: Lactate dehydrogenase level is a potential predictor of symptom onset in COVID-19. Older age, consolidation on chest CT images, and lymphopenia might be risk factors for disease progression of COVID-19 and contribute to the clinical management.

Control measures, based on isolation and quarantine, have been shown to decrease and delay the burden of the ongoing epidemic. With respect to the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, recent modelling work shows that this intervention technique may be inadequate to control local outbreaks, even when perfect isolation is assumed. Furthermore, the effect of infectiousness prior to symptom onset combined with a significant proportion of asymptomatic infectees further complicates the use of contact tracing. Antivirals, which decrease the viral load and reduce the infectiousness, could be integrated in the control measures in order to augment the feasibility of controlling the epidemic. Methods: Using a simulation-based model of viral transmission we tested the efficacy of different intervention measures for the control of COVID-19. For individuals that were identified through contact tracing, we evaluate two procedures: monitoring individuals for symptoms onset and testing of individuals. Moreover, we investigate the effect of a potent antiviral compound on the contact tracing process. Findings: The use of an antiviral drug, in combination with contact tracing, quarantine and isolation, results in a significant decrease of the final size, the peak incidence, and increases the probability that the outbreak will fade out. Interpretation: For an infectious disease in which presymptomatic infections are plausible, an intervention measure based on contact tracing performs better when realized together with testing instead of monitoring, provided that the test is able to detect infections during the incubation period. In addition, in all tested scenarios, the model highlights the benefits of the administration of an antiviral drug in addition to quarantine, isolation and contact tracing. The resulting control measure, could be an effective strategy to control local and re-emerging outbreaks of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrea Torneri","author_inst":"Centre for Health Economic Research and Modelling Infectious Diseases, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Pieter Jules Karel Libin","author_inst":"Artificial intelligence lab, Department of computer science, Vrije Universiteit Brussel"},{"author_name":"Joris Vanderlocht","author_inst":"Interuniversity Institute of Biostatistics and statistical Bioinformatics, Data Science Institute,Hasselt University, Hasselt, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Anne-Mieke Vandamme","author_inst":"KU Leuven - University of Leuven, Department of Microbiology and ImmunologyRega Institute for Medical Research, Clinical and epidemiological virology, Leuven, B"},{"author_name":"Johan Neyts","author_inst":"KU Leuven - University of Leuven, Department of Microbiology and ImmunologyRega Institute for Medical Research, Clinical and epidemiological virology, Leuven, B"},{"author_name":"Niel Hens","author_inst":"Hasselt University and University of Antwerp"},{"author_name":"Hirofumi Obinata","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Satoshi Mimura","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tsutomu Kodera","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Manabu Kitagaki","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michiya Sato","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Satoshi Suzuki","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Toshimitsu Ito","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yasuhide Uwabe","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kaku Tamura","author_inst":"Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cheng-Feng Qin","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Fang Chen","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Chui Yang Liu Hospital affiliated to Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.18.20038513","rel_title":"Dynamic profile of severe or critical COVID-19 cases","rel_date":"2020-03-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.18.20038513","rel_abs":"In December 2019, a cluster of acute respiratory illness, now known as SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, occurred in Wuhan, China.

Patients admitted from Jan 14 to Feb 26, 2020 with the epidemiological history of exposure to COVID-19 were included [Model development (n = 132) and validation (n = 32)]. Candidate features included clinical symptoms, routine laboratory tests and other clinical information on admission. Features selection and model development were based on Lasso regression. The primary outcome is the development and validation of a diagnosis aid model for S-COVID-19-P early identification on admission. The development cohort contains 26 S-COVID-19-P and 7 confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia cases. The model performance in held-out testing set and validation cohort resulted in AUCs of 0.841 and 0.938, F-1 score of 0.571 and 0.667, recall of 1.000 and 1.000, specificity of 0.727 and 0.778, and the precision of 0.400 and 0.500.

Daily contacts were reduced 7-9 fold during the COVID-19 social distancing period, with most interactions restricted to the household. Children 0-14 years were 59% (95% CI 7-82%) less susceptible than individuals 65 years and over. A transmission model calibrated against these data indicates that social distancing alone, as implemented in China during the outbreak, is sufficient to control COVID-19.

Moreover, as of the 13th of March 2020, the WHO has announced that the European continent is now the main centre of the pandemic. Many European governments have already implemented harsh measures to attempt to contain the spread of the virus. In Portugal, there are, as of the 20th of March 2020, 1020 confirmed cases. One of the questions many policy makers, and governments are asking themselves is how the spread is going to evolve in time. A timely idea of the amount of cases that will exist in a near future can allow governments and policy makers to act accordingly. In this study, I applied an adapted SIR model previously used in South Korea to model the MERS outbreak, which is also caused by a coronavirus, to estimate the evolution of the curve of active cases in the case of the Portuguese situation. As some of the parameters were unknown, and the data for Portugal is still scarce, given that the outbreak started later (first case on the 2nd of March) I used Italian data (first reported case in Italy on the 31st of January) to predict them. I then construct two or three different scenarios for the evolution of covid-19 in Portugal, considering both the effectiveness of the mitigation measurements implemented by the government, and the self-protective measures taken by the population, as explained in the South Korean model. In the out of control scenario, the number of active cases could reach as much as ~40,000 people by the beginning of April. If measures are appropriately taken this number can be reduced to about 800 cases. In case that some measures are taken, but their implementation is not done appropriately, the active cases could reach circa 7,000 people. The actual figures probably lie between the interval (~800-7,000) and the peak will be reached between 9th and the 20nd of April 2020. Without control and self-protective measures, this model predicts that the figures of active cases of SARS-covid-2 would reach a staggering ~40,000 people It shows the importance of control and self-protecting measure to bring down the number of affected people by following the recommendations of the WHO and health authorities. With the appropriate measures, this number can be brought down to ~800-7,000 people. Hopefully that will be the case not just in Portugal, but in the rest of the World.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pedro Teles","author_inst":"Faculdade de Ciencias da Universidade do Porto"},{"author_name":"Maria Litvinova","author_inst":"ISI Foundation"},{"author_name":"Yuxia Liang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yan Wang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Shanlu Zhao","author_inst":"Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Qianhui Wu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Stefano Merler","author_inst":"Bruno Kessler Foundation"},{"author_name":"Cecile Viboud","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Vespignani","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"Bruno Kessler Foundation"},{"author_name":"Hongjie Yu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Wenzheng Sun","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Liping Zhang","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Qingru Han","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Juan Zhang","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Fei Pan","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Li Chen","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Zhihong Zhu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Hongju Xiao","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Yu Liu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Gang Liu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Tanshi Li","author_inst":"PLAGH"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.18.20038570","rel_title":"Extended SIR prediction of the epidemics trend of COVID-19 in Italy and compared with Hunan, China","rel_date":"2020-03-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.18.20038570","rel_abs":"Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID19) is currently a global public health threat. Outside of China, Italy is one of the most suffering countries with the COVID19 epidemic. It is important to predict the epidemics trend of COVID19 epidemic in Italy to help develop public health strategies. Methods: We used time series data of COVID 19 from Jan 22,2020 to Mar 16,2020. An infectious disease dynamic extended susceptible infected removed (eSIR) model, which covers the effects of different intervention measures in dissimilar periods, was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Italy. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credible interval (CI). Hunan, with similar total number of populations in Italy, was used as a comparative item. Results: In the eSIR model, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for COVID 19 was respectively 4.10 (95% CI: 2.15 to 6.77) in Italy and 3.15(95% CI: 1.71 to 5.21) in Hunan. There would be totally 30 086 infected cases (95%CI:7920-81 869) under the current country blockade and the endpoint would be Apr 25 (95%CI: Mar 30 to Aug 07) in Italy. If the country blockade is imposed 5 day later, the total number of infected cases would expand the infection scale 1.50 times. Conclusion: Italy's current strict measures can efficaciously prevent the further spread of COVID19 and should be maintained. Necessary strict public health measures be implemented as soon as possible in other European countries with a high number of COVID19 cases. The most effective strategy needs to be confirmed in further studies.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wangping Jia","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ke Han","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yang Song","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wenzhe Cao","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shengshu Wang","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shanshan Yang","author_inst":"Shanshan Yang"},{"author_name":"Jianwei Wang","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fuyin Kou","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Penggang Tai","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Miao Liu","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yao He","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wenzheng Sun","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Liping Zhang","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Qingru Han","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Juan Zhang","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Fei Pan","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Li Chen","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Zhihong Zhu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Hongju Xiao","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Yu Liu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Gang Liu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Tanshi Li","author_inst":"PLAGH"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.18.20038224","rel_title":"Assessing the Global Tendency of COVID-19 Outbreak","rel_date":"2020-03-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.18.20038224","rel_abs":"COVID-19 is now widely spreading around the world as a global pandemic. In this report, we estimated the global tendency of COVID-19 and analyzed the associated global epidemic risk, given that the status quo is continued without further measures being taken.Based on official data of confirmed and recovered cases until May 21, 2020, the results showed that the global , excluding China, was estimated to be 2.76 (95% CI: 2.57 - 2.95). The United States, Germany, Italy, and Spain have peak values over 100,000. Using dynamical model and cluster analysis, we partition the globe into four regional epicenters of the outbreak: Southeast Asia extending southward to Oceania, the Middle East, Western Europe, and North America. Among them, Western Europe would become the major center of the outbreak. The peak values in Germany, Italy, and Spain were estimated to be 228,000, 291,000, and 298,000, respectively. Based on the current control measures by May 21, 2020, the peak value in the United States will reach 2,114,000. The cumulative number of 51 mainly researched countries' patients might finally attain 6,542,000 (95% CI: 4,772,000 - 40,735,000). We also estimated the diagnosis rate, recovery rate , and infection degree of each country or region, and used clustering algorithm to retrieve countries or regions with similar epidemic characteristics. Several suggestions have been proposed for countries or regions in different clusters.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qinghe Liu","author_inst":"Southeast University, China"},{"author_name":"Zhicheng Liu","author_inst":"Southeast University, China"},{"author_name":"Junkai Zhu","author_inst":"Southeast University, China"},{"author_name":"Yuhao Zhu","author_inst":"Erasmus University Rotterdam, Rotterdam, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Deqiang Li","author_inst":"Southeast University, China"},{"author_name":"Zefei Gao","author_inst":"Southeast University, China"},{"author_name":"Liuling Zhou","author_inst":"Southeast University, China"},{"author_name":"Yuanbo Tang","author_inst":"Southeast University, School of Information Science and Engineering"},{"author_name":"Xiang Zhang","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Junyan Yang","author_inst":"Southeast University, China"},{"author_name":"Qiao Wang","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Yao He","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wenzheng Sun","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Liping Zhang","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Qingru Han","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Juan Zhang","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Fei Pan","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Li Chen","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Zhihong Zhu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Hongju Xiao","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Yu Liu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Gang Liu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Tanshi Li","author_inst":"PLAGH"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.19.20038729","rel_title":"Fear, Access, and the Real-Time Estimation of Etiological Parameters for Outbreaks of Novel Pathogens","rel_date":"2020-03-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.19.20038729","rel_abs":"Early analysis of outbreaks of novel pathogens to evaluate their likely public health impact depends on fitting predictive models to data gathered and updated in real-time. Both transmission rates and the critical threshold (i.e. the pathogen's 'reproductive number') are inferred by finding the values that provide the best model fit to reported case incidence. These models and inferred results are then the basic tools used for public health planning: how many people expected to be infected, at what scales of time and space, and whether potential intervention strategies impact disease transmission and spread. An underlying assumption, however, is that the ability to observe new cases is either constant, or at least constant relative to diagnostic test availability. We present a demonstration, discussion, and mathematical analysis of how this assumption of predictable observability in disease incidence can drastically impact model accuracy. We also demonstrate how to tailor estimations of these parameters to a few examples of different types of shifting influences acting on detection, depending on the likely sensitivity of surveillance systems to errors from sources such as clinical testing rates and differences in healthcare-seeking behavior from the public over time. Finally, we discuss the implications of these corrections for both historical and current outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nina H Fefferman","author_inst":"University of Tennessee"},{"author_name":"Eric Lofgren","author_inst":"Washington State University"},{"author_name":"Nianpeng Li","author_inst":"Howard University"},{"author_name":"Pieter Blue","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"David Weber","author_inst":"University of North Carolina, Gillings School of Global Public Health"},{"author_name":"Abdul-Aziz Yakubu","author_inst":"Howard University"},{"author_name":"Liuling Zhou","author_inst":"Southeast University, China"},{"author_name":"Yuanbo Tang","author_inst":"Southeast University, School of Information Science and Engineering"},{"author_name":"Xiang Zhang","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Junyan Yang","author_inst":"Southeast University, China"},{"author_name":"Qiao Wang","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Yao He","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wenzheng Sun","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Liping Zhang","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Qingru Han","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Juan Zhang","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Fei Pan","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Li Chen","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Zhihong Zhu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Hongju Xiao","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Yu Liu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Gang Liu","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"PLAGH"},{"author_name":"Tanshi Li","author_inst":"PLAGH"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"}]}
