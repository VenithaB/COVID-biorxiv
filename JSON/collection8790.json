Although case counts vary significantly between affected provinces in Mainland China, the scaling law t^ is surprisingly universal, with a range of exponents  = 2.1 {+\/-} 0.3. The universality of this behavior indicates that, in spite of social, regional, demographical, geographical, and socio-economical heterogeneities of affected Chinese provinces, this outbreak is dominated by fundamental mechanisms that are not captured by standard epidemiological models. We show that the observed scaling law is a direct consequence of containment policies that effectively deplete the susceptible population. To this end we introduce a parsimonious model that captures both, quarantine of symptomatic infected individuals as well as population wide isolation in response to mitigation policies or behavioral changes. For a wide range of parameters, the model reproduces the observed scaling law in confirmed cases and explains the observed exponents. Quantitative fits to empirical data permit the identification of peak times in the number of asymptomatic or oligo-symptomatic, unidentified infected individuals, as well as estimates of local variations in the basic reproduction number. The model implies that the observed scaling law in confirmed cases is a direct signature of effective contaiment strategies and\/or systematic behavioral changes that affect a substantial fraction of the susceptible population. These insights may aid the implementation of containment strategies in potential export induced COVID-19 secondary outbreaks elsewhere or similar future outbreaks of other emergent infectious diseases.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Benjamin F Maier","author_inst":"Robert Koch Institute"},{"author_name":"Dirk Brockmann","author_inst":"Robert Koch Institute & Institute for Theoretical Biology, Humboldt University of Berlin"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.16.20023820","rel_title":"Fractal kinetics of COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-02-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.16.20023820","rel_abs":"We give an update to the original paper posted on 2\/17\/20 -- now (as of 3\/1\/20) the China deaths are rapidly decreasing, and we find an exponential decline to the power law similar to the that predicted by the network model of \\citet{vazquez_polynomial_2006}. At the same time, we see non-China deaths increasing rapidly, and similar to the early behavior of the China statistics. Thus, we see three stages of the spread of the disease in terms of number of deaths: exponential growth, power-law behavior, and then exponential decline in the daily rate. (Original abstract) The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to grow rapidly in China and is spreading in other parts of the world. The classic epidemiological approach in studying this growth is to quantify a reproduction number and infection time, and this is the approach followed by many studies on the epidemiology of this disease. However, this assumption leads to exponential growth, and while the growth rate is high, it is not following exponential behavior. One approach that is being used is to simply keep adjusting the reproduction number to match the dynamics. Other approaches use rate equations such as the SEIR and logistical models. Here we show that the current growth closely follows power-law kinetics, indicative of an underlying fractal or small-world network of connections between susceptible and infected individuals. Positive deviations from this growth law might indicate either a failure of the current containment efforts while negative deviations might indicate the beginnings of the end of the pandemic. We cannot predict the ultimate extent of the pandemic but can get an estimate of the growth of the disease.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anna L.

This study proposes a method to estimate the cure rate and case fatality rate of COVID-19. The ratio of cumulative discharges on a given day to the sum of cumulative discharges on a given day and cumulative deaths before j days is used to estimate the cure rate. Moreover, the case fatality ratio can also be estimated. After simulation calculations, j is statistically appropriate when it is 8-10, and it is also clinically appropriate. When j is 9, based on the available data, it is inferred that the cure rate of this epidemic is about 93% and the case fatality rate is about 7%. This method of estimating the cure rate can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment in different medical schemes and different regions, and has great value and significance for decision-making in the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ying Diao","author_inst":"Wuhan University; Chongqing University of Arts and Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyun Liu","author_inst":"Wuhan Windoor Information Technology Co.

To date, few data on immunologic features of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported. Methods In this single-centre retrospective study, a total of 21 patients with pneumonia who were laboratory-confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan Tongji hospital were included from Dec 19, 2019 to Jan 27, 2020. The immunologic characteristics as well as their clinical, laboratory, radiological features were compared between 11 severe cases and 10 moderate cases. Results Of the 21 patients with COVID-19, only 4 (19%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market. 7 (33.3%) patients had underlying conditions. The average age of severe and moderate cases was 63.9 and 51.4 years, 10 (90.9%) severe cases and 7 (70.0%) moderate cases were male. Common clinical manifestations including fever (100%, 100%), cough (70%, 90%), fatigue (100%, 70%) and myalgia (50%, 30%) in severe cases and moderate cases. PaO2\/FiO2 ratio was significantly lower in severe cases (122.9) than moderate cases (366.2). Lymphocyte counts were significantly lower in severe cases (7000 million\/L) than moderate cases (11000 million\/L). Alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase levels, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and ferritin were significantly higher in severe cases (41.4 U\/L, 567.2 U\/L, 135.2 mg\/L and 1734.4 ug\/L) than moderate cases (17.6 U\/L, 234.4 U\/L, 51.4 mg\/L and 880.2 ug \/L). IL-2R, TNF- and IL-10 concentrations on admission were significantly higher in severe cases (1202.4 pg\/mL, 10.9 pg\/mL and 10.9 pg\/mL) than moderate cases (441.7 pg\/mL, 7.5 pg\/mL and 6.6 pg\/mL). Absolute number of total T lymphocytes, CD4+T cells and CD8+T cells decreased in nearly all the patients, and were significantly lower in severe cases (332.5, 185.6 and 124.3 million\/L) than moderate cases (676.5, 359.2 and 272.0 million\/L). The expressions of IFN-{gamma} by CD4+T cells tended to be lower in severe cases (14.6%) than moderate cases (23.6%). Conclusion The SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect primarily T lymphocytes, particularly CD4+T cells, resulting in significant decrease in number as well as IFN-{gamma} production, which may be associated with disease severity. Together with clinical characteristics, early immunologic indicators including diminished T lymphocytes and elevated cytokines may serve as potential markers for prognosis in COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guang Chen","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Di Wu","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Guo","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Yong Cao","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Da Huang","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Hongwu Wang","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Tao Wang","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyun Zhang","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Huilong Chen","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Haijing Yu","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoping Zhang","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Minxia Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Shiji Wu","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Jianxin Song","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Tao Chen","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Meifang Han","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Shusheng Li","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoping Luo","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Jianping Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Qin Ning","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong Un"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.15.20023234","rel_title":"The estimate of infected individuals of the 2019-Novel Coronavirus in South Korea by incoming international students from the countries of risk of 2019-Novel Coronavirus: a simulation study","rel_date":"2020-02-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.15.20023234","rel_abs":"Background: In March 2020, overall, 37,000 international students from the country at risk of the 2019-novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection will arrive in Seoul, South Korea.

Methods All confirmed COVID-19 case treated in the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen,from January 11, 2020 to February 6, 2020, were included in this study. We analyzed the epidemiological and clinical features of these cases to better inform patient management in normal hospital settings. Results Among the 298 confirmed cases, 233(81.5%) had been to Hubei while 42(14%) had not clear epidemiological history. Only 192(64%) cases presented with fever as initial symptom.

The continuous rising of infected cases has imposed overwhelming pressure on public health decision and medical resource allocation in China. We managed to forecast the infection peak time in Hubei province and the severe and critical case distribution. Methods: We used data resource according to cases reported by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (Jan 25, 2019, to Feb 28, 2020) as the training set to deduce the arrival of the peak infection time and the number of severe and critical cases in Wuhan on subsequent days. Medical observation, discharge, infected, non-Severe, infected and severe, cure and death data were collected and analyzed. Using this state transition matrix model, we will be able predict when the inflection peak time (the maximum open infection cases) in Hubei Province will occur. Also, we can use this model to predict the patient distribution (severe, non-severe) to better allocate medical resource. Under relative pessimistic scenario, the inflection peak time is April 6-April 14. The numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients will lie between 8300-9800 and 2200-2700, respectively. Results: In very optimistic scenarios (daily NCC decay rate of -10%), the peak time of open inflection cases will arrive around February 23-February 26. At the same time, there will be a peak in the numbers of severely ill and critically ill patients, between 6800-7200 and 1800-2000, respectively. In a relative optimistic scenario (daily NCC decay rate of -5%), the inflection case peak time will arrive around February 28-March 2. The numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients will lie between 7100-7800 and 1900-2200, respectively. In a relatively pessimistic scenario (daily NCC decay rate of -1%), the inflection peak time does not arrive around the end of March. Estimated time is April 6-April 14. The numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients will lie between 8300-9800 and 2200-2700, respectively. We are using the diagnosis rate, mortality rate, cure rate as the 2\/8 data. There should be room for improvement, if these metrics continue to improve. In that case, the peak time will arrive earlier than our estimation. Also, the severe and critical case ratios are likely to decline as the virus becomes less toxic and medical conditions improve. If that happens, the peak numbers will be lower than predicted above. Conclusion: We can infer that we are still not close to the end of this outbreak and the number of critically ill patients is still climbing. Assisting critical care resources in Hubei province requires the government to consider further tilt, and it is vital to make reasonable management of doctors and medical assistance systems to curb the transmission trend.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ke Wu Sr.","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Junhua Zheng","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jian Chen","author_inst":"CreditWise Technology Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Hong Yu","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhibin Zhu","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhang Xia","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yinan Su","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhenghua Ma","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yiming Zhang","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhiwei Li","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Qing He","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yang Fu","author_inst":"Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jun Chen","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Tao Chen","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Meifang Han","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Shusheng Li","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoping Luo","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Jianping Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Qin Ning","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong Un"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.17.951848","rel_title":"Structure of dimeric full-length human ACE2 in complex with B0AT1","rel_date":"2020-02-18","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.17.951848","rel_abs":"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the surface receptor for SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), directly interacting with the spike glycoprotein (S protein).

Here we present the 2.9 [A] resolution cryo-EM structure of full-length human ACE2 in complex with B0AT1. The complex, assembled as a dimer of ACE2-B0AT1 heterodimers, exhibits open and closed conformations due to the shifts of the peptidase domains (PDs) of ACE2. A newly resolved Collectrin-like domain (CLD) on ACE2 mediates homo-dimerization.

Apart from fever and respiratory complications, acute kidney injury has been observed in some patients with 2019-nCoV. In a short period of time, angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), have been proposed to serve as the receptor for the entry of 2019-nCoV, which is the same for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS). To investigate the possible cause of kidney damage in 2019-nCoV patients, we used both published kidney and bladder cell atlas data and an independent unpublished kidney single cell RNA-Seq data generated in-house to evaluate ACE2 gene expressions in all cell types in healthy kidneys and bladders.\n\nOur results showed the enriched expression of all subtypes of proximal tubule cells of kidney and low but detectable levels of expression in bladder epithelial cells. These results indicated the urinary system is a potential route for 2019-nCoV infection, along with the respiratory system and digestion system. Our findings suggested the kidney abnormalities of SARS and 2019-nCoV patients may be due to proximal tubule cells damage and subsequent systematic inflammatory response induced kidney injury. Beyond that, laboratory tests of viruses and related indicators in urine may be needed in some special patients of 2019-nCoV.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wei Lin","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan Province, China."},{"author_name":"Longfei Hu","author_inst":"Singleron Biotechnologies, Yaogu Avenue 11, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"},{"author_name":"Yan Zhang","author_inst":"Singleron Biotechnologies, Yaogu Avenue 11, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"},{"author_name":"Jushua D.

Here, we show that recombination in betacoronaviruses, including human-infecting viruses like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, frequently encompasses the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) in the Spike gene. We find that this common process likely led to a recombination event at least 11 years ago in an ancestor of the SARS-CoV-2 involving the RBD. As a result of this recombination event, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share a similar genotype in RBD, including two insertions (positions 432-436 and 460-472), and alleles 427N and 436Y. Both 427N and 436Y belong to a helix that interacts with the human ACE2 receptor. Ancestral state analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 differentiated from its most recent common ancestor with RaTG13 by accumulating a significant number of amino acid changes in the RBD. In sum, we propose a two-hit scenario in the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus whereby the SARS-CoV-2 ancestors in bats first acquired genetic characteristics of SARS-CoV by incorporation of a SARS-like RBD through recombination before 2009, and subsequently, the lineage that led to SARS-CoV-2 accumulated further, unique changes specifically in the RBD.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Juan Angel Patino-Galindo","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Ioan Filip","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Mohammed AlQuraishi","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Raul Rabadan","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Xue-Bing Ni","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Yun-Shi Liao","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Wei Wei","author_inst":"Guangxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"William Yiu-Man Cheung","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Wen-Juan Li","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Lian-Feng Li","author_inst":"Guangxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Gabriel M Leung","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Edward C Holmes","author_inst":"The University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Yan-Ling Hu","author_inst":"Guangxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yi Guan","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong, Shantou University"},{"author_name":"Jue Fan","author_inst":"Singleron Biotechnologies, Yaogu Avenue 11, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhong","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan Province, China."},{"author_name":"Shusheng Li","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoping Luo","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Jianping Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Qin Ning","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong Un"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"evolutionary biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.10.942185","rel_title":"Structural modeling of 2019-novel coronavirus (nCoV) spike protein reveals a proteolytically-sensitive activation loop as a distinguishing feature compared to SARS-CoV and related SARS-like coronaviruses","rel_date":"2020-02-18","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.10.942185","rel_abs":"The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is currently causing a widespread outbreak centered on Hubei province, China and is a major public health concern.

Our data provide support for the similar receptor utilization between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, despite a relatively low amino acid similarity in the receptor binding module. Compared to SARS-CoV, we identify an extended structural loop containing basic amino acids at the interface of the receptor binding (S1) and fusion (S2) domains, which we predict to be proteolytically-sensitive. We suggest this loop confers fusion activation and entry properties more in line with MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses, and that the presence of this structural loop in 2019-nCoV may affect virus stability and transmission.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Javier A.

Methods: The meteorological factors during the outbreak period of the novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan in 2019 were collected and analyzed, and were confirmed with those of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in China in 2003. Data of patients infected with 2019-nCoV and SARS coronavirus were collected from WHO website and other public sources. Results: This study found that the suitable temperature range for 2019-nCoV coronavirus survival is (13-24 degree Celsius), among which 19 degree Celsius lasting about 60 days is conducive to the spread between the vector and humans; the humidity range is 50%-80%, of which about 75% humidity is conducive to the survival of the coronavirus; the suitable precipitation range is below 30 mm\/ month. Cold air and continuous low temperature over one week are helpful for the elimination of the virus. The prediction results show that with the approach of spring, the temperature in north China gradually rises, and the coronavirus spreads to middle and high latitudes along the temperature line of 13-18 degree Celsius. The population of new coronavirus infections is concentrated in Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai and other urban agglomerations. Starting from May 2020, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration, the Central China Zhengzhou-Wuhan urban agglomeration, the eastern Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Shanghai urban agglomeration, and the southern Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration are all under a high temperature above 24 degree Celsius, which is not conducive to the survival and reproduction of coronaviruses, so the epidemic is expected to end. Conclusions: A wide range of continuous warm and dry weather is conducive to the survival of 2019-nCoV. The coming of spring, in addition to the original Wuhan-Zhengzhou urban agglomeration in central China, means that the prevention and control measures in big cities located in mid-latitude should be strengthened, especially the monitoring of transportation hubs. The Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration is a concentrated area of population in south China, with a faster temperature rise than those in mid-high latitudes, and thus the prevention in this area should be prioritized. From a global perspective, cities with a mean temperature below 24 degree Celsius are all high-risk cities for 2019-nCoV transmission before June.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jin Bu","author_inst":"Hospital for Skin Diseases (Institute of Dermatology), Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Pekin Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Dong-Dong Peng","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical and Marine Meteorology, China Meteorological Administration"},{"author_name":"Hui Xiao","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical and Marine Meteorology, China Meteorological Administration"},{"author_name":"Qian Yue","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical and Marine Meteorology, China Meteorological Administration"},{"author_name":"Yan Han","author_inst":"Hospital for Skin Diseases (Institute of Dermatology), Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Yu Lin","author_inst":"Shenzhen Withsum Technology Limited"},{"author_name":"Gang Hu","author_inst":"School of Agriculture, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jing Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical and Marine Meteorology, China Meteorological Administration"},{"author_name":"Wen-Juan Li","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Lian-Feng Li","author_inst":"Guangxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Gabriel M Leung","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Edward C Holmes","author_inst":"The University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Yan-Ling Hu","author_inst":"Guangxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yi Guan","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong, Shantou University"},{"author_name":"Jue Fan","author_inst":"Singleron Biotechnologies, Yaogu Avenue 11, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhong","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan Province, China."},{"author_name":"Shusheng Li","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoping Luo","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Jianping Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Qin Ning","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong Un"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.12.20022400","rel_title":"Can Search Query Forecast successfully in China's 2019-nCov pneumonia?","rel_date":"2020-02-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.12.20022400","rel_abs":"Recently the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) pneumonia outbreak in China then the world, and the Number of infections and death continues to increases.

Conclusion: It is recommended that the duration of quarantine should be extended to at least 3 weeks.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Char Leung","author_inst":"Deakin University"},{"author_name":"Wu Qi","author_inst":"Fuyang Normal University"},{"author_name":"Lv Benfu","author_inst":"University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Qian Yue","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical and Marine Meteorology, China Meteorological Administration"},{"author_name":"Yan Han","author_inst":"Hospital for Skin Diseases (Institute of Dermatology), Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Yu Lin","author_inst":"Shenzhen Withsum Technology Limited"},{"author_name":"Gang Hu","author_inst":"School of Agriculture, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jing Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical and Marine Meteorology, China Meteorological Administration"},{"author_name":"Wen-Juan Li","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Lian-Feng Li","author_inst":"Guangxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Gabriel M Leung","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Edward C Holmes","author_inst":"The University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Yan-Ling Hu","author_inst":"Guangxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yi Guan","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong, Shantou University"},{"author_name":"Jue Fan","author_inst":"Singleron Biotechnologies, Yaogu Avenue 11, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhong","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan Province, China."},{"author_name":"Shusheng Li","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoping Luo","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Jianping Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Qin Ning","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong Un"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.14.20023168","rel_title":"A model simulation study on effects of intervention measures in Wuhan COVID-19 epidemic","rel_date":"2020-02-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.14.20023168","rel_abs":"Background: In the beginning of January 2020, new unknown virus pneumonia cases started to emerge in local hospitals in Wuhan, China. This virus epidemic quickly became a public health emergency of international concern by the WHO. Enormous amount of medical supplies as well as healthcare personals from other provinces were mobilized to support Wuhan. This current work tent to help people understanding how infectious disease spread and the purpose and consequences of various efforts based on simulation model. Method: a simulation model was created using known parameters. R0 set to 3 and mean incubation time to be 7.5days. the epidemic was divided to 3 periods. Simulation would run 50 times to mimic different patient0 status. Personal activity index was used to mimic different level of control measures. 141427709 simulated patients were created. Cumulation number of patients at the end of period 1 (day50) is 2868.7 {+\/-} 1739.0. Total infected patients could be 913396.5 {+\/-} 559099.9 by the end of period 2 (day70) in free transmission state. And at day90, total patients number is 913396.5 {+\/-} 559099.9. Conclusion: COVID-19 is a novel severe respiratory disease. This will put great burden on the shoulder of healthcare workers as well as on medical hardware and supplements. Current strict control measures help to contain disease from spreading. An early detecting, reporting and fast reacting system needs to be setup to prevent future unknown infectious disease.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guopeng ZHOU","author_inst":"Peking University First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chunhua CHI","author_inst":"Peking University First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lv Benfu","author_inst":"University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Qian Yue","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical and Marine Meteorology, China Meteorological Administration"},{"author_name":"Yan Han","author_inst":"Hospital for Skin Diseases (Institute of Dermatology), Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Yu Lin","author_inst":"Shenzhen Withsum Technology Limited"},{"author_name":"Gang Hu","author_inst":"School of Agriculture, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jing Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical and Marine Meteorology, China Meteorological Administration"},{"author_name":"Wen-Juan Li","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Lian-Feng Li","author_inst":"Guangxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Gabriel M Leung","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Edward C Holmes","author_inst":"The University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Yan-Ling Hu","author_inst":"Guangxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yi Guan","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong, Shantou University"},{"author_name":"Jue Fan","author_inst":"Singleron Biotechnologies, Yaogu Avenue 11, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhong","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan Province, China."},{"author_name":"Shusheng Li","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoping Luo","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Jianping Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Qin Ning","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong Un"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.14.20022939","rel_title":"A new transmission route for the propagation of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus","rel_date":"2020-02-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.14.20022939","rel_abs":"We explore here how variation in the SARS-CoV-2 virus tropism could influence epidemic spread.

Methods Python 3.7.1 was used to write a SEIR class to model the epidemic procedure and a back propagation class to estimate the initial true infected number. The epidemic area in China was divided into three parts, Wuhan city, Hubei province (except Wuhan) and China (except Hubei) based on the different transmission pattern. A limitation factor for the medical resource was imposed to model the infected but not quarantined. Credible data source from Baidu Qianxi were used to assess the number of infected cases migrated from Wuhan to other areas. Results Basic reproduction number, R0, was 3.6 in the very early stage. The true infected number was 4508 in our model in Wuhan before January 22, 2020. By January 22 2020, it was estimated that 1764 infected cases migrated from Wuhan to other cities in Hubei province. Effective reproductive number, R, gradually decreased from 3.6 (Wuhan, stage 1), 3.4 (Hubei except Wuhan, stage 1) and 3.3 (China except Hubei, stage 1) to 0.67 (Wuhan, stage 4), 0.83 (Hubei except Wuhan, stage 2) and 0.63 (China except Hubei, stage 2), respectively. Especially after January 23, 2020 when Wuhan City was closed, the infected number showed a turning point in Wuhan. By early April, there would be 42073, 21342 and 13384 infected cases in Wuhan, Hubei (except Wuhan) and China (except Hubei) respectively, and there would be 2179, 633 and 107 death in Wuhan, Hubei (except Wuhan) and China (except Hubei) respectively. Conclusion A series of control measures in China have effectively prevented the spread of COVID-19, and the epidemic will end in early April.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bo Zhang","author_inst":"School of Environment and Natural Resources, Renmin University of China"},{"author_name":"Hongwei Zhou","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Fang Zhou","author_inst":"Beijing Key Laboratory of Megaregions Sustainable Development Modeling, Capital University of Economics and Business"},{"author_name":"Qian Yue","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical and Marine Meteorology, China Meteorological Administration"},{"author_name":"Yan Han","author_inst":"Hospital for Skin Diseases (Institute of Dermatology), Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Yu Lin","author_inst":"Shenzhen Withsum Technology Limited"},{"author_name":"Gang Hu","author_inst":"School of Agriculture, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jing Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical and Marine Meteorology, China Meteorological Administration"},{"author_name":"Wen-Juan Li","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Lian-Feng Li","author_inst":"Guangxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Gabriel M Leung","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Edward C Holmes","author_inst":"The University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Yan-Ling Hu","author_inst":"Guangxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yi Guan","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong, Shantou University"},{"author_name":"Jue Fan","author_inst":"Singleron Biotechnologies, Yaogu Avenue 11, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhong","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan Province, China."},{"author_name":"Shusheng Li","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoping Luo","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Jianping Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Qin Ning","author_inst":"Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong Un"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.17.20024034","rel_title":"Epidemic Situation of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia in China mainland","rel_date":"2020-02-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.17.20024034","rel_abs":"[Objective] Analyze the occurrence of novel coronavirus pneumonia(NCP) in China mainland, explore the epidemiological rules, and evaluate the effect of prevention and control.

We found that the cumulative number of confirmed cases from Jan 21 to Feb 14, 2020 for mainland China, Hubei Province, Wuhan City and other provinces were all well fitted with the Boltzmann function (R2 being close to 0.999). The potential total number of confirmed cases in the above geographic regions were estimated at 95% confidence interval (CI) as 79589 (71576, 93855), 64817 (58223, 77895), 46562 (40812, 57678) and 13956 (12748, 16092), respectively. Notably, our results suggest that the number of daily new confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in mainland China (including Hubei Province) will become minimal between Feb 28 and Mar 10, 2020, with 95% CI. In addition, we found that the data of cumulative confirmed cases of 2003 SARS-CoV in China and Worldwide were also well fitted to the Boltzmann function.

Method: Peripheral blood samples were longitudinally collected from 40 confirmed COVID-19 patients and examined for lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry and cytokine profiles by specific immunoassays. Findings: Of the 40 COVID-19 patients enrolled, 13 severe cases showed significant and sustained decreases in lymphocyte counts but increases in neutrophil counts than 27 mild cases. Further analysis demonstrated significant decreases in the counts of T cells, especially CD8 + T cells, as well as increases in IL-6, IL-10, IL-2 and IFN-{gamma} levels in the peripheral blood in the severe cases compared to those in the mild cases. T cell counts and cytokine levels in severe COVID-19 patients who survived the disease gradually recovered at later time points to levels that were comparable to those of the mild cases. Moreover, the neutrophil-to-CD8+ T cell ratio (N8R) were identified as the most powerful prognostic factor affecting the prognosis for severe COVID-19. Conclusion: The degree of lymphopenia and a proinflammatory cytokine storm is higher in severe COVID-19 patients than in mild cases, and is associated with the disease severity. N8R may serve as a useful prognostic factor for early identification of severe COVID-19 cases.","rel_num_authors":48,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jing Liu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sumeng Li","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jia Liu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Boyun Liang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiaobei Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hua Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wei Li","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qiaoxia Tong","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jianhua Yi","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Zhao","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lijuan Xiong","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chunxia Guo","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jin Tian","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jinzhuo Luo","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jinghong Yao","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ran Pang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hui Shen","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cheng Peng","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ting Liu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qian Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Wu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ling Xu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sihong Lu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Baoju Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhihong Weng","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chunrong Han","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huabing Zhu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ruxia Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Helong Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiliu Chen","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Pian Ye","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bin Zhu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shengsong He","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yongwen He","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shenghua Jie","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ping Wei","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jianao Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yinping Lu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Weixian Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Li Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ling Li","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fengqin Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"University Hospital of Essen"},{"author_name":"Ulf Dittmer","author_inst":"University Hospital of Essen"},{"author_name":"Mengji Lu","author_inst":"University Hospital of Essen"},{"author_name":"Yu Hu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dongliang Yang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xin Zheng","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.16.20023838","rel_title":"Risk map of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China: proportionate control is needed","rel_date":"2020-02-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.16.20023838","rel_abs":"Background China is running a national level antivirus campaign against the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Strict control measures are being enforced in either the populated areas and remote regions. While the virus is closed to be under control, tremendous economic loss has been caused. Methods and findings We assessed the pandemic risk of 2019-nCoV for all cities\/regions in China using the random forest algorithm, taking into account the effect of five factors: the accumulative and increased numbers of confirmed cases, total population, population density, and GDP. We defined four levels of the risk, corresponding to the four response levels to public health emergencies in China. The classification system has good consistency among cities in China, as the error rate of the confusion matrix is 1.58%. Conclusions The pandemic risk of 2019-nCoV is dramatically different among the 442 cities\/regions.

By February 15, 2020 in Wuhan, the total number of confirmed infection cases has reached 37,914, and the number of deaths has reached 1123, accounting for 56.9% of the total confirmed cases and 73.7% of the total deaths in China. People are eager to know when the epidemic will be completely controlled and when people's work and life will be on the right track. In this study we analyzed the epidemic dynamics and trend of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan by using the data after the closure of Wuhan city till February 12, 2020 based on the SEIR modeling method. The optimal parameters were estimated as R0=1.44 (interquartile range: 1.40-1.47)TI=14 (interquartile range: 14-14) and TE=3.0 (interquartile range: 2.8-3.1). Based on these parameters, the number of infected individuals in Wuhan city may reach the peak around February 19 at about 45,000 people. Once entering March, the epidemic would gradually decline, and end around the late March. It is worth noting that the above prediction is based on the assumption that the number of susceptible population N = 200,000 will not increase. If the epidemic situation is not properly controlled, the peak of infected number can be further increased and the peak time will be a little postponed. It was expected that the epidemic would subside in early March, and disappear gradually towards the late March.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"lianglu zhang Sr.","author_inst":"Wuhan Ammunition Life-Tech Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"kangkang wan Jr.","author_inst":"Wuhan Ammunition Life-Tech Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"jing chen Sr.","author_inst":"Clinics of Oilcrops Research Institute, CAAS"},{"author_name":"changming lu Sr.","author_inst":"Wuhan Ammunition Life-Tech Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"lanlan dong Jr.","author_inst":"Wuhan Ammunition Life-Tech Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"zhicheng wu Sr.","author_inst":"Wuhan Ammunition Life-Tech Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Wei Li","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qiaoxia Tong","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jianhua Yi","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Zhao","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lijuan Xiong","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chunxia Guo","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jin Tian","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jinzhuo Luo","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jinghong Yao","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ran Pang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hui Shen","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cheng Peng","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ting Liu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qian Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Wu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ling Xu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sihong Lu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Baoju Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhihong Weng","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chunrong Han","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huabing Zhu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ruxia Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Helong Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiliu Chen","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Pian Ye","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bin Zhu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shengsong He","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yongwen He","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shenghua Jie","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ping Wei","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jianao Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yinping Lu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Weixian Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Li Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ling Li","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fengqin Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"University Hospital of Essen"},{"author_name":"Ulf Dittmer","author_inst":"University Hospital of Essen"},{"author_name":"Mengji Lu","author_inst":"University Hospital of Essen"},{"author_name":"Yu Hu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dongliang Yang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xin Zheng","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.15.20023440","rel_title":"Evaluating new evidence in the early dynamics of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China with real time domestic traffic and potential asymptomatic transmissions","rel_date":"2020-02-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.15.20023440","rel_abs":"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19), first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019, has spread to 28 countries\/regions with over 43,000 confirmed cases. Much about this outbreak is still unknown. At this early stage of the epidemic, it is important to investigate alternative sources of information to understand its dynamics and spread. With updated real time domestic traffic, this study aims to integrate recent evidence of international evacuees extracted from Wuhan between Jan. 29 and Feb. 2, 2020 to infer the dynamics of the COVD-19 outbreak in Wuhan. In addition, a modified SEIR model was used to evaluate the empirical support for the presence of asymptomatic transmissions. Based on the data examined, this study found little evidence for the presence of asymptomatic transmissions. However, it is still too early to rule out its presence conclusively due to sample size and other limitations. The updated basic reproductive number was found to be 2.12 on average with a 95% credible interval of [2.04, 2.18]. It is smaller than previous estimates probably because the new estimate factors in the social and non-pharmaceutical mitigation implemented in Wuhan through the evacuee dataset. Detailed predictions of infected individuals exported both domestically and internationally were produced. The estimated case confirmation rate has been low but has increased steadily to 23.37% on average. The findings of this study depend on the validity of the underlying assumptions, and continuing work is needed, especially in monitoring the current infection status of Wuhan residents.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Can Zhou","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"kangkang wan Jr.","author_inst":"Wuhan Ammunition Life-Tech Co.,

Wuhan, Hubei province since December 2019, and caused a rapid outbreak throughout China and globally. Cities outside Hubei are also facing great challenge and require implementing of effective and feasible strategy in precision diagnosing novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). We described a multicenter prospective study on diagnostic strategy of suspected NCP patients from January 22nd to February 9th, 2020 in Eastern China cities. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from the patients. The epidemiological characteristics, clinical symptoms, laboratory assessments, and computed tomographic (CT) scans were obtained. Pathogen screen were performed including RT-PCR, multiplex PCR, rapid flu antigen tests and mNGS. We enrolled 53 suspected NCP patients, among whom 20 were laboratory-confirmed. Fourteen (70%) and 3 (15%) patients were positive for the first and second SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test, respectively. All NCP patients were positive for mNGS. Chest CT images and the symptoms of early stage NCP patients were similar to other viral pneumonia patients. We identified 11 of 20 co-infections in NCP cases, including regular respiratory virus, fungi and bacteria synchronously. Genomic analysis showed that 8 of 10 cases had no mutation in virus genome, while 2 cases had only one single mutation in N gene. Our study discovered that a combination of chest CT, SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and multi-plex PCR is recommended in regions outside Hubei province. Co-infection of other pathogens with SARS-CoV-2 exists and should be acknowledged. Repeated sampling, change of specimen type or metagenomics sequencing could further facilitate during critical clinical cases.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jing-Wen Ai","author_inst":"Department of infectious disease, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Hao-Cheng Zhang","author_inst":"Department of infectious disease, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Teng Xu","author_inst":"Vision Medicals Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Jing Wu","author_inst":"Department of infectious disease, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Mengqi Zhu","author_inst":"Department of infectious disease, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Yi-Qi Yu","author_inst":"Department of infectious disease, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Han-Yue Zhang","author_inst":"Department of infectious disease, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Zhongliang Shen","author_inst":"Department of infectious disease, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Yang Li","author_inst":"Department of infectious disease, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xian Zhou","author_inst":"Department of infectious disease, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Guo-Qing Zang","author_inst":"Department of infectious disease, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Jie Xu","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Wen-Jing Chen","author_inst":"Vision Medicals Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Yong-Jun Li","author_inst":"Vision Medicals Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"De-Sheng Xie","author_inst":"Shanghai Fifth People's Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Ming-Zhe Zhou","author_inst":"Simcere Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Jing-Ying Sun","author_inst":"Simcere Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Jia-Zhen Chen","author_inst":"Department of infectious disease, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Wen-Hong Zhang","author_inst":"Department of infectious disease, Huashan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Qian Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Wu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ling Xu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sihong Lu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Baoju Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhihong Weng","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chunrong Han","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huabing Zhu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ruxia Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Helong Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiliu Chen","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Pian Ye","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bin Zhu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shengsong He","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yongwen He","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shenghua Jie","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ping Wei","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jianao Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yinping Lu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Weixian Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Li Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ling Li","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fengqin Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"University Hospital of Essen"},{"author_name":"Ulf Dittmer","author_inst":"University Hospital of Essen"},{"author_name":"Mengji Lu","author_inst":"University Hospital of Essen"},{"author_name":"Yu Hu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dongliang Yang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xin Zheng","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"}]}
