Most trainees felt under-utilized and wanted to be engaged clinically in meaningful ways; however, some trainees felt that contributing to healthcare during a pandemic was beyond the scope of a medical learner. Statistically significant differences were detected between levels of training and geographic regions for satisfaction with organizational responses, the impact of COVID-19 on wellness, and state-trait anxiety. Overall, the initial disruption to medical training has been perceived by learners across all levels and geographic regions to have negatively affected their training and well-being, particularly amongst postgraduate trainees. These results provide initial insights into the areas that warrant future research as well as consideration for current and future policy planning, such as the policies for clinical utilization of medical learners during public health emergencies.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Allison Brown","author_inst":"University of Calgary - Cumming School of Medicine, Department of Medicine and Community Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Aliya Kassam","author_inst":"University of Calgary - Cumming School of Medicine, Office of Postgraduate Medical Education"},{"author_name":"Mike Paget","author_inst":"University of Calgary - Cumming School of Medicine, Undergraduate Medical Education"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Blades","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Megan Mercia","author_inst":"University of Calgary - Faculty of Science"},{"author_name":"Rahim Kachra","author_inst":"University of Calgary - Cumming School of Medicine, Department of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"medical education"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.02.20186502","rel_title":"Real-time monitoring of COVID-19 dynamics using automated trend fitting and anomaly detection","rel_date":"2020-09-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.02.20186502","rel_abs":"As several countries gradually release social distancing measures, rapid detection of new localised COVID-19 hotspots and subsequent intervention will be key to avoiding large-scale resurgence of transmission. We introduce ASMODEE (Automatic Selection of Models and Outlier Detection for Epidemics), a new tool for detecting sudden changes in COVID-19 incidence. Our approach relies on automatically selecting the best (fitting or predicting) model from a range of user-defined time series models, excluding the most recent data points, to characterise the main trend in an incidence. We then derive prediction intervals and classify data points outside this interval as outliers, which provides an objective criterion for identifying departures from previous trends. We also provide a method for selecting the optimal breakpoints, used to define how many recent data points are to be excluded from the trend fitting procedure. The analysis of simulated COVID-19 outbreaks suggest ASMODEE compares favourably with a state-of-art outbreak-detection algorithm while being simpler and more flexible. We illustrate our method using publicly available data of NHS Pathways reporting potential COVID-19 cases in England at a fine spatial scale, for which we provide a template automated analysis pipeline. ASMODEE is implemented in the free R package trendbreaker.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thibaut Jombart","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM)"},{"author_name":"Stephane Ghozzi","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Brunswick, Lower Saxony, Germany"},{"author_name":"Dirk Schumacher","author_inst":"R Epidemics Consortium"},{"author_name":"Quentin Leclerc","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark Jit","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stefan Flasche","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Felix Greaves","author_inst":"Joint Biosecurity Centre"},{"author_name":"Tom Ward","author_inst":"Joint Biosecurity Centre"},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Emily Nightingale","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sophie Meakin","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Oliver J Brady","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"- Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Graham Medley","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Michael Hohle","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, Stockholm University, Sweden"},{"author_name":"John Edmunds","author_inst":"LSHTM"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.01.20186288","rel_title":"A model assessing potential benefits of isolation and mass testing on COVID-19: the case of Nigeria","rel_date":"2020-09-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.01.20186288","rel_abs":"We consider a model with mass testing and isolation mimicking the current policies implemented in Nigeria and use the Nigerian daily cumulative cases to calibrate the model to obtain the optimal mass testing and isolation levels.

Objective: To determine the progression of disease and subsequent determinants of hospitalization. Design: A prospective outpatient cohort. Setting: Outpatients were recruited by phone between April 21 to June 23, 2020 after receiving outpatient or emergency department testing within a large health network in Maryland, USA. Participants: Outpatient adults with positive RT-PCR results for SARS-CoV-2. Measurements: Symptoms, portable pulse oximeter oxygen saturation (SaO2), heart rate, and temperature were collected by participants on days 0, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 after enrollment. Baseline demographics, comorbid conditions were evaluated for risk of subsequent hospitalization using negative binomial, logistic, and random effects logistic regression. Results: Among 118 SARS-CoV-2 infected outpatients, the median age was 56.0 years (IQR, 50.0 to 63.0) and 50 (42.4%) were male. Among those reporting active symptoms, the most common symptoms during the first week since symptom onset included weakness\/fatigue (67.3%), cough (58.0%), headache (43.8%), and sore throat (34.8%). Participants returned to their usual health a median of 20 days (IQR, 13 to 38) from the symptom onset, and only 65.5% of respondents were at their usual health during the fourth week of illness. Over 28 days, 10.9% presented to the emergency department and 7.6% required hospitalization. Individuals at the same duration of illness had a 6.1 times increased adjusted odds of subsequent hospitalization per every percent decrease in home SaO2 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.41 to 31.23, p=0.02). Limitations: Severity and duration of illness may differ in a younger population. Conclusion: Symptoms often persisted but uncommonly progressed to hospitalization. Home SaO2 might be an important adjunctive tool to identify progression of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paul W Blair","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA; Austere environments Consortium for En"},{"author_name":"Diane M Brown","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Minyoung Jang","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Annukka AR Antar","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Jeanne C Keruly","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Vismaya Bachu","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Jenny L Townsend","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey A Tornheim","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Sara C Keller","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Lauren Sauer","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA."},{"author_name":"David L Thomas","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Yukari C Manabe","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"- Ambulatory COVID Study Team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Graham Medley","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Michael Hohle","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, Stockholm University, Sweden"},{"author_name":"John Edmunds","author_inst":"LSHTM"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.01.20186130","rel_title":"24 People, one test: Boosting test efficiency using pooled serum antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-09-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.01.20186130","rel_abs":"Background: The global pandemic of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), with different prevalence rates across countries and regions. Dynamic testing strategies are mandatory to establish efficient mitigation strategies against the disease; to be cost effective, they should adapt to regional prevalences. Seroprevalence surveys that detect individuals who have mounted an immune response against COVID-19 will help to determine the total number of infections within a community and improve the epidemiological calculations of attack and case fatality rates of the virus. They will also inform about the percentage of a population that might be immune against re-infections. Methods: We developed a sensitive and specific cell-based assay to detect conformational SARS-CoV-2 spike (SARS-2-S) S1 antibodies in human serum, and have cross-evaluated this assay against two FDA-approved SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays. We performed pseudovirus neutralization assays to determine whether sera that were rated antibody-positive in our assay were able to specifically neutralize SARS-2-S. We pooled up to 24 sera and assessed the group testing performance of our cell-based assay. Group testing was further optimized by Monte Carlo like simulations and prospectively evaluated. Findings: Highly significant correlations could be established between our cell-based assay and commercial antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2. SARS-2-S S1 antibody-positive sera neutralized SARS-2-S but not SARS-S, and were sensitively and specifically detected in pools of 24 samples. Monte Carlo like simulations demonstrated that a simple two-step pooling scheme with fixed pool sizes performed at least equally as well as Dorfman's optimal testing across a wide range of antibody prevalences. Interpretation: We demonstrate that a cell-based assay for SARS-2-S S1 antibodies qualifies for group testing of neutralizing anti-SARS-2-S antibodies. The assay can be combined with an easily implemented algorithm which greatly expands the screening capacity to detect anti-SARS-2-S antibodies across a wide range of antibody prevalences. It will thus improve population serological testing in many countries.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stefan Nessler","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathololgy, University Medical Center Goettingen, Goettingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jonas Franz","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University Medical Center Goettingen, Goettingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Franziska van der Meer","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University Medical Center Goettingen, Goettingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Konstantina Kolotourou","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University Medical Center Goettingen, Goettingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Vivek Venkataramani","author_inst":"Institute of Pathology, University Medical Center Goettingen, Goettingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Chalid Hasan","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University Medical Center Goettingen, Goettingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Beatrix Beatrix Pollok-Kopp","author_inst":"Department of Transfusion Medicine, University Medical Center Goettingen, Goettingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas E Zautner","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Microbiology, University Medical Center Goettingen, Goettingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Christine Stadelmann","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University Medical Center Goettingen, Goettingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Michael Weig","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Microbiology, University Medical Center Goettingen, Goettingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Stefan Poehlmann","author_inst":"Infection Biology Unit, German Primate Center, Leibniz Institute for Primate Research, Goettingen, Germany; Faculty of Biology and Psychology, Georg-August Univ"},{"author_name":"Markus Hoffmann","author_inst":"Infection Biology Unit, German Primate Center, Leibniz Institute for Primate Research, Goettingen, Germany; Faculty of Biology and Psychology, Georg-August Univ"},{"author_name":"Joachim Riggert","author_inst":"Department of Transfusion Medicine, University Medical Center Goettingen, Goettingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Graham Medley","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Michael Hohle","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, Stockholm University, Sweden"},{"author_name":"John Edmunds","author_inst":"LSHTM"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.02.20186023","rel_title":"Digital droplet PCR accurately quantifies SARS-CoV-2 viral load from crude lysate without nucleic acid purification","rel_date":"2020-09-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.02.20186023","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus motivates diverse diagnostic approaches due to the novel causative pathogen, incompletely understood clinical sequelae, and limited availability of testing resources. Given the variability in viral load across and within patients, absolute viral load quantification directly from crude lysate is important for diagnosis and surveillance. Here, we investigate the use of digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) for SARS-CoV-2 viral load measurement directly from crude lysate without nucleic acid purification. We demonstrate ddPCR accurately quantifies SARS-CoV-2 standards from purified RNA and multiple sample matrices, including commonly utilized universal transport medium (UTM). In addition, we find ddPCR functions robustly at low input viral copy numbers on nasopharyngeal swab specimens stored in UTM without upfront RNA extraction. We also show ddPCR, but not qPCR, from crude lysate shows high concordance with viral load measurements from purified RNA. Our data suggest ddPCR offers advantages to qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection with higher sensitivity and robustness when using crude lysate rather than purified RNA as input. More broadly, digital droplet assays provide a potential method for nucleic acid measurement and infectious disease diagnosis with limited sample processing, underscoring the utility of such techniques in laboratory medicine.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Harish Vasudevan","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Peng Xu","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Venice Servellita","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Steve Miller","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Leqian Liu","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Allan Gopez","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Charles Y Chiu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Adam R Abate","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Christine Stadelmann","author_inst":"Institute of Neuropathology, University Medical Center Goettingen, Goettingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Michael Weig","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Microbiology, University Medical Center Goettingen, Goettingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Stefan Poehlmann","author_inst":"Infection Biology Unit, German Primate Center, Leibniz Institute for Primate Research, Goettingen, Germany; Faculty of Biology and Psychology, Georg-August Univ"},{"author_name":"Markus Hoffmann","author_inst":"Infection Biology Unit, German Primate Center, Leibniz Institute for Primate Research, Goettingen, Germany; Faculty of Biology and Psychology, Georg-August Univ"},{"author_name":"Joachim Riggert","author_inst":"Department of Transfusion Medicine, University Medical Center Goettingen, Goettingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Graham Medley","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Michael Hohle","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, Stockholm University, Sweden"},{"author_name":"John Edmunds","author_inst":"LSHTM"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.01.20185611","rel_title":"Examination of Isolation Rate in SIQR model for COVID-19 Epidemic","rel_date":"2020-09-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.01.20185611","rel_abs":"Newly proposed SIQR model defines exponent {lambda} of exponential function expressing daily number of isolated persons as linear equation of isolation rate q and social distancing ratio x. In order to dynamically analyze the process of COVID-19 epidemic in seven countries by means of regression analyses of {lambda}, increasing rate of cumulative isolated persons(cases), IRCC, is proposed as practical index for the isolation rate q. IRCC is correlated with q in the form of q=C*IRCC, where C is a normalizing coefficient. At first, C is formulated in two modes, one is simple and the other complex, under the constraint conditions by definition 0[&le;]x, q[&le;]1, which give allowable narrow path of C between upper and lower boundaries. Then, the dynamic locus of q-x relation is analyzed for each of seven countries including Japan and the United States using formulated isolation rate q, and characteristic q-x behavior for each country is derived. At the same time, it is shown that specific path selection of C gives almost same linear loci of q-x relation derived by mathematical sequential method imitating a bipedal walk.

Central to meeting testing demands are specimens that can be easily and reliably collected and laboratory capacity to rapidly ramp up to scale. We and others have demonstrated that high and consistent levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in saliva from COVID-19 inpatients, outpatients, and asymptomatic individuals. As saliva collection is non-invasive, extending this strategy to test pooled saliva samples from multiple individuals could thus provide a simple method to expand testing capacity. However, hesitation towards pooled sample testing arises due to the dilution of positive samples, potentially shifting weakly positive samples below the detection limit for SARS-CoV-2 and thereby decreasing the sensitivity. Here, we investigated the potential of pooling saliva samples by 5, 10, and 20 samples prior to RNA extraction and RT-qPCR detection of SARS-CoV-2. Based on samples tested, we conservatively estimated a reduction of 7.41%, 11.11%, and 14.81% sensitivity, for each of the pool sizes, respectively. Using these estimates we modeled anticipated changes in RT-qPCR cycle threshold to show the practical impact of pooling on results of SARS-CoV-2 testing. In tested populations with greater than 3% prevalence, testing samples in pools of 5 requires the least overall number of tests. Below 1% however, pools of 10 or 20 are more beneficial and likely more supportive of ongoing surveillance strategies.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anne E Watkins","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, CT 06510, USA"},{"author_name":"Eli P.

GC-FP is quantitative over a large dynamic range, providing a linear response for serum titers ranging from 1:25 to 1:1,600, and shows high correlation with both ELISA and a Luminex-based microsphere immunoassay (MIA) (Pearson r > 0.9). Compatibility testing with dried blood spot samples (n = 63) demonstrated 100% selectivity and 86.7% sensitivity. A machine learning (ML) model was trained to classify dried blood spot samples for prior COVID-19 infection status, based on the combined antibody response to S1, S1S2, and Nuc antigens. The ML model yielded 100% selectivity and 80% sensitivity and demonstrated a higher stringency than diagnosis with a single antibody-antigen response. The platform is flexible and will readily accommodate IgG, IgM, and IgA. Further, the assay uses sub-nanogram quantities of capture ligand and is thus readily modified to include additional antigens, which is shown by the addition of RBD in later iterations of the test. The combination of rapid, multiplexed, and quantitative detection for both blood serum and dried blood spot samples makes GC-FP an attractive approach for COVID-19 antibody testing.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nathaniel C Cady","author_inst":"SUNY Polytechnic Institute"},{"author_name":"Natalya Tokranova","author_inst":"SUNY Polytechnic Institute"},{"author_name":"Armond Minor","author_inst":"SUNY Polytechnic Institute"},{"author_name":"Nima Nikvand","author_inst":"SUNY Polytechnic Institute"},{"author_name":"Klemen Strle","author_inst":"Wadsworth Center, NY State Department of Health"},{"author_name":"William T Lee","author_inst":"Wadsworth Center, NY State Department of Health & University at Albany"},{"author_name":"William Page","author_inst":"Ciencia, Inc."},{"author_name":"Ernest Guignon","author_inst":"Ciencia, Inc."},{"author_name":"Arturo Pilar","author_inst":"Ciencia, Inc."},{"author_name":"George N Gibson","author_inst":"University of Connecticut & Ciencia, Inc."},{"author_name":"- the Yale IMPACT Research Team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Charles S.

Patients with COVID-19 exhibited considerable variation in disease behavior. Pervious genome-wide association studies have identified potential genetic variants involved in the risk and prognosis of COVID-19, but the underlying biological interpretation remains largely unclear. Methods: We applied the summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) method to identify genes that were pleiotropically associated with the risk and various outcomes of COVID-19, including severe respiratory confirmed COVID-19 and hospitalized COVID-19. Results: In blood, we identified 2 probes, ILMN_1765146 and ILMN_1791057 tagging IFNAR2, that showed pleiotropic association with hospitalized COVID-19 (Beta; [SE]=0.42 [0.09], P=4.75E-06 and Beta; [SE]=-0.48 [0.11], P=6.76E-06, respectively). Although no other probes were significant after correction for multiple testing in both blood and lung, multiple genes as tagged by the top 5 probes were involved in inflammation or antiviral immunity, and several other tagged genes, such as PON2 and HPS5, were involved in blood coagulation. Conclusions: We identified IFNAR2 and other potential genes that could be involved in the susceptibility or prognosis of COVID-19. These findings provide important leads to a better understanding of the mechanisms of cytokine storm and venous thromboembolism in COVID-19 and potential therapeutic targets for the effective treatment of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Di Liu","author_inst":"Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jingyun Yang","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Bowen Feng","author_inst":"University of Windsor"},{"author_name":"Wenjin Lu","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Chuntao Zhao","author_inst":"Cincinnati Children Hospital Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Lizhuo Li","author_inst":"Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"William Page","author_inst":"Ciencia, Inc."},{"author_name":"Ernest Guignon","author_inst":"Ciencia, Inc."},{"author_name":"Arturo Pilar","author_inst":"Ciencia, Inc."},{"author_name":"George N Gibson","author_inst":"University of Connecticut & Ciencia, Inc."},{"author_name":"- the Yale IMPACT Research Team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Charles S.

Objective: To determine whether D-dimer levels after anticoagulation treatment is predictive of in-hospital mortality. Design: Retrospective study using electronic health record data. Setting: A large New York City hospital network serving a diverse, urban patient population. Participants: Adult patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19 infection who received therapeutic anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis between February 25, 2020 and May 31, 2020. Exposures: Mean and trend of D-dimer levels in the 3 days following the first therapeutic dose of anticoagulation. Main Outcomes: In-hospital mortality versus discharge. Results: 1835 adult patients (median age, 67 years [interquartile range, 57-78]; 58% male) with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 who received therapeutic anticoagulation during hospitalization were included. 74% (1365) of patients were discharged and 26% (430) died in hospital. The study cohort was divided into four groups based on the mean D-dimer levels and its trend following anticoagulation initiation, with significantly different in-hospital mortality rates (p<0.001): 49% for the high mean-increase trend (HI) group; 27% for the high-decrease (HD) group; 21% for the low-increase (LI) group; and 9% for the low-decrease (LD) group. Using penalized logistic regression models to simultaneously analyze 67 variables (baseline demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory values, D-dimer levels), post-anticoagulant D-dimer groups had the highest adjusted odds ratios (ORadj) for predicting in-hospital mortality. The ORadj of in-hospital death among patients from the HI group was 6.58 folds (95% CI 3.81-11.16) higher compared to the LD group. The LI (ORadj: 4.06, 95% CI 2.23-7.38) and HD (ORadj: 2.37; 95% CI 1.37-4.09) groups were also associated with higher mortality compared to the LD group. Conclusions and Relevance: D-dimer levels and its trend following the initiation of anticoagulation have high and independent predictive value for in-hospital mortality. This novel prognostic biomarker should be incorporated into management protocols to guide resource allocation and prospective studies for emerging treatments in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaoyu Song","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jiayi Ji","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Boris Reva","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Himanshu Joshi","author_inst":"Institute of Healthcare Delivery Science, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Anna Pamela Calinawan","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Madhu Mazumdar","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital"},{"author_name":"Emanuela Taioli","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Pei Wang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Rajwanth Veluswamy","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"George N Gibson","author_inst":"University of Connecticut & Ciencia, Inc."},{"author_name":"- the Yale IMPACT Research Team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Charles S.

Objective Measure socioeconomic factors and primary language effects on the risk of COVID-19 severity across and within racial\/ethnic groups. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Health records of 12 Midwest hospitals and 60 clinics in the U.S. between March 4, 2020 to August 19, 2020. Participants PCR+ COVID-19 patients. Patients missing race or ethnicity data or those diagnosed with COVID-19 during a hospitalization were excluded. Exposures Main exposures included race\/ethnicity, area deprivation index (ADI), and primary language. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was COVID-19 severity using hospitalization within 45 days of diagnosis. Logistic and competing-risk regression models (censored at 45 days and accounting for the competing risk of death prior to hospitalization) assessed the effects of neighborhood-level deprivation (using the ADI) and primary language. Within race effects of ADI and primary language were measured using logistic regression. Results 5,577 COVID-19 patients were included, 866 (n=15.5%) were hospitalized within 45 days of diagnosis. Hospitalized patients were older (60.9 years, IQR: 45.7-75.9 vs. 40.4 years, IQR: 25.6-58.3, p<0.001) and more likely to be male (n=425 [49.1%] vs. 2,049 [43.5%], p=0.002). Of those requiring hospitalization, 43.9% (n=381), 19.9% (n=172), 18.6% (n=161), and 11.8% (n=102) were White, Black, Asian, and Hispanic, respectively. Independent of ADI, minority race\/ethnicity was associated with COVID-19 severity; Hispanic patients (OR 3.8, 95% CI 2.72-5.30), Asians (OR 2.39, 95% CI 1.74-3.29), and Blacks (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.15-1.94). Surprisingly ADI was not associated with hospitalization; however, consistent trends within racial\/ethnic groups were observed. Furthermore, non-English speaking (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.51-2.43) significantly increased odds of hospital admission across and within minority groups. Conclusions Minority populations have increased odds of severe COVID-19 independent of neighborhood deprivation, a commonly suspected driver of disparate outcomes during the pandemic. Non-English speaking also accounts for between and within minority populations. These results support continued concern that racism contributes to disparities during COVID-19 while also highlighting the underappreciated role primary language plays in COVID-19 severity across and within minority groups.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicholas E Ingraham","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Laura N.

Previous research has considered the impact of international travel restrictions on COVID-19 dynamics, but in response to the pandemic, policies that restrict travel within countries have also been implemented, and the impact of these restrictions is less well studied. On May 4th, 2020, Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) implemented travel restrictions such that non-residents were required to have exemptions to enter the province. METHODS: We fit a stochastic epidemic model to data describing the number of active COVID-19 cases in NL from March 14th - May 4th. We then predicted possible outbreaks over the 9 weeks subsequent to May 4th, with and without the travel restrictions, and for physical distancing scenarios ranging from a 40% to 70% reduction in the daily contact rate relative to pre-pandemic levels. RESULTS: We find that the mean number of clinical COVID-19 cases would have been 12.4 times higher without the travel restrictions. Furthermore, without the travel restrictions there is a substantial risk of very large outbreaks. INTERPRETATION: Using epidemic modelling, we show how the NL COVID-19 outbreak could have unfolded had the travel restrictions not been implemented. Both physical distancing and travel restrictions affect the local dynamics of the epidemic. Our modelling shows that the travel restrictions are a plausible reason why there were so few reported COVID-19 cases in NL in the 9 weeks after May 4th.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amy Hurford","author_inst":"Memorial University"},{"author_name":"Proton Rahman","author_inst":"Memorial University"},{"author_name":"J Concepcion Loredo-Osti","author_inst":"Memorial University"},{"author_name":"Saniya Minase","author_inst":"Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani, Goa-403 726, India"},{"author_name":"Namitha Sivadas","author_inst":"Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore-632 014, India"},{"author_name":"Ashutosh Mahajan","author_inst":"Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, India"},{"author_name":"Michelle L.

Its confirmation in an emerging infectious disease is usually done using time series data from several years. By using statistical regression methods for time-series data pooled from more than 50 countries from both hemispheres, we show how to determine its presence in a pandemic at the onset of the seasonal period. We measure its expected effect in the mean transmission rate of SARS-coV-2 and predict when further epidemic outbreaks of COVID-19 will occur. The obtained result in the Northern Hemisphere shows that seasonality reduced the mean growth rate in 222.5% in April 2020. A relative reduction greater than 100% should be interpreted as a reduction changing an increasing rate to a decreasing one. In contrast, at the same moment, the seasonal effect in the Southern Hemisphere increased the mean growth rate in 740.3%. Our analysis simultaneously considers other confounding factors to properly separate them from seasonal effects and, in addition, we measure the mean global effect of social-distancing interventions and its relation with income. Future COVID-19 waves are expected to occur in autumn\/winter seasons, typically between September and March in the Northern Hemisphere, and between April and September in the Southern Hemisphere. Simulations of a seasonal SEIR model with a social distancing effect are shown to describe the behavior of COVID-19 outbreaks in several countries. These results provide vital information for policy makers to plan their actions against the new coronavirus disease, particularly in the optimization of social-distancing interventions and vaccination schedules. Ultimately, our methods can be used to identify and measure seasonal effects in a future pandemic.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marcio Watanabe","author_inst":"Universidade Federal Fluminense"},{"author_name":"Proton Rahman","author_inst":"Memorial University"},{"author_name":"J Concepcion Loredo-Osti","author_inst":"Memorial University"},{"author_name":"Saniya Minase","author_inst":"Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani, Goa-403 726, India"},{"author_name":"Namitha Sivadas","author_inst":"Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore-632 014, India"},{"author_name":"Ashutosh Mahajan","author_inst":"Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, India"},{"author_name":"Michelle L.

Purpose This living review aims to critically appraise available data about secondary attack rates from people with asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data sources Medline, EMBASE, China Academic Journals full-text database (CNKI), and pre-print servers were searched from 30 December 2019 to 3 July 2020 using relevant MESH terms. Study selection Studies that report on contact tracing of index cases with asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, in either English or Chinese were included. Data extraction Two authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality and risk of bias. We calculated the secondary attack rate as the number of contacts with SARS-CoV-2, divided by the number of contacts tested. Data synthesis Of 928 studies identified, 19 were included. Secondary attack rates from asymptomatic index cases ranged from 0% to 2.8% (9 studies). Pre-symptomatic secondary attack rates ranged from 0.7% to 31.8% (10 studies). The highest secondary attack rates were found in contacts who lived in the same household as the index case. Other activities associated with transmission were group activities such as sharing meals or playing board games with the index case. Limitations We excluded some studies because the index case or number of contacts were unclear. Owing to the anticipated heterogeneity, we did not produce a summary estimate of the included studies. Conclusion Asymptomatic patients can transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others, but our findings indicate that such individuals are responsible for fewer secondary infections than people with symptoms in the same studies.

Here we use computational modeling, coupled with clinical data from a rapid antigen test, to predict the impact of frequent rapid testing on COVID-19 spread and outcomes. Using patient nasopharyngeal swab specimens, we demonstrate that the sensitivity and specificity of the rapid antigen test compared to quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) are 84.7% and 85.7%, respectively; moreover, sensitivity correlates directly with viral load. Based on COVID-19 data from three regions in the United States and Sao Jose do Rio Preto, Brazil, we show that high frequency, strategic population-wide rapid testing, even at varied accuracy levels, diminishes COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths at a fraction of the cost of nucleic acid detection via qRT-PCR. We propose large-scale antigen-based surveillance as a viable strategy to control SARS-CoV-2 spread and to enable societal re-opening.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Beatrice Nash","author_inst":"E25Bio, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Anthony Badea","author_inst":"E25Bio, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Ankita Reddy","author_inst":"E25Bio, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Miguel Bosch","author_inst":"E25Bio, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Nol Salcedo","author_inst":"E25Bio, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Adam R.

Effective use of such programs requires methods to estimate their current and anticipated impact. Methods and Findings: We present a mathematical modeling framework to evaluate the expected reductions in the reproductive number, R, from test-trace-isolate programs. This framework is implemented in a publicly available R package and an online application. We evaluated the effects of case detection, speed of isolation, contact tracing completeness and speed of quarantine using parameters consistent with COVID-19 transmission (R0=2.5, generation time 6.5 days). We show that R is most sensitive to changes to the proportion of infections detected in almost all scenarios, and other metrics have a reduced impact when case detection levels are low (<30%). Although test-trace-isolate programs can contribute substantially to reducing R, exceptional performance across all metrics is needed to bring R below one through test-trace-isolate alone, highlighting the need for comprehensive control strategies. Formally framing the dynamical process also indicates that metrics used to evaluate performance of test-trace-isolate, such as the proportion of identified infections among traced contacts, may be misleading. While estimates of program performance are sensitive to assumptions about COVID-19 natural history, our qualitative findings are robust across numerous sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Effective test-trace-isolate programs first need to be strong in the \"test\" component, as case detection underlies all other program activities. Even moderately effective test-trace-isolate programs are an important tool for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic, and can alleviate the need for more restrictive social distancing measures.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kyra H Grantz","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth C Lee","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Lucy D'Agostino McGowan","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Wake Forest University"},{"author_name":"Kyu Han Lee","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"C.

Objective: To review studies on the effect of influenza vaccines on non-influenza respiratory disease (NIRD). Methods: Using different search strategies, 18 relevant studies were identified and their strength, limitations and significance were assessed. Results: Analysis of 4 RCT datasets did not suggest increased NIRD risk in recipients of live-attenuated vaccines (LAIV) and results of a cohort study suggested short-term protection consistent with the hypothesis of trained immunity. One RCT, four cohort studies and one test-negative case-control suggested increased NIRD risk in recipients of inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV), whereas five test-negative case-control studies did not show an increased risk associated with a specific viral pathogen. Cross-protection against COVID-19 was suggested in one cross-sectional study on IIV but major biases could not be excluded. Results of four recent ecological studies on COVID-19 were challenging to interpret. Conclusions: Available data on LAIV are reassuring but not all those on IIV. A drastic reorientation of 2020-2021 influenza campaigns is probably not warranted but studies aiming to test COVID-19 risk modification among recipients of seasonal influenza vaccines should be planned and funded.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Philippe De wals","author_inst":"Laval University"},{"author_name":"Maziar Divangahi","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Lucy D'Agostino McGowan","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Wake Forest University"},{"author_name":"Kyu Han Lee","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"C.

In this research, we seek to advance the existing epidemiological models based on microscopic Markov chains to predict the impact of the pandemic at medical and economic levels. For this purpose, we have made use of the Spanish population movements based on mobile-phone geographically-located information to determine its economic activity using Artificial Intelligence techniques and have developed a novel advanced epidemiological model that combines this information with medical data. With this tool, scenarios can be released with which to determine which restriction policies are optimal and when they have to be applied both to limit the destruction of the economy and to avoid the feared possible upsurge of the disease.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mateo C\u00e1mara","author_inst":"Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Mario Miravete","author_inst":"ZZ Data Labs"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Navarro","author_inst":"ZZ Data Labs"},{"author_name":"Kyu Han Lee","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"C.

We aimed to describe and compare the demographics, comorbidities, and outcomes of obese patients with COVID-19 to those of non-obese patients with COVID-19, or obese patients with seasonal influenza. Methods: We conducted a cohort study based on outpatient\/inpatient care, and claims data from January to June 2020 from the US, Spain, and the UK. We used six databases standardized to the OMOP common data model. We defined two cohorts of patients diagnosed and\/or hospitalized with COVID-19. We created corresponding cohorts for patients with influenza in 2017-2018. We followed patients from index date to 30 days or death. We report the frequency of socio-demographics, prior comorbidities, and 30-days outcomes (hospitalization, events, and death) by obesity status. Findings: We included 627 044 COVID-19 (US: 502 650, Spain: 122 058, UK: 2336) and 4 549 568 influenza (US: 4 431 801, Spain: 115 224, UK: 2543) patients. The prevalence of obesity was higher among hospitalized COVID-19 (range: 38% to 54%) than diagnosed COVID-19 (30% to 47%), or diagnosed\/hospitalized influenza (15% to 48%) patients. Obese hospitalized COVID-19 patients were more often female and younger than non-obese COVID-19 patients or obese influenza patients. Obese COVID-19 patients were more likely to have prior comorbidities, present with cardiovascular and respiratory events during hospitalization, require intensive services, or die compared to non-obese COVID-19 patients. Obese COVID-19 patients were also more likely to require intensive services or die compared to obese influenza patients, despite presenting with fewer comorbidities. Interpretation: We show that obesity is more common among COVID-19 than influenza patients, and that obese patients present with more severe forms of COVID-19 with higher hospitalization, intensive services, and fatality than non-obese patients.

Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase; data published by Johns Hopkins University; and Chinese databases CNKI, Wanfang, and Chongqing Weipu. Reports on chest CT imaging features of children with COVID-19 from January 1, 2020, to August 10, 2020, were analyzed retrospectively and a meta-analysis carried out using Stata12.0 software. Results: Thirty-seven articles (1747 children) were included in this study. The overall rate of abnormal lung CT findings was 63.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 55.8-70.6%), with a rate of 61.0% (95% CI: 50.8-71.2%) in China and 67.8% (95% CI: 57.1-78.4%) in the rest of the world in the subgroup analysis. The incidence of ground-glass opacities was 39.5% (95% CI: 30.7-48.3%), multiple lung lobe lesions 65.1% (95% CI: 55.1-67.9%), and bilateral lung lesions 61.5% (95% CI: 58.8-72.2%). Other imaging features included nodules (25.7%), patchy shadows (36.8%), halo sign (24.8%), consolidation (24.1%), air bronchogram signs (11.2%), cord-like shadows (9.7%), crazy-paving pattern (6.1%), and pleural effusion (9.1%). Two articles reported three cases of white lung, another reported two cases of pneumothorax, and another one case of bullae. CONCLUSION: The lung CT results of children with COVID-19 are usually normal or slightly atypica, with a low sensitivity and specificity compared with that in adults. The lung lesions of COVID-19 pediatric patients mostly involve both lungs or multiple lobes, and the common manifestations are patchy shadows, ground-glass opacities, consolidation, partial air bronchogram signs, nodules, and halo signs; white lung, pleural effusion, and paving stone signs are rare. CLINICAL IMPACT: Therefore, chest CT has limited value as a screening tool for children with COVID-19 and can only be used as an auxiliary assessment tool.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ji-Gan Wang Jr.","author_inst":"Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region"},{"author_name":"Yu-Fang Mo","author_inst":"Liuzhou Workers' Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yu-heng Su","author_inst":"Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region"},{"author_name":"Li-chuang Wang","author_inst":"Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region"},{"author_name":"Guang-bing Liu","author_inst":"Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region"},{"author_name":"Meng Li","author_inst":"Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region"},{"author_name":"Qian-qiu Qin","author_inst":"Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region"},{"author_name":"Thamir M Alshammari","author_inst":"Medication Safety Research Chair, King Saud University"},{"author_name":"Osaid Alser","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, 02114, Massachusetts, USA"},{"author_name":"Carlos Areia","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Edward Burn","author_inst":"1.

The effectiveness of these NPIs has been investigated with simulation studies, that rely on assumptions and by empirical studies with few countries and controversial results. However, it has not been investigated in detail how long different NPIs need to be in place to take effect, or how long they should be in place for their maximum effect to unfold. We used global data and a non-parametric machine learning model to estimate the effects of NPIs in relation to how long they have been in place. Here we show that closure and regulation of schools was the most important NPI, associated with a pronounced effect about 10 days after implementation. Restrictions of mass gatherings and restrictions and regulations of businesses were found to have a more gradual effect, and social distancing was associated with a delayed effect starting about 18 days after implementation. Generally, effects increased until about 40 to 50 days after implementation. Our results can inform political decisions regarding the choice of NPIs and how long they need to be in place to take effect.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elisabeth Lucia Zeilinger","author_inst":"Faculty of Psychology, University of Vienna"},{"author_name":"Ingo W.

N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators (N95-FFRs) provide respiratory protection against respiratory pathogens including SARS-COV-2. There is scant literature on reprocessing methods which can enable reuse of N95-FFRs. Aim: We conducted this study to evaluate research done, prior to COVID-19 pandemic, on various decontamination methods for reprocessing of N95-FFRs. Methods: We searched 5 electronic databases (Pubmed, Google Scholar, Crossref, Ovid, ScienceDirect) and 1 Grey literature database (OpenGrey). We included original studies, published prior to year 2020, which had evaluated any decontamination method on FFRs. Studies had evaluated a reprocessing method against parameters namely physical changes, user acceptability, respirator fit, filter efficiency, microbicidal efficacy and presence of chemical residues post-reprocessing. Findings and Conclusions: Overall, we found 7887 records amongst which 17 original research articles were finally included for qualitative analysis. Overall, 21 different types of decontamination or reprocessing methods for N95-FFRs were evaluated. Most commonly evaluated method for reprocessing of FFRs was Ultraviolet (Type-C) irradiation (UVGI) which was evaluated in 13\/17 (76%) studies. We found published literature is scant on this topic despite warning signs of pandemic of a respiratory illness over the years. Promising technologies requiring expeditious evaluation are UVGI, Microwave generated steam (MGS) and Hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV). Global presence of technologies, which have been given Emergency use authorisation for N95-FFR reprocessing, is extremely limited. Reprocessing of N95-FFRs by MGS should be considered for emergency implementation in resource limited settings to tackle shortage of N95-FFRs.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Diptanu Paul","author_inst":"AIIMS Bhopal"},{"author_name":"Ayush Gupta","author_inst":"AIIMS Bhopal"},{"author_name":"Anand Kumar Maurya","author_inst":"AIIMS Bhopal"},{"author_name":"Clemens Zauchner","author_inst":"IT Power Services GmbH, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Guang-bing Liu","author_inst":"Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region"},{"author_name":"Meng Li","author_inst":"Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region"},{"author_name":"Qian-qiu Qin","author_inst":"Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region"},{"author_name":"Thamir M Alshammari","author_inst":"Medication Safety Research Chair, King Saud University"},{"author_name":"Osaid Alser","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, 02114, Massachusetts, USA"},{"author_name":"Carlos Areia","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Edward Burn","author_inst":"1.

To estimate the burden of the disease with time it is important to undertake a longitudinal seroprevalence study which will also help to understand the stability of anti SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Various studies have been conducted worldwide to assess the antibody stability. However, there is very limited data available from India. Healthcare workers (HCW) are the frontline workforce and more exposed to the COVID-19 infection (SARS-CoV-2) compared to the community. This study was conceptualized with an aim to estimate the seroprevalence in hospital and general population and determine the stability of anti SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in HCW. Methods: Staff of a tertiary care hospital in Delhi and individuals visiting that hospital were recruited between April to August 2020. Venous blood sample, demographic, clinical, COVID-19 symptoms, and RT-PCR data was collected from all participants. Serological testing was performed using the electro-chemiluminescence based assay developed by Roche Diagnostics, in Cobas Elecsys 411. Seropositive participants were followed- upto 83 days to check for the presence of antibodies. Results: A total of 780 participants were included in this study, which comprised 448 HCW and 332 individuals from the general population. Among the HCW, seroprevalence rates increased from 2.3% in April to 50.6% in July. The cumulative prevalence was 16.5% in HCW and 23.5% (78\/332) in the general population with a large number of asymptomatic individuals. Out of 74 seropositive HCWs, 51 were followed-up for the duration of this study. We observed that in all seropositive cases the antibodies were sustained even up to 83 days. Conclusion: The cumulative prevalence of seropositivity was lower in HCWs than the general population. There were a large number of asymptomatic cases and the antibodies developed persisted through the duration of the study. More such longitudinal serology studies are needed to better understand the antibody response kinetics.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samreen Siddiqui","author_inst":"Institute of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism Max Healthcare, Max Super Speciality Hospital, Saket, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Salwa Naushin","author_inst":"2 CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology,New Delhi-110025,  India,Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad-201002, India"},{"author_name":"Shalini Pradhan","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology,New Delhi-110025, India"},{"author_name":"Archa Misra","author_inst":"Institute of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, Max Healthcare, Max Super Speciality      Hospital, Saket,New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Akansha Tyagi","author_inst":"Institute of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, Max Healthcare, Max Super Speciality      Hospital, Saket,New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Menka Loomba","author_inst":"Institute of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, Max Healthcare, Max Super Speciality      Hospital, Saket,New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Swati Waghdhare","author_inst":"Institute of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, Max Healthcare, Max Super Speciality  Hospital, Saket,New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Rajesh Pandey","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology,New Delhi-110025, India"},{"author_name":"Shantanu Sengupta","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology,New Delhi-110025, India"},{"author_name":"Sujeet Jha","author_inst":"Institute of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, Max Healthcare, Max Super Speciality Hospital, Saket,New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Edward Burn","author_inst":"1.

Across all HEIs it is estimated that there will be a total of approximately 700 COVID-19 cases (95% CI: 640 - 750) arriving on campus of which 380 are associated from UK students, 230 from international and 90 from staff. This assumes all students will return to campus and that student numbers and where they come from are similar to previous years. According to the current UK government guidance approximately 237,370 students arriving on campus will be required to quarantine because they come from countries outwith designated travel corridors. Assuming quarantining is 100% efficient this will potentially reduce the overall number of cases by approximately 20% to 540 (95% CI: 500 - 590). Universities must plan for COVID-19 cases to arrive on campus and facilitate mitigations to reduce the spread of disease. It is likely that the first two weeks will be crucial to stop spread of introduced cases. Following that, the risk of introduction of new cases onto campus will be from interactions between students, staff and the local community as well as students travelling off campus for personal, educational or recreational reasons.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Francisco Perez-Reche","author_inst":"University of Aberdeen"},{"author_name":"Norval Strachan","author_inst":"University of Aberdeen"},{"author_name":"Shalini Pradhan","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology,New Delhi-110025, India"},{"author_name":"Archa Misra","author_inst":"Institute of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, Max Healthcare, Max Super Speciality      Hospital, Saket,New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Akansha Tyagi","author_inst":"Institute of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, Max Healthcare, Max Super Speciality      Hospital, Saket,New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Menka Loomba","author_inst":"Institute of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, Max Healthcare, Max Super Speciality      Hospital, Saket,New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Swati Waghdhare","author_inst":"Institute of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, Max Healthcare, Max Super Speciality  Hospital, Saket,New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Rajesh Pandey","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology,New Delhi-110025, India"},{"author_name":"Shantanu Sengupta","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology,New Delhi-110025, India"},{"author_name":"Sujeet Jha","author_inst":"Institute of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, Max Healthcare, Max Super Speciality Hospital, Saket,New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Edward Burn","author_inst":"1.

In February 2020, the disease was named \"coronavirus disease 2019\" (COVID-19). COVID-19 became a pandemic in March 2020, and, since then, different countries have implemented a broad spectrum of policies. Thailand is considered to be among the top countries in handling its first wave of the outbreak -- 12 January to 31 July 2020. Here, we illustrate how Thailand tackled the COVID-19 outbreak, particularly the effects of public health interventions on the epidemiological spread. This study shows how the available data from the outbreak can be analyzed and visualized to quantify the severity of the outbreak, the effectiveness of the interventions, and the level of risk of allowed activities during an easing of a \"lockdown.\" This study shows how a well-organized governmental apparatus can overcome the havoc caused by a pandemic.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sipat Dr. Triukose","author_inst":"Research group on Applied Digital Technology in Medicine (ATM) and Chulalongkorn University Big Data Analytics and IoT Center (CUBIC), Chulalongkorn University"},{"author_name":"Sirin Dr. Nitinawarat","author_inst":"International School of Engineering, Faculty of Engineering and Research group on Applied Digital Technology in Medicine (ATM), Chulalongkorn University"},{"author_name":"Ponlapat Satian","author_inst":"Lansaka Hospital, Office of the permanent secretary, Ministry of Public Health, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Anupap Dr. Somboonsavatdee","author_inst":"Greater Data Science Lab, Department of Statistics, Chulalongkorn Business School, 15 Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Ponlachart Dr. Chotikarn","author_inst":"Marine and Coastal Resources Institute, Faculty of Environmental Management, Coastal Oceanography and Climate Change Research Center, Prince of Songkla Universi"},{"author_name":"Thunchanok Thammasanya","author_inst":"TrueEye Company Limited, Bangkok, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Nasamon Wanlapakorn","author_inst":"Center of Excellence in Clinical Virology, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, 22 Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Natthinee Dr. Sudhinaraset","author_inst":"Center of Excellence in Clinical Virology, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Pitakpol Dr. Boonyamalik","author_inst":"Office of the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Public Health, Bangkok, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Bancha Kakhong","author_inst":"Department of Health, Ministry of Public Health, Bangkok, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Yong Poovorawan","author_inst":"Center of Excellence in Clinical Virology, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Paula Casajust","author_inst":"Real-World Evidence, Trial Form Support, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Dalia Dawoud","author_inst":"Cairo University, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo, Egypt"},{"author_name":"Scott L DuVall","author_inst":"1.VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure, VA Salt Lake City Health Care System, Salt Lake City, UT, USA 2.

The study will provide evidence for the UK Office of Veterans' Affairs (OVA), UK stakeholders supporting the ex-service community, and evidence to inform our international counterparts working with ex-service communities in allied countries regarding the impact of COVID-19 on the health and wellbeing of ex-service personnel. Methods and analysis Participants were eligible to participate if they lived in the UK, had Regular service history from the UK Armed Forces and had previously completed the King's Centre for Military Health Research (KCMHR) Health and Wellbeing survey between 2014-2016. Participants who met these criteria were recruited through email to take part in an online questionnaire. The study provides additional quantitative longitudinal data on this sub-sample. Data are being collected June 2020-September 2020. Specific measures are used to capture participants' COVID-19 experiences, health and wellbeing status and lifestyle behaviours. Other key topics will include questions regarding the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on employment, finances, volunteering, charitable giving, accommodation and living arrangements, help-seeking behaviours, as well as any potential positive changes during this period. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been gained from King's College London Research Ethics Committee (Ref: HR-19\/20-18626). Participants were provided with information and agreed to a series of consent statements before enrolment. Data are kept on secure servers with access to personally identifiable information limited.
