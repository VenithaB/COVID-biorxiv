The objective of the study was to report the clinical manifestation of both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19-positive patients. Methods: A online-based cross-sectional survey was conducted for initial recruitment of participants with subsequent telephone interview by the three trained physicians in 237 adults with confirmed COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh. The study period was between 27 April to 26th May, 2020. Consent was ensured before commencing the interview. Collected data were entered in a predesigned case report form and subsequently analyzed by SPSS 20. Results: The mean age at presentation was 41.59 (13.73 SD) years and most of the cases were male (73%). A total of 90.29% of patients reside in urban areas. Among the positive cases, 13.1% (n=31) were asymptomatic. Asymptomatic cases were significantly more common in households with 2 to 4 members (p=.008). Both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients shared similar ages of presentation (p=0.23), gender differences (p=0.30), and comorbidities (p=0.11). Only 5.3% of patients received ICU care during their treatment. The most frequent presentation was fever (88.3%), followed by cough (69.9%), chest pain (34.5%), body ache (31.1%), and sore throat (30.1%). Thirty-nine percent (n=92) of the patients had comorbidities, with diabetes and hypertension being the most frequently observed. Conclusion: There has been an upsurge in COVID-19 cases in Bangladesh. Patients were mostly middle-aged and male. Typical presentations were fever and cough. Maintenance of social distancing and increased testing are required to meet the current public health challenge.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammad Jahid Hasan","author_inst":"Pi Research Consultancy Center"},{"author_name":"Sayeda Mukta Chowdhury","author_inst":"Pi Research Consultancy Center"},{"author_name":"Md Abdullah Saeed Khan","author_inst":"Pi Research Consultancy Center"},{"author_name":"Monjur Rahaman","author_inst":"Pi Research Consultancy Center"},{"author_name":"Jannatul Fardous","author_inst":"Pi Research Consultancy Center"},{"author_name":"Tanjir Adit","author_inst":"Keranigonj Health Complex"},{"author_name":"Mustafizur Rahman","author_inst":"Kuet Moitri Hospital, Dhaka"},{"author_name":"Md.

However, the extent to which assay signals relate to exhaled virus is unknown. We investigated the use of novel, non-invasive face-mask sampling (FMS) to detect exhaled SARS-CoV-2 RNA in two studies. Methods In an outbreak study (cohort 1), we performed FMS and NPS for 21 consecutive days after diagnosis on six healthcare workers who were screened positive for SARS-CoV-2. In a second hospitalised cohort (cohort 2), we performed FMS on 47 patients within 24 hours of a positive diagnosis. COVID-19 severity was graded according to WHO recommendations. Findings In cohort 1, SARS-COV-2 was detected by FMS in 10\/40 (25%) samples (4\/6 individuals), with no correlation between NPS and FMS RNA signals. All samples were negative by day 14 post diagnosis. Sustained FMS positivity with higher viral RNA signals showed a trend towards disease severity. In cohort 2, 19\/47 (40%) individuals exhaled SARS-CoV-2 RNA extending over five orders of magnitude. FMS positive participants were older (positive: median age [IQR] 71 [61-84] vs negative: 61 [45-73], p=0.04) with more comorbidities (positive: 2 [1-3] vs negative: 1 [0-2], p<0.001) and have active cough (positive: 68% vs negative: 24%, p=0.003) and breathlessness (positive: 74% vs negative: 32%, p=0.005) during sampling, compared to FMS negative patients. Of five patients who were FMS positive and asymptomatic at time of sampling, two died of severe COVID-19 pneumonia within one month of follow up. Interpretation FMS detects exhaled SARS-COV-2, with stronger signals in those who develop severe disease.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Caroline Williams","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Daniel Pan","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Decker","author_inst":"University of leicester"},{"author_name":"Anika Wisniewska","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Shirley Sze","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Eve Fletcher","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Richard Haigh","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Mohamad Abdulwhhab","author_inst":"University of leicester"},{"author_name":"Paul Bird","author_inst":"University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Christopher Holmes","author_inst":"University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Alaa Al-Taie","author_inst":"Al-Nahrain University"},{"author_name":"Baber Saleem","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Jingzhe Pan","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Natalie Garton","author_inst":"University of leicester"},{"author_name":"Manish Pareek","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Michael Barer","author_inst":"University of leicester"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.19.20172924","rel_title":"First study on surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater systems and related environments in Wuhan: Post-lockdown","rel_date":"2020-08-21","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.19.20172924","rel_abs":"Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has emerged as an effective environmental surveillance tool in monitoring fecal-oral pathogen infections within a community. Congruently, SARS-CoV-2 virus, the etiologic agent of COVID-19, has been demonstrated to infect the gastrointestinal tissues, and be shed in feces. In the present study, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was concentrated from wastewater, sludge, surface water, ground water, and soil samples of municipal and hospital wastewater systems and related environment in Wuhan during the COVID-19 middle and low risk periods, and the viral RNA copies quantified using RT-qPCR. From the findings of this study, during the middle risk period, one influent sample and three secondary treatment effluents collected from Waste Water Treatment Plant 2 (WWTP2), as well as two influent samples from wastewater system of Hospital 2 were SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive. One sludge sample collected from Hospital 4; which was obtained during low risk period, was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. These study findings demonstrate the significance of WBE in continuous surveilling and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 at the community level, even when the COVID19 prevalence is low. Therefore, the application of WBE is principally useful in tracking the level of infections in communities and the risk assessment of the secondary environment.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lu Zhao","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, Ch"},{"author_name":"Evans Atoni","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, Ch"},{"author_name":"Yao Du","author_inst":"School of Environmental Studies, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan), Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Huaiyu Zhang","author_inst":"Central and Southern China Municipal Design & Research Institute Co., Ltd., Wuhan China"},{"author_name":"Oscar Donde","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Science, Egerton University, P.

This study presents a computational model of virus propagation within the respiratory tract network. The model includes the generation network branch structure of the respiratory tract, biophysical and infectivity properties of the virus, as well as air flow models that aid the circulation of the virus particles. The model can also consider the impact of the immune response aim to inhibit virus replication and spread. The model was applied to the SARS-CoV-2 virus by integrating data on its life-cycle, as well as density of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE2) expressing cells along the respiratory tract network.

The cause of these complications is not yet known, and whether they are due to a direct infection of neural cells, such as neurons and astrocytes, or through indirect effects on supportive brain cells, is unknown. Here, we use brain organoids to examine SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism. We examine expression of the key viral receptor ACE2 in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) revealing that only a subset of choroid plexus cells but not neurons or neural progenitors express this entry factor. We then challenge organoids with both SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudovirus and live virus to demonstrate high viral tropism for choroid plexus epithelial cells but not stromal cells, and little to no infection of neurons or glia. We find that infected cells of the choroid plexus are an apolipoprotein and ACE2 expressing subset of epithelial barrier cells. Finally, we show that infection with live SARS-CoV-2 leads to barrier breakdown of the choroid plexus. These findings suggest that neurological complications may result from effects on the choroid plexus, an important barrier that normally prevents entry of immune cells and cytokines into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Laura Pellegrini","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Anna Albecka","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Donna L Mallery","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Max J Kellner","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"David Paul","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Andrew P Carter","author_inst":"MRC Lab of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Leo C James","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Madeline A Lancaster","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Zhu Shu","author_inst":"School of Environmental Studies, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan), Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Zhiming Yuan","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, Ch"},{"author_name":"Lei Tong","author_inst":"School of Environmental Studies, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan), Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Han Xia","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, Ch"},{"author_name":"Jingzhe Pan","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Natalie Garton","author_inst":"University of leicester"},{"author_name":"Manish Pareek","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Michael Barer","author_inst":"University of leicester"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"neuroscience"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.19.257022","rel_title":"Targeting pentose phosphate pathway for SARS-CoV-2 therapy","rel_date":"2020-08-21","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.19.257022","rel_abs":"It becomes more and more obvious that deregulation of host metabolism play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis with implication for increased risk of severe course of COVID-19.

Thereby understanding the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection on host metabolism can facilitate efforts for effective treatment option. We have previously shown that SARS-CoV-2-infected cells undergo a shift towards glycolysis and that 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication. Here, we show that also pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is remarkably deregulated. Since PPP supplies ribonucleotides for SARS-CoV-2 replication, this could represent an attractive target for an intervention. On that account, we employed the transketolase inhibitor benfooxythiamine and showed dose-dependent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in non-toxic concentrations. Importantly, the antiviral efficacy of benfooxythiamine was further increased in combination with 2DG.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Denisa Bojkova","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Virology"},{"author_name":"Rui Costa","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Marco Bechtel","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Virology"},{"author_name":"Sandra Ciesek","author_inst":"Goethe Universtiy Frankfurt"},{"author_name":"Martin Michaelis","author_inst":"University of Kent"},{"author_name":"Jindrich Cinatl Jr.","author_inst":"Klinikum der Goethe-Universitaet"},{"author_name":"Leo C James","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Madeline A Lancaster","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Zhu Shu","author_inst":"School of Environmental Studies, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan), Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Zhiming Yuan","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, Ch"},{"author_name":"Lei Tong","author_inst":"School of Environmental Studies, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan), Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Han Xia","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, Ch"},{"author_name":"Jingzhe Pan","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Natalie Garton","author_inst":"University of leicester"},{"author_name":"Manish Pareek","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Michael Barer","author_inst":"University of leicester"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.20.259721","rel_title":"Temporal landscape of mutation accumulation in SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Bangladesh: possible implications from the ongoing outbreak in Bangladesh","rel_date":"2020-08-21","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.20.259721","rel_abs":"Along with intrinsic evolution, adaptation to selective pressure in new environments might have resulted in the circulatory SARS-CoV-2 strains in response to the geoenvironmental conditions of a country and the demographic profile of its population.

With this target, the current study traced the evolutionary route and mutational frequency of 198 Bangladesh originated SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences available in the GISAID platform over a period of 13 weeks as of 14 July 2020. The analyses were performed using MEGA 7, Swiss Model Repository, Virus Pathogen Resource and Jalview visualization. Our analysis identified that majority of the circulating strains in the country belong to B and\/or L type among cluster A to Z and strikingly differ from both the reference genome and the first sequenced genome from Bangladesh. Mutations in Nonspecific protein 2 (NSP2), NSP3, RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), Helicase, Spike, ORF3a, and Nucleocapsid (N) protein were common in the circulating strains with varying degrees and the most unique mutations(UM) were found in NSP3 (UM-18). But no or limited changes were observed in NSP9, NSP11, E (Envelope), NSP7a, ORF 6, and ORF 7b suggesting the possible conserved functions of those proteins in SARS-CoV-2 propagation. However, along with D614G mutation, more than 20 different mutations in the Spike protein were detected basically in the S2 domain. Besides, mutations in SR-rich region of N protein and P323L in RDRP were also present. However, the mutation accumulation showed an association with sex and age of the COVID-19 positive cases. So, identification of these mutational accumulation patterns may greatly facilitate drug\/ vaccine development deciphering the age and the sex dependent differential susceptibility to COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Otun Saha","author_inst":"Dhaka University"},{"author_name":"Rokaiya Nurani Shatadru","author_inst":"University of Dhaka"},{"author_name":"Nadira Naznin Rakhi","author_inst":"Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Science and Technology University"},{"author_name":"Israt Islam","author_inst":"University of Dhaka"},{"author_name":"Md.

Like in SARS-CoV, horseshoe bats currently represent the most likely candidate animal source for SARS-CoV-2. Yet, the specific mechanisms of cross-species transmission and adaptation to the human host remain unknown. Here we show that the unsupervised analysis of conservation patterns across the {beta}-CoV spike protein family, using sequence information alone, can provide rich information on the molecular basis of the specificity of {beta}-CoVs to different host cell receptors. More precisely, our results indicate that host cell receptor usage is encoded in the amino acid sequences of different CoV spike proteins in the form of a set of specificity determining positions (SDPs). Furthermore, by integrating structural data, in silico mutagenesis and coevolution analysis we could elucidate the role of SDPs in mediating ACE2 binding across the Sarbecovirus lineage, either by engaging the receptor through direct intermolecular interactions or by affecting the local environment of the receptor binding motif. Finally, by the analysis of coevolving mutations across a paired MSA we were able to identify key intermolecular contacts occurring at the spike-ACE2 interface. These results show that effective mining of the evolutionary records held in the sequence of the spike protein family can help tracing the molecular mechanisms behind the evolution and host-receptors adaptation of circulating and future novel {beta}-CoVs.\n\nSignificanceUnraveling the molecular basis for host cell receptor usage among {beta}-CoVs is crucial to our understanding of cross-species transmission, adaptation and for molecular-guided epidemiological monitoring of potential outbreaks. In the present study, we survey the sequence conservation patterns of the {beta}-CoV spike protein family to identify the evolutionary constraints shaping the functional specificity of the protein across the {beta}-CoV lineage. We show that the unsupervised analysis of statistical patterns in a MSA of the spike protein family can help tracing the amino acid space encoding the specificity of {beta}-CoVs to their cognate host cell receptors.

A molecular framework of how the virus manipulates host cellular machinery to facilitate infection remains unclear. Here, we focus on SARS-CoV-2 NSP1, which is proposed to be a virulence factor that inhibits protein synthesis by directly binding the human ribosome. Using extract-based and reconstitution experiments, we demonstrate that NSP1 inhibits translation initiation on model human and SARS-CoV-2 mRNAs. NSP1 also specifically binds to the small (40S) ribosomal subunit, which is required for translation inhibition. Using single-molecule fluorescence assays to monitor NSP1-40S subunit binding in real time, we demonstrate that eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) modulate the interaction: NSP1 rapidly and stably associates with most ribosomal pre-initiation complexes in the absence of mRNA, with particular enhancement and inhibition by eIF1 and eIF3j, respectively. Using model mRNAs and an inter-ribosomal-subunit FRET signal, we elucidate that NSP1 competes with RNA segments downstream of the start codon to bind the 40S subunit and that the protein is unable to associate rapidly with 80S ribosomes assembled on an mRNA. Collectively, our findings support a model where NSP1 associates with the open head conformation of the 40S subunit to inhibit an early step of translation, by preventing accommodation of mRNA within the entry channel.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. A molecular framework for how SARS-CoV-2 manipulates host cellular machinery to facilitate infection is needed. Here, we integrate biochemical and single-molecule strategies to reveal molecular insight into how NSP1 from SARS-CoV-2 inhibits translation initiation. NSP1 directly binds to the small (40S) subunit of the human ribosome, which is modulated by human initiation factors. Further, NSP1 and mRNA compete with each other to bind the ribosome. Our findings suggest that the presence of NSP1 on the small ribosomal subunit prevents proper accommodation of the mRNA. How this competition disrupts the many steps of translation initiation is an important target for future studies.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christopher P.

Using the focus forming assay as the basis for screening cell susceptibility and to develop a focus reduction neutralization test.

The observation of a low prevalence of smokers among hospitalized COVID-19 patients has led to the development of a hypothesis that nicotine could have protective effects by enhancing the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. Based on clinical data and on modelling and docking experiments we have previously presented the potential interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), due to a \"toxin-like\" epitope on the Spike Glycoprotein, with homology to a sequence of a snake venom toxin. We here present that this epitope coincides with the well-described cryptic epitope for the human antibody CR3022 and with the epitope for the recently described COVA1-16 antibody. Both antibodies are recognizing neighboring epitopes, are not interfering with the ACE2 protein and are not able to inhibit SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections. In this study we present the molecular complexes of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoproteins, at their open or closed conformations, with the molecular model of the human 7 nAChR.

We therefore studied the virus morphology and morphometry of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS-CoV as it appears in Vero cell cultures by using conventional thin section electron microscopy and electron tomography. Both virus isolates, SARS-CoV Frankfurt 1 and SARS-CoV-2 Italy-INMI1, were virtually identical at the ultrastructural level and revealed a very similar particle size distribution ([~]100 nm, without peplomers). SARS-CoV showed a slightly broader size distribution with a few smaller and bigger particles than SARS-CoV-2. The segmental peplomer density of SARS-CoV was approximately 30% higher than the corresponding peplomer density of SARS-CoV-2.

The current studies were conducted to evaluate the in vitro SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity of astodrimer sodium, a dendrimer with broad spectrum antimicrobial activity, including against enveloped viruses in in vitro and in vivo models, that is marketed for antiviral and antibacterial applications. We report that astodrimer sodium inhibits replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells when added to cells 1-hour prior to or 1-hour post infection, with 50% effective concentrations reducing virus-induced cytopathic effect (EC50) ranging from 0.090 to 0.742 M (0.002 to 0.012 mg\/mL). The selectivity index (SI) in these assays was as high as 2197. Astodrimer sodium was also effective in a virucidal evaluation when mixed with virus for 1 hour prior to infection of cells (EC50 1.83 M [0.030 mg\/mL]). Results from a time of addition study, which showed infectious virus was below the lower limit of detection at all time points tested, were consistent with the compound inhibiting early virus entry steps. The data were similar for all investigations and were consistent with the potent antiviral activity of astodrimer sodium being due to inhibition of virus-host cell interactions, as previously demonstrated for other viruses. Further studies will confirm if astodrimer sodium binds to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and physically blocks initial association of the virus with heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the host cell. Given the in vitro effectiveness and significantly high SI, astodrimer sodium warrants further investigation for potential as a nasally administered or inhaled antiviral agent for SARS-CoV-2 prevention and treatment applications.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jeremy R.A.

In this article we use non-parametric techniques (HT and MST) with the aim of identifying groups of countries with a similar spread of the coronavirus. The variable of interest is the number of daily infections per country. Results show that there are groups of countries with differentiated contagion dynamics, both in the number of contagions plus at the time of the greatest transmission of the disease.

This article aims to analyse the effect of blood cell depletion and blood cell recovery on mortality due to COVID-19. Design: This work is a multicentre, retrospective, cohort study of 9,644 hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID-19 from the Spanish Society of Internal Medicine SEMI-COVID-19 Registry. Setting: This study examined patients hospitalised in 147 hospitals throughout Spain. Participants: This work analysed 9,644 patients (57.12% male) out of a cohort of 12,826 patients over 18 years of age hospitalised with COVID-19 in Spain included in the SEMI-COVID-19 Registry as of 29 May 2020. Main outcome measures: The main outcome measure of this work is the effect of blood cell depletion and blood cell recovery on mortality due to COVID-19. Univariate analysis was performed to determine possible predictors of death and then multivariate analysis was carried out to control for potential confounders. Results: An increase in the eosinophil count on the seventh day of hospitalisation was associated with a better prognosis, including lower mortality rates (5.2% vs 22.6% in non-recoverers, OR 0.234 [95% CI, 0.154 to 0.354]) and lower complication rates, especially regarding to development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (8% vs 20.1%, p=0.000) and ICU admission (5.4% vs 10.8%, p=0.000). Lymphocyte recovery was found to have no effect on prognosis. Treatment with inhaled or systemic glucocorticoids was not found to be a confounding factor. Conclusion: Eosinophil recovery in patients with COVID-19 is a reliable marker of a good prognosis that is independent of prior treatment. This finding could be used to guide discharge decisions.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria Mateos Gonzalez","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Infanta Cristina University Hospital, Parla, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Elena Sierra Gonzalo","author_inst":"Pathology Department, Infanta Cristina University Hospital, Parla, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Irene Casado Lopez","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Infanta Cristina University Hospital, Parla, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Francisco Arnalich Fernandez","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, La Paz University Hospital, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Jose Luis Beato Perez","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Albacete University Hospital Complex, Albacete, Spain."},{"author_name":"Daniel Monge Monge","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Segovia Hospital Complex, Segovia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Juan Antonio Vargas Nunez","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Puerta de Hierro University Hospital, Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Rosa Garcia Fenoll","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Miguel Servet Hospital, Zaragoza, Spain."},{"author_name":"Carmen Suarez Fernandez","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, La Princesa University Hospital, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Santiago Jesus Freire Castro","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, A Coruna University Hospital, A Coruna, Spain."},{"author_name":"Manuel Mendez Bailon","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Clinico San Carlos Hospital, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Isabel Perales Fraile","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Infanta Sofia Hospital, San Sebastian de los Reyes, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Manuel Madrazo","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Dr. Peset University Hospital, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Paula Maria Pesqueira Fontan","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Santiago Clinical Hospital, Santiago de Compostela, A Coruna, Spain."},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Oskar Magallanes Gamboa","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Nuestra Senora del Prado Hospital, Talavera de la Reina, Toledo, Spain."},{"author_name":"Andres Gonzalez Garcia","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Ramon y Cajal University Hospital, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Anxela Crestelo Vieitez","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Royo Villanova Hospital, Zaragoza, Spain."},{"author_name":"Eva Maria Fonseca Aizpuru","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Cabuenes Hospital, Gijon, Asturias, Spain."},{"author_name":"Asier Aranguren Arostegui","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Urduliz Alfredo Espinosa Hospital, Urduliz, Vizcaya, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ainara Coduras Erdozain","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Santa Marina Hospital, Bilbao, Spain"},{"author_name":"Carmen Martinez Cilleros","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, HLA Moncloa Hospital, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Jose Loureiro Amigo","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Moises Broggi Hospital, Sant Joan Despi, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Francisco Epelde","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Parc Tauli Hospital, Sabadell, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Carlos Lumbreras Bermejo","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, 12 de Octubre University Hospital, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Juan Miguel Anton Santos","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Infanta Cristina University Hospital, Parla, Madrid, Spain"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.17.20176925","rel_title":"Engineering luminescent biosensors for point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection","rel_date":"2020-08-21","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.17.20176925","rel_abs":"Current serology tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies mainly take the form of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays or lateral flow assays, with the former being laborious and the latter being expensive and often lacking sufficient sensitivity and scalability.

Individuals who are symptomatic\/asymptomatic or have recovered are reported to have\/will have serious health complications in the future, which is going to be huge economic burden globally. Given the wide-spread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 it is almost impossible to test each and every individual for the same and isolate them. Recent reports have shown that sewage can be used as a holistic approach to estimate the epidemiology of the virus. Here we have estimated the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the city of Hyderabad, India which is populated with nearly 10 million people. The sewage samples were collected from all the major sewage treatment plants (STPs) and were processed for detecting the viral genome using the standard RT-PCR method. Based on the average viral particle shedding per individual, the total number of individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 (in a window of 35 days) is about 6.6% of the population, which clearly indicates the rate of community transmission and asymptomatic carriers is higher than the number of reported cases. It is important to note here that the samples collected from the inlet of STPs were positive for SARS-CoV-2, while the outlets were negative indicating the efficient treatment of sewage at STPs. These studies are going to be essential to manage the pandemic better and also to assess the effectiveness of control measure.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hemalatha Manupati","author_inst":"CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, Hyderabad-500007, India"},{"author_name":"Uday Kiran","author_inst":"CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, India"},{"author_name":"Santosh Kumar Kuncha","author_inst":"CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Harishankar Kopperi","author_inst":"CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, Hyderabad-500007, India"},{"author_name":"Gokulan C.G.","author_inst":"CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular.

As previous studies were limited to mathematical modeling or testing on low throughput PCR instruments, this study aimed to assess pooling on high throughput analyzers. To assess the impact of pooling, SARS-CoV-2 dilutions were performed at varying pool depths (i.e. 1:2, 1:4, and 1:8) into test-negative nasopharyngeal or oropharynx\/anterior nares swabs matrix. Testing was evaluated on the automated Roche Cobas 6800 system, or the Roche MagNApure LC 2.0 or MagNAPure 96 instruments paired with a laboratory-developed test using a 96-well PCR format. The frequency of detection in specimens with low viral loads was evaluated using archived specimens collected throughout the first pandemic wave. The proportion of detectable results per pool depths was used to estimate the potential impact. In addition, workflow at the analytical stage, and pre-and post-stages of testing were also considered. The current study estimated that pool depths of 1:2, 1:4, and 1:8 would have allowed the detection of 98.3%, 96.0%, and 92.6% of positive SARS-CoV-2 results identified in the first wave of the pandemic in Nova Scotia. Overall, this study demonstrated that pooling on high throughput instrumentation can dramatically increase the overall testing capacity to meet increased demands, with little compromising to sensitivity at low pool depths. However, the human resources required at the pre-analytical stage of testing is a particular challenging to achieve.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jason J LeBlanc","author_inst":"Division of Microbiology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Nova Scotia Health, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada."},{"author_name":"Glenn Patriquin","author_inst":"Division of Microbiology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Nova Scotia Health, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Janice Pettipas","author_inst":"Nova Scotia Provincial Public Health Laboratory Network (PPHLN), Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Michelle Warhuus","author_inst":"Canadian Center for Vaccinology (CCfV), Dalhousie University, IWK Health Centre, and Nova Scotia Health, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Darren Sarty","author_inst":"Division of Microbiology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Nova Scotia Health, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Colleen Jackson","author_inst":"Division of Microbiology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Nova Scotia Health, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Charles Heinstein","author_inst":"Division of Microbiology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Nova Scotia Health, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada"},{"author_name":"James MacDonald","author_inst":"Division of Microbiology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Nova Scotia Health, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada"},{"author_name":"David Haldane","author_inst":"Division of Microbiology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Nova Scotia Health, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Todd F Hatchette","author_inst":"Division of Microbiology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Nova Scotia Health, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada"},{"author_name":"Ralph Etienne-Cummings","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering"},{"author_name":"Leonel Torres","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Michael J.

Efficient, effective and economically feasible methods for large-scale PPE decontamination are urgently needed. Aims: (1) to develop protocols for effectively decontaminating PPE using vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP); (2) to develop novel approaches that decrease set up and take down time while also increasing decontamination capacity (3) to test decontamination efficiency for N95 respirators heavily contaminated by makeup or moisturizers. Methods: We converted a decommissioned Biosafety Level 3 laboratory into a facility that could be used to decontaminate N95 respirators. N95 respirators were hung on metal racks, stacked in piles, placed in paper bags or covered with makeup or moisturizer. A VHP VICTORYTM unit from STERIS was used to inject VHP into the facility. Biological and chemical indicators were used to validate the decontamination process. Findings: N95 respirators individually hung on metal racks were successfully decontaminated using VHP. N95 respirators were also successfully decontaminated when placed in closed paper bags or if stacked in piles of up to six. Stacking reduced the time needed to arrange N95 respirators for decontamination by approximately two-thirds while almost tripling facility capacity. Makeup and moisturizer creams did not interfere with the decontamination process. Conclusions: Respirator stacking can reduce the hands-on time and increase decontamination capacity. When personalization is needed, respirators can be decontaminated in labeled paper bags. Make up or moisturizers do not appear to interfere with VHP decontamination.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"RICCARDO RUSSO","author_inst":"Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey"},{"author_name":"Carly Levine","author_inst":"Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey"},{"author_name":"Courtney Veilleux","author_inst":"Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey"},{"author_name":"Blas Peixoto","author_inst":"Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey"},{"author_name":"Jessica McCormick-Ell","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Thomas Block","author_inst":"Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey"},{"author_name":"Anthony Gresko","author_inst":"Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey"},{"author_name":"Guillaume Delmas","author_inst":"Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey"},{"author_name":"Poonam Chitale","author_inst":"Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey"},{"author_name":"Alexis Frees","author_inst":"Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey"},{"author_name":"Alejandro Ruiz","author_inst":"Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey"},{"author_name":"David Alland","author_inst":"Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey"},{"author_name":"Miles D Chapman","author_inst":"Neuroimmunology and CSF laboratory, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust National Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queen Square, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Melanie Hart","author_inst":"Neuroimmunology and CSF laboratory, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust National Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queen Square, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Michael P Lunn","author_inst":"Neuroimmunology and CSF laboratory, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust National Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queen Square, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Cristina M.

Although mitigation measures have been globally considered, the spatial heterogeneity of its effectiveness is evident, underscoring global health inequalities. Using Bayesian-based Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations, we evidenced that factors contributing to poverty are also risk factors for COVID-19 case-fatality, and unexpectedly, their impact on the case-fatality risk is comparable to that produced by health factors. Additionally, we confirm that both case-fatality risk and multidimensional poverty index have a heterogeneous spatial distribution, where the lastest consists of health, educational, dwelling, and employment dimensions. Spatio-temporal analysis reveals that the spatial heterogeneity in case-fatalities is associated with the percentage contribution of the health (RR 1.89 95%CI=1.43-2.48) and dwelling (RR 2.01 95%CI=1.37-2.63) dimensions to the multidimensional poverty, but also with the educational (RR 1.21 95%CI=1.03-1.49), and employment (RR 1.23 95%CI=1.02-1.47) dimensions. This spatial correlation indicates that the case-fatality risk increase by 189% and 201% in regions with a higher contribution of the health dimension (i.e., lack of health insurance and self-reporting) and dwelling dimension (i.e., lack of access to safe water, inadequate disposal of human feces, poor housing construction, and critical overcrowding), respectively. These findings assist policy-makers in the spatial and temporal planning of strategies focused on mitigating the case-fatality risk in most vulnerable communities and preparing for future pandemics by progressively reducing the factors that generate health inequality.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gina Polo","author_inst":"Grupo de Investigaci\u00f3n en Epidemiolog\u00eda y SaludP\u00fablica.

Different countries have developed and adopted various policies to contain this epidemic and the most common were the social distancing and lockdown. Though some countries have come out of this pandemic, the infection is still increasing and remains very serious in the rest of the world. Even when the disease is not under control, many countries have withdrawn the lockdown and going through the phase-wise unlocking process, causing a further increment in the infection rate. In such a scenario, the role of the undetected class of infected individuals has become very crucial. The present study is an attempt to understand and estimate the possible epidemic burden during the unlock phase in the presence of an undetected class. We proposed a modified SEIR model and dissected the epidemiological status of different countries with the available data. With the initial establishment of the model with the epidemic data of four countries, which have already attained the epidemic peak, the study focused more on countries like India and the USA, where the epidemic curve is still growing, but the unlock process has started. As a straightforward result, we noticed a significant increase in the undetected and detected infected cases under the ongoing unlock phase. Under such conditions, our recalibration exercise showed that an increase in the testing could revert the existing growth rate of the infected cases to the lower growth rate of the lockdown period. Our present study emphasizes on the implementation of 3T principles, trace, test, and treat, to contain the epidemic. The significance of large scale testing in controlling the epidemic is true for both India and the USA though they have different socio-economic conditions. The use of repurposing drugs may further decrease the infected cases and help the disease controlling process. We believe our proposed strategy obtained through a mathematical model will help to make a better policy for the unlock phase.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abhijit Paul","author_inst":"Translational Health Science and Technology Institute"},{"author_name":"Samrat Chatterjee","author_inst":"Translational Health Science and Technology Institute"},{"author_name":"Nandadulal Bairagi","author_inst":"Jadavpur University"},{"author_name":"Juli\u00e1n Felipe Porras Villamil","author_inst":"Grupo de Investigaci\u00f3n en Epidemiolog\u00eda y SaludP\u00fablica.

But few studies have empirically examined the factors driving these outcomes. We examined the association between perceived preparedness to respond to the pandemic and HCW stress and burnout and identified potential mediating factors among HCWs in Ghana. Methods: Data are from HCWs in Ghana who completed a cross-sectional self-administered online survey; 414 and 409 HCWs completed stress and burnout questions, respectively. Perceived preparedness, stress, and burnout were measured using validated psychosocial measures. We assessed associations using linear regressions with robust standard errors. Results: The average score for preparedness was 24 (SD=8.8), 16.3 (SD=5.9) for stress, and 37.4 (SD=15.5) for burnout. In multivariate analysis, HCWs who felt somewhat prepared and prepared had lower stress ({beta}=-1.89, 95%CI:-3.49 to -0.30 and {beta}=-2.66, 95%CI:-4.48 to -0.84) and burnout ({beta}=-7.74, 95%CI:-11.8 to -3.64 and {beta}=-9.25, 95%CI:-14.1 to - 4.41) scores than those who did not feel prepared. Appreciation from management and family support were associated with lower stress and burnout, while fear of infection was associated with higher stress and burnout. Fear of infection partially mediated the relationship between perceived preparedness and stress\/burnout, accounting for about 16 to 17% of the effect. Conclusion: Low perceived preparedness to respond to COVID-19 increases stress and burnout, and this is partly through fear of infection. Interventions to increase HCWs' morale and capacity to respond to the pandemic are needed.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patience A Afulani","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Akua O.

Methods: Herein, we compare several analytic platforms with 15 positive and 30 negative SARS-CoV-2 infected controls followed by viral neutralization assessment. We then applied these platforms in a clinically relevant population: 114 individuals with unknown histories of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: In control populations, the best performing antibody detection assays were SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG (specificity 87%, sensitivity 100%, PPV 100%, NPV 93%), spike IgG3 (specificity 93%, sensitivity 97%, PPV 93%, NPV 97%), and nucleocapsid (NP) protein IgG (specificity 93%, sensitivity 97%, PPV 93%, NPV 97%). Neutralization of positive and negative control sera showed 100% agreement. 20 unknown individuals had detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with 16 demonstrating virus neutralization. The antibody assays that best predicted virus neutralization were RBD IgG (misidentified 2), spike IgG3 (misidentified 1), and NP IgG (misidentified 2). Conclusion: These data suggest that meaningful evaluation of antibody assay performance requires testing in an unknown population. Further, these results indicate coupling of virus neutralization analysis to a positive antibody test is required to categorize patients based on SARS-CoV-2 immune protection status following virus exposure or vaccine administration. One of the antibody detection platforms identified in this study followed by the pseudoneutralization or focus reduction assay would provide a practical testing strategy to assess for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with optimal prediction of correlates to neutralizing immunity.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jennifer A Rathe","author_inst":"University of Washington \/ Seattle Children's Hopsital"},{"author_name":"Emily A Hemann","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Julie Eggenberger","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Zhaoqi Li","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Megan Knoll","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Caleb Stokes","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Tien-Ying Hsiang","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jason Netland","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Marion Pepper","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Michael Gale Jr.","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Deepak Modi","author_inst":"ICMR-National Institute for Research in Reproductive Heath"},{"author_name":"Carlos Meza Carvajalino","author_inst":"Grupo de Investigaci\u00f3n en Epidemiolog\u00eda y SaludP\u00fablica.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of children and adolescents (<21 years of age) with a SARS-CoV-2-infected close contact. We collected nasopharyngeal or nasal swabs at enrollment and tested for SARS-CoV-2 using a real-time PCR assay. RESULTS: Of 382 children, 293 (77%) were SARS-CoV-2-infected. SARS-CoV-2-infected children were more likely to be Hispanic (p<0.0001), less likely to have asthma (p=0.005), and more likely to have an infected sibling contact (p=0.001) than uninfected children. Children ages 6-13 years were frequently asymptomatic (39%) and had respiratory symptoms less often than younger children (29% vs. 48%; p=0.01) or adolescents (29% vs. 60%; p<0.0001). Compared to children ages 6-13 years, adolescents more frequently reported influenza-like (61% vs. 39%; p<0.0001), gastrointestinal (27% vs. 9%; p=0.002), and sensory symptoms (42% vs. 9%; p<0.0001), and had more prolonged illnesses [median (IQR) duration: 7 (4, 12) vs. 4 (3, 8) days; p=0.01]. Despite the age-related variability in symptoms, we found no differences in nasopharyngeal viral load by age or between symptomatic and asymptomatic children. CONCLUSIONS: Hispanic ethnicity and an infected sibling close contact are associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 infection risk among children, while asthma is associated with decreased risk. Age-related differences in the clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection must be considered when evaluating children for COVID-19 and in developing screening strategies for schools and childcare settings.","rel_num_authors":30,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jillian H.
