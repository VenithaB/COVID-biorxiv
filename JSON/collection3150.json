When a new variant emerges, there is a concern regarding whether an individual exposed to one variant of a virus will have cross-reactive immune memory to the second variant. Accordingly, we analyzed the serologic reactivity of D614 (original) and G614 variant spike proteins. We found that antibodies from a high-incidence population in New York City reacted both toward the original D614 spike and the G614 spike variant. These data suggest that patients who have been exposed to either SARS-CoV-2 variant have humoral immunity that can respond against both variants. This is an important finding both for SARS-CoV-2 disease biology and for potential antibody-based therapeutics.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carleen Klumpp-Thomas","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Heather Kalish","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Hicks","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Mehalko","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Matthew Drew","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Matthew J Memoli","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Matthew D Hall","author_inst":"NIH NCATS"},{"author_name":"Dominic Esposito","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Kaitlyn Sadtler","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc0","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.08.20148841","rel_title":"A Multicenter, randomized, open-label, controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of hydroxychloroquine and a retrospective study in adult patients with mild to moderate Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)","rel_date":"2020-07-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.08.20148841","rel_abs":"Objective In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) via a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and a retrospective study. Methods Subjects admitted to 11 designated public hospitals in Taiwan between April 1 and May 31, 2020, with COVID-19 diagnosis confirmed by pharyngeal real-time RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, were randomized at a 2:1 ratio and stratified by mild or moderate illness. HCQ 400 mg twice for 1 d and HCQ 200 mg twice daily for 6 days were administered. Both study group and controlled group received standard of care (SOC). Pharyngeal swabs and sputum were collected every other day. The proportion and time to negative viral PCR were assessed on day 14. In the retrospective study, medical records were reviewed for patients admitted before March 31, 2020. Results There were 33 and 37 cases in the RCT and retrospective study, respectively. In the RCT, the median times to negative rRT-PCR from randomization to hospital day 14 were 5 days (95% CI; 1-9 days) and 10 days (95% CI; 2-12 days) for the HCQ and SOC groups, respectively (p = 0.40). On day 14, 81.0% (17\/21) and 75.0% (9\/12) of the subjects in the HCQ and SOC groups, respectively, had undetected virus (p = 0.36). In the retrospective study, 12 (42.9%) in the HCQ group and 5 (55.6%) in the control group had negative rRT-PCR results on hospital day 14 (p = 0.70). Conclusions Neither study demonstrated that HCQ shortened viral shedding in mild to moderate COVID-19 subjects.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cheng-Pin Chen","author_inst":"Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Yi-Chun Lin","author_inst":"Taoyuan General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tsung-Chia Chen","author_inst":"Taichung Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ting-Yu Tseng","author_inst":"Taichung Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hon-Lai Wong","author_inst":"Keelung Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cheng-Yu Kuo","author_inst":"Pingtung Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wu-Pu Lin","author_inst":"Taipei Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sz-Rung Huang","author_inst":"Miaoli General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wei-Yao Wang","author_inst":"Feng Yuan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jia-Hung Liao","author_inst":"Nantou Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chung-Shin Liao","author_inst":"Chia Yi Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuan-Pin Hung","author_inst":"Tainan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tse-Hung Lin","author_inst":"Chang Hua Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tz-Yan Chang","author_inst":"Chang Hua Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chin-Fu Hsiao","author_inst":"National Health Research Institutes"},{"author_name":"Yi-Wen Huang","author_inst":"Chang Hua Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wei-Sheng Chung","author_inst":"Taichung Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chien-Yu Cheng","author_inst":"Taoyuan General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shu-Hsing Cheng","author_inst":"Taoyuan General Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.08.20148999","rel_title":"Artificial Intelligence-Assisted Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification (ai-LAMP) for Rapid and Reliable Detection of SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-07-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.08.20148999","rel_abs":"Until vaccines and effective therapeutics become available, the practical way to transit safely out of the current lockdown may include the implementation of an effective testing, tracing and tracking system. However, this requires a reliable and clinically validated diagnostic platform for the sensitive and specific identification of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we report on the development of a de novo, high-resolution and comparative genomics guided reverse-transcribed loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay. To further enhance the assay performance and to remove any subjectivity associated with operator interpretation of result, we engineered a novel hand-held smart diagnostic device. The robust diagnostic device was further furnished with automated image acquisition and processing algorithms, and the collated data was processed through artificial intelligence (AI) pipelines to further reduce the assay run time and the subjectivity of the colorimetric LAMP detection. This advanced AI algorithm-implemented LAMP (ai-LAMP) assay, targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene, showed high analytical sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2. A total of ~200 coronavirus disease (CoVID-19)-suspected patient samples were tested using the platform and it was shown to be reliable, highly specific and significantly more sensitive than the current gold standard qRT-PCR. The system could provide an efficient and cost-effective platform to detect SARS-CoV-2 in resource-limited laboratories.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammed A Rohaim","author_inst":"The Lancaster University"},{"author_name":"Emily Clayton","author_inst":"The Lancaster University"},{"author_name":"Irem Sahin","author_inst":"The Lancaster University"},{"author_name":"Julianne Vilela","author_inst":"The Lancaster University"},{"author_name":"Manar E Khalifa","author_inst":"The Lancaster University"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Q Al-Natour","author_inst":"The Lancaster University"},{"author_name":"Mahmoud Bayoumi","author_inst":"The Lancaster University"},{"author_name":"Aurore Poirier","author_inst":"The University of Surrey"},{"author_name":"Manoharanehru Branavan","author_inst":"Brunel University London"},{"author_name":"Mukunthan Tharmakulasingam","author_inst":"University of Surrey,"},{"author_name":"Nouman S Chaudhry","author_inst":"The University of Surrey"},{"author_name":"Ravinder Sodi","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, Poole & Bournemouth Hospitals NHS Trust, Longfleet Road, Poole, UK BH15 2JB"},{"author_name":"Amy Brown","author_inst":"The Royal Lancaster Infirmary, University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS, Foundation Trust, UK"},{"author_name":"Peter Burkhart","author_inst":"The Royal Lancaster Infirmary, University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS, Foundation Trust, UK"},{"author_name":"Wendy Hacking","author_inst":"The Royal Lancaster Infirmary, University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS, Foundation Trust, UK"},{"author_name":"Judy Botham","author_inst":"The Royal Lancaster Infirmary, University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS, Foundation Trust, UK"},{"author_name":"Joe Boyce","author_inst":"The Royal Lancaster Infirmary, University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS, Foundation Trust, UK"},{"author_name":"Hayley Wilkinson","author_inst":"The Royal Lancaster Infirmary, University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS, Foundation Trust, UK"},{"author_name":"Craig Williams","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Michelle Bates","author_inst":"The Lancaster University"},{"author_name":"Roberto La Ragione","author_inst":"University of Surrey"},{"author_name":"Wamadeva Balachandran","author_inst":"College of Engineering, Design and Physical Sciences, Brunel University London, Kingston Lane, Uxbridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Anil Fernando","author_inst":"The University of Surrey"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Munir","author_inst":"Lancaster University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.07.20148478","rel_title":"Natural killer cell activation related to clinical outcome of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-07-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.07.20148478","rel_abs":"Understanding innate immune responses in COVID-19 is important for deciphering mechanisms of host responses and interpreting disease pathogenesis. Natural killer (NK) cells are innate effector lymphocytes that respond to acute viral infections, but might also contribute to immune pathology. Here, using 28-color flow cytometry, we describe a state of strong NK cell activation across distinct subsets in peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients, a pattern mirrored in scRNA-seq signatures of lung NK cells. Unsupervised high-dimensional analysis identified distinct immunophenotypes that were linked to disease severity. Hallmarks of these immunophenotypes were high expression of perforin, NKG2C, and Ksp37, reflecting a high presence of adaptive NK cell expansions in circulation of patients with severe disease. Finally, arming of CD56bright NK cells was observed in course of COVID-19 disease states, driven by a defined protein-protein interaction network of inflammatory soluble factors. This provides a detailed map of the NK cell activation-landscape in COVID-19 disease.","rel_num_authors":29,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christopher Maucourant","author_inst":"Center for Infectious

In this study we report the analytical and clinical performance characteristics of a new, high throughput, fully automated nucleic acid amplification test system for the detection of SARSCoV2. The assay utilizes target capture, transcription mediated amplification, and acridinium ester labeled probe chemistry on the automated Panther System to directly amplify and detect two separate target sequences in the ORF1ab region of the SARSCoV2 RNA genome. The probit 95% limit of detection of the assay was determined to be 0.004 TCID50\/ml using inactivated virus, and 25 c\/ml using synthetic in vitro transcript RNA targets. Analytical sensitivity (100% detection) was confirmed to be 83 to 194 c\/ml using three commercially available SARSCoV2 nucleic acid controls. No cross reactivity or interference was observed with testing six related human coronaviruses, as well as 24 other viral, fungal, and bacterial pathogens, at high titer. Clinical nasopharyngeal swab specimen testing (N=140) showed 100%, 98.7%, and 99.3% positive, negative, and overall agreement, respectively, with a validated reverse transcription PCR NAAT for SARSCoV2 RNA.

Methods: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted in patients with diabetes admitted with COVID-19 to Mediclinic Parkview Hospital in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE) from 30th March to 7th June 2020. They had laboratory and\/or radiologically confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), known as COVID-19. Variation in characteristics, length of stay in hospital, diabetes status, comorbidities and outcomes were examined. Results: A total of 103 patients with confirmed COVID-19 presentations had diabetes. During the same timeframe, 410 patients overall were admitted with COVID-19 infection. This gives a total proportion of persons admitted with COVID-19 infection and coexistent diabetes\/prediabetes of 25%. 67% (n=69) of the COVID-19 diabetes cohort were male. Patients admitted with COVID-19 and diabetes represented 17 different ethnicities. Of these, 59.2% (n=61) were Asians and 35% (n=36) were from Arab countries. Mean age (SD) was 54 (12.5) years. 85.4% (n=88) were known to have diabetes prior to admission, while 14.6% (n=15) were newly diagnosed with either diabetes or prediabetes during admission. Most patients in the study cohort had type 2 diabetes or prediabetes, with only 3% overall having type 1 diabetes (n=3). 46.9% of patients had evidence of good glycaemic control of their diabetes during the preceding 4-12 weeks prior to admission as defined arbitrarily by admission HbA1c <7.5%. 73.8% (n=76) had other comorbidities including hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, and dyslipidaemia. Laboratory data Mean(SD) on admission for those who needed ward-based care versus those needing intensive care unit (ICU) care: Fibrinogen 462.75 (125.16) mg\/dl vs 660 (187.58) mg\/dl ; D-dimer 0.66 (0.55) mcg\/ml vs 2.3 (3.48) mcg\/ml; Ferritin 358.08 (442.05) mg\/dl vs 1762.38 (2586.38) mg\/dl; and CRP 33.9 (38.62) mg\/L vs 137 (111.72) mg\/L were all statistically significantly higher for the ICU cohort (p<0.05). Average length of stay in hospital was 14.55 days. 28.2% of patients needed ICU admission. 4.9% (n=5) overall died during hospitalisation (all in ICU). Conclusions: In this single-centre study in Dubai, 25% of patients admitted with COVID-19 also had diabetes\/prediabetes. Most diabetes patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 disease were males of Asian origin. 14.6% had new diagnosis of diabetes\/prediabetes on admission. The majority of patients with diabetes\/prediabetes and COVID-19 infection had other important comorbidities (n=76; 73.8%). Only 4 patients had negative COVID-19 RT-PCR but had pathognomonic changes of COVID-19 radiologically. Our comprehensive laboratory analysis revealed distinct abnormal patterns of biomarkers that are associated with poor prognosis: Fibrinogen, D-dimer, Ferritin and CRP levels were all statistically significantly higher (p<0.05) at presentation in patients who subsequently needed ICU care compared with those patients who remained ward-based. 28.2% overall needed ICU admission, out of which 5 patients died. More studies with larger sample sizes are needed to compare data of COVID-19 patients admitted with and without diabetes within the UAE region.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rahila Bhatti","author_inst":"Mediclinic Parkview Hospital"},{"author_name":"Amar Omer","author_inst":"Mohammad Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dubai, UAE."},{"author_name":"Samara Khattib","author_inst":"Mediclinic Parkview Hospital"},{"author_name":"Seemin Shiraz","author_inst":"Mediclinic Parkview Hospital"},{"author_name":"Glenn Matfin","author_inst":"Mohammad Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dubai, UAE."},{"author_name":"Ian McHardy","author_inst":"Scripps Health San Diego"},{"author_name":"Inessa Gendlina","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center"},{"author_name":"D.

Here, we provide a quantitative framework to determine which interventions are likely to have the most impact in which settings. We introduce the concept of \"event R\", the expected number of new infections due to the presence of a single infected individual at an event. We obtain a fundamental relationship between event R and four parameters: transmission intensity, duration of exposure, the proximity of individuals, and the degree of mixing. We use reports of small outbreaks to establish event R and transmission intensity in a range of settings. We identify principles that guide whether physical distancing, masks and other barriers to transmission, or social bubbles will be most effective. We outline how this information can be obtained and used to re-open economies with principled measures to reduce COVID-19 transmission.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paul Tupper","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Madi Yerlanov","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Himani Boury","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Caroline Colijn","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Glenn Matfin","author_inst":"Mohammad Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dubai, UAE."},{"author_name":"Ian McHardy","author_inst":"Scripps Health San Diego"},{"author_name":"Inessa Gendlina","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center"},{"author_name":"D.

When estimating the incidence, it can be difficult to distinguish whether increased numbers of positive tests stem from increases in the spread of the virus or increases in testing. This has made it very difficult to identify locations in which the epidemic poses the largest public health risks. Here, we use a probabilistic model to quantify beliefs about testing strategies and understand implications regarding incidence. We apply this model to estimate the incidence in each state of the United States, and find that: (1) the Covid-19 epidemic is likely to be more widespread than reported by limited testing, (2) the Covid-19 epidemic growth in the summer months is likely smaller than it was during the spring months, and (3) the regions which are at highest risk of Covid-19 epidemic outbreaks are not always those with the largest number of positive test results.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Benjamin J Lengerich","author_inst":"Carnegie Mellon University"},{"author_name":"Willie Neiswanger","author_inst":"Carnegie Mellon University"},{"author_name":"Eugene J.

Although the lockdown is effective in such prevention, it may put the economy into a depression. Predicting the epidemic progression with government switching the lockdown on or off is critical. We propose a transfer learning approach called ALeRT-COVID using attention-based recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture to predict the epidemic trends for different countries. A source model was trained on the pre-defined source countries and then transferred to each target country. The lockdown measure was introduced to our model as a predictor and the attention mechanism was utilized to learn the different contributions of the confirmed cases in the past days to the future trend. Results demonstrated that the transfer learning strategy is helpful especially for early-stage countries. By introducing the lockdown predictor and the attention mechanism, ALeRT-COVID showed a significant improvement on the prediction performance. We predicted the confirmed cases in one week when extending and easing lockdown separately. Results showed the lockdown measures is still necessary for a number of countries. We expect our research can help different countries to make better decisions on the lockdown measures.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yingxue Li","author_inst":"Ping An Healthcare Technology"},{"author_name":"Wenxiao Jia","author_inst":"Ping An Healthcare Technology"},{"author_name":"Junmei Wang","author_inst":"Ping An Healthcare Technology"},{"author_name":"Jianying Guo","author_inst":"Ping An Healthcare Technology"},{"author_name":"Qin Liu","author_inst":"Ping An Healthcare Technology"},{"author_name":"Xiang Li","author_inst":"Ping An Healthcare Technology"},{"author_name":"Guotong Xie","author_inst":"Ping An Healthcare Technology"},{"author_name":"Fei Wang","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Amy S.

G6PD deficiency induces redox imbalance and exaggerates the inflammatory response; thus, it might contribute to the development or the grave outcome of our case.

The pathogenesis is unclear but has overlapping features with Kawasaki disease suggestive of vasculitis and a likely autoimmune etiology. We apply systems-level analyses of blood immune cells, cytokines and autoantibodies in healthy children, children with Kawasaki disease enrolled prior to COVID-19, children infected with SARS-CoV2 and children presenting with MIS-C. We find that the inflammatory response in MIS-C differs from the cytokine storm of severe acute COVID-19, is more similar to Kawasaki disease, but also differ from this with respect to T-cell subsets, IL-17A and biomarkers associated with arterial damage. Finally, autoantibody profiling suggests endoglin, an endothelial glycoprotein as one of several candidate targets of autoantibodies in MIS-C.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Camila Rosat Consiglio","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Nicola Cotugno","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fabian Sardh","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Christian Pou","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Donato Amodio","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sonia Zicari","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Ruggiero","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Rubens Pascucci","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lucie Rodriguez","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Veronica Santilli","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tessa Campbell","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Yenan Bryceson","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Ziyang Tan","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Daniel Eriksson","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Tadepally Lakshmikanth","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Marchesi","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tadepally Lakshmikanth","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Andrea Campana","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alberto Villani","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Paolo Rossi","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"- the CACTUS study team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Nils Landegren","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Paolo Palma","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Petter Brodin","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Quirin Hammer","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Kristoffer Stralin","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Niklas K Bjorkstrom","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"- Karolinska COVID-19 Study Group","author_inst":"-"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pediatrics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.08.20148866","rel_title":"Predictors of Anxiety Regarding The COVID-19 Pandemic Among Health-care Workers in a Hospital Not Assigned to Manage COVID-19 Patients in Nepal.","rel_date":"2020-07-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.08.20148866","rel_abs":"Introduction: We studied the levels and severity of anxiety caused by COVID-19 amongst frontline health-care workers (HCWs) in a tertiary care neurological hospital in Nepal, not assigned to manage COVID-19 cases. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 100 frontline Health Care Workers (HCWs) using a 10-point subjective assessment tool, the Anxiety Level Index (ALI), and the Zung Self Rating Anxiety Score (SAS), to assess the level of anxiety regarding COVID-19. Results: On ALI 55% of HCWs were found to have marked severe anxiety (6-9), however, on SAS 44% of HCWs reported anxiety. The majority HCWs were female (n=78) with nurses forming 62% of the sample size. The mean age was 26.8 years (SD 8.17). Factors associated with significantly higher levels of anxiety regarding COVID-19 on ALI were age (p=0.002), sex (p=0.001), receiving regular COVID-19 updates via social media (p=0.011) and a high frequency of checking for COVID-19 information authenticity (p=0.039). Work experience (p=0.026) and frequency of checking for information authenticity (p=0.029) were factors found to increase SAS measured anxiety and were found to be associated with significantly higher levels of anxiety. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that respondents with work experience of less than or equal to 2 years were 0.380 (95% CI 0.158 to 0.910) times less likely to have anxiety than those with work experience of more than 2 years. Similarly, the odds of having anxiety among those who checked information authenticity less frequently was 0.377 (95% CI 0.153 to 0.931) times less than those who often did. Conclusion: The COVID-19 outbreak has caused a substantial impact on the mental health of frontline HCWs in a hospital not assigned to manage COVID-19 patients. Length of time of worked in healthcare and the frequency of checking for COVID-19-related information were significant predictors of anxiety.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lekhjung Thapa","author_inst":"UDM-NINAS, Neuro and Allied Clinic"},{"author_name":"Aparna Ghimire","author_inst":"BPKIHS"},{"author_name":"Sulochana Ghimire","author_inst":"UCNS"},{"author_name":"Nooma Sharma","author_inst":"PAHS"},{"author_name":"Shakti Shrestha","author_inst":"Neuro and Allied Clinic"},{"author_name":"Medha Devkota","author_inst":"Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Suman Bhattarai","author_inst":"UDM-NINAS"},{"author_name":"Anzil Maharjan","author_inst":"UDM-NINAS"},{"author_name":"Subash Lohani","author_inst":"UDM-NINAS"},{"author_name":"Subash Phuyal","author_inst":"UDM-NINAS"},{"author_name":"Prathiba Maharjan","author_inst":"UDM-NINAS"},{"author_name":"Yenan Bryceson","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Ziyang Tan","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Daniel Eriksson","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Tadepally Lakshmikanth","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Marchesi","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tadepally Lakshmikanth","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Andrea Campana","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alberto Villani","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Paolo Rossi","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"- the CACTUS study team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Nils Landegren","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Paolo Palma","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Petter Brodin","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Quirin Hammer","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Kristoffer Stralin","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Niklas K Bjorkstrom","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"- Karolinska COVID-19 Study Group","author_inst":"-"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.08.20148171","rel_title":"Sleep quality, mental health and circadian rhythms during COVID lockdown: Results from the SleepQuest Study","rel_date":"2020-07-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.08.20148171","rel_abs":"Behavioural responses to COVID19 lockdown will define the long-term impact of psychological stressors on sleep and brain health. Here we tease apart factors that help protect against sleep disturbance. We capitalise on the unique restrictions during COVID19 to understand how time of day of daylight exposure and outside exercise interact with chronotype and sleep quality. 3474 people from the UK (median age 62, range 18 to 91) completed our online 'SleepQuest' Study between 29th April and 13th May 2020 - a set of validated questionnaires probing sleep quality, depression, anxiety and attitudes to sleep alongside bespoke questions on the effect of COVID19 lockdown on sleep, time spent outside and exercising and self-help sleep measures. Significantly more people (n=1252) reported worsened than improved sleep (n=562) during lockdown (p<0.0001). Factors significantly associated with worsened sleep included low mood (p<0.001), anxiety (p<0.001) and suspected, proven or at risk of COVID19 symptoms (all p<0.03). Sleep improvement was related to the increased length of time spent outside (P<0.01). Older people's sleep quality was less affected than younger people by COVID19 lockdown (p<0.001). Better sleep quality was associated with going outside and exercising earlier, rather than later, in the day. However, the benefit of being outside early is driven by improved sleep in 'owl' (p=0.0002) and not 'lark' (p=0.27) chronotype, whereas, the benefit of early exercise (inside or outside) did not depend on chronotype. Defining the interaction between chronotype, mental health and behaviour will be critical for targeted lifestyle adaptations to protect brain health through current and future crises.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Neil Carrigan","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Alfie R Wearn","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Saba Meky","author_inst":"North Bristol NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"James Selwood","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Hugh Piggins","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Turner","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Rosemary Greenwood","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Coulthard","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Subash Lohani","author_inst":"UDM-NINAS"},{"author_name":"Subash Phuyal","author_inst":"UDM-NINAS"},{"author_name":"Prathiba Maharjan","author_inst":"UDM-NINAS"},{"author_name":"Yenan Bryceson","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Ziyang Tan","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Daniel Eriksson","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Tadepally Lakshmikanth","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Marchesi","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tadepally Lakshmikanth","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Andrea Campana","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alberto Villani","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Paolo Rossi","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"- the CACTUS study team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Nils Landegren","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Paolo Palma","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Petter Brodin","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Quirin Hammer","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Kristoffer Stralin","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Niklas K Bjorkstrom","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"- Karolinska COVID-19 Study Group","author_inst":"-"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"neurology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.09.20149591","rel_title":"IN-UTERO MOTHER-TO-CHILD SARS-CoV-2 TRANSMISSION: viral detection and fetal immune response","rel_date":"2020-07-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.09.20149591","rel_abs":"Pregnancy is known to increase the risk of severe illnesses in response to viral infections. Therefore, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection during gestational ages might be detrimental and the potential vertical transmission should be thoroughly studied. Herein, we investigated whether SARS-CoV-2 vertical transmission is possible and, in case, whether this results in a fetal involvement. Additionally, we analyzed the role of the antibody and the inflammatory responses in placenta and plasma from SARS-CoV-2-positive pregnant women and fetuses. 31 SARS-CoV-2 pregnant women were enrolled. Real-time PCR was performed to detect the virus on maternal and newborns nasopharyngeal swabs, vaginal swabs, maternal and umbilical cord plasma, placenta and umbilical cord biopsies, amniotic fluids and milk. Maternal and umbilical cord plasma, and milk were tested for specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. RNA expression quantification of genes involved in the inflammatory response was performed on four selected placentas. On maternal and umbilical cord plasma of the same subjects, secreted cytokines\/chemokines were quantified. SARS-CoV-2 is found in at-term placentae and in the umbilical cord blood, in the vaginal mucosa of pregnant women and in milk. Furthermore, we report the presence of specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies in the umbilical cord blood of pregnant women, as well as in milk specimens. Finally, a specific inflammatory response is triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women at both systemic and placental level, and in umbilical cord blood plasma. Our data strongly support the hypothesis that in-utero vertical transmission is possible in SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women. This is essential for defining proper obstetric management of COVID-19 pregnant women, or putative indications for mode and timing of delivery.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Claudio Fenizia","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Mara Biasin","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Irene Cetin","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Patrizia Vergani","author_inst":"Department of Maternal Fetal Medicine, Fondazione MBBM, San Gerardo Hospital, University of Milan-Bicocca, Milan"},{"author_name":"Davide Mileto","author_inst":"Clinical Microbiology, Virology and Bio-emergence Diagnosis, L.

However, Venezuelan ongoing humanitarian crisis has decimated its health care system, and forced millions of Venezuelans to flee through its porous border with Colombia. The extensive shared border, and illegal cross-border transit through improvised trails between the two countries are major challenges for public health authorities. We report the first SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Venezuela, and present a snapshot of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemiologic landscape in the Colombian-Venezuelan border region. We sequenced and assembled viral genomes from total RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal (NP) clinical specimens using a custom reference-based analysis pipeline. Three assemblies obtained were subjected to typing using the Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak LINeages Pangolin tool. A total of 376 publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes from South America were obtained from the GISAID database to perform comparative genomic analyses. Additionally, the Wuhan-1 strain was used as reference. We found that two of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Venezuela belonged to the B1 lineage, and the third to the B.1.13 lineage. We observed a point mutation in the Spike protein gene (D614G substitution), previously reported to be associated with increased infectivity, in all three Venezuelan genomes. An additional three mutations (R203K\/G204R substitution) were present in the nucleocapsid (N) gene of one Venezuelan genome. Conclusions: Genomic sequencing demonstrates similarity between SARS-CoV-2 lineages from Venezuela and viruses collected from patients in bordering areas in Colombia and from Brazil, consistent with cross-border transit despite administrative measures including lockdowns. The presence of mutations associated with increased infectivity in the 3 Venezuelan genomes we report and Colombian SARS-CoV-2 genomes from neighboring borders areas may pose additional challenges for control of SARS-CoV-2 spread in the complex epidemiological landscape in Latin American countries. Public health authorities should carefully follow the progress of the pandemic and its impact on displaced populations within the region.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alberto Paniz-Mondolfi","author_inst":"Icahn School of medicina at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Marina Munoz","author_inst":"Universidad del Rosario"},{"author_name":"Carolina Florez","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Sergio Gomez","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Angelica Rico","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Lisseth Pardo","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Esther C Barros","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Carolina Hernandez","author_inst":"Universidad del Rosario"},{"author_name":"Lourdes Delgado","author_inst":"Universidad del Rosario"},{"author_name":"Jesus Jaimes","author_inst":"Universidad del Rosario"},{"author_name":"Luis Perez","author_inst":"Universidad del Rosario"},{"author_name":"Anibal Teheran","author_inst":"Fundacion Universitaria Juan N Corpas"},{"author_name":"Hala Alshammary","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Ajay Obla","author_inst":"Ichan School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Zenab Khan","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Ana Gonzalez-Reiche","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicina at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hernandez","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Emilia Sordillo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Viviana Simon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Harm van Bakel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Juan David Ramirez","author_inst":"Universidad del Rosario"},{"author_name":"- the CACTUS study team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Nils Landegren","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Paolo Palma","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Petter Brodin","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Quirin Hammer","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Kristoffer Stralin","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Niklas K Bjorkstrom","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"- Karolinska COVID-19 Study Group","author_inst":"-"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"genetic and genomic medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.09.20149955","rel_title":"A Poorly Understood Disease?

We find strong evidence of an income gradient in the impact of the pandemic on mortality: it is twice as large in the poorest municipalities compared to other municipalities. We then show that both poor housing conditions and higher occupational exposure are likely mechanisms. Overall, these mechanisms accounts for up to 60% of the difference observed between rich and poor municipalities.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paul Brandily","author_inst":"Paris School of Economics"},{"author_name":"Clement Brebion","author_inst":"Centre d'Etudes de l'Emploi et du Travail"},{"author_name":"Simon Briole","author_inst":"Paris School of Economics & J-PAL Europe"},{"author_name":"Laura Khoury","author_inst":"Norwegian School of Economics"},{"author_name":"Angelica Rico","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Lisseth Pardo","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Esther C Barros","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Carolina Hernandez","author_inst":"Universidad del Rosario"},{"author_name":"Lourdes Delgado","author_inst":"Universidad del Rosario"},{"author_name":"Jesus Jaimes","author_inst":"Universidad del Rosario"},{"author_name":"Luis Perez","author_inst":"Universidad del Rosario"},{"author_name":"Anibal Teheran","author_inst":"Fundacion Universitaria Juan N Corpas"},{"author_name":"Hala Alshammary","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Ajay Obla","author_inst":"Ichan School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Zenab Khan","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Ana Gonzalez-Reiche","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicina at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hernandez","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Emilia Sordillo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Viviana Simon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Harm van Bakel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Juan David Ramirez","author_inst":"Universidad del Rosario"},{"author_name":"- the CACTUS study team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Nils Landegren","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Paolo Palma","author_inst":"Bambino Gesu Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Petter Brodin","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Quirin Hammer","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Kristoffer Stralin","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Niklas K Bjorkstrom","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"- Karolinska COVID-19 Study Group","author_inst":"-"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health economics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.09.20149849","rel_title":"Severe SAR-CoV-2 infection in humans is defined by a shift in the serum lipidome resulting indysregulation of eicosanoid immune mediators","rel_date":"2020-07-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.09.20149849","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than 10 million people worldwide with mortality exceeding half a million patients.

Notably each of these risk factors pathologically disrupts the lipidome and this disruption may be a unifying feature of severe COVID-19. Here we provide the first in depth interrogation of lipidomic changes, including structural-lipids as well as the eicosanoids and docosanoids lipid mediators (LMs), that mark COVID-19 disease severity. Our data reveal that progression from moderate to severe disease is marked by a loss of specific immune regulatory LMs and increased pro-inflammatory species.

A major effort was completed to compare 17 serological tests. Methods In a preliminary phase, we compared 17 IgG, IgM, IgA and pan Ig serological tests including ELISA, LFA, CLIA and ECLIA on a panel of 182 sera, comprising 113 sera from hospitalized patients with a positive RT-PCR, and 69 sampled before 1st November 2019, expected to give a positive and negative results, respectively. In a second phase, the five best performing and most available tests were further evaluated on a total of 582 sera (178 and 404 expected positive and negative, respectively), allowing the assessment of 20 possible cross-reactions with other virus. Results In the preliminary phase, among eight IgG\/pan-Ig ELISA or CLIA\/ECLIA tests, four had a sensitivity and specificity above 90% and 98% respectively, and on six IgM\/IgA tests, only one was acceptable. Only one LFA test on three showed good performances for both IgG and IgM. For all the tests IgM and IgG aroused concomitantly. In the second phase, no tests showed particular cross-reaction. We observed an important heterogeneity in the development of the antibody response, and that anti-nucleocapside (anti-N) antibodies appeared earlier than the anti-spike (anti-S) proteins. Conclusions The identified SARS-CoV-2 serology tests may be used for the diagnostic of CoviD-19 for negative RT-PCR patients presenting severe to mild suggestive symptoms or particular clinical presentation. Detection of both anti-N and anti-S could be complementary to increase the sensitivity of the analysis.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alix T.

We consider repeat SARS-CoV-2 testing models for the purpose of containing outbreaks in the residential campus community. The goal of repeat testing is to detect and isolate new infections rapidly to block transmission that would otherwise occur both on and off campus. The models allow for specification of aspects including scheduled on-campus resident screening at a given frequency, test sensitivity that can depend on the time since infection, imported infections from off campus throughout the school term, and a lag from testing until student isolation due to laboratory turnaround and student relocation delay. For early- (late-) transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by age of infection, we find that weekly screening cannot reliably contain outbreaks with reproductive numbers above 1.4 (1.6) if more than one imported exposure per 10,000 students occurs daily. Screening every three days can contain outbreaks providing the reproductive number remains below 1.75 (2.3) if transmission happens earlier (later) with time from infection, but at the cost of increased false positive rates requiring more isolation quarters for students testing positive. Testing frequently while minimizing the delay from testing until isolation for those found positive are the most controllable levers for preventing large residential college outbreaks.

Here we analyze 247 full-genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences from two nearby communities in Wisconsin, USA, and find surprisingly distinct patterns of viral spread. Dane County had the 12th known introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States, but this did not lead to descendant community spread. Instead, the Dane County outbreak was seeded by multiple later introductions, followed by limited community spread. In contrast, relatively few introductions in Milwaukee County led to extensive community spread. We present evidence for reduced viral spread in both counties, and limited viral transmission between counties, following the statewide Safer-at-Home public health order, which went into effect 25 March 2020. Our results suggest that early containment efforts suppressed the spread of SARS-CoV-2 within Wisconsin.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gage Kahl Moreno","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin - Madison"},{"author_name":"Katarina M Braun","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Kasen K Riemersma","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Michael A Martin","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Peter J Halfmann","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Chelsea M Crooks","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Trent Prall","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"David Baker","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"John J Baczenas","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Anna S Heffron","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Mitchell Ramuta","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Manjeet Khubbar","author_inst":"City of Milwaukee Health Department Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Andrea  M.

This study systematically examines care-home outbreaks of COVID-19 in a large Scottish health board. Methods: Analysis of testing, cases and deaths using linked care-home, testing and mortality data for 189 care-homes with 5843 beds in a large Scottish Health Board up to 15\/06\/20. Findings: 70 (37.0%) of care-homes experienced a COVID-19 outbreak, 66 of which were in care-homes for older people where care-home size was strongly associated with outbreaks (OR per 20-bed increase 3.50, 95%CI 2.06 to 5.94). There were 852 confirmed cases and 419 COVID-related deaths, 401 (95.7%) of which occurred in care-homes with an outbreak, 16 (3.8%) in hospital, and two in the 119 care-homes without a known outbreak. For non-COVID related deaths, there were 73 excess deaths in care-homes with an outbreak, but no excess deaths in care-homes without an outbreak, and 24 fewer deaths than expected of care-home residents in hospital. A quarter of COVID-19 related cases and deaths occurred in five (2.6%) care-homes, and half in 13 (6.9%) care-homes. Interpretation: The large impact on excess deaths appears to be primarily a direct effect of COVID-19, with cases and deaths are concentrated in a minority of care homes. A key implication is that there is a large pool of susceptible residents if community COVID-19 incidence increases again. Shielding residents from potential sources of infection and rapid action into minimise outbreak size where infection is introduced will be critical in any wave 2.

Widely used statistical and computer methods for modeling and forecasting the trajectory of Covid-19 are epidemiological models. Although these epidemiological models are useful for estimating the dynamics of transmission of epidemics, their prediction accuracies are quite low. Alternative to the epidemiological models, the reinforcement learning (RL) and causal inference emerge as a powerful tool to select optimal interventions for worldwide containment of Covid-19. Therefore, we formulated real-time forecasting and evaluation of multiple public health intervention problems into off-policy evaluation (OPE) and counterfactual outcome forecasting problems and integrated RL and recurrent neural network (RNN) for exploring public health intervention strategies to slow down the spread of Covid-19 worldwide, given the historical data that may have been generated by different public health intervention policies. We applied the developed methods to real data collected from January 22, 2020 to July 30, 2020 for real-time forecasting the confirmed cases of Covid-19 across the world. We observed that the number of new cases of Covid-19 worldwide reached a peak (407,205) on July 24, 2020 and forecasted that the number of laboratory-confirmed cumulative cases of Covid-19 will pass 20 million as of August 22, 2020.

One of the most concerning aspects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemics is that it disproportionately affects people from Black and African American backgrounds creating an unexpected infection gap. Interestingly, the abnormal impact on these ethnic groups seem to be almost uncorrelated with other risk factors, including co-morbidity, poverty, level of education, access to healthcare, residential segregation, and response to cures. A proposed explanation for the observed incidence gap is that people from African American backgrounds are more often employed in low-income service jobs, and are thus more exposed to infection through face-to-face contacts, but the lack of direct data has not allowed to draw strong conclusions in this sense so far. Here we introduce the concept of dynamic segregation, that is the extent to which a given group of people is internally clustered or exposed to other groups, as a result of mobility and commuting habits. By analysing census and mobility data on more than 120 major US cities, we found that the dynamic segregation of African American communities is significantly associated with the weekly excess COVID-19 incidence and mortality in those communities. The results confirm that knowing where people commute to, rather than where they live, is much more relevant for disease modelling.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aleix Bassolas","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Sandro Sousa","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Vincenzo Nicosia","author_inst":"Queen mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Shudi Li","author_inst":"University of Texas School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Wei Lin","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Li Jin","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Momiao Xiong","author_inst":"University of Texas School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Richard Othieno","author_inst":"NHS Lothian"},{"author_name":"Janet Stevenson","author_inst":"NHS Lothian"},{"author_name":"Stefanie Swietlik","author_inst":"NHS Lothian"},{"author_name":"Kate Templeton","author_inst":"NHS Lothian"},{"author_name":"Mette Tranter","author_inst":"NHS Lothian"},{"author_name":"Lorna Willocks","author_inst":"NHS Lothian"},{"author_name":"Bruce Guthrie","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"William M Rehrauer","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Shelby L O'Connor","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Nasia Safdar","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Caitlin S Pepperell","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Trivikram Dasu","author_inst":"City of Milwaukee Health Department Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Sanjib Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"City of Milwaukee Health Department Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Yoshihiro Kawaoka","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Katia Koelle","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"David H O'Connor","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Thomas C Friedrich","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey S.

People of minority ethnic background may be disproportionately affected by severe COVID-19 for reasons that are unclear. We sought to examine the relationship between ethnic background and (1) hospital admission for severe COVID-19; (2) in-hospital mortality. Methods. We conducted a case-control study of 872 inner city adult residents admitted to hospital with confirmed COVID-19 (cases) and 3,488 matched controls randomly sampled from a primary healthcare database comprising 344,083 people resident in the same region. To examine in-hospital mortality, we conducted a cohort study of 1827 adults consecutively admitted with COVID-19. Data collected included hospital admission for COVID-19, demographics, comorbidities, in-hospital mortality. The primary exposure variable was self-defined ethnicity. Results. The 872 cases comprised 48.1% Black, 33.7% White, 12.6% Mixed\/Other and 5.6% Asian patients. In conditional logistic regression analyses, Black and Mixed\/Other ethnicity were associated with higher admission risk than white (OR 3.12 [95% CI 2.63-3.71] and 2.97 [2.30- 3.85] respectively). Adjustment for comorbidities and deprivation modestly attenuated the association (OR 2.28 [1.87-2.79] for Black, 2.66 [2.01-3.52] for Mixed\/Other). Asian ethnicity was not associated with higher admission risk (OR 1.20 [0.86-1.66]). In the cohort study of 1827 patients, 455 (28.9%) died over a median (IQR) of 8 (4-16) days. Age and male sex, but not Black (adjusted HR 0.84 [0.63-1.11]) or Mixed\/Other ethnicity (adjusted HR 0.69 [0.43-1.10]), were associated with in-hospital mortality. Asian ethnicity was associated with higher in-hospital mortality (adjusted HR 1.54 [0.98-2.41]). Conclusions. Black and Mixed ethnicity are independently associated with greater admission risk with COVID-19 and may be risk factors for development of severe disease. Comorbidities and socioeconomic factors only partly account for this and additional ethnicity-related factors may play a large role. The impact of COVID-19 may be different in Asians.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rosita Zakeri","author_inst":"King's College, London"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Bendayan","author_inst":"King's College, London"},{"author_name":"Mark Ashworth","author_inst":"King's College, London"},{"author_name":"Daniel M Bean","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Hiten Dodhia","author_inst":"King's College, London"},{"author_name":"Stevo Durbaba","author_inst":"King's College, London"},{"author_name":"Kevin O Gallagher","author_inst":"King's College, London"},{"author_name":"Claire Palmer","author_inst":"King's College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Vasa Curcin","author_inst":"King's College, London"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Aitken","author_inst":"Lewisham & Greenwich NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"William Bernal","author_inst":"King's College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Richard D Barker","author_inst":"King's College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sam Norton","author_inst":"King's College, London"},{"author_name":"Martin C Gulliford","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"James T Teo","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"James Galloway","author_inst":"King's College, London"},{"author_name":"Richard J Dobson","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Ajay M Shah","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Trivikram Dasu","author_inst":"City of Milwaukee Health Department Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Sanjib Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"City of Milwaukee Health Department Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Yoshihiro Kawaoka","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Katia Koelle","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"David H O'Connor","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Thomas C Friedrich","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey S.

Second, to investigate the association between HL and the knowledge and behavior relevant for preventing spread of the virus. Third, to explore variables associated with HRQoL in a pandemic environment. Methods: This cross-sectional study includes survey data from 2,205 Norwegian adolescents 16-19 years of age. The participants reported on their health information sources, HL, handwashing knowledge and behavior, number of social interactions, and HRQoL. Associations between study variables and specified outcomes were explored using multiple linear and logistic regression analyses. Results: Television (TV) and family were indicated to be the main sources for pandemic-related health information. Handwashing, physical distancing, and limiting the number of social contacts were the most frequently reported measures. HL and handwashing knowledge and HL and handwashing behavior were significantly associated. For each unit increase on the HL scale, the participants were 5% more likely to socialize less with friends in comparison to normal. The mean HRQoL was very poor compared to European norms. Being quarantined or isolated and having confirmed or suspected Covid-19 were significantly negatively associated with HRQoL, but seeing less friends than normal was not associated. HL was significantly positively associated with HRQoL, albeit of minor clinical importance. Conclusion: Adolescents follow the health authorities' guidelines and appear highly literate. However, high fidelity requires great sacrifice because the required measures seem to collide with certain aspects that are important for the adolescents' HRQoL.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kirsti Riiser","author_inst":"OsloMet -Oslo Metropolitan University"},{"author_name":"Solvi Helseth","author_inst":"OsloMet -Oslo Metropolitan University"},{"author_name":"Kristin Haraldstad","author_inst":"University of Agder"},{"author_name":"Astrid Torbjornsen","author_inst":"OsloMet -Oslo Metropolitan University"},{"author_name":"Kare Ronn Richardsen","author_inst":"OsloMet -Oslo Metropolitan University"},{"author_name":"Stevo Durbaba","author_inst":"King's College, London"},{"author_name":"Kevin O Gallagher","author_inst":"King's College, London"},{"author_name":"Claire Palmer","author_inst":"King's College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Vasa Curcin","author_inst":"King's College, London"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Aitken","author_inst":"Lewisham & Greenwich NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"William Bernal","author_inst":"King's College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Richard D Barker","author_inst":"King's College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sam Norton","author_inst":"King's College, London"},{"author_name":"Martin C Gulliford","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"James T Teo","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"James Galloway","author_inst":"King's College, London"},{"author_name":"Richard J Dobson","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Ajay M Shah","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Trivikram Dasu","author_inst":"City of Milwaukee Health Department Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Sanjib Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"City of Milwaukee Health Department Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Yoshihiro Kawaoka","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Katia Koelle","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"David H O'Connor","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Thomas C Friedrich","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey S.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), an antimalarial and anti-inflammatory drug, has been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and tested in clinical studies. However, lung concentration (6.7 {micro}g\/mL) to predict the in vivo antiviral efficacy might not be achievable with the currently proposed oral dosing regimen. Further, a high cumulative doses of HCQ may raise concerns of systemic toxicity, including cardiotoxicity. Here, we described a non-clinical study to investigate the pharmacokinetics of a novel formulation of liposomal HCQ administrated by intratracheal (IT) instillation in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats which achieved 129.4 {micro}g\/g (Cmax) in the lung. Compared to unformulated HCQ administered intravenous (IV), liposomal HCQ with normalized dose showed higher ([~]30-fold) lung exposure, longer ([~]2.5-fold) half-life in lung, but lower blood exposure with [~]20% of Cmax and 74% of AUC and lower heart exposure with 24% of Cmax and 58% of AUC. In conclusion, the pharmacokinetics results in an animal model demonstrate the proof of concept that inhalable liposomal HCQ may provide clinical benefit and serve as a potential treatment for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tien-Tzu Tai","author_inst":"Taiwan Liposome Company"},{"author_name":"Tzung-Ju Wu","author_inst":"Taiwan Liposome Company"},{"author_name":"Huey-Dong Wu","author_inst":"National Taiwan University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yi-Chen Tsai","author_inst":"Taiwan Liposome Company"},{"author_name":"Hui-Ting Wang","author_inst":"Taiwan Liposome Company"},{"author_name":"An-Min Wang","author_inst":"Taiwan Liposome Company"},{"author_name":"Sheue-Fang Shih","author_inst":"Taiwan Liposome Company"},{"author_name":"Yee-Chun Chen","author_inst":"National Taiwan University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Vasa Curcin","author_inst":"King's College, London"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Aitken","author_inst":"Lewisham & Greenwich NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"William Bernal","author_inst":"King's College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Richard D Barker","author_inst":"King's College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sam Norton","author_inst":"King's College, London"},{"author_name":"Martin C Gulliford","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"James T Teo","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"James Galloway","author_inst":"King's College, London"},{"author_name":"Richard J Dobson","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Ajay M Shah","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Trivikram Dasu","author_inst":"City of Milwaukee Health Department Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Sanjib Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"City of Milwaukee Health Department Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Yoshihiro Kawaoka","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Katia Koelle","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"David H O'Connor","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Thomas C Friedrich","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey S.

To meet this challenge, participants need an informed approach for working safely with the etiological agent, the novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Work with infectious SARS-CoV-2 is currently restricted to high-containment laboratories, but material can be handled at a lower containment level after inactivation. Given the wide array of inactivation reagents that are being used in laboratories during this pandemic, it is vital that their effectiveness is thoroughly investigated. Here, we evaluated a total of 23 commercial reagents designed for clinical sample transportation, nucleic acid extraction and virus inactivation for their ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2, as well as seven other common chemicals including detergents and fixatives. As part of this study, we have also tested five filtration matrices for their effectiveness at removing the cytotoxic elements of each reagent, permitting accurate determination of levels of infectious virus remaining following treatment. In addition to providing critical data informing inactivation methods and risk assessments for diagnostic and research laboratories working with SARS-CoV-2, these data provide a framework for other laboratories to validate their inactivation processes and to guide similar studies for other pathogens.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stephen Welch","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Katherine Davies","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Hubert Buczkowski","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Nipunadi Hettiarachchi","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Nicole Green","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Ulrike Arnold","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Matthew Jones","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Matthew J Hannah","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Reah Evans","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Christopher Burton","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Jane E Burton","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Malcolm Guiver","author_inst":"Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Patricia A Cane","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Neil Woodford","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Christine B Bruce","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Allen D.G Roberts","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Marian J Killip","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Ajay M Shah","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Trivikram Dasu","author_inst":"City of Milwaukee Health Department Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Sanjib Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"City of Milwaukee Health Department Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Yoshihiro Kawaoka","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Katia Koelle","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"David H O'Connor","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Thomas C Friedrich","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey S.
