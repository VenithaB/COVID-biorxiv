As the etiological coronavirus (a.k.a. SARS-CoV2) may putatively have a bat origin, our understanding about its intermediate reservoir between bats and humans, especially its tropism in wild and domestic animals, are mostly unknown. This constitutes major concerns in public health for the current pandemics and potential zoonosis. Previous reports using structural analysis of the viral spike protein (S) binding its cell receptor of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), indicate a broad SARS-CoV2 susceptibility in wild and particularly domestic animals. Through integration of key immunogenetic factors, including the existence of S-binding-void ACE2 isoforms and the disparity of ACE2 expression upon early innate immune response, we further refine the SARS-CoV2 susceptibility prediction to fit recent experimental validation. In addition to showing a broad susceptibility potential across mammalian species based on structural analysis, our results also reveal that domestic animals including dogs, pigs, cattle and goats may evolve ACE2-related immunogenetic diversity to restrict SARS-CoV2 infections. Thus, we propose that domestic animals may be unlikely to play a role as amplifying hosts unless the virus has further species-specific adaptation. These findings may relieve relevant public concerns regarding COVID-19-like risk in domestic animals, highlight virus-host coevolution, and evoke disease intervention through targeting ACE2 molecular diversity and interferon optimization.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eric R.

Assays to monitor SARS-CoV-2 growth depend on time-consuming and costly RNA extraction steps, hampering progress in basic research and drug development efforts. Here we developed a facile Q-RT-PCR assay that bypasses viral RNA extraction steps and can monitor SARS-CoV-2 replication kinetics from a small amount of cell culture supernatants. Using this assay, we screened the activities of a number of entry, SARS-CoV-2- and HIV-1-specific inhibitors in a proof of concept study. In line with previous studies which has shown that processing of the viral Spike protein by cellular proteases and endosomal fusion are required for entry, we found that E64D and apilimod potently decreased the amount of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in cell culture supernatants with minimal cytotoxicity. Surprisingly, we found that macropinocytosis inhibitor EIPA similarly decreased viral RNA in supernatants suggesting that entry may additionally be mediated by an alternative pathway. HIV-1-specific inhibitors nevirapine (an NNRTI), amprenavir (a protease inhibitor), and ALLINI-2 (an allosteric integrase inhibitor) modestly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication, albeit the IC50 values were much higher than that required for HIV-1. Taken together, this facile assay will undoubtedly expedite basic SARS-CoV-2 research, be amenable to mid-throughput screens to identify chemical inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2, and be applicable to a broad number of RNA and DNA viruses.\n\nImportanceSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, has quickly become a major global health problem causing immense respiratory disease and social and economic disruptions. Conventional assays that monitor SARS-CoV-2 growth in cell culture rely on costly and time-consuming RNA extraction procedures, hampering progress in basic SARS-CoV-2 research and development of effective therapeutics. Here we developed a facile Q-RT-PCR assay to monitor SARS-CoV-2 growth in cell culture supernatants that does not necessitate RNA extraction, and is as accurate and sensitive as existing methods. In a proof-of-concept screen, we found that E64D, apilimod, EIPA and remdesivir can substantially impede SARS-Cov-2 replication providing novel insight into viral entry and replication mechanisms. This facile approach will undoubtedly expedite basic SARS-CoV-2 research, be amenable to screening platforms to identify therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and can be adapted to numerous other RNA and DNA viruses.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christian Shema Mugisha","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hung R.

Here, we developed two modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) based vaccines which express either a membrane anchored full-length spike protein (MVA\/S) stabilized in a prefusion state or the S1 region of the spike (MVA\/S1) which forms trimers and is secreted. Both immunogens contained the receptor-binding domain (RBD) which is a known target of antibody-mediated neutralization. Following immunizations with MVA\/S or MVA\/S1, both spike protein recombinants induced strong IgG antibodies to purified full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The MVA\/S induced a robust antibody response to purified RBD, S1 and S2 whereas MVA\/S1 induced an antibody response to the S1 region outside of the RBD region. Both vaccines induced an antibody response in the lung and that was associated with induction of bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue. MVA\/S but not MVA\/S1 vaccinated mice generated robust neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 that strongly correlated with RBD antibody binding titers. Mechanistically, S1 binding to ACE-2 was strong but reduced following prolonged pre-incubation at room temperature suggesting confirmation changes in RBD with time. These results demonstrate MVA\/S is a potential vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 infection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nanda Kishore Routhu","author_inst":"Emory Vaccine Center, Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30329, USA"},{"author_name":"Sailaja Gangadhara","author_inst":"Emory Vaccine Center, Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30329, USA"},{"author_name":"Narayanaiah Cheedarla","author_inst":"Emory Vaccine Center, Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30329, USA"},{"author_name":"Ayalnesh Shiferaw","author_inst":"Emory Vaccine Center, Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30329, USA"},{"author_name":"Sheikh Abdul Rahman","author_inst":"Emory Vaccine Center, Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30329, USA"},{"author_name":"Anusmita Sahoo","author_inst":"Emory Vaccine Center, Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30329, USA"},{"author_name":"Pei-Yong Shi","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Vineet D Menachery","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Katharine Floyd","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Division of Infectious Diseases, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Fischinger","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA"},{"author_name":"Caroline Atyeo","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA"},{"author_name":"Galit Alter","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA"},{"author_name":"Mehul S Suthar","author_inst":"Emory Vaccine Center, Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30329, USA"},{"author_name":"Rama Rao Amara","author_inst":"Emory Vaccine Center, Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30329, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.27.174979","rel_title":"Structures, conformations and distributions of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein trimers on intact virions","rel_date":"2020-06-27","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.27.174979","rel_abs":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virions are surrounded by a lipid bilayer from which spike (S) protein trimers protrude.

S exhibits extensive conformational flexibility: it modulates the exposure of its receptor binding site and later undergoes complete structural rearrangement to drive fusion of viral and cellular membranes. The structures and conformations of soluble, overexpressed, purified S proteins have been studied in detail using cryo-electron microscopy. The structure and distribution of S on the virion surface, however, has not been characterised. Here we applied cryo-electron microscopy and tomography to image intact SARS-CoV-2 virions, determining the high-resolution structure, conformational flexibility and distributions of S trimers in situ on the virion surface. These results provide a basis for understanding the conformations of S present on the virion, and for studying their interactions with neutralizing antibodies.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zunlong Ke","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Joaquin Oton","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Kun Qu","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Mirko Cortese","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Heidelberg University"},{"author_name":"Vojtech Zila","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Heidelberg University"},{"author_name":"Lesley McKeane","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Takanori Nakane","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Jasenko Zivanov","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Christopher J Neufeldt","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Heidelberg University"},{"author_name":"John M Lu","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Julia Peukes","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Xiaoli Xiong","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Hans-Georg Krausslich","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Heidelberg University"},{"author_name":"Sjors H.W.

The spike protein of nCOV-2019 resides on the virions surface mediating coronavirus entry into host cells by binding its receptor binding domain (RBD) to the host cell surface receptor protein, angiotensin converter enzyme (ACE2). Our goal is to provide a detailed structural mechanism of how nCOV-2019 recognizes and establishes contacts with ACE2 and its difference with an earlier coronavirus SARS-COV in 2002 via extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Numerous mutations have been identified in the RBD of nCOV-2019 strains isolated from humans in different parts of the world. In this study, we investigated the effect of these mutations as well as other Ala-scanning mutations on the stability of RBD\/ACE2 complex. It is found that most of the naturally-occurring mutations to the RBD either strengthen or have the same binding affinity to ACE2 as the wild-type nCOV-2019. This may have implications for high human-to-human transmission of coronavirus in regions where these mutations have been found as well as any vaccine design endeavors since these mutations could act as antibody escape mutants. Furthermore, in-silico Ala-scanning and long-timescale MD simulations, highlight the crucial role of the residues at the interface of RBD and ACE2 that may be used as potential pharmacophores for any drug development endeavors. From an evolutional perspective, this study also identifies how the virus has evolved from its predecessor SARS-COV and how it could further evolve to become more infectious.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mahdi Ghorbani","author_inst":"University of Maryland"},{"author_name":"Bernard R.

A relatively higher divergence on the spike protein of SASR-CoV-2 enables it to transmit across species efficiently. We particularly believe that the adaptive mutations of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike protein in SARS-CoV-2 might be essential to its high transmissibility among humans. Thus here we collected 2,142 high-quality genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from 160 regions in over 50 countries and reconstructed their phylogeny, and also analyzed the interaction between the polymorphisms of spike protein and human ACE2 (hACE2). Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus in other hosts show SARS-CoV-2 is highly possible originated from Bat-CoV (RaTG13) found in horseshoe bat and a recombination event may occur on the spike protein of Pangolin-CoV to imbue it the ability to infect humans. Moreover, compared to the S gene of SARS-CoV-2, it is more conserved in the direct-binding sites of RBD and we noticed that spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 may under a consensus evolution to adapt to human hosts better. 3,860 amino acid mutations in spike protein RBD (T333-C525) of SARS-CoV-2 were simulated and their stability and affinity binding to hACE2 (S19-D615) were calculated. Our analysis indicates SARS-CoV-2 could infect humans from different populations with no preference, and a higher divergence in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 at the early stage of this pandemic may be a good indicator that could show the pathway of SARS-CoV-2 transmitting from the natural reservoir to human beings.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xia Xue","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Jianxiang Shi","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Hongen Xu","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yaping Qin","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Zengguang Yang","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Shuaisheng Feng","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Danhua Liu","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Liguo Jian","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Linlin Hua","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yaohe Wang","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Qi Zhang","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xueyong Huang","author_inst":"Henan Province Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xinxin Li","author_inst":"Henan hospital of infectious diseases"},{"author_name":"Chunguang Chen","author_inst":"Henan hospital of infectious diseases"},{"author_name":"JianCheng Guo","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Wenxue Tang","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Jianbo Liu","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.19.20128207","rel_title":"COVID-19 related concerns of people with long-term respiratory conditions: A qualitative study","rel_date":"2020-06-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.19.20128207","rel_abs":"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic is having profound psychological impacts on populations globally, with increasing levels of stress, anxiety, and depression being reported, especially in people with pre-existing medical conditions who appear to be particularly vulnerable. There are limited data on the specific concerns people have about COVID-19 and what these are based on. METHODS The aim of this study was to identify and explore the concerns of people with long-term respiratory conditions in the UK regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and how these concerns were affecting them. We conducted a thematic analysis of free text responses to the question 'What are your main concerns about getting coronavirus?', which was included in the British Lung Foundation\/Asthma UK (BLF-AUK) partnership COVID-19 survey, conducted between the 1st and 8th of April. This was during the 3rd week of the UK's initial social distancing measures. RESULTS 7,039 responses were analysed, with respondents from a wide range of ages, gender, and all UK nations. Respondents reported having asthma (85%), COPD (9%), bronchiectasis (4%), interstitial lung disease (2%), or 'other' lung diseases (e.g. lung cancer) (1%). Four main themes were identified: 1) vulnerability to COVID-19; 2) anticipated experience of contracting COVID-19; 3) wide-reaching uncertainty; and 4) inadequate national response. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic is having profound psychological impacts. The concerns we identified largely reflect objective, as well as subjective, aspects of the current situation. Hence, key approaches to reducing these concerns require changes to the reality of their situation, and are likely to include i) helping people optimise their health, limit risk of infection, and access necessities; ii) minimising the negative experience of disease where possible, iii) providing up-to-date, accurate and consistent information, iv) improving the government and healthcare response.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Keir Elmslie James Philip","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Bradley Lonergan","author_inst":"Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Andrew Cumella","author_inst":"Asthma UK and British Lung Foundation Partnership"},{"author_name":"Joe Farrington-Douglas","author_inst":"Asthma UK and British Lung Foundation Partnership"},{"author_name":"Michael Laffan","author_inst":"Asthma UK and British Lung Foundation Partnership"},{"author_name":"Nicholas S Hopkinson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Danhua Liu","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Liguo Jian","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Linlin Hua","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yaohe Wang","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Qi Zhang","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xueyong Huang","author_inst":"Henan Province Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xinxin Li","author_inst":"Henan hospital of infectious diseases"},{"author_name":"Chunguang Chen","author_inst":"Henan hospital of infectious diseases"},{"author_name":"JianCheng Guo","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Wenxue Tang","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Jianbo Liu","author_inst":"Zhengzhou University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.24.20139121","rel_title":"Exploring Causal relationship between risk factors and vulnerability to COVID-19Cases of Italy, Spain, France, Greece, Portugal, Morocco and South Africa","rel_date":"2020-06-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.24.20139121","rel_abs":"Even though the infection rate of COVID-19 is very high as of today 31 May: 5,819,962 confirmed cases worldwide, the death rate is only about 6.23%, 362,786 deaths as for the same date.

Specifically, the contagion and removal terms, normally linear in the fraction $I$ of infecteds, are taken to depend on $I^{\\,q_{up}}$ and $I^{\\,q_{down}}$, respectively. These dependencies can be understood as highly reduced effective descriptions of contagion via anomalous diffusion of susceptibles and infecteds in fractal geometries, and removal (i.e., recovery or death) via complex mechanisms leading to slowly decaying removal-time distributions. We obtain rather convincing fits to time series for both active cases and mortality with the same values of $(q_{up},q_{down})$ for a given country, suggesting that such aspects may in fact be present in the evolution of the Covid-19 pandemic. We also obtain approximate values for the effective population $N_{eff}$, which turns out to be a small percentage of the entire population $N$ for each country.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ugur TIRNAKLI","author_inst":"Ege University"},{"author_name":"Constantino Tsallis","author_inst":"CBPF"},{"author_name":"Thaer A.

Methods: A locally developed rapid IgM\/IgG test kit was used for screening hospital staff and patients who required procedural treatment or surgery in 52 hospitals in Thailand from April 8 to June 26, 2020. A total of 857 participants were tested--675 were hospital staff and 182 were pre-procedural patients. (Thai Clinical Trials Registry: TCTR20200426002) Results Overall, 5.5% of the participants (47 of 857) had positive immunoglobulin M (IgM), 0.2% (2 of 857) had positive immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM. Hospitals located in the Central part of Thailand had the highest IgM seroprevalence (11.9%). Preprocedural patients had a higher rate of positive IgM than the hospital staff (12.1% vs. 3.7%). Participants with present upper respiratory tract symptoms had a higher rate of positive IgM than those without (9.6% vs. 4.5%). Three quarters (80.5%, 690 of 857) of the participants were asymptomatic, of which, 31 had positive IgM (4.5%) which consisted of 20 of 566 healthcare workers (3.5%) and 11 of 124 preprocedural patients (8.9%). Conclusions COVID-19 antibody test could detect a substantial number of potential silent spreaders in Thai community hospitals.

Healthcare workers are one of the risk groups that need to be well characterized due to their strategic role in the management of patients, presently and in prevention of healthcare needs for future outbreaks. This study presents the results of the first SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence study in the Northern Metropolitan Area of Barcelona, Spain. Methods: IgG SARS-CoV2 antibodies were analyzed in serum samples from 7563 healthcare workers of the Northern Metropolitan Area of Barcelona taken during the pandemia (from May 4th to May 22nd, 2020) by chemiluminescence assays. Results: A total of 779 of 7563 (10.3%) healthcare workers had detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG (specific for either S1\/S2 or N antigens). No significant differences were observed between those working at primary care or at the reference hospital. Interestingly, in 29 (8.53%) of the previously confirmed positive reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) patients SARS-CoV-2 IgG (S1\/S2 or recombinant N antigen) were negative. Conclusion: Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in the healthcare workers of the Nord Metropolitan Area of Barcelona was significantly increased in comparison with the general population in the same geographical area. These results give us an important insight for a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology, in a collective that is essential for the response against this pandemic.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gema Fern\u00e1ndez-Rivas","author_inst":"Hospital Germans Trias.

Treatment targeting this immune response might be beneficial but there is limited evidence on its efficacy. The aim of this study was to determine if early treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with tocilizumab and\/or steroids was associated with better outcome. Methods This observational single-center study included patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who were not intubated and received either standard of care (SOC, controls) or SOC plus early (within 3 days from hospital admission) anti-inflammatory treatment. SOC consisted of hydroxychloroquine 400mg bid plus, in those admitted before March 24th, also darunavir\/ritonavir. Anti-inflammatory treatment consisted of either tocilizumab (8mg\/kg intravenously or 162mg subcutaneously) or methylprednisolone 1 mg\/kg for 5 days or both. Failure was defined as intubation or death, and the endpoints were failure-free survival (primary endpoint) and overall survival (secondary) at day 30. Difference between the groups was estimated as Hazard Ratio by a propensity score weighted Cox regression analysis (HROW). Results Overall, 196 adults were included in the analyses. They were mainly male (67.4%), with comorbidities (78.1%) and severe COVID-19 pneumonia (83.7%). Median age was 67.9 years (range, 30-100) and median PaO2\/FiO2 200 mmHg (IQR 133-289). Among them, 130 received early anti-inflammatory treatment with: tocilizumab (n=29, 22.3%), methylprednisolone (n=45, 34.6%), or both (n=56, 43.1%). The adjusted failure-free survival among tocilizumab\/methylprednisolone\/SOC treated patients vs. SOC was 80.8% (95%CI, 72.8-86.7) vs. 64.1% (95%CI, 51.3-74.0), HROW 0.48, 95%CI, 0.23-0.99; p=0.049. The overall survival among tocilizumab\/methylprednisolone\/SOC patients vs. SOC was 85.9% (95%CI, 80.7-92.6) vs. 71.9% (95%CI, 46-73), HROW 0.41, 95%CI: 0.19-0.89, p=0.025. Conclusion Early adjunctive treatment with tocilizumab, methylprednisolone or both may improve outcomes in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","rel_num_authors":44,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Malgorzata Mikulska","author_inst":"University of Genova"},{"author_name":"Laura Ambra Nicolini","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessio Signori","author_inst":"Section of Biostatistics, Department of Health Sciences, University of Genova, Genova, Italy"},{"author_name":"Antonio Di Biagio","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Health Sciences (DISSAL), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy;

A thorough understanding of the molecular and histological correlates of the disease is still missing, especially because post-mortem analysis of COVID-19-affected organs has been so far scant and often anecdotical. Here we report the results of the systematic analysis of 41 consecutive post-mortem samples from individuals who died of COVID-19. We found that the disease is characterized by extensive alveolar damage and thrombosis of the lung micro- and macro-vasculature. Thrombi were in different stages of organization, consistent with an ongoing, endogenous thrombotic process. In all the analyzed samples, in situ RNA hybridization showed that pneumocytes and vascular endothelial cells had massive presence of viral RNA even at the later stages of the disease. An additional feature of the disease was the presence, in the vast majority of patients, of a large number of dysmorphic pneumocytes, often forming large syncytial elements, a consequence of the fusogenic activity of the viral Spike protein, detected with specific antibodies. Despite occasional presence of virus-positive cells in the heart, no overt signs of viral infection were detected in other organs, which showed common alterations compatible with prolonged hypoxia, multifocal organ disease or previous comorbidities. In summary, COVID-19 is a unique interstitial pneumonia with extensive lung thrombosis, long-term persistence of viral replication in pneumocytes and endothelial cells, along with the presence of infected cellular syncytia in the lung. We propose that several of the COVID-19 disease features are due to the persistence of virus-infected cells in the lungs of the infected individuals for the duration of the disease.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mauro Giacca","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rossana Bussani","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Edoardo Schneider","author_inst":"ICGEB"},{"author_name":"Lorena Zentilin","author_inst":"ICGEB"},{"author_name":"Chiara Collesi","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Hashim Ali","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Luca Braga","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Ilaria Secco","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Maria Concetta Volpe","author_inst":"ICGEB"},{"author_name":"Andrea Colliva","author_inst":"ICGEB"},{"author_name":"Fabrizio Zanconati","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Berlot","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Furio Silvestri","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Serena Zacchigna","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Michele Mirabella","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Health Sciences (DISSAL), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy;

Brazil is the second country with more deaths due to COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate excess cardiovascular mortality during COVID-19 pandemic in 6 Brazilian capital cities. Methods: Using the Civil Registry public database, we evaluated total and cardiovascular excess deaths, further stratified in ACS, stroke and unspecified cardiovascular deaths in the 6 Brazilian cities with greater number of COVID-19 deaths (Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Fortaleza, Recife, Belem, Manaus). We compared data from epidemiological weeks 12 to 22 of 2020, with the same period in 2019. We also compared the number of hospital and home deaths during the period. Results: There were 69,328 deaths and 17,877 COVID-19 deaths in the studied period and cities for 2020. Cardiovascular mortality increased in most cities, with greater magnitude in the Northern capitals. However, while there was a reduction in ACS and stroke in the most developed cities, the Northern capitals showed an increase of these events. For unspecified cardiovascular deaths, there was a marked increase in all cities, which strongly correlated to the rise in home deaths (r=0.86, p=0.01). Conclusion: The excess cardiovascular mortality was greater in the less developed cities, possibly associated with healthcare collapse. ACS and stroke deaths decreased in the most developed cities, in parallel with an increase in unspecified cardiovascular and home deaths, presumably as a result of misdiagnosis. Conversely, ACS and stroke deaths increased in cities with a healthcare collapse.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luisa Campos Caldeira Brant","author_inst":"Hospital das Clinicas da Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Bruno Ramos Nascimento","author_inst":"Hospital das Clinicas da Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Renato Teixeira","author_inst":"Hospital das Clinicas da Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Marcelo Antonio Queiroga Lopes","author_inst":"Sociedade Brasileira de Cardiologia"},{"author_name":"Deborah Carvalho Malta","author_inst":"Escola de Enfermagem da Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Glaucia Maria Moraes Oliveira","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro"},{"author_name":"Antonio Luiz Pinho Ribeiro","author_inst":"Hospital das Clinicas da Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Ilaria Secco","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Maria Concetta Volpe","author_inst":"ICGEB"},{"author_name":"Andrea Colliva","author_inst":"ICGEB"},{"author_name":"Fabrizio Zanconati","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Berlot","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Furio Silvestri","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Serena Zacchigna","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Michele Mirabella","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Health Sciences (DISSAL), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy;

To investigate the benefits and costs of contact tracing, we develop an individual-based contact-network model and a susceptible-exposed-infected-confirmed (SEIC) epidemic model for the stochastic simulations of COVID-19 transmission. We estimate the unknown parameters (reproductive ratio R0 and confirmed rate {delta}2) by using observed confirmed case data. After a two month-lockdown, states in the USA have started the reopening process. We provide simulations for four different reopening situations: under \"stay-at-home\" order or no reopening, 25% reopening, 50% reopening, and 75% reopening. We model contact tracing in a two-layer network by modifying the basic SEIC epidemic model. The two-layer network is composed by the contact network in the first layer and the tracing network in the second layer. Since the full contact list of an infected individual patient can be hard to obtain, then we consider different fractions of contacts from 60% to 5%. The goal of this paper is to assess the effectiveness of contact tracing to control the COVID-19 spreading in the reopening process. In terms of benefits, simulation results show that increasing the fraction of traced contacts decreases the size of the epidemic. For example, tracing 20% of the contacts is enough for all four reopening scenarios to reduce the epidemic size by half. Considering the act of quarantining susceptible households as the contact tracing cost, we have observed an interesting phenomenon. When we increase the fraction of traced contacts from 5% to 20%, the number of quarantined susceptible people increases because each individual confirmed case is mentioning more contacts. However, when we increase the fraction of traced contacts from 20% to 60%, the number of quarantined susceptible people decreases because the increment of the mentioned contacts is balanced by a reduced number of confirmed cases. The main contribution of this research lies in the investigation of the effectiveness of contact tracing for the containment of COVID-19 spreading during the initial phase of the reopening process of the USA.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sifat afroj Moon","author_inst":"Kansas State University"},{"author_name":"Caterina Scoglio","author_inst":"Kansas State University"},{"author_name":"Renato Teixeira","author_inst":"Hospital das Clinicas da Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Marcelo Antonio Queiroga Lopes","author_inst":"Sociedade Brasileira de Cardiologia"},{"author_name":"Deborah Carvalho Malta","author_inst":"Escola de Enfermagem da Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Glaucia Maria Moraes Oliveira","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro"},{"author_name":"Antonio Luiz Pinho Ribeiro","author_inst":"Hospital das Clinicas da Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Ilaria Secco","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Maria Concetta Volpe","author_inst":"ICGEB"},{"author_name":"Andrea Colliva","author_inst":"ICGEB"},{"author_name":"Fabrizio Zanconati","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Berlot","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Furio Silvestri","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Serena Zacchigna","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Michele Mirabella","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Health Sciences (DISSAL), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy;

Understanding the epidemiology of viral outbreaks is the first step towards vaccine development programs. This is the first phylodynamics study attempted on of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from India to infer its current evolution in the context of an ongoing pandemic. Out of 286 retrieved SARS-CoV-2 whole genomes from India, 138 haplotypes were generated and analyzed. Median-joining network was built to investigate the relatedness of SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes in India. The BDSIR package of BEAST2 was used to calculate the reproduction number (R0) and the infectious rate of the virus. Past and current population trend was investigated using the stamp date method in coalescent Bayesian skyline plot, implemented in BEAST2 and by exponential growth prior in BEAST 1.10.4. Median-joining network reveals two distinct ancestral clusters A and B showing genetic affinities with Wuhan outbreak sample. The network also illustrates the autochthonous development of isolates in a few instances. High basic reproduction number of SARS-nCoV-2 in India points towards the phase of active community transmission. The Bayesian skyline plot revel exponential rise in the effective population size (Ne) of Indian isolates from the first week of January to the first week of April 2020. More genome sequencing and analyses of the virus will be required in coming days to monitor COVID19 after the upliftment of lock down in India.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sameera Farah","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, Laboratory of Molecular and Conservation Genetics, Govt.

The elderly also suffer from increased morbidity and mortality from seasonal influenza infection, and thus annual influenza vaccination is recommended for them. In this study, we explore a possible area-level association between influenza vaccination coverage in people aged 65 years and older and the number of deaths from COVID-19. To this end, we used COVID-19 data until June 10, 2020 together with population health data for the United States at the county level. We fit quasi-Poisson regression models using influenza vaccination coverage in the elderly population as the independent variable and the number of deaths from COVID-19 as the outcome variable. We adjusted for a wide array of potential confounding variables using both county-level generalized propensity scores for influenza vaccination rates, as well as direct adjustment. Our results suggest that influenza vaccination coverage in the elderly population is negatively associated with mortality from COVID-19. This finding is robust to using different analysis periods, different thresholds for inclusion of counties, and a variety of methodologies for confounding adjustment. In conclusion, our results suggest a potential protective effect of the influenza vaccine on COVID-19 mortality in the elderly population. The significant public health implications of this possibility point to an urgent need for studying the relationship between influenza vaccination and COVID-19 mortality at the individual level, to investigate both the epidemiology and any underlying biological mechanism.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Claudio Zanettini","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Omar","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Wikum Dinalankara","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Eddie Luidy Imada","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Colantuoni","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Parmigiani","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Luigi Marchionni","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Ilaria Secco","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Maria Concetta Volpe","author_inst":"ICGEB"},{"author_name":"Andrea Colliva","author_inst":"ICGEB"},{"author_name":"Fabrizio Zanconati","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Berlot","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Furio Silvestri","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Serena Zacchigna","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Michele Mirabella","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Health Sciences (DISSAL), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy;

Background: There have been growing concerns about the speed and rigor of the review process for COVID-related articles by journals. Methods: Using Dimensions, an online searchable platform, we identified PubMed-indexed journals that published >50 COVID-related articles (regardless of article type) between 1\/1\/2020 and 5\/16\/2020 and had available data on the date of article receipt. For the control group, we included consecutive full-length original investigations with available receipt date (regardless of topic) published in these journals starting from 3\/1\/2019 until a 1:2 ratio of COVID to non-COVID-related articles per journal was achieved. Results: The final number included 294 COVID-related full-length original investigations with available article receipt dates published in 16 journals with corresponding 588 control articles from the same journals. The median time from article receipt to online publication was 20 (11-32) days for COVID-articles vs. 119 (62-182) days for controls (P<0.001). The median time to final acceptance (available for 97% of the articles) was 13 (5-23) days for COVID vs. 102 (55-161) days for controls (P<0.001). These observations were seen across all the included journals in the analysis. Conclusions: In this analysis of full-length original investigations published in 16 medical journals, the median time from receipt to final acceptance of COVID-related articles was 8 times faster compared to non-COVID-related articles published in a similar time frame in the previous year. Online publication was 6 times faster for COVID-related articles compared to controls.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amr F Barakat","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Shokr","author_inst":"Wayne State University"},{"author_name":"Joseph Ibrahim","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh Medical Center"},{"author_name":"John Mandrola","author_inst":"Baptist Health Louisville"},{"author_name":"Islam Y Elgendy","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Meirion Rhys Evans","author_inst":"Public Health Wales"},{"author_name":"Paul Longley","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Janusz Janiec","author_inst":"Narodowy Instytut Zdrowia Publicznego"},{"author_name":"Roiyah Saltus","author_inst":"University of South Wales"},{"author_name":"Giri Shankar","author_inst":"Public Health Wales"},{"author_name":"Fabrizio Zanconati","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Berlot","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Furio Silvestri","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Serena Zacchigna","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Michele Mirabella","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Health Sciences (DISSAL), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy;

This has important implications for the risk of patient-to-staff, staff-to-staff and staff-to patient transmission among health professionals in maternity. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of previously undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection in health professionals from two tertiary-level maternity units in London, UK and to determine associations between HCW characteristics, reported symptoms and serological evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. 200 anaesthetists, midwives and obstetricians with no previously confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were tested for immune seroconversion using laboratory IgG assays. Comprehensive symptom and medical histories were also collected. 5\/40 (12.5%; 95% CI: 4.2-26.8) anaesthetists, 7\/52 (13.5%; 95% CI: 5.6-25.8%) obstetricians and 17\/108 (15.7%; 95% CI: 9.5-24.0%) midwives were seropositive, with an overall total of 29\/200 (14.5%; 95% CI: 9.9-20.1%) of maternity healthcare workers testing positive for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Of those who had seroconverted, 10\/29 (35.5%) were completely asymptomatic. Fever or cough were only present in 6\/29 (20.7%) and (10\/29 (34.5%) respectively. Anosmia was the most common symptom occurring in 15\/29 (51.7%) seropositive participants and was the only symptom that was predictive of positive seroconversion (OR 18; 95% CI 6 to 55). 58.6% of those who were seropositive had not self-isolated at any point and continued to provide patient care in the hospital setting. This study was the largest study of baseline immune seroconversion in maternity healthcare workers conducted to date and reveals that 1 in 6 were seropositive, of whom 1 in 3 were asymptomatic. This has significant implications for the risk of occupational transmission of SARS-CoV-2 for both staff and patients in maternity and regular testing of staff, including asymptomatic staff should be considered to reduce transmission risk.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sohail Bampoe","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Dominique Nuala Lucas","author_inst":"Northwick Park Hospital"},{"author_name":"Georgina Neall","author_inst":"University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Penny Sceales","author_inst":"University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Reena Aggarwal","author_inst":"University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Dimitrios Siassakos","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Peter Mark Odor","author_inst":"University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Janusz Janiec","author_inst":"Narodowy Instytut Zdrowia Publicznego"},{"author_name":"Roiyah Saltus","author_inst":"University of South Wales"},{"author_name":"Giri Shankar","author_inst":"Public Health Wales"},{"author_name":"Fabrizio Zanconati","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Berlot","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Furio Silvestri","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Serena Zacchigna","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Michele Mirabella","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Health Sciences (DISSAL), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy;

Thus, community members, business owners, and even medical personnel have resorted to alternative methods for sterilizing face coverings and N95 respirators for reuse. While significant work has shown that vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) can be used to sterilize N95 respirators, the cost and installation time for these sterilization systems limit their accessibility. To this end, we have designed and constructed a novel, cost-effective, and scalable VHP system that can be used to sterilize N95 respirators and other face coverings for clinical and community applications. N95 respirators inoculated with P22 bacteriophage showed a greater than 6-log10 reduction in viral load when sterilized in the VHP system for one 60-minute cycle. Further, N95 respirators treated with 20 cycles in this VHP system showed comparable filtration efficiency to untreated N95 respirators in a 50 to 200 nanometer particulate challenge filtration test. While a 23% average increase in water droplet roll-off time was observed for N95 respirators treated with 5 cycles in the sterilization, no breakdown in fluid resistance was detected. These data suggest that our VHP system is effective in sterilizing N95 respirators and other polypropylene masks for reuse. Relating to the present epidemic, deployment of this system reduces the risk of COVID-19 community transmission while conserving monetary resources otherwise spent on the continuous purchase of disposable N95 respirators and other face coverings. In summary, this novel, scientifically validated sterilization system can be easily built at a low cost and implemented in a wide range of settings.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nikhil Dave","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Katie Sue Pascavis","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"John M Patterson","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"David W Wallace","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Abhik Chowdhury","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Morteza Abbaszadegan","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Absar Alum","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Pierre Herckes","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Zhaobo Zhang","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Michael Kozicki","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Erica Forzani","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Sabrina Jimena Mora","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Josh Chang","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Clinton Ewell","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Tyler Smith","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Mark Naufel","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Sara Mora","author_inst":"Department of Informatics, Bioengineering, Robotics and System Engineering, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Delfino","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy"},{"author_name":"Federica Toscanini","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy"},{"author_name":"Elisa Balletto","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Health Sciences (DISSAL), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy;

With global contagion figures exceeding 4 million persons, the shortage of reagents for RNA extraction represents a bottleneck for testing globally. We present the validation results for a RT-qPCR protocol without prior RNA extraction. Because of its simplicity, this protocol is suitable for widespread application in resource-limited settings. Methods: Optimal protocol was selected by comparing RT-qPCR performance under a set of thermal (65{degrees}C, 70{degrees}C, and 95{degrees}C for 5, 10, and 30 minutes) and amplification conditions (3 or 3,5 uL loading volume; 2 commercial RT-qPCR kits with limit of detection below 10 copies\/sample) in nasopharyngeal swabs stored at 4{degrees}C in sterile Weise buffer pH 7.2. The selected protocol was evaluated for classification concordance with the standard protocol (automated RNA extraction) in 130 routine samples and in 50 historical samples with Cq values near to the clinical decision limit. Results: Optimal selected conditions were: Thermal shock at 70{degrees}C for 10 minutes, loading 3.5 ul in the RT-qPCR. Prospective evaluation in 130 routine samples showed 100% classification concordance with the standard protocol. The evaluation in historical samples, selected because their Cqs were at the clinical decision limit, showed 94% concordance with our confirmatory-gold standard which includes manual RNA extraction. Conclusions: These results validate the use of this direct RT-qPCR protocol as a safe alternative for SARS CoV-2 diagnosis in case of a shortage of reagents for RNA extraction, with minimal clinical impact.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jose P.

The most common manifestation of SARS-CoV2 infection (Coronavirus disease 2019 - COVID-19) is viral pneumonia with varying degrees of respiratory compromise and up to 40% of hospitalized patients might develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Several clinical trials evaluated the role of corticosteroids in non-COVID-19 ARDS with conflicting results. We designed a trial to evaluate the effectiveness of early intravenous dexamethasone administration on the number of days alive and free of mechanical ventilation within 28 days after randomization in adult patients with moderate or severe ARDS due to confirmed or probable COVID-19. METHODS: This is a pragmatic, prospective, randomized, stratified, multicenter, open-label, controlled trial including 350 patients with early-onset (less than 48h before randomization) moderate or severe ARDS, defined by the Berlin criteria, due to COVID-19. Eligible patients will be randomly allocated to either standard treatment plus dexamethasone (intervention group) or standard treatment without dexamethasone (control group). Patients in the intervention group will receive dexamethasone 20mg IV once daily for 5 days, followed by dexamethasone 10mg IV once daily for additional 5 days or until Intensive Care Unit (ICU) discharge, whichever occurs first. The primary outcome is ventilator-free days within 28 days after randomization, defined as days alive and free from invasive mechanical ventilation. Secondary outcomes are all-cause mortality rates at day 28, evaluation of the clinical status at day 15 assessed with a 6-level ordinal scale, mechanical ventilation duration from randomization to day 28, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score evaluation at 48h, 72h and 7 days and ICU-free days within 28. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This trial was approved by the Brazilian National Committee of Ethics in Research (Comissao Nacional de Etica em Pesquisa - CONEP) and National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA). An independent data monitoring committee will perform interim analyses and evaluate adverse events throughout the trial. Results will be submitted for publication after enrolment and follow-up are complete.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bruno Martins Tomazini","author_inst":"Hospital Sirio-Libanes"},{"author_name":"Israel S.

By comparing the growth rates in daily hospitalisations or confirmed cases under different interventions, we provide evidence that the effect of school closure is visible as a reduction in the growth rate approximately 9 days after implementation. Limited school attendance, such as older students sitting exams or the partial return of younger year groups, does not appear to significantly affect community transmission. A large-scale reopening of schools while controlling or suppressing the epidemic appears feasible in countries such as Denmark or Norway, where community transmission is generally low. However, school reopening can contribute to significant increases in the growth rate in countries like Germany, where community transmission is relatively high. Our findings underscore the need for a cautious evaluation of reopening strategies that ensure low classroom occupancy and a solid infrastructure to quickly identify and isolate new infections.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Helena B Stage","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Joseph Shingleton","author_inst":"Emergency Response Department, Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Sanmitra Ghosh","author_inst":"MRC Biostatistics Unit, University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Francesca Scarabel","author_inst":"Laboratory of Industrial and Applied Mathematics, Department of Mathematics and Statistics, York University"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Pellis","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Thomas Finnie","author_inst":"Emergency Response Department, Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Ricardo A.

Even though it is arguably not an established diagnostic tool, using machine learning-based analysis of COVID-19 medical scans has shown the potential to provide a preliminary digital second opinion. This can help in managing the current pandemic, and thus has been attracting significant research attention. In this research, we propose a multi-task pipeline that takes advantage of the growing advances in deep neural network models. In the first stage, we fine-tuned an Inception-v3 deep model for COVID-19 recognition using multi-modal learning, i.e., using X-ray and CT scans. In addition to outperforming other deep models on the same task in the recent literature, with an attained accuracy of 99.4%, we also present comparative analysis for multi-modal learning against learning from X-ray scans alone. The second and the third stages of the proposed pipeline complement one another in dealing with different types of infection manifestations. The former features a convolutional neural network architecture for recognizing three types of manifestations, while the latter transfers learning from another knowledge domain, namely, pulmonary nodule segmentation in CT scans, to produce binary masks for segmenting the regions corresponding to these manifestations. Our proposed pipeline also features specialized streams in which multiple deep models are trained separately to segment specific types of infection manifestations, and we show the significant impact that this framework has on various performance metrics. We evaluate the proposed models on widely adopted datasets, and we demonstrate an increase of approximately 4% and 7% for dice coefficient and mean intersection-over-union (mIoU), respectively, while achieving 60% reduction in computational time, compared to the recent literature.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shimaa El-bana","author_inst":"Alexandria Higher Institute of Engineering and Technology"},{"author_name":"Ahmad Al-Kabbany","author_inst":"Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Arab Academy for Science, Technology, and Maritime Transport, Alexandria, Egypt"},{"author_name":"Maha Sharkas","author_inst":"Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Arab Academy for Science, Technology, and Maritime Transport, Alexandria, Egypt"},{"author_name":"Francesca Scarabel","author_inst":"Laboratory of Industrial and Applied Mathematics, Department of Mathematics and Statistics, York University"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Pellis","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Thomas Finnie","author_inst":"Emergency Response Department, Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Ricardo A.
