Indeed, the clinical heterogeneity of COVID-19 ranges from relatively asymptomatic to severe disease with death resultant from multiple constellations of organ failures. In addition to genetics and host characteristics, it is likely that viral dissemination is a key determinant of disease manifestation. Given the complexity of disease expression, one major limitation in current animal models is the ability to capture this clinical heterogeneity due to technical limitations related to murinizing SARS-CoV2 or humanizing mice to render susceptible to infection. Here we describe a murine model of COVID-19 using respiratory infection with the native mouse betacoronavirus MHV-A59. We find that whereas high viral inoculums uniformly led to hypoxemic respiratory failure and death, lethal dose 50% (LD50) inoculums led to a recapitulation of most hallmark clinical features of COVID-19, including lymphocytopenias, heart and liver damage, and autonomic dysfunction. We find that extrapulmonary manifestations are due to viral metastasis and identify a critical role for type-I but not type-III interferons in preventing systemic viral dissemination. Early, but not late treatment with intrapulmonary type-I interferon, as well as convalescent serum, provided significant protection from lethality by limiting viral dissemination. We thus establish a Biosafety Level II model that may be a useful addition to the current pre-clinical animal models of COVID-19 for understanding disease pathogenesis and facilitating therapeutic development for human translation.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hua Qing","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lokesh Sharma","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Brandon K Hilliard","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xiaohua Peng","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Anush Swaminathan","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Justin Tian","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kavita Israni-Winger","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Cuiling Zhang","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Delva Leao","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Seungjin Ryu","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Victoria Habet","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lin Wang","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xuefei Tian","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shuta Ishibe","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lawrence H.

Unregulated cytokine storm together with impaired immunometabolic response leads to highest mortality in elderly infected with SARS-CoV-2. To investigate how aging compromises defense against COVID-19, we developed a model of natural murine beta coronavirus (mCoV) infection with mouse hepatitis virus strain MHV-A59 (mCoV-A59) that recapitulated majority of clinical hallmarks of COVID-19. Aged mCoV-A59-infected mice have increased mortality and higher systemic inflammation in the heart, adipose tissue and hypothalamus, including neutrophilia and loss of {gamma}{delta} T cells in lungs. Ketogenic diet increases beta-hydroxybutyrate, expands tissue protective {gamma}{delta} T cells, deactivates the inflammasome and decreases pathogenic monocytes in lungs of infected aged mice. These data underscore the value of mCoV-A59 model to test mechanism and establishes harnessing of the ketogenic immunometabolic checkpoint as a potential treatment against COVID-19 in the elderly.\n\nHighlights - Natural MHV-A59 mouse coronavirus infection mimics COVID-19 in elderly.\n- Aged infected mice have systemic inflammation and inflammasome activation\n- Murine beta coronavirus (mCoV) infection results in loss of pulmonary {gamma}{delta} T cells.\n- Ketones protect aged mice from infection by reducing inflammation.\n\n\neTOC BlurbElderly have the greatest risk of death from COVID-19.

While worldwide efforts are being advanced towards vaccine development, the structural modeling of TCR-pMHC (T Cell Receptor-peptide-bound Major Histocompatibility Complex) regarding SARS-CoV-2 epitopes and the design of effective T cell vaccine based on these antigens are still unresolved. Here, we present both pMHC and TCR-pMHC interfaces to infer peptide epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Accordingly, significant TCR-pMHC templates (Z-value cutoff > 4) along with interatomic interactions within the SARS-CoV-2-derived hit peptides were clarified. Also, we applied the structural analysis of the hit peptides from different coronaviruses to highlight a feature of evolution in SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, bat-CoV, and MERS-CoV. Peptide-protein flexible docking between each of the hit peptides and their corresponding MHC molecules were performed, and a multi-hit peptides vaccine against the S and N glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was designed. Filtering pipelines including antigenicity, and also physiochemical properties of designed vaccine were then evaluated by different immunoinformatics tools. Finally, vaccine-structure modeling and immune simulation of the desired vaccine were performed aiming to create robust T cell immune responses. We anticipate that our design based on the T cell antigen epitopes and the frame of the immunoinformatics analysis could serve as valuable supports for the development of COVID-19 vaccine.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amir Hossein Mohseni","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Sedigheh Taghinezhad-S","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Bing Su","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Feng Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Brandon K Hilliard","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tamara Dlugos","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xinbo Zhang","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yuki Yasumoto","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Carmen J.

Here, we examined the immune milieu in the CNS through the analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in circulation through analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of COVID-19 patients with neurological symptoms. Single cell sequencing with paired repertoire sequencing of PBMCs and CSF cells show evidence for unique immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS. Strikingly, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are present in the CSF of all patients studied, but the antibody epitope specificity in the CSF and relative prevalence of B cell receptor sequences markedly differed when compared to those found in paired serum. Finally, using a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we demonstrate that localized CNS immune responses occur following viral neuroinvasion, and that the CSF is a faithful surrogate for responses occurring uniquely in the CNS. These results illuminate CNS compartment-specific immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, forming the basis for informed treatment of neurological symptoms associated with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eric Song","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ryan D Chow","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Roy Jiang","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Colin R Zamecnik","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Rita Loudermilk","author_inst":"University of California, San Francicsco"},{"author_name":"Yile Dai","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Feimei Liu","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bertie Geng","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Chiarella","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Israelow","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Arnau Casanovas-Massana","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Albert Ko","author_inst":"Yale University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Aaron Ring","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Steven Kleinstein","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Serena Spudich","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael Wilson","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Akiko Iwasaki","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shelli F Farhadian","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Aaron M Ring","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Vishwa Deep Dixit","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Craig B Wilen","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Joao P Pereira","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Charles S.

The efficacy of several repurposed drugs has been evaluated in clinical trials. Among these drugs, a relatively new antiandrogen agent, enzalutamide, was proposed because it reduces the expression of transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), a key component mediating SARS-CoV-2-driven entry into host cells, in prostate cancer cells. However, definitive evidence for the therapeutic efficacy of enzalutamide in COVID-19 is lacking. Here, we evaluated the antiviral efficacy of enzalutamide in prostate cancer cells, lung cancer cells, human lung organoids and SARS-CoV-2-infected Ad-ACE2-transduced Tmprss2 knockout (Tmprss2-KO) and wild-type (WT) mice. TMPRSS2 knockout significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. Enzalutamide effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in human prostate cancer cells (LNCaP) but not in human lung cancer cells or patient-derived lung organoids. Although Tmprss2 knockout effectively blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection in ACE2-transduced mice, enzalutamide showed no antiviral activity due to the AR independence of TMPRSS2 expression in mouse and human lung epithelial cells. Moreover, we observed distinct AR binding patterns between prostate cells and lung cells and a lack of direct binding of AR to TMPRSS2 in human lung cells. Thus, our findings do not support the postulated protective role of enzalutamide in treating COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dong Gao","author_inst":"CAS Center for

The replicon was devoid of structural genes spike (S), membrane (M), and envelope (E). Upon transfection, the replicon RNA replicated in various cell lines, and was sensitive to interferon alpha (IFN-), remdesivir, but was resistant to hepatitis C virus inhibitors daclatasvir and sofosbuvir. Replication of the replicon was also sensitive overexpression of zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP). We also constructed a four-plasmid in-vitro ligation system that is compatible with the BAC system, which makes it easy to introduce desired mutations into the assembly plasmids for in-vitro ligation.

Several studies showed that the glycosylation of virus spike (S) protein and the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the host cell is critical for the virus infectivity. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations were used to explore the role of a novel mutated O-glycosylation site (D494S) on the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of S protein. This site was suggested as a key mediator of virus-host interaction. We showed that the decoration of S494 with core and elongated O-glycans results in stabilized interactions on the direct RBD-ACE2 interface with more favorable binding free energies for longer oligosaccharides. Hence, the further drug design attempts should take this crucial factor into account, while suggesting any novel therapeutic candidate.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shadi Rahnama","author_inst":"Sharif University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Maryam Azimzadeh Irani","author_inst":"Faculty of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shahid Beheshti University"},{"author_name":"Mehriar Amininasab","author_inst":"Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, School of Biology, College of Science, University of Tehran"},{"author_name":"Reza Ejtehadi","author_inst":"Department of Physics, Sharif University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhigang Yi","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Juan He","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Xiaoting Tao","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Yang Wu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences and Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan "},{"author_name":"Xinyuan Tong","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Xinyi Xia","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Wangxin Guo","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Yunguang Li","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Yinqin Zhu","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyu Zhang","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Zhuang Liu","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Rebiguli Aji","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Xia Cai","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences and Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan "},{"author_name":"Yutang Li","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences and Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan "},{"author_name":"Di Qu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences and Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan "},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Shibo Jiang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Qiao Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Hongbin Ji","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and"},{"author_name":"Yihua Sun","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Lu Lu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yunjiao Zhou","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"biophysics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.09.20191320","rel_title":"How to Make COVID-19 Contact Tracing Apps work: Insights From Behavioral Economics","rel_date":"2020-09-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.09.20191320","rel_abs":"Due to network effects, Contact Tracing Apps (CTAs) are only effective if many people download them. However, the response to CTAs has been tepid. For example, in France less than 2 million people (roughly 3% of the population) downloaded the CTA. Against this background, we carry out an online experiment to show that CTAs can still play a key role in containing the spread of COVID-19, provided that they are re-conceptualized to account for insights from behavioral science. We start by showing that carefully devised in-app notifications are effective in inducing prudent behavior like wearing a mask or staying home. In particular, people that are notified that they are taking too much risk and could become a superspreader engage in more prudent behavior. Building on this result, we suggest that CTAs should be re-framed as Behavioral Feedback Apps (BFAs). The main function of BFAs would be providing users with information on how to minimize the risk of contracting COVID-19, like how crowded a store is likely to be. Moreover, the BFA could have a rating system that allows users to flag stores that do not respect safety norms like wearing masks. These functions can inform the behavior of app users, thus playing a key role in containing the spread of the virus even if a small percentage of people download the BFA. While effective contact tracing is impossible when only 3% of the population downloads the app, less risk taking by small portions of the population can produce large benefits. BFAs can be programmed so that users can also activate a tracing function akin to the one currently carried out by CTAs. Making contact tracing an ancillary, opt-in function might facilitate a wider acceptance of BFAs.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ian Ayres","author_inst":"Yale Law School"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Romano","author_inst":"Bocconi Law School\/ Yale Law School"},{"author_name":"Chiara Sotis","author_inst":"London School of Economics and Political Science and Political Science"},{"author_name":"Reza Ejtehadi","author_inst":"Department of Physics, Sharif University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhigang Yi","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Juan He","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Xiaoting Tao","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Yang Wu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences and Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan "},{"author_name":"Xinyuan Tong","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Xinyi Xia","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Wangxin Guo","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Yunguang Li","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Yinqin Zhu","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyu Zhang","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Zhuang Liu","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Rebiguli Aji","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Xia Cai","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences and Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan "},{"author_name":"Yutang Li","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences and Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan "},{"author_name":"Di Qu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences and Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan "},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Shibo Jiang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Qiao Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Hongbin Ji","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and"},{"author_name":"Yihua Sun","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Lu Lu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yunjiao Zhou","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health economics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.10.20191890","rel_title":"Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) health awareness among the United Arab Emirates Population","rel_date":"2020-09-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.10.20191890","rel_abs":"ABSTRACT Background: In response to the global (COVID-19) epidemic, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) government is taking precautionary action to mitigate the spread of the virus and protect the safety and well-being of citizens, residents, and visitors. The knowledge and practices of individuals will probably have an important bearing on the course of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. The aim of this study was to evaluate the knowledge and practices toward COVID-19 among the general public in the UAE during the current outbreak COVID-19. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey of 1356 of respondents in the UAE we conducted during the epidemic outbreak between 9th to 24th June-2020. The questionnaire consisted of three sections: Socio-demographic, participants knowledge, and participants practices. Independent- samples t-test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), chi-square, and binary logistic regression have used. A p-value of (p < 0.05) was considered statistically significant. Results: Of the total sample, 72% were females, 47% % were aged between 30-49 years, 57.2% were from Sharjah, 65.6% had a college degree, and 40.6% were unemployed. The total correct score of knowledge and practices questions was high 85% and 90%, respectively. Males gender, other marital status, and illiterate\/primary educational levels had a lower level of knowledge and practices than others. participants aged 18-29 had little higher knowledge than other ages but had a lower level in practices, people who live in Abu Dhabi had better knowledge and practice than other emirates, employed people had a lower level of knowledge but higher in practice. Binary logistic regression analysis presented that females, 18-29 years, and married participants significantly associated with a higher score of knowledge, while female gender, over 30 years old, the martial status of singles, college-level and higher, unemployed, were significantly associated with high mean practice score. Conclusions: To our knowledge, the current study is one of the first studies to evaluate the knowledge and practices of UAE population toward COVID-19. Most of the respondents demonstrate an excellent level of knowledge and awareness as well as proper conscious practices. Continuing to implement the health education programs pursued by the UAE is highly important to maintain the appropriate level of awareness among the public.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Balsam Qubais","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Iffat Elbarazi","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Mai Barakat","author_inst":"Mansoura University"},{"author_name":"Reza Ejtehadi","author_inst":"Department of Physics, Sharif University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhigang Yi","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Juan He","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Xiaoting Tao","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Yang Wu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences and Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan "},{"author_name":"Xinyuan Tong","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Xinyi Xia","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Wangxin Guo","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Yunguang Li","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Yinqin Zhu","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyu Zhang","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Zhuang Liu","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Rebiguli Aji","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Xia Cai","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences and Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan "},{"author_name":"Yutang Li","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences and Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan "},{"author_name":"Di Qu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences and Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan "},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Shibo Jiang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Qiao Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Hongbin Ji","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and"},{"author_name":"Yihua Sun","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Lu Lu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yunjiao Zhou","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.10.20192195","rel_title":"Mathematical Modeling and a Month Ahead Forecast of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic: An Indian Scenario","rel_date":"2020-09-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.10.20192195","rel_abs":"India, the second-most populous country in the world, has been lately witnessing a daily surge in the COVID-19 infected cases. India is currently among the worst-hit nations worldwide, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and ranks just behind Brazil and USA. In order to prevent the further worsening of the situation, predicting the future course of the pandemic is of utmost importance. In this paper, we model the past trajectory (March 01, 2020 - July 25, 2020) and make a month-long (July 26, 2020 - August 24, 2020) forecast of the future evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in India using an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. According to our forecasting results, India is likely to have 3,800,989 cumulative infected cases, 1,634,142 cumulative active cases, 2,110,697 cumulative recoveries and 56,150 cumulative deaths by August 24, 2020, if the current trend of the pandemic continues to prevail. The implications of these forecasts are that in the upcoming month the infection rate of COVID-19 in India is going to escalate, while as the rate of recovery and the case-fatality rate is likely to reduce. In order to avert these possible scenarios, the administration and health-care personnel need to formulate and implement robust control measures, while the general public needs to be more responsible and strictly adhere to the established and newly formulated guidelines to slow down the spread of the pandemic and prevent it from transforming into a catastrophe.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Suhail Ganiny","author_inst":"National Institute of Technology, Srinagar"},{"author_name":"Owais

It is accepted that aerosols are produced during a range of dental procedures, posing potential risks to both dental practitioners and patients. There has been little agreement concerning aerosol transmission associated with orthodontics and associated mitigation. Methods: Orthodontic procedures were simulated in a closed side-surgery using a dental manikin on an acrylic model using composite-based adhesive. Adhesive removal representing debonding was undertaken using a 1:1 contra-angle handpiece and fast hand-piece with variation in air and water flow. The removal of acid etch was also simulated with use of combined 3-in-1 air water syringe to remove etch. An optical particle scanner and a spectrometer particle scanner were both to assess particulate matter ranging from 'very small' (0.08 - 0.26 um) to large (2.7 - 10 um). Results: Standard debonding procedure (involving air but no water) was associated with clear increase in the very small and small (0.26 - 0.9 um) particles, but only for a short period with no significant increases for other sizes. Debonding procedures without air appeared to produce similar levels of aerosol to standard debonding. Debonding in association with water tended to produce large increase in aerosol levels, producing particles of all sizes throughout the experiment. The use of water and a fast hand-piece led to the most significant increase in particles. Combined use of the 3-in-1 air water syringe did not result in any detectable increase in the aerosol levels. Conclusions: Particulate matter was released during orthodontic debonding, although the concentration and volume was markedly less than that associated with the use of a fast hand-piece. No increase in particulates was associated with prolonged use of a 3-in-1 air-water syringe. Particulate levels reduced to baseline levels over a short period (approx. 5 minutes). Further research within alternative, open environments and without air exchange systems is required.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ahmed R Din","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Annika Hindocha","author_inst":"Barts Health NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Tulsi Patel","author_inst":"Barts Health NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Sanjana Sudarshan","author_inst":"Barts NHS Health Trust"},{"author_name":"Neil Cagney","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Amine Koched","author_inst":"TSI France Inc."},{"author_name":"Jens-Dominik Mueller","author_inst":"QueenMary University of London"},{"author_name":"Noha Seoudi","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Claire Morgan","author_inst":"Barts NHS Health Trust"},{"author_name":"Shakeel Shahdad","author_inst":"Barts NHS Health Trust"},{"author_name":"Padhraig S Fleming","author_inst":"Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Yunguang Li","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Yinqin Zhu","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyu Zhang","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Zhuang Liu","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Rebiguli Aji","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Xia Cai","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences and Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan "},{"author_name":"Yutang Li","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences and Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan "},{"author_name":"Di Qu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences and Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan "},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Shibo Jiang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Qiao Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Hongbin Ji","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and"},{"author_name":"Yihua Sun","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Lu Lu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yunjiao Zhou","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"dentistry and oral medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.09.20191494","rel_title":"Analysis of twenty-week time-series of confirmed cases of New Coronavirus COVID-19 and their simple short-term prediction for Georgia and Neighboring Countries (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey, Russia) in amid of a global pandemic","rel_date":"2020-09-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.09.20191494","rel_abs":"Results of a comparative statistical analysis of the daily data associated with New coronavirus COVID-19 infection of confirmed cases ([C]) of the population in Georgia (GEO), Armenia (ARM), Azerbaijan (AZE), Turkey (TUR) and Russia (RUS) amid a global pandemic (WLD) in the period from March 14 to July 31, 2020 are presented. The analysis of data is carried out with the use of the standard statistical analysis methods of random events and methods of mathematical statistics for the non-accidental time-series of observations. In particular, a correlation and autocorrelation analysis of the observational data was carried out, the periodicity in the time- series of [C] were revealed, the calculation of the interval prediction values of [C] taking into account the periodicity in the time-series of observations from August 1 to 31, 2020 (ARM, AZE) and from August 1 to September 11, 2020 (WLD, GEO, TUR, RUS) were carried out. Comparison of real and calculated predictions data on [C] in the study sites from August 1 to August 31, 2020 is carried out. It was found that daily, monthly and mean weekly real values of [C] for all the studied locations practically fall into the 99% confidence interval of the predicted values of [C] for the specified time period. A dangerous situation with the spread of coronavirus infection may arise when the mean weekly values of [C] of the 99% upper level of the forecast confidence interval are exceeded within 1-2 weeks. Favorable - when the mean weekly values of [C] decrease below 99% of the lower level of the forecast confidence interval.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Avtandil G.

We correlate the COVID-19 prevalence and death rate with data from the US Census Bureau and point out how the spreading patterns of the disease show asymmetries in urban and rural areas separately and is preferentially affecting the counties where a large fraction of the population is non-white.

In this study, we conducted a global systematic literature review to summarize trends in the modelling techniques used for Covid-19 from January 1st 2020 to June 30th 2020. We further examined the reliability and correctness of predictions by comparing predicted and observed values for cumulative cases and deaths. From an initial 2170 peer-reviewed articles and preprints found with our defined keywords, 148 were fully analyzed. We found that most studies on the modelling of Covid-19 were from Asia (52.70%) and Europe (25%). Most of them used compartmental models (SIR and SEIR) (57%) and statistical models (growth models and time series) (28%) while few used artificial intelligence (5%) and Bayesian approach (3%). For cumulative cases, the ratio predicted\/observed values and the ratio of the amplitude of confidence interval (CI) or credibility interval (CrI) of predictions and the central value were on average larger than 1 (4.49-9.98 and 1.10-1.94, respectively) indicating cases of incorrect predictions, large uncertainty on predictions, and large variation across studies. There was no clear difference among models used for these two ratios. However, the ratio predicted\/observed values was relatively smaller for SIR models than for SEIR models, indicating that more complex models might not be more accurate for predictions. We further found that values of both ratios decreased with the number of days covered by studies, indicating that the wider the time covered by the data, the higher the correctness and accuracy of predictions. In 21.62% of studies, observed values fall within the CI or CrI of the cumulative cases predicted by studies. Only six of the 148 selected studies (4.05%) predicted the number of deaths. For 33.3% of these predictions, the ratio of predicted to actual number of deaths was close to 1. We also found that the Bayesian model made predictions closer to reality than the compartmental and the statistical models, although these differences are only suggestive due to the small size of the data. Our findings suggest that while predictions made by the different models are useful to understand the pandemic course and guide policy-making, there should be cautious in their usage.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Janyce E.

To this end we developed a deterministic transmission model based on the renewal equation and fitted the model to daily case and death data in the first few months of 2020 in 79 countries and states, representing 4.2 billions individuals. Based on a region-specific infection fatality ratio, we inferred the time-varying probability of case detection and the time-varying decline in transmissiblity. As a validation, the predicted total number of infected was close to that found in serosurveys; more importantly, the inferred probability of detection strongly correlated with the number of daily tests per inhabitant, with 50% detection achieved with 0.003 daily tests per inhabitants. Most of the decline in transmission was explained by the reductions in transmissibility (social distancing), which avoided 10 millions deaths in the regions studied over the first four months of 2020. In contrast, symptom-based testing and isolation of positive cases was not an efficient way to control the spread of the disease, as a large part of transmission happens before symptoms and only a small fraction of infected individuals was typically detected. The latter is explained by the limited number of tests available, and the fact that increasing test capacity increases the probability of detection less than proportionally. Together these results suggest that little control can be achieved by symptom-based testing and isolation alone.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Antoine Belloir","author_inst":"Ecole Polytechnique"},{"author_name":"Francois Blanquart","author_inst":"CNRS"},{"author_name":"Huynh Kim Mai","author_inst":"IP, Nha Trang, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Bao Trieu","author_inst":"IP, Nha Trang, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Le Xuan Huy","author_inst":"IP, Nha Trang, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Ho Thi Thanh Thuy","author_inst":"Viet A, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Le Thanh Chung","author_inst":"Da Nang CDC, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Ngoc Anh","author_inst":"Da Nang CDC, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thi Thu Hong","author_inst":"OUCRU, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Bui Duc Thang","author_inst":"Da Nang CDC, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thi Hoai Thu","author_inst":"Da Nang CDC, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Le Thi Kim Chi","author_inst":"Da Nang CDC, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thi Hanh","author_inst":"Da Nang University of Medical Technology and Pharmacy, Da Nang city, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Huy Hoang","author_inst":"Da Nang University of Medical Technology and Pharmacy, Da Nang city, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Chau Nguyen","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases"},{"author_name":"Guy Thwaites","author_inst":"OUCRU, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Do Thai Hung","author_inst":"IP, Nha Trang, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Le Van Tan","author_inst":"OUCRU-VN"},{"author_name":"Ngo Thi Kim Yen","author_inst":"DoH, Da Nang, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Shibo Jiang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Qiao Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Hongbin Ji","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and"},{"author_name":"Yihua Sun","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Lu Lu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yunjiao Zhou","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.10.20191841","rel_title":"The King's College London Coronavirus Health and Experiences of Colleagues at King's Study: SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in an occupational sample","rel_date":"2020-09-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.10.20191841","rel_abs":"We report test results for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in an occupational group of postgraduate research students and current members of staff at King's College London.

However, no prior studies have examined temporal trends and differential effects of social vulnerability on COVID-19 incidence and death rates. The purpose of this study was to examine temporal trends among counties with high and low social vulnerability and to quantify disparities in these trends over time. We hypothesized that highly vulnerable counties would have higher incidence and death rates compared to less vulnerable counties and that this disparity would widen as the pandemic progressed. Methods: We conducted a retrospective longitudinal analysis examining COVID-19 incidence and death rates from March 1 to August 31, 2020 for each county in the US. We obtained daily COVID-19 incident case and death data from USAFacts and the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering. We classified counties using the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), a percentile-based measure from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in which higher scores represent more vulnerability. Using a Bayesian hierarchical negative binomial model, we estimated daily risk ratios (RRs) comparing counties in the first (lower) and fourth (upper) SVI quartiles. We adjusted for percentage of the county designated as rural, percentage in poor or fair health, percentage of adult smokers, county average daily fine particulate matter (PM2.5), percentage of primary care physicians per 100,000 residents, and the proportion tested for COVID-19 in the state. Results: In unadjusted analyses, we found that for most of March 2020, counties in the upper SVI quartile had significantly fewer cases per 100,000 than lower SVI quartile counties. However, on March 30, we observed a crossover effect in which the RR became significantly greater than 1.00 (RR = 1.10, 95% PI: 1.03, 1.18), indicating that the most vulnerable counties had, on average, higher COVID-19 incidence rates compared to least vulnerable counties. Upper SVI quartile counties had higher death rates on average starting on March 30 (RR = 1.17, 95% PI: 1.01,1.36). The death rate RR achieved a maximum value on July 29 (RR = 3.22, 95% PI: 2.91, 3.58), indicating that most vulnerable counties had, on average, 3.22 times more deaths per million than the least vulnerable counties. However, by late August, the lower quartile started to catch up to the upper quartile. In adjusted models, the RRs were attenuated for both incidence cases and deaths, indicating that the adjustment variables partially explained the associations. We also found positive associations between COVID-19 cases and deaths and percentage of the county designated as rural, percentage of resident in fair or poor health, and average daily PM2.5. Conclusions: Results indicate that the impact of COVID-19 is not static but can migrate from less vulnerable counties to more vulnerable counties over time. This highlights the importance of protecting vulnerable populations as the pandemic unfolds.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brian Neelon","author_inst":"Medical University of South Carolina"},{"author_name":"Fedelis Mutiso","author_inst":"Medical University of South Carolina"},{"author_name":"Noel T Mueller","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"John L Pearce","author_inst":"Medical University of South Carolina"},{"author_name":"Sara E Benjamin-Neelon","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Sharon Stevelink","author_inst":"Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hotopf","author_inst":"Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"},{"author_name":"Reza Razavi","author_inst":"The School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London"},{"author_name":"- On behalf of the KCL CHECK research team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Bui Duc Thang","author_inst":"Da Nang CDC, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thi Hoai Thu","author_inst":"Da Nang CDC, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Le Thi Kim Chi","author_inst":"Da Nang CDC, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thi Hanh","author_inst":"Da Nang University of Medical Technology and Pharmacy, Da Nang city, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Huy Hoang","author_inst":"Da Nang University of Medical Technology and Pharmacy, Da Nang city, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Chau Nguyen","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases"},{"author_name":"Guy Thwaites","author_inst":"OUCRU, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Do Thai Hung","author_inst":"IP, Nha Trang, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Le Van Tan","author_inst":"OUCRU-VN"},{"author_name":"Ngo Thi Kim Yen","author_inst":"DoH, Da Nang, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Shibo Jiang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Qiao Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Hongbin Ji","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and"},{"author_name":"Yihua Sun","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Lu Lu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yunjiao Zhou","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.08.20190769","rel_title":"Estimating the Risk of Outbreaks of COVID-19 Associated with Shore Leave by Merchant Ship Crews: Simulation Studies for a Case Country","rel_date":"2020-09-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.08.20190769","rel_abs":"Aim: We aimed to estimate the risk of COVID-19 outbreaks in a case study COVID-free destination country, associated with shore leave for merchant ship crews. Methods: A stochastic version of the SEIR model CovidSIM v1.1, designed specifically for COVID-19 was utilised. It was populated with parameters for SARS-CoV-2 transmission, shipping characteristics, and plausible control measures. Results: When no control interventions were in place, an outbreak of COVID-19 in our case study destination country (New Zealand; NZ) was estimated to occur after a median time of 23 days (assuming a global average for source country incidence of 2.66 new infections per 1000 population per week, a crew of 20, a voyage length of 10 days, 1 day of shore leave both in NZ and abroad, and 108 port visits by international merchant ships per week). For this example the uncertainty around when outbreaks occur is wide (an outbreak occurs with 95% probability between 1 and 124 days). The combined use of a PCR test on arrival, self-reporting of symptoms with contact tracing, and mask use during shore leave, increased this median time to 1.0 year (14 days to 5.4 years). Scenario analyses found that onboard infection chains could persist for well over 4 weeks even with crews of only 5 members. Conclusion: Introduction of SARS-CoV-2 through shore leave from international shipping crews is likely, even after long voyages. The risk can be substantially mitigated by control measures such as PCR testing and mask use.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nick Wilson","author_inst":"University of Otago, Wellington"},{"author_name":"Tony Blakely","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Michael Baker","author_inst":"University of Otago, Wellington"},{"author_name":"Martin Eichner","author_inst":"Epimos"},{"author_name":"Sara E Benjamin-Neelon","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Sharon Stevelink","author_inst":"Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hotopf","author_inst":"Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"},{"author_name":"Reza Razavi","author_inst":"The School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London"},{"author_name":"- On behalf of the KCL CHECK research team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Bui Duc Thang","author_inst":"Da Nang CDC, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thi Hoai Thu","author_inst":"Da Nang CDC, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Le Thi Kim Chi","author_inst":"Da Nang CDC, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thi Hanh","author_inst":"Da Nang University of Medical Technology and Pharmacy, Da Nang city, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Huy Hoang","author_inst":"Da Nang University of Medical Technology and Pharmacy, Da Nang city, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Chau Nguyen","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases"},{"author_name":"Guy Thwaites","author_inst":"OUCRU, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Do Thai Hung","author_inst":"IP, Nha Trang, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Le Van Tan","author_inst":"OUCRU-VN"},{"author_name":"Ngo Thi Kim Yen","author_inst":"DoH, Da Nang, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Shibo Jiang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Qiao Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Hongbin Ji","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and"},{"author_name":"Yihua Sun","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Lu Lu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yunjiao Zhou","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.10.20179135","rel_title":"The influence of pH on SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity","rel_date":"2020-09-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.10.20179135","rel_abs":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can infect a broad range of human tissues by using the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).

Here we showed that patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE) have a higher expression of ACE2 in BE tissues compared to normal squamous esophagus, and that the lower pH associated with BE may drive this increase in expression. Human primary monocytes cultured in reduced pH displayed increased ACE2 expression and viral load upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We have designed a COVID-19 dashboard with the goal of providing concise sets of summarized data presentations to simplify interpretation of basic statistics and location-specific current and short-term future risks of infection. Methods We perform continuous collection and analyses of publicly available data accessible through the COVID-19 dashboard hosted at Johns Hopkins University (JHU github). Additionally, we utilize the accumulation of cases and deaths to provide dynamic 7-day short-term predictions on these outcomes across these national, state and county administrative levels. Findings COVID-19Predict produces 2,100 daily predictions [or calculations] on the state level (50 States x3 models x7 days x2 cases and deaths) and 131,964 (3,142 Counties x3 models x7 days x2 cases and deaths) on the county level. To assess how robust our models have performed in making short-term predictions over the course of the pandemic, we used available case data for all 50 U.S. states spanning the period January 20 - August 16 2020 in a retrospective analysis. Results showed a 3.7% to -0.2% mean error of deviation from the actual case predictions to date. Interpretation Our transparent methods and admin-level visualizations provide real-time data reporting and forecasts related to on-going COVID-19 transmission allowing viewers (individuals, health care providers, public health practitioners and policy makers) to develop their own perspectives and expectations regarding public life activity decisions.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jurgen Bosch","author_inst":"Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"Austin Wilson","author_inst":"Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"Karthik O'Neil","author_inst":"Andrews Osborne Academy"},{"author_name":"Pater A Zimmerman","author_inst":"Case Western Reserve University"},{"author_name":"Lucas KK Ferreira","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Gustavo G Davanzo","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Lauar B Monteiro","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Joao V Virgilio-da-Silva","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Mayla GS Borba","author_inst":"Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Dr Heitor Vieira Dourado"},{"author_name":"Gabriela F Souza","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Nathalia Zini","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Sao Jose do Rio Preto"},{"author_name":"Flora A Gandolfi","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Sao Jose do Rio Preto"},{"author_name":"Stefanie P Murano","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Jose L Proenca-Modena","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Fernando A Val","author_inst":"Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Dr Heitor Vieira Dourado"},{"author_name":"Gisely C Melo","author_inst":"Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Dr Heitor Vieira Dourado"},{"author_name":"Wuelton M Monteiro","author_inst":"Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Dr Heitor Vieira Dourado"},{"author_name":"Mauricio L Nogueira","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Sao Jose do Rio Preto"},{"author_name":"Marcus VG Lacerda","author_inst":"Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Dr Heitor Vieira Dourado"},{"author_name":"Pedro M Moraes-Vieira","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Helder I Nakaya","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Qiao Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Hongbin Ji","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and"},{"author_name":"Yihua Sun","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Lu Lu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yunjiao Zhou","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.10.20190793","rel_title":"The impact of asthma on mental health & wellbeing during COVID-19 lockdown","rel_date":"2020-09-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.10.20190793","rel_abs":"Abstract Introduction The global SARS CoV2 pandemic resulted in social isolation measures with unintended negative impacts, particularly on mental health. We hypothesised that people with asthma are likely to be more vulnerable to worse mental health during lockdown. Methods We examined COVID-19 surveys (completed April\/May 2020), nested within two generations of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC): index-generation ALSPAC-G1 (n= 2942, mean age=28) and the parents generation ALSPAC-G0 (n=3737, mean age=59). We used Poisson and logistic regression models to estimate the effect of asthma on wellbeing, anxiety and depression, and factors related to COVID-19 and lockdown. Models were adjusted for validated pre-pandemic measures of mental health and socio-economic factors. Results Asthma was associated with a 13% increase in depression score in ALSPAC-G1 (p=0.005) and 15% increase in ALSPAC-G0 (p=0.05) compared to participants without asthma, anxiety scores increased by 14% in ALSPAC-G1 (p=0.005) and by 16% in ALSPAC-G0 (p=0.02). Asthma was associated with a similar increase of anxiety and depression scores during COVID-19 in both generations (Z test p values >0.80). Discussion People with asthma have worse mental health & wellbeing during lockdown compared to people without asthma. Although the effect of asthma on mental health is of similar magnitude between the generations, younger participants with asthma declined to lower levels of mental health despite reporting less symptoms, COVID-19 infection and self-isolation. This has important implications given repeated lockdowns. Young people with asthma should be closely monitored and supported to mitigate the impact of lockdown on their mental health.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel H Higbee","author_inst":"University of Bristol.

Using a within-subjects design with objective measurement (via validated accelerometers), we assessed rheumatoid arthritis patients' physical activity and sedentary behavior levels prior to and during the social distancing measures implemented in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Methods: Post-menopausal women diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis were assessed before (from March 2018 to March 2020) and during (from 24th May to 7th July 2020) social distancing measures to contain COVID-19 pandemic, using a within-subjects, repeated-measure design. Physical activity and sedentary behavior were assessed using postural-based accelerometry (ActivPAL micro). Findings: Mean age was 60.9 years (95%CI: 58.0, 63.7) and BMI was 29.5 Kg\/m2 (95%CI: 27.2, 31.9). Disease activity ranged from remission to moderate activity. Most of the patients were using disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs and prednisone. Hypertension and dyslipidemia were the most frequent comorbidities During social distancing, there were reductions in total stepping time (15.7% [-0.3 h\/day, 95%CI: -0.4, -0.1; p=0.004]), in light-intensity activity (13.0% [-0.2 h\/day, 95%CI: -0.4, -0.04; p=0.016]) and in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (38.8% [-4.5 min\/day, 95%CI: -8.1, -0.9; p=0.015]), but no changes in total standing time or total sedentary time. However, time spent in prolonged bouts of sitting <30 min increased by 34% (1.0 h\/day, 95%CI: 0.3, 1.7; p=0.006) and sitting bouts <60 min increased by 85% (1.0 h\/day, 95%CI: 0.5, 1.6) Sit-stand transitions were reduced by 10% (-5.1\/day, 95%CI: -10.3, 0.0; p=0.051). Conclusion: Imposed social distancing measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak were associated with decreased physical activity and increased prolonged sitting among rheumatoid arthritis patients. Since this has the potential to increase the burden of cardiovascular disease in such high-risk patients, attention to maintaining physical activity is an urgent consideration during the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ana Jessica Pinto","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Diego Rezende","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Sofia Mendes Sieczkowska","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Kamila Meireles","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Karina Bonfiglioli","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Ana C M Ribeiro","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Eloisa Bonfa","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Neville Owen","author_inst":"Baker Heart & Diabetes Institute"},{"author_name":"David W Dunstan","author_inst":"Baker Heart & Diabetes Institute"},{"author_name":"Hamilton Roschel","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Bruno Gualano","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Flora A Gandolfi","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Sao Jose do Rio Preto"},{"author_name":"Stefanie P Murano","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Jose L Proenca-Modena","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Fernando A Val","author_inst":"Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Dr Heitor Vieira Dourado"},{"author_name":"Gisely C Melo","author_inst":"Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Dr Heitor Vieira Dourado"},{"author_name":"Wuelton M Monteiro","author_inst":"Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Dr Heitor Vieira Dourado"},{"author_name":"Mauricio L Nogueira","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Sao Jose do Rio Preto"},{"author_name":"Marcus VG Lacerda","author_inst":"Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Dr Heitor Vieira Dourado"},{"author_name":"Pedro M Moraes-Vieira","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Helder I Nakaya","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Qiao Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Hongbin Ji","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and"},{"author_name":"Yihua Sun","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Lu Lu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yunjiao Zhou","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"rheumatology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.11.20191734","rel_title":"The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on emergency and elective hip surgeries in Norway","rel_date":"2020-09-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.11.20191734","rel_abs":"Objective: To assess the effects of Covid-19 pandemic lockdown restrictions on the number of emergency and elective hip joint surgeries, and explore whether these procedures are more\/less affected by lockdown restrictions than other hospital care.

Incidence Rate Ratios [IRR] reflect the after-lockdown number of surgeries divided by the before-lockdown number of surgeries. Results: After-lockdown elective hip surgeries were one third the number of before-lockdown (IRR ~0.3), which is a greater drop than the drop seen in all-cause elective hospital care (IRR ~0.6) (no age\/sex differences). Men aged 35-69 had half the number of emergency hip fracture surgeries (IRR ~0.6), whereas women aged [&ge;]70 had the same number of emergency hip fracture surgeries after lockdown (IRR ~1). Only women aged 35-69 and men aged [&ge;]70 had emergency hip fracture surgery rates after lockdown comparable to what may be expected based on analyses of all-cause acute care (IRR ~0.80) Conclusion: Important to note for future pandemics management is that lockdown restrictions may impact more on scheduled joint surgery than other scheduled hospital care.

To highlight the critical importance of unofficially reported newspaper-based deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) like illness (CLI) together with officially confirmed death counts to support improvements in COVID 19 death surveillance. Methods. Both hospital-based official COVID 19 and unofficial CLI death counts were collected from daily newspapers between March 8 and August 22, 2020. We performed both exploratory and time-series analyses to understand the influence of combining newspaper-based CLI death counts with confirmed hospital death counts on the trends and forecasting of COVID-19 death counts. An autoregressive integrated moving average based approach was used to forecast the number of weekly death counts for six weeks ahead. Results. Between March 8 and August 22, 2020, 2,156 CLI deaths were recorded based on newspaper reporting for a count that was 55% of the officially confirmed death count (n = 3,907). This shows that newspaper reports tend to cover a significant number of COVID-19 related deaths. Our forecast also indicates an approximate total of 406 CLI expected for the six weeks ahead, which could contribute to a total of 2,413 deaths including 2,007 confirmed deaths expected from August 23 to October 3, 2020. Conclusions. Analyzing existing trends in and forecasting the expected number of newspaper based CLI deaths indicates yet-unreported COVID-19 death counts, which could be a critical source to estimate provisional COVID 19 death counts and mortality surveillance. Public Health Implications. Considering unofficial newspaper-based CLI death counts is essential to identify COVID-19 death severity and surveillance needs to advance public health research efforts to prepare appropriate response strategies for low- and middle-income countries.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mazbahul G Ahamad","author_inst":"University of Nebraska-Lincoln"},{"author_name":"Monir U Ahmed","author_inst":"Shahjalal University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Byomkesh Talukder","author_inst":"York University"},{"author_name":"Fahian Tanin","author_inst":"Independent Researcher"},{"author_name":"Karina Bonfiglioli","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Ana C M Ribeiro","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Eloisa Bonfa","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Neville Owen","author_inst":"Baker Heart & Diabetes Institute"},{"author_name":"David W Dunstan","author_inst":"Baker Heart & Diabetes Institute"},{"author_name":"Hamilton Roschel","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Bruno Gualano","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Flora A Gandolfi","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Sao Jose do Rio Preto"},{"author_name":"Stefanie P Murano","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Jose L Proenca-Modena","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Fernando A Val","author_inst":"Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Dr Heitor Vieira Dourado"},{"author_name":"Gisely C Melo","author_inst":"Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Dr Heitor Vieira Dourado"},{"author_name":"Wuelton M Monteiro","author_inst":"Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Dr Heitor Vieira Dourado"},{"author_name":"Mauricio L Nogueira","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Sao Jose do Rio Preto"},{"author_name":"Marcus VG Lacerda","author_inst":"Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Dr Heitor Vieira Dourado"},{"author_name":"Pedro M Moraes-Vieira","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Helder I Nakaya","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Qiao Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Hongbin Ji","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and"},{"author_name":"Yihua Sun","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Lu Lu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yunjiao Zhou","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.11.20192880","rel_title":"Gender disparities in access to care for time-sensitive conditions during COVID-19 pandemic in Chile","rel_date":"2020-09-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.11.20192880","rel_abs":"Introduction: During the COVID-19 pandemic reduction on the utilisation of healthcare services are reported in different contexts. Nevertheless, studies have not explored specifically gender disparities on access to healthcare. Aim: To evaluate disparities in access to care in Chile during the COVID-19 pandemic from a gender-based perspective. Methods: We conducted a quasi-experimental design using a difference-in-difference approach. We compared the number of weekly confirmed cases of a set of oncologic and cardiovascular time-sensitive conditions at a national level. We defined weeks 12 to 26 as an intervention period and the actual year as a treatment group. We selected this period because preventive interventions, such as school closures or teleworking, were implemented at this point. To test heterogeneity by sex, we included an interaction term between difference-in-difference estimator and sex. Results: A sizable reduction in access to care for patients with time-sensitivity conditions was observed for oncologic (IRR 0.56; 95% CI 0.50-0.63) and cardiovascular diseases (IRR 0.64; 95% CI 0.62-0.66). Greater reduction occurred in women compared to men across diseases groups, particularly marked on myocardial infarction (0.89; 95% CI 0.85-0.93), stroke (IRR 0.88 IC95% 0.82-0.93), and colorectal cancer (IRR 0.79; 95% CI 0.69-0.91). Compared to men, a greater absolute reduction in women for oncologic diseases (782; 95% CI 704-859) than cardiovascular diseases (172; 95% CI 170-174) occurred over 14 weeks. Conclusion: We confirmed a large drop in new diagnosis for time-sensitive conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile. This reduction was greater for women. Our findings should alert policy-makers about the urgent need to integrate a gender perspective into the pandemic response and its aftermath.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jorge Pacheco","author_inst":"Universidad de Concepcion"},{"author_name":"Francisca Crispi","author_inst":"Universidad de Chile.

We hypothesized that hyaluronan, an extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycan produced at sites of active inflammation that promotes edema in other settings, might be a component of these secretions. To interrogate this, we examined the respiratory secretions collected from eight intubated patients with COVID-19, six control patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), a different respiratory disease also associated with thick adherent secretions, and eight healthy controls. In this sample set we found that hyaluronan content is increased approximately 20-fold in both CF and COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. The hyaluronan in COVID-19 samples was comprised of low-molecular weight fragments, the hyaluronan form most strongly linked with pro-inflammatory functions. Hyaluronan is similarly abundant in histologic sections from cadaveric lung tissue from COVID-19 patients. These findings implicate hyaluronan in the thick respiratory secretions characteristic of COVID-19 infection. Therapeutic strategies targeting hyaluronan should be investigated further for potential use in patients with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gernot Kaber","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Michael J.
