How to leverage rich heterogeneous data based on various signals such as mobility, testing, and\/or disease exposure for forecasting? How to handle noisy data and generate uncertainties in the forecast? In this paper, we present DeepCOVID, an operational deep learning framework designed for real-time COVID-19 forecasting. DeepCOVID works well with sparse data and can handle noisy heterogeneous data signals by propagating the uncertainty from the data in a principled manner resulting in meaningful uncertainties in the forecast. The framework also consists of modules for both real-time and retrospective exploratory analysis to enable interpretation of the forecasts. Results from real-time predictions (featured on the CDC website and FiveThirtyEight.com) since April 2020 indicates that our approach is competitive among the methods in the COVID-19 Forecast Hub, especially for short-term predictions.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexander Rodriguez","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Anika Tabassum","author_inst":"Virginia Tech"},{"author_name":"Jiaming Cui","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Jiajia Xie","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Javen Ho","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Pulak Agarwal","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Bijaya Adhikari","author_inst":"University of Iowa"},{"author_name":"B.

Soon, it has spread out across the world and become an ongoing pandemic. In Bangladesh, the first case of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was detected on March 8, 2020. Since then, not many significant studies have been conducted to understand the transmission dynamics of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Bangladesh. In this study, we estimated the basic reproduction number R0 of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Bangladesh. Methods: The data of daily confirmed cases of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Bangladesh and the reported values of generation time of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) for Singapore and Tianjin, China, were collected. We calculated the basic reproduction number R0 by applying the exponential growth (EG) method. Epidemic data of the first 76 days and different values of generation time were used for the calculation. Results: The basic reproduction number R0 of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Bangladesh is estimated to be 2.66 [95% CI: 2.58-2.75], optimized R0 is 2.78 [95% CI: 2.69-2.88] using generation time 5.20 with a standard deviation of 1.72 for Singapore. Using generation time 3.95 with a standard deviation of 1.51 for Tianjin, China, R0 is estimated to be 2.15 [95% CI: 2.09-2.20], optimized R0 is 2.22 [95% CI: 2.16-2.29]. Conclusions: The calculated basic reproduction number R0 of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Bangladesh is significantly higher than 1, which indicates its high transmissibility and contagiousness.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Riaz Mahmud","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, South Asian University, New Delhi-110021, India."},{"author_name":"H.

However, although the COVID-19 pandemic has created a tidal wave of data, most patient data is siloed, not easily accessible, and due to low sample size, largely not actionable. Based on the precision medicine platform Shivom, a novel and secure data sharing and data analytics marketplace, we developed a versatile pandemic preparedness platform that allows healthcare professionals to rapidly share and analyze genetic data. The platform solves several problems of the global medical and research community, such as siloed data, cross-border data sharing, lack of state-of-the-art analytic tools, GDPR-compliance, and ease-of-use. The platform serves as a central marketplace of 'discoverability'. The platform combines patient genomic & omics data sets, a marketplace for AI & bioinformatics algorithms, new diagnostic tools, and data-sharing capabilities to advance virus epidemiology and biomarker discovery. The bioinformatics marketplace contains some preinstalled COVID-19 pipelines to analyze virus- and host genomes without the need for bioinformatics expertise. The platform will be the quickest way to rapidly gain insight into the association between virus-host interactions and COVID-19 in various populations which can have a significant impact on managing the current pandemic and potential future disease outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ibrahim Farah","author_inst":"Shivom Ventures Limited, 71-75 Shelton Street, Covent Garden, London, England, WC2H 9JQ"},{"author_name":"Giada Lalli","author_inst":"Shivom Ventures Limited, 71-75 Shelton Street, Covent Garden, London, England, WC2H 9JQ"},{"author_name":"Darrol Baker","author_inst":"Shivom Ventures Limited, 71-75 Shelton Street, Covent Garden, London, England, WC2H 9JQ"},{"author_name":"Axel Schumacher","author_inst":"Shivom Ventures Limited, 71-75 Shelton Street, Covent Garden, London, England, WC2H 9JQ"},{"author_name":"OLIVER MENDOZA-CANO","author_inst":"UNIVERSIDAD DE COLIMA"},{"author_name":"Pulak Agarwal","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Bijaya Adhikari","author_inst":"University of Iowa"},{"author_name":"B.

Here we suggest how to use the observed deaths by COVID-19 in an arbitrary population as a surrogate for the progression of the epidemic with the purpose of decision making. We compare several estimates of IFR for SARS-CoV-2 with our estimate that uses the number of additional deaths in households in a database population of 159,150 laboratory-confirmed (RT-qPCR) COVID-19 by SARS-COV-2 in Mexico.

By mid-September of 2020, the number of daily new infections in India have crossed 95,000. To facilitate an intuition for the spatio-temporal development of the pandemic and to help resource deployment planning, we analyze and describe how the disease burden almost-predictably shifted from large metropolitan districts to sub-urban districts. Methods. We gathered the publicly available granular data from 186 different districts (equivalent of counties) on their COVID-19 infections and deaths during the 15 April to 31 August 2020 period. These districts presented an active case burden of 559,566 and a cumulative 2,715,656 infections as of August 31. The epidemiological data of these districts was fit to a susceptible-asymptomatic-infected-recovered-dead (SAIRD) model and the underlying epidemic parameters for each of these districts during the course of 4 months was estimated. We validated these parameters against known epidemiological characteristic distributions and analyzed them to understand their changes in space-time during the pandemic. Findings. The center of the burden of the current-active infections which on May 15 was in the large metro districts with most international access shifted continuously and smoothly shifted towards districts which could be accessed by domestic airports and by trains. A linear trend-analysis showed a continuous improvement in most epidemic parameters consistently across the districts with four categories of accessibility from an international travel perspective - large metro, metro, urban and sub-urban districts. The reproduction numbers improved from 1.77{+\/-}0.58 on May 15 to 1.07{+\/-} 0.13 on August 31 in large metro districts (p-Value of trend 0.0001053); and from 1.58{+\/-}0.39 on May 15 to 0.94{+\/-}0.11 on August 31 in sub-urban districts (p-Value of trend 0.0067). The recovery rate per infected person per day improved from 0.0581{+\/-}0.009 on May 15 to 0.091{+\/-}0.010 on August 31 in large metro districts (p-Value of trend 0.26.10^{-12}); and from 0.059{+\/-}0.011 on May 15 to 0.100{+\/-}0.010 on August 31 in sub-urban districts (p-Value of trend 0.12.10{-16}). The death rate of symptomatic individuals which includes the case-fatality-rate as well as the time from symptoms to death, consistently decreased from 0.0025{+\/-}0.0014 on May 15 to 0.0013{+\/-}0.0003 on August 31 in large metro districts (p-Value of trend 0.0010); and from 0.0018{+\/-}0.0008 on May 15 to 0.0014{+\/-}0.0003 on August 31 in sub-urban districts (p-Value of trend 0.2789. Interpretation. As the daily infections continue to rise at a national level, it is important to notice a `local-flattening' in larger metro districts, and a shift of the pandemic-burden towards smaller sized districts in a clear hierarchical fashion of accessibility from an international travel perspective. The pandemic burden shifting towards remotely accessible regions, with possibly lesser health care facilities, is a call for attention to the re-organization of resources.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Santosh Ansumali","author_inst":"Jawaharlal Nehru Center for Advanced Scientific Research"},{"author_name":"Aloke Kumar","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Samarth Agrawal","author_inst":"Jawaharlal Nehru Center for Advanced Scientific Research"},{"author_name":"H J Shashank","author_inst":"Jawaharlal Nehru Center for Advanced Scientific Research"},{"author_name":"Meher K Prakash","author_inst":"Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research"},{"author_name":"Pulak Agarwal","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Bijaya Adhikari","author_inst":"University of Iowa"},{"author_name":"B.

During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis, this study used the experience sampling method to track the daily WhatsApp usage of 151 adults throughout one week (capturing a total of 924 days of crisis-related communication). Each day, participants reported the extent to which they had received, forwarded, or discussed COVID-19- related content. During the week-long monitoring, most participants (94.7%) reported at least one COVID-19 related use of WhatsApp. Those who engaged with more COVID-19 content in personal chats were more likely to report having COVID-19 thoughts throughout the day. We further observed that around 1 in 10 individuals (14%) were chronic users who received and shared forwarded COVID-19 messages at a high volume; this group may represent everyday \"super spreaders\" of crisis-related content.

Many professional societies recommend postponing, decreasing or stopping anti-cancer therapy in selected persons during the pandemic. However, although seemingly sensible these recommendations are not evidence-based and their impact on anxiety and health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) is unknown. Methods: Surveyed 2532 subjects including 1060 persons with lymphoma, 948 caregivers and 524 normal, uninvolved persons using a purposed-designed questionnaire on a patient organization website. Respondents also completed the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety and patient respondents, the EORTC QLQ-C30 instruments to quantify anxiety and HRQoL. We also evaluated caregiver support and an online education programme of the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology (CSCO). Data of HRQoL from a 2019 pre-pandemic online survey of 1106 persons with lymphoma was a control. Results: 33% (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 30, 36%) of lymphoma patients and 31% (28, 34%) of caregivers but only 21% (17, 24%) of normal individuals had any level of anxiety (both pair-wise P < 0.001). Amongst lymphoma respondents physical exercise and better caregiver support were associated with less anxiety whereas female sex, receiving therapy and reduced therapy intensity were associated with more anxiety. Paradoxically, lymphoma respondents during the pandemic had better HRQoL than pre-pandemic controls. Reduced therapy intensity was associated with worse HRQoL whereas respondents who scored caregiver support and the online patient education programme high had better HRQoL. Conclusions: During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic lymphoma patients and their caregivers had significantly higher incidence of anxiety compared with normals. Lymphoma respondents reported better HRQoL compared with pre-pandemic controls. Reduced therapy-intensity in patients with cancer may have unanticipated adverse effects on anxiety and HRQoL. Regular and intense support by caregivers and online education programmes alleviate anxiety and improve HRQoL.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shenmiao Yang","author_inst":"Peking Univeristy Institute of Hematology"},{"author_name":"Dong Dong","author_inst":"JC School of Public Health and Primary Care, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, SAR China"},{"author_name":"Hongfei Gu","author_inst":"Chinese lymphoma patients organization, House086, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Robert Peter Gale","author_inst":"Haematology Research Centre, Department of Immunology and Inflammation, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Jun Ma","author_inst":"Harbin Institute of Hematology & Oncology, Harbin, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaojun Huang","author_inst":"Peking University Peoples Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology.

Aim: The objectives of this study were to compare SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence and compliance to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) between HCWs working within (high-risk) or outside (intermediate-risk) units treating suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. In addition, administration staff (low-risk) was included. Materials: Co-HCW is a prospective cohort study among employees at the Jena University Hospital, Germany. Since 16th March 2020, 50 SARS-CoV-2 inpatients and 73 outpatients were treated in our hospital. Mandatory masking was implemented on 20th March 2020. We here evaluated seroprevalence using two IgG detecting immunoassays, assessed COVID-19 exposure, clinical symptoms and compliance to wear PPE. Findings: Between 19th May and 19th June 2020 we analysed 660 employees [out of 3,228; 20.4%]. Eighteen participants (2.7%) had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in at least one immunoassay. Among them, 13 (72.2%) were not aware of direct COVID-19 exposure and 9 (50.0%) did not report any clinical symptoms. We observed no evidence for an association between seroprevalence and risk area (high-risk: 2 of 137 HCWs (1.5%), intermediate-risk: 10 of 343 HCWs (2.9%), low-risk: 6 of 180 administration employees (3.3%); p=0.574). Reported compliance to wear PPE differed (p<0.001) between working in high-risk (98.3%) and in intermediate-risk areas (69.8%). Conclusion: No evidence for higher seroprevalence against SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs working in high-risk COVID-19 areas could be observed, probably due to high compliance to wear PPE. Compared to administration employees, we observed no additional risk to acquire SARS-CoV-2 infections by patient care.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christina Bahrs","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital, Friedrich-Schiller-University, Jena, Germany"},{"author_name":"Aurelia Kimmig","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital, Friedrich-Schiller-University, Jena, Germany"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Weis","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Juliane Ankert","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital, Friedrich-Schiller-University, Jena, Germany"},{"author_name":"Stefan Hagel","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital, Friedrich-Schiller-University, Jena, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jens Maschmann","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital, Friedrich-Schiller-University, Jena, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Stallmach","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital, Friedrich-Schiller-University, Jena, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andrea Steiner","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital, Friedrich-Schiller-University, Jena, Germany"},{"author_name":"Michael Bauer","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital, Friedrich-Schiller-University, Jena, Germany"},{"author_name":"Wilhelm Behrigner","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital, Friedrich-Schiller-University, Jena, Germany"},{"author_name":"Michael Baier","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital, Friedrich-Schiller-University, Jena, Germany"},{"author_name":"Miriam Kesselmeier","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital, Friedrich-Schiller-University, Jena, Germany"},{"author_name":"Cora Richert","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital, Friedrich-Schiller-University, Jena, Germany"},{"author_name":"Florian Zepf","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital, Friedrich-Schiller-University, Jena, Germany"},{"author_name":"Martin Walter","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital, Friedrich-Schiller-University, Jena, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andre Scherag","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital, Friedrich-Schiller-University, Jena, Germany"},{"author_name":"Michael Kiehntopf","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital, Friedrich-Schiller-University, Jena, Germany"},{"author_name":"Bettina Loeffler","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital, Friedrich-Schiller-University, Jena, Germany"},{"author_name":"Mathias W Pletz","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital, Friedrich-Schiller-University, Jena, Germany"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.29.20203695","rel_title":"Coding Complete Genome Sequences of Twenty-three SARS-CoV-2 Strains Isolated in the Philippines","rel_date":"2020-09-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.29.20203695","rel_abs":"Here, we report the coding complete genome sequences of 23 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) strains from the Philippines.

Objective: To estimate the probability of averting outbreaks in homeless shelters under different infection control strategies. Design: Microsimulation model of COVID-19 transmission in a representative homeless shelter over 30 days under different infection control strategies, including daily symptom-based screening, twice-weekly polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) testing and universal mask wearing. Setting: A shelter of 250 residents and 50 staff. Patients: Residents and staff of homeless shelters in the US. Model calibrated to data from cross-sectional PCR surveys during COVID-19 outbreaks in five shelters in three US cities. Measurements: Probability of averting a COVID-19 outbreak ([&ge;]3 infections in 14 days). Results: Basic reproduction number (R0) estimates for the observed outbreaks ranged from 2.9 to 6.2. The probability of averting an outbreak diminished with higher transmissibility (R0) within the simulated shelter and increasing transmission intensity in the local community. With moderate transmission intensity in the local community, the estimated probabilities of averting an outbreak in a low-risk (R0=1.5), moderate-risk (R0=2.9), and high-risk (R0=6.2) shelter were: 0.33, 0.11 and 0.03 for daily symptom-based screening; 0.52, 0.27, and 0.04 for twice-weekly PCR testing; 0.47, 0.20 and 0.06 for universal masking; and 0.68, 0.40 and 0.08 for these strategies combined. Limitations: R0 values calibrated to reported outbreaks may be higher than for average shelter due to smaller outbreaks going unreported. Conclusion: In high-risk homeless shelter environments and locations with high community incidence of COVID-19 most infection control strategies are unlikely to prevent outbreaks. In lower-risk environments, combined interventions should be adopted to reduce outbreak risk.

Affinity reagents targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, the most exposed surface structure of the virus, are of interest for the development of therapeutics and diagnostics. We used affinity selection-mass spectrometry for the rapid discovery of synthetic high affinity peptide binders for the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. From library screening with 800 million synthetic peptides, we identified three sequences with nanomolar affinities (dissociation constants Kd = 80 to 970 nM) for RBD and selectivity over human serum proteins. Picomolar RBD concentrations in biological matrix could be detected using the biotinylated lead peptide in ELISA format. These peptides might associate with the SARS-CoV-2-spike-RBD at a site unrelated to ACE2 binding, making them potential orthogonal reagents for sandwich immunoassays.

In the absence of an updated systematic review, we conducted a meta-analysis of randomized trials that study the effectiveness of HCQ to prevent COVID-19. Methods and Findings: A search of PubMed, Embase, and medRxiv with expert consultation found four completed randomized trials: two pre-exposure prophylaxis trials and two post-exposure prophylaxis trials. We obtained or calculated the risk ratio of COVID-19 diagnosis for assignment to HCQ versus no HCQ (either placebo or usual care) for each trial, and then pooled the risk ratio estimates. The risk ratio estimated for each of the individual trials were 0.74 (95% CI 0.50-1.10), 0.95 (0.25, 3.64), 0.83 (95% CI: 0.58-1.18), and 0.69 (95% CI: 0.35-1.37). The pooled risk ratio estimate was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.61-0.99) when using either a fixed effect or a standard random effects approach, and 0.78 (95% CI: 0.53-1.16) when using a conservative modification of the Hartung-Knapp random effects approach. All four trials found a similar rate of serious adverse effects in the HCQ and no HCQ groups. Discussion: A pooled analysis of these randomized trials cannot rule out a moderate reduction of COVID-19 risk after assignment to HCQ. Yet the findings from the randomized trials were widely interpreted as definite evidence of lack of effectiveness of HCQ, simply because they were not statistically significant. Completion of the ongoing trials is needed to generate more precise estimates of the effectiveness of HCQ to prevent COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xabier Garcia-Albeniz","author_inst":"RTI Health Solutions"},{"author_name":"Julia Del Amo","author_inst":"National Plan Against AIDS, Ministry of Health.

A specificity of less than one implies occurrence of false positive cases, which becomes particularly relevant with an increased number of tests. The recent increase in cases in Bavaria could therefore be smaller than reported. However, an increase in case counts can still be seen from Mid-July until September 2020. The additional consideration of a sensitivity less than one, i.e., the occurrence of false negative tests, results in an epidemic curve in which the daily case counts are increased by a constant factor, but the structure of the curve does not change considerably.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Felix Guenther","author_inst":"Statistical Consulting Unit StaBLab, Department of Statistics, LMU Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Bender","author_inst":"Statistical Consulting Unit StaBLab, Department of Statistics, LMU Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Michael H\u00f6hle","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, Stockholm University, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Manfred Wildner","author_inst":"Bavarian Health and Food Safety Authority \/ Pettenkofer School of Public Health, Oberschlei\u00dfheim, Germany"},{"author_name":"Helmut K\u00fcchenhoff","author_inst":"Statistical Consulting Unit StaBLab, Department of Statistics, LMU Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Yen-Chun Lee","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Xiyun Ye","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Hanna","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Bradley L.

Curbing the spread of Covid-19 is still urgently needed. Given the lack of potential vaccines and effective medications, non-pharmaceutical interventions are the major option to curtail the spread of COVID-19. An accurate estimate of the potential impact of different non-pharmaceutical measures on containing, and identify risk factors influencing the spread of COVID-19 is crucial for planning the most effective interventions to curb the spread of COVID-19 and to reduce the deaths. Additive model-based bivariate causal discovery for scalar factors and multivariate Granger causality tests for time series factors are applied to the surveillance data of lab-confirmed Covid-19 cases in the US, University of Maryland Data (UMD) data, and Google mobility data from March 5, 2020 to August 25, 2020 in order to evaluate the contributions of social-biological factors, economics, the Google mobility indexes, and the rate of the virus test to the number of the new cases and number of deaths from COVID-19. We found that active cases\/1000 people, workplaces, tests done\/1000 people, imported COVID-19 cases, unemployment rate and unemployment claims\/1000 people, mobility trends for places of residence (residential), retail and test capacity were the most significant risk factor for the new cases of COVID-19 in 23, 7, 6, 5, 4, 2, 1 and 1 states, respectively, and that active cases\/1000 people, workplaces, residential, unemployment rate, imported COVID cases, unemployment claims\/1000 people, transit stations, mobility trends (transit) , tests done\/1000 people, grocery, testing capacity, retail, percentage of change in consumption, percentage of working from home were the most significant risk factor for the deaths of COVID-19 in 17, 10, 4, 4, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1 states, respectively. We observed that no metrics showed significant evidence in mitigating the COVID-19 epidemic in FL and only a few metrics showed evidence in reducing the number of new cases of COVID-19 in AZ, NY and TX.

Here, we constructed two novel adenovirus vectored COVID-19 vaccine candidates on simian adenovirus serotype 23 (Sad23L) and human adenovirus serotype 49 vectors (Ad49L) carrying the full-length gene of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S), designated Sad23L-nCoV-S and Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccines, respectively. The immunogenicity elicited by these two vaccine strains was individually evaluated in mice. Specific humoral and cellular immune responses were proportionally observed in a dose-dependent manner, and stronger response was obtained by boosting. Furthermore, five rhesus macaques were intramuscularly injected with a dose of 5x109 PFU Sad23L-nCoV-S vaccine for prime vaccination, followed by boosting with 5x109 PFU of Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccine at 4-week interval. Three macaques were injected with Sad23L-GFP and Ad49L-GFP vectorial viruses as negative controls. Both mice and macaques tolerated well the vaccine inoculations without detectable clinical or pathologic changes. In macaques, prime-boost vaccination regimen induced high titers of 103.16 S-binding antibody (S-BAb), 102.75 cell receptor binding domain (RBD)-BAb and 102.38 neutralizing antibody (NAb) to pseudovirus a week after boosting injection, followed by sustained high levels over 10 weeks of observation. Robust IFN-{gamma} secreting T-cell response (712.6 SFCs\/106 cells), IL-2 secreting T-cell response (334 SFCs\/106 cells) and intracellular IFN-{gamma} expressing CD4+\/CD8+ T cell response (0.39%\/0.55%) to S peptides were detected in the vaccinated macaques. It was concluded that prime-boost immunization with Sad23L-nCoV-S and Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccines can safely elicit strong immunity in animals in preparation of clinical phase 1\/2 trials.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shengxue Luo","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Shenzhen Hospital, Southern Medical University, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Panli Zhang","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Bochao Li","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chan Yang","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chaolan Liang","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qi Wang","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ling Zhang","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xi Tang","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jinfeng Li","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Shuiping Hou","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jinfeng Zeng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Yongshui Fu","author_inst":"Guangzhou Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Jean-Pierre Allain","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Tingting Li","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yuming Zhang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Hospital, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chengyao Li","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Michael Kiehntopf","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital, Friedrich-Schiller-University, Jena, Germany"},{"author_name":"Bettina Loeffler","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital, Friedrich-Schiller-University, Jena, Germany"},{"author_name":"Mathias W Pletz","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital, Friedrich-Schiller-University, Jena, Germany"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.29.317289","rel_title":"Susceptibility of midge and mosquito vectors to SARS-CoV-2 by natural route of infection","rel_date":"2020-09-29","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.29.317289","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 is a recently emerged, highly contagious virus and the cause of the current pandemic. It is a zoonotic virus, although its animal origin is not clear yet. Person-to-person transmission occurs by inhalation of infected droplets and aerosols, or by direct contact with contaminated fomites. Arthropods transmit numerous viral, parasitic, and bacterial diseases; however, the potential role of arthropods in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is not fully understood. Thus far, a few studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 replication is not supported in cells from certain insect species nor in certain species of mosquitoes after intrathoracic inoculation. In this study, we expanded the work of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility to biting insects after ingesting a SARS-CoV-2infected blood meal. Species tested included Culicoides sonorensis biting midges, as well as Culex tarsalis and Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes, all known biological vectors for numerous RNA viruses. Arthropods were allowed to feed on SARS-CoV-2 spiked blood and at various time points post infection analyzed for the presence of viral RNA and infectious virus. Additionally, cell lines derived from C. sonorensis (W8a), Ae. aegypti (C6\/36), Cx. quinquefasciatus (HSU), and Cx. tarsalis (CxTrR2) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility. Our results indicate that none of the biting insects, nor the insect cell lines support SARS-CoV-2 replication. We conclude, that biting insect do not pose a risk for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to humans or animals following a SARS-CoV-2 infected blood meal.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Velmurugan Balaraman","author_inst":"Kansas State University"},{"author_name":"Barbara S.

With similar morphology to the WT virion, the D614G virus is also more sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Infection of human ACE2 transgenic mice and Syrian hamsters with the WT or D614G viruses produced similar titers in respiratory tissue and pulmonary disease.

Objectives: We aim to provide early predictions of individual patients' intensive care unit length of stay, which might improve resource allocation and patient care during the on-going pandemic. Methods: We developed a new semiparametric distributional index model depending on covariates which are available within 24h after intensive care unit admission. The model was trained on a large cohort of acute respiratory distress syndrome patients out of the Minimal Dataset of the Swiss Society of Intensive Care Medicine. Then, we predict individual length of stay of patients in the RISC-19-ICU registry. Measurements: The RISC-19-ICU Investigators for Switzerland collected data of 557 critically ill patients with COVID-19. Main Results: The model gives probabilistically and marginally calibrated predictions which are more informative than the empirical length of stay distribution of the training data. However, marginal calibration was worse after approximately 20 days in the whole cohort and in different subgroups. Long staying COVID-19 patients have shorter length of stay than regular acute respiratory distress syndrome patients. We found differences in LoS with respect to age categories and gender but not in regions of Switzerland with different stress of intensive care unit resources. Conclusion: A new probabilistic model permits calibrated and informative probabilistic prediction of LoS of individual patients with COVID-19. Long staying patients could be discovered early. The model may be the basis to simulate stochastic models for bed occupation in intensive care units under different casemix scenarios.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexander Henzi","author_inst":"Institute of Mathematical Statistics and Actuarial Science, University of Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Gian-Reto Kleger","author_inst":"Division of Intensive Care Medicine, Cantonal Hospital, St.Gallen, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Matthias P.

While research has focused on the hyperinflammation, little research has been performed on the compensatory anti-inflammatory response which if severe may lead to a state of functional immunoparalysis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory response to COVID-19, by assessing interleukin-10 (IL-10) and IL-10\/lymphocyte count ratio and their association with patient outcomes. Methods: Adult patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were recruited. The primary endpoint was peak COVID-19 severity within 30 days of index ED visit. Additional endpoints included COVID-19 severity at ED disposition, development of severe acute kidney injury (AKI) or secondary bacterial infections. Results: A total of 52 COVID-19 patients were enrolled. IL-10 and IL-10\/lymphocyte count were significantly higher in patients with severe disease at both time points (all p<0.05), as well as in those who developed severe AKI and secondary bacterial infection (all p[&le;]0.01). In multivariable analysis, a one-unit increase in IL-10 was associated with 42% increased odds of severe COVID-19 (p=0.031), whilst a one-unit increase IL-10\/lymphocyte ratio was also associated with 32% increase in odds of severe COVID-19 (p=0.013). Conclusions: The hyperinflammatory response to COVID-19 is accompanied by a simultaneous anti-inflammatory response, which is associated with poor outcomes and may increase the risk of secondary bacterial infections. IL-10 and IL-10\/lymphocyte ratio at ED presentation were independent predictors of COVID-19 severity. Functional immunoparalysis in COVID-19 requires further investigation to enable more precise immunomodulatory therapy against SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brandon Michael Henry","author_inst":"Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Stefanie Benoit","author_inst":"Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jens Vikse","author_inst":"Stavanger University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Brandon Berger","author_inst":"University of Cincinnati"},{"author_name":"Christina Pulvino","author_inst":"University of Cincinnati"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Hoehn","author_inst":"University of Cincinnati"},{"author_name":"James Rose","author_inst":"Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Maria Helena Santos de Oliveira","author_inst":"Federal University of Parana"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Lippi","author_inst":"University of Verona"},{"author_name":"Justin Benoit","author_inst":"University of Cincinnati"},{"author_name":"Rhianna E Lee","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Teresa M Mascenik","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Caitlin E Edwards","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Longping V Tse","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Richard C Boucher","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Scott H Randell","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Tadaki Suzuki","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Lisa E Gralinski","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Yoshihiro Kawaoka","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Ralph S.

High quality recombinant virus proteins are required for research related to the development of vaccines and improved assays, and to the general understanding of virus action. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the 2019-nCoV spike (S) protein contains disulfide bonds and N-linked glycosylations, therefore, it is typically produced by secretion. Here, we describe a construct and protocol for the expression and purification of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) labeled 2019-nCoV spike RBD. The fusion protein, in the vector pcDNA 4\/TO, comprises an N-terminal interferon alpha 2 (IFN2) signal peptide, an eYFP, a FLAG-tag, a human rhinovirus 3C protease cleavage site, the RBD of the 2019-nCoV spike protein and a C-terminal 8x His-tag. We stably transfected HEK 293 cells. Following expansion of the cells, the fusion protein was secreted from adherent cells into serum-free medium. Ni-NTA IMAC purification resulted in very high protein purity, based on analysis by SDS-PAGE. The fusion protein was soluble and monodisperse, as confirmed by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and negative staining electron microscopy. Deglycosylation experiments confirmed the presence of N-linked glycosylations in the secreted protein. Complex formation with the peptidase domain of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for the 2019-nCoV spike RBD, was confirmed by SEC, both for the YFP-fused spike RBD and for spike RBD alone, after removal of YFP by proteolytic cleavage. Possible applications for the fusion protein include binding studies on cells or in vitro, fluorescent labeling of potential virus-binding sites on cells, the use as an antigen for immunization studies or as a tool for the development of novel virus- or antibody-detection assays.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tobias Bierig","author_inst":"Paul Scherrer Institute"},{"author_name":"Gabriella Collu","author_inst":"Paul Scherrer Institute"},{"author_name":"Alain Blanc","author_inst":"Paul Scherrer Institute"},{"author_name":"Emiliya Poghosyan","author_inst":"Paul Scherrer Institute"},{"author_name":"Roger Marc Benoit","author_inst":"Paul Scherrer Institute"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Hoehn","author_inst":"University of Cincinnati"},{"author_name":"James Rose","author_inst":"Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Maria Helena Santos de Oliveira","author_inst":"Federal University of Parana"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Lippi","author_inst":"University of Verona"},{"author_name":"Justin Benoit","author_inst":"University of Cincinnati"},{"author_name":"Rhianna E Lee","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Teresa M Mascenik","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Caitlin E Edwards","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Longping V Tse","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Richard C Boucher","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Scott H Randell","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Tadaki Suzuki","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Lisa E Gralinski","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Yoshihiro Kawaoka","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Ralph S.

Methods: Data consisted of sociodemographic and clinical data captured in University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) electronic medical record (EMR) systems, linked by common variables (deidentified). The analysis population included hospitalized patients (across 21 hospitals) with a primary diagnosis of COVID-19 infection during the period March 14-August 31, 2020. The primary outcome was a composite of in-hospital mechanical ventilation\/mortality. We compared temporal trends in patient characteristics, clinical practice, and hospital outcomes using 4 time-defined epochs for calendar year 2020: March 14-March 31 (epoch 1); April 1-May 15, (epoch 2), May 16-June 28 (epoch 3); and June 29-August 31 (epoch 4). We report unadjusted survival estimates, followed by propensity score analyses to adjust for differences in patient characteristics, to compare in-hospital outcomes of epoch 4 patients (recently treated) to epoch 1-3 patients (earlier treated). Results: Mean number of hospital admissions was 9.9 per day during epoch 4, which was ~2- to 3-fold higher than the earlier epochs. Presenting characteristics of the 1,076 COVID-19 hospitalized patients were similar across the 4 epochs, including mean age. The crude rate of mechanical ventilation\/mortality was lower in epoch 4 patients (17%) than in epoch 1-3 patients (23% to 35%). When censoring for incomplete patient follow-up, the rate of mechanical ventilation\/mortality was lower in epoch 4 patients (p<0.0001), as was the individual component of mechanical ventilation (p=0.0002) and mortality (p=0.02). In propensity score adjusted analyses, the in-hospital relative risk (RR) of mechanical ventilation\/mortality was lower in epoch 4 patients (RR=0.67, 95% CI: 0.48, 0.93). For the outcome being discharged alive within 3, 5, or 7 days of admission, adjusted odds ranged from 1.6- to 1.7-fold higher among epoch 4 patients compared to earlier treated patients. The better outcomes in epoch 4 patients were principally observed in patients under the age of 75 years. Patient level dexamethasone use was 55.6% in epoch 4 compared to 15% or less of patients in the earlier epochs. Most patients across epochs received anticoagulation drugs (principally heparin). Overall steroid (81.7% vs. 54.3%, p<0.0001) and anticoagulation use (90.4% vs. 80.7%, p=0.0001) was more frequent on the day or day after hospitalization in epoch 4 patients compared to earlier treated patients. Conclusions: In our large system, recently treated hospitalized COVID-19 patients had lower rates of in-hospital mechanical ventilation\/mortality and shorter length of hospital stay. Alongside of this was a change to early initiation of glucocorticoid therapy and anticoagulation. The extent to which the improvement in patient outcomes was related to changes in clinical practice remains to be established.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kevin E Kip","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Graham Snyder","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Donald M Yealy","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center"},{"author_name":"John W Mellors","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tami Minnier","author_inst":"Wolff Center, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael P Donahoe","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey McKibben","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kevin Collins","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Oscar C Marroquin","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Justin Benoit","author_inst":"University of Cincinnati"},{"author_name":"Rhianna E Lee","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Teresa M Mascenik","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Caitlin E Edwards","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Longping V Tse","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Richard C Boucher","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Scott H Randell","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Tadaki Suzuki","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Lisa E Gralinski","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Yoshihiro Kawaoka","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Ralph S.
