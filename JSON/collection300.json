Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a less common type of stroke which might be triggered by COVID-19. We present a series of CVST cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: In a multinational retrospective study, we collected all cases of CVST in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients admitted to nine tertiary stroke centers from the beginning of the pandemic to June 30th, 2020. We compared the demographics, clinical and radiological characteristics, risk factors, and outcome of these patients with a control group of non-SARS-CoV-2 infected CVST patients in the same seasonal period of the years 2012-2016 from the country where the majority of cases were recruited. Results: A total of 13 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria (62% women, mean age 50.9 years). Six patients were discharged with good outcomes (mRS[&le;]2) and three patients died in hospital. Compared to the control group, the SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were significantly older (50.9 versus 36.7 years, p<0.001), had a lower rate of identified CVST risk factors (23.1% versus 84.2%, p<0.001), had more frequent cortical vein involvement (38.5% versus 10.5%, p: 0.025), and a non-significant higher rate of in-hospital mortality (23.1% versus 5.3%, p: 0.073). Conclusion: CVST should be considered as potential comorbidity in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients presenting with neurological symptoms. Our data suggest that compared to non-SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, CVST occurs in older patients, with lower rates of known CVST risk factors and might lead to a poorer outcome in the SARS-CoV-2 infected group.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ashkan Mowla","author_inst":"Division of Stroke and Endovascular Neurosurgery, Department of Neurological Surgery, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, California, US"},{"author_name":"Banafsheh Shakibajahromi","author_inst":"Clinical Neurology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shima Shahjouei","author_inst":"Neurology Department, Neuroscience Institute, Geisinger Health System, Pennsylvania, USA"},{"author_name":"Afshin Borhani-Haghighi","author_inst":"Clinical Neurology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran"},{"author_name":"Nasrin Rahimian","author_inst":"Neurology Department, Yasrebi Hospital, Kashan, Iran"},{"author_name":"Humain Baharvahdat","author_inst":"Division of Neuroendovascular surgery, Department of Neurosurgery, Ghaem Hospital, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran"},{"author_name":"Soheil Naderi","author_inst":"Neurosurgery Department, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Fariborz Khorvash","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran"},{"author_name":"Davar Altafi","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Alavi Hospital, Ardabil University of Medical Sciences, Ardabil, Iran"},{"author_name":"Seyed Amir Ebrahimzadeh","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Yasrebi Hospital, Kashan, Iran"},{"author_name":"Ghasem Farahmand","author_inst":"Iranian Center of Neurological Research, Neuroscience Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Alaleh Vaghefi Far","author_inst":"Iranian Center of Neurological Research, Neuroscience Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Vijay K.

In this study, we examined utility of simpler models for estimating risk of hospitalization of patients with COVID-19 and mortality of these patients based on demographic characteristics (sex, age, race, median household income based on zip code) and smoking status of 12,347 patients who tested positive at Mass General Brigham centers. The corresponding electronic health records were queried from 02\/26\/2020 to 07\/14\/2020 to construct derivation and validation cohorts. The derivation cohort was used to fit a generalized linear model for estimating risk of hospitalization within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis and mortality within approximately 3 months for the hospitalized patients. On the validation cohort, the model resulted in c-statistics of 0.77 [95% CI: 0.73-0.80] for hospitalization outcome, and 0.72 [95% CI: 0.69-0.74] for mortality among hospitalized patients. Higher risk was associated with older age, male sex, black ethnicity, lower socioeconomic status, and current\/past smoking status. The model can be applied to predict risk of hospitalization and mortality, and could aid decision making when detailed medical history of patients is not easily available.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hesam Dashti","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Elise Roche","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"David Bates","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Samia Mora","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Olga Demler","author_inst":"Division of Preventive Medicine"},{"author_name":"Humain Baharvahdat","author_inst":"Division of Neuroendovascular surgery, Department of Neurosurgery, Ghaem Hospital, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran"},{"author_name":"Soheil Naderi","author_inst":"Neurosurgery Department, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Fariborz Khorvash","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran"},{"author_name":"Davar Altafi","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Alavi Hospital, Ardabil University of Medical Sciences, Ardabil, Iran"},{"author_name":"Seyed Amir Ebrahimzadeh","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Yasrebi Hospital, Kashan, Iran"},{"author_name":"Ghasem Farahmand","author_inst":"Iranian Center of Neurological Research, Neuroscience Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Alaleh Vaghefi Far","author_inst":"Iranian Center of Neurological Research, Neuroscience Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Vijay K.

COVID-19 disease severity, while highly variable, is typically lower in pediatric patients than adults (particularly the elderly), but increased rates of hospitalizations requiring intensive care are observed in infants than in older children. The reasons for these differences are unknown. To detect potential age-based correlates of disease severity, we measured ACE2 protein expression at the single cell level in human lung tissue specimens from over 100 donors from [~]4 months to 75 years of age. We found that expression of ACE2 in distal lung epithelial cells generally increases with advancing age but exhibits extreme intra- and inter-individual heterogeneity. Notably, we also detected ACE2 expression on neonatal airway epithelial cells and within the lung parenchyma. Similar patterns were found at the transcript level: ACE2 mRNA is expressed in the lung and trachea shortly after birth, downregulated during childhood, and again expressed at high levels in late adulthood in alveolar epithelial cells. Furthermore, we find that apoptosis, which is a natural host defense system against viral infection, is also dynamically regulated during lung maturation, resulting in periods of heightened apoptotic priming and dependence on pro-survival BCL-2 family proteins including MCL-1. Infection of human lung cells with SARS-CoV-2 triggers an unfolded protein stress response and upregulation of the endogenous MCL-1 inhibitor Noxa; in juveniles, MCL-1 inhibition is sufficient to trigger apoptosis in lung epithelial cells - this may limit virion production and inflammatory signaling. Overall, we identify strong and distinct correlates of COVID-19 disease severity across lifespan and advance our understanding of the regulation of ACE2 and cell death programs in the mammalian lung. Furthermore, our work provides the framework for potential translation of apoptosis modulating drugs as novel treatments for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zintis Inde","author_inst":"Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Clarence Yapp","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Gaurav N Joshi","author_inst":"Emory University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Johan Spetz","author_inst":"Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Cameron Fraser","author_inst":"Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Brian Deskin","author_inst":"Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Elisa Ghelfi","author_inst":"Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Chhinder Sodhi","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"David Hackam","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Lester Kobzik","author_inst":"Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Ben Croker","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Douglas Brownfield","author_inst":"Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Hongpeng Jia","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Kristopher A.

Specifically, the time of day of infection was found critical for illness progression, as has been reported for influenza, respiratory syncytial and parainfluenza type 3 viruses. We analyzed circadian rhythm implication in SARS-CoV-2 virus infection of isolated human monocytes, key actor cells in Covid-19 disease, from healthy subjects. The circadian gene expression of Bmal1 and Clock genes was investigated with q-RTPCR. Monocytes were infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus strain and viral infection was investigated by One-Step qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence. Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1{beta} and IL-10 levels were also measured in supernatants of infected monocytes. Using Cosinor analysis, we showed that Bmal1 and Clock transcripts exhibited circadian rhythm in monocytes with an acrophase and a bathyphase at Zeitgeber Time (ZT)6 and ZT17. After forty-eight hours, the amount of SARS-CoV-2 virus increased in the monocyte infected at ZT6 compared to ZT17. The high virus amount at ZT6 was associated with significant increased release in IL-6, IL-1{beta} and IL-10 compared to ZT17. Our results suggest that time day of SARS-CoV-2 infection affects viral infection and host immune response. They support consideration of circadian rhythm in SARS-CoV-2 disease progression and we propose circadian rhythm as a novel target for managing viral progression.\n\nImportanceThe implication of circadian rhythm (CR) in pathogenesis of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been recently anticipated. The time of day of infection is critical for illness progression as reported for influenza, respiratory syncytial and parainfluenza type 3 viruses. In this study, we wondered if SARS-CoV-2 infection and cytokine production by human monocytes, innate immune cells affected by Covid-19, were regulated by CR. Our results suggest that time day of SARS-CoV-2 infection affects viral infection and host immune response. They support consideration of circadian rhythm in SARS-CoV-2 disease progression and we propose circadian rhythm as a novel target for managing viral progression.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aissatou Bailo Diallo","author_inst":"Aix-Marseille Univ, IRD, APHM, MEPHI, IHU-M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Infection"},{"author_name":"Laetitia Gay","author_inst":"Aix-Marseille Univ, IRD, APHM, MEPHI, IHU-M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Infection"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Coiffard","author_inst":"Aix-Marseille Univ, MEPHI, IRD, APHM, Marseille, France"},{"author_name":"Marc Leone","author_inst":"Aix-Marseille Univ, MEPHI, IRD, APHM, Marseille, France"},{"author_name":"Soraya Mezouar","author_inst":"Aix-Marseille Univ, IRD, APHM, MEPHI, IHU-M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Infection"},{"author_name":"Jean-Louis M\u00e8ge","author_inst":"IHU M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e infection"},{"author_name":"Elisa Ghelfi","author_inst":"Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Chhinder Sodhi","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"David Hackam","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Lester Kobzik","author_inst":"Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Ben Croker","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Douglas Brownfield","author_inst":"Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Hongpeng Jia","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Kristopher A.

The acceleration of new cases is important for the characterization and comparison of epidemic curves. The objective of this work is to measure the diversity of epidemic curves and understand the importance of socioeconomic variables in the acceleration, peak cases and deaths by Covid-19 in Brazilian states. Methods: This is an ecological study with time series analysis of new cases and deaths by Covid-19 in Brazil and its 27 federation units. Using the polynomial interpolation method, we calculated the daily cases and deaths with the measurement of the respective acceleration. We calculated the correlation coefficient between the epidemic curve data and socioeconomic data. Results: The combination of daily data and acceleration determined that the states of Brazil are in different stages of the epidemic. Maximum acceleration of peak cases, peak of cases, maximum acceleration of deaths and peak of deaths are associated with the Gini index and population density, but did not correlate with HDI and per capita income. Conclusion: Brazilian states showed heterogeneous data curves. Densitypopulation and socioeconomic inequality are associated with worse control of the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Airandes S Pinto","author_inst":"Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana"},{"author_name":"Carlos A Rodrigues","author_inst":"Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana"},{"author_name":"Carlito L Sobrinho","author_inst":"Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana"},{"author_name":"Edval G Santos Jr.","author_inst":"Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana"},{"author_name":"Livia A Cruz","author_inst":"Grupo Baiano de Oncologia"},{"author_name":"Paulo C Nunes","author_inst":"Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana"},{"author_name":"Matheus G Costa","author_inst":"Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana"},{"author_name":"Manoel O Rocha","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"David Hackam","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Lester Kobzik","author_inst":"Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Ben Croker","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Douglas Brownfield","author_inst":"Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Hongpeng Jia","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Kristopher A.

Indeed, the clinical heterogeneity of COVID-19 ranges from relatively asymptomatic to severe disease with death resultant from multiple constellations of organ failures. In addition to genetics and host characteristics, it is likely that viral dissemination is a key determinant of disease manifestation. Given the complexity of disease expression, one major limitation in current animal models is the ability to capture this clinical heterogeneity due to technical limitations related to murinizing SARS-CoV2 or humanizing mice to render susceptible to infection. Here we describe a murine model of COVID-19 using respiratory infection with the native mouse betacoronavirus MHV-A59. We find that whereas high viral inoculums uniformly led to hypoxemic respiratory failure and death, lethal dose 50% (LD50) inoculums led to a recapitulation of most hallmark clinical features of COVID-19, including lymphocytopenias, heart and liver damage, and autonomic dysfunction. We find that extrapulmonary manifestations are due to viral metastasis and identify a critical role for type-I but not type-III interferons in preventing systemic viral dissemination. Early, but not late treatment with intrapulmonary type-I interferon, as well as convalescent serum, provided significant protection from lethality by limiting viral dissemination. We thus establish a Biosafety Level II model that may be a useful addition to the current pre-clinical animal models of COVID-19 for understanding disease pathogenesis and facilitating therapeutic development for human translation.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hua Qing","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lokesh Sharma","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Brandon K Hilliard","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xiaohua Peng","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Anush Swaminathan","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Justin Tian","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kavita Israni-Winger","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Cuiling Zhang","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Delva Leao","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Seungjin Ryu","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Victoria Habet","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lin Wang","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xuefei Tian","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shuta Ishibe","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lawrence H.

Here, we present both pMHC and TCR-pMHC interfaces to infer peptide epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Accordingly, significant TCR-pMHC templates (Z-value cutoff > 4) along with interatomic interactions within the SARS-CoV-2-derived hit peptides were clarified. Also, we applied the structural analysis of the hit peptides from different coronaviruses to highlight a feature of evolution in SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, bat-CoV, and MERS-CoV. Peptide-protein flexible docking between each of the hit peptides and their corresponding MHC molecules were performed, and a multi-hit peptides vaccine against the S and N glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was designed. Filtering pipelines including antigenicity, and also physiochemical properties of designed vaccine were then evaluated by different immunoinformatics tools. Finally, vaccine-structure modeling and immune simulation of the desired vaccine were performed aiming to create robust T cell immune responses. We anticipate that our design based on the T cell antigen epitopes and the frame of the immunoinformatics analysis could serve as valuable supports for the development of COVID-19 vaccine.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amir Hossein Mohseni","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Sedigheh Taghinezhad-S","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Bing Su","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Feng Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Brandon K Hilliard","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tamara Dlugos","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xinbo Zhang","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yuki Yasumoto","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Carmen J.

Single cell sequencing with paired repertoire sequencing of PBMCs and CSF cells show evidence for unique immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS. Strikingly, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are present in the CSF of all patients studied, but the antibody epitope specificity in the CSF and relative prevalence of B cell receptor sequences markedly differed when compared to those found in paired serum. Finally, using a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we demonstrate that localized CNS immune responses occur following viral neuroinvasion, and that the CSF is a faithful surrogate for responses occurring uniquely in the CNS.

The efficacy of several repurposed drugs has been evaluated in clinical trials. Among these drugs, a relatively new antiandrogen agent, enzalutamide, was proposed because it reduces the expression of transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), a key component mediating SARS-CoV-2-driven entry into host cells, in prostate cancer cells. However, definitive evidence for the therapeutic efficacy of enzalutamide in COVID-19 is lacking. Here, we evaluated the antiviral efficacy of enzalutamide in prostate cancer cells, lung cancer cells, human lung organoids and SARS-CoV-2-infected Ad-ACE2-transduced Tmprss2 knockout (Tmprss2-KO) and wild-type (WT) mice. TMPRSS2 knockout significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. Enzalutamide effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in human prostate cancer cells (LNCaP) but not in human lung cancer cells or patient-derived lung organoids. Although Tmprss2 knockout effectively blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection in ACE2-transduced mice, enzalutamide showed no antiviral activity due to the AR independence of TMPRSS2 expression in mouse and human lung epithelial cells. Moreover, we observed distinct AR binding patterns between prostate cells and lung cells and a lack of direct binding of AR to TMPRSS2 in human lung cells. Thus, our findings do not support the postulated protective role of enzalutamide in treating COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dong Gao","author_inst":"CAS Center for

To facilitate antiviral screening against SARS-CoV-2 without requirement for high biosafety level facility, we developed a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-vectored replicon of SARS-CoV-2, nCoV-SH01 strain, in which secreted Gaussia luciferase (sGluc) was encoded in viral subgenomic mRNA as a reporter gene. The replicon was devoid of structural genes spike (S), membrane (M), and envelope (E). Upon transfection, the replicon RNA replicated in various cell lines, and was sensitive to interferon alpha (IFN-), remdesivir, but was resistant to hepatitis C virus inhibitors daclatasvir and sofosbuvir. Replication of the replicon was also sensitive overexpression of zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP). We also constructed a four-plasmid in-vitro ligation system that is compatible with the BAC system, which makes it easy to introduce desired mutations into the assembly plasmids for in-vitro ligation. This replicon system would be helpful for performing antiviral screening and dissecting virus-host interactions.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yang Zhang","author_inst":"Key

Several studies showed that the glycosylation of virus spike (S) protein and the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the host cell is critical for the virus infectivity. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations were used to explore the role of a novel mutated O-glycosylation site (D494S) on the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of S protein. This site was suggested as a key mediator of virus-host interaction. We showed that the decoration of S494 with core and elongated O-glycans results in stabilized interactions on the direct RBD-ACE2 interface with more favorable binding free energies for longer oligosaccharides. Hence, the further drug design attempts should take this crucial factor into account, while suggesting any novel therapeutic candidate.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shadi Rahnama","author_inst":"Sharif University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Maryam Azimzadeh Irani","author_inst":"Faculty of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shahid Beheshti University"},{"author_name":"Mehriar Amininasab","author_inst":"Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, School of Biology, College of Science, University of Tehran"},{"author_name":"Reza Ejtehadi","author_inst":"Department of Physics, Sharif University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhigang Yi","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Juan He","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Xiaoting Tao","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Yang Wu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences and Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan "},{"author_name":"Xinyuan Tong","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Xinyi Xia","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Wangxin Guo","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Yunguang Li","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Yinqin Zhu","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyu Zhang","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Zhuang Liu","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Rebiguli Aji","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Xia Cai","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences and Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan "},{"author_name":"Yutang Li","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences and Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan "},{"author_name":"Di Qu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences and Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan "},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Shibo Jiang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Qiao Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Hongbin Ji","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and"},{"author_name":"Yihua Sun","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Lu Lu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yunjiao Zhou","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Thomas Rogers","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Michelle I Rossulek","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Jean G Sathish","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Claire Steppan","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Martyn Ticehurst","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Lawrence W.

However, the response to CTAs has been tepid. For example, in France less than 2 million people (roughly 3% of the population) downloaded the CTA. Against this background, we carry out an online experiment to show that CTAs can still play a key role in containing the spread of COVID-19, provided that they are re-conceptualized to account for insights from behavioral science. We start by showing that carefully devised in-app notifications are effective in inducing prudent behavior like wearing a mask or staying home. In particular, people that are notified that they are taking too much risk and could become a superspreader engage in more prudent behavior. Building on this result, we suggest that CTAs should be re-framed as Behavioral Feedback Apps (BFAs). The main function of BFAs would be providing users with information on how to minimize the risk of contracting COVID-19, like how crowded a store is likely to be. Moreover, the BFA could have a rating system that allows users to flag stores that do not respect safety norms like wearing masks. These functions can inform the behavior of app users, thus playing a key role in containing the spread of the virus even if a small percentage of people download the BFA. While effective contact tracing is impossible when only 3% of the population downloads the app, less risk taking by small portions of the population can produce large benefits. BFAs can be programmed so that users can also activate a tracing function akin to the one currently carried out by CTAs. Making contact tracing an ancillary, opt-in function might facilitate a wider acceptance of BFAs.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ian Ayres","author_inst":"Yale Law School"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Romano","author_inst":"Bocconi Law School\/ Yale Law School"},{"author_name":"Chiara Sotis","author_inst":"London School of Economics and Political Science and Political Science"},{"author_name":"Reza Ejtehadi","author_inst":"Department of Physics, Sharif University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhigang Yi","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Juan He","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Xiaoting Tao","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Yang Wu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences and Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan "},{"author_name":"Xinyuan Tong","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Xinyi Xia","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Wangxin Guo","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Yunguang Li","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Yinqin Zhu","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyu Zhang","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Zhuang Liu","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Rebiguli Aji","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Xia Cai","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences and Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan "},{"author_name":"Yutang Li","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences and Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan "},{"author_name":"Di Qu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences and Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan "},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Shibo Jiang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Qiao Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Hongbin Ji","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and"},{"author_name":"Yihua Sun","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Lu Lu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yunjiao Zhou","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Thomas Rogers","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Michelle I Rossulek","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Jean G Sathish","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Claire Steppan","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Martyn Ticehurst","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Lawrence W.

The knowledge and practices of individuals will probably have an important bearing on the course of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. The aim of this study was to evaluate the knowledge and practices toward COVID-19 among the general public in the UAE during the current outbreak COVID-19. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey of 1356 of respondents in the UAE we conducted during the epidemic outbreak between 9th to 24th June-2020. The questionnaire consisted of three sections: Socio-demographic, participants knowledge, and participants practices. Independent- samples t-test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), chi-square, and binary logistic regression have used. A p-value of (p < 0.05) was considered statistically significant. Results: Of the total sample, 72% were females, 47% % were aged between 30-49 years, 57.2% were from Sharjah, 65.6% had a college degree, and 40.6% were unemployed. The total correct score of knowledge and practices questions was high 85% and 90%, respectively. Males gender, other marital status, and illiterate\/primary educational levels had a lower level of knowledge and practices than others. participants aged 18-29 had little higher knowledge than other ages but had a lower level in practices, people who live in Abu Dhabi had better knowledge and practice than other emirates, employed people had a lower level of knowledge but higher in practice. Binary logistic regression analysis presented that females, 18-29 years, and married participants significantly associated with a higher score of knowledge, while female gender, over 30 years old, the martial status of singles, college-level and higher, unemployed, were significantly associated with high mean practice score. Conclusions: To our knowledge, the current study is one of the first studies to evaluate the knowledge and practices of UAE population toward COVID-19. Most of the respondents demonstrate an excellent level of knowledge and awareness as well as proper conscious practices. Continuing to implement the health education programs pursued by the UAE is highly important to maintain the appropriate level of awareness among the public.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Balsam Qubais","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Iffat Elbarazi","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Mai Barakat","author_inst":"Mansoura University"},{"author_name":"Reza Ejtehadi","author_inst":"Department of Physics, Sharif University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhigang Yi","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Juan He","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Xiaoting Tao","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Yang Wu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences and Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan "},{"author_name":"Xinyuan Tong","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Xinyi Xia","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Wangxin Guo","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Yunguang Li","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Yinqin Zhu","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyu Zhang","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Zhuang Liu","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Rebiguli Aji","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Xia Cai","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences and Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan "},{"author_name":"Yutang Li","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences and Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan "},{"author_name":"Di Qu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences and Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan "},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Shibo Jiang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Qiao Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Hongbin Ji","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and"},{"author_name":"Yihua Sun","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Lu Lu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yunjiao Zhou","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Thomas Rogers","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Michelle I Rossulek","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Jean G Sathish","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Claire Steppan","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Martyn Ticehurst","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Lawrence W.

In this paper, we model the past trajectory (March 01, 2020 - July 25, 2020) and make a month-long (July 26, 2020 - August 24, 2020) forecast of the future evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in India using an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. According to our forecasting results, India is likely to have 3,800,989 cumulative infected cases, 1,634,142 cumulative active cases, 2,110,697 cumulative recoveries and 56,150 cumulative deaths by August 24, 2020, if the current trend of the pandemic continues to prevail. The implications of these forecasts are that in the upcoming month the infection rate of COVID-19 in India is going to escalate, while as the rate of recovery and the case-fatality rate is likely to reduce. In order to avert these possible scenarios, the administration and health-care personnel need to formulate and implement robust control measures, while the general public needs to be more responsible and strictly adhere to the established and newly formulated guidelines to slow down the spread of the pandemic and prevent it from transforming into a catastrophe.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Suhail Ganiny","author_inst":"National Institute of Technology, Srinagar"},{"author_name":"Owais Nisar","author_inst":"SKUAST-K"},{"author_name":"Mai Barakat","author_inst":"Mansoura University"},{"author_name":"Reza Ejtehadi","author_inst":"Department of Physics, Sharif University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhigang Yi","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Juan He","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Xiaoting Tao","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Yang Wu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences and Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan "},{"author_name":"Xinyuan Tong","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Xinyi Xia","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Wangxin Guo","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Yunguang Li","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Yinqin Zhu","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyu Zhang","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Zhuang Liu","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Rebiguli Aji","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Xia Cai","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences and Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan "},{"author_name":"Yutang Li","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences and Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan "},{"author_name":"Di Qu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences and Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan "},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Shibo Jiang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Qiao Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Hongbin Ji","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and"},{"author_name":"Yihua Sun","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Lu Lu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yunjiao Zhou","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Thomas Rogers","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Michelle I Rossulek","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Jean G Sathish","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Claire Steppan","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Martyn Ticehurst","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Lawrence W.

It is accepted that aerosols are produced during a range of dental procedures, posing potential risks to both dental practitioners and patients. There has been little agreement concerning aerosol transmission associated with orthodontics and associated mitigation. Methods: Orthodontic procedures were simulated in a closed side-surgery using a dental manikin on an acrylic model using composite-based adhesive. Adhesive removal representing debonding was undertaken using a 1:1 contra-angle handpiece and fast hand-piece with variation in air and water flow. The removal of acid etch was also simulated with use of combined 3-in-1 air water syringe to remove etch. An optical particle scanner and a spectrometer particle scanner were both to assess particulate matter ranging from 'very small' (0.08 - 0.26 um) to large (2.7 - 10 um). Results: Standard debonding procedure (involving air but no water) was associated with clear increase in the very small and small (0.26 - 0.9 um) particles, but only for a short period with no significant increases for other sizes. Debonding procedures without air appeared to produce similar levels of aerosol to standard debonding. Debonding in association with water tended to produce large increase in aerosol levels, producing particles of all sizes throughout the experiment. The use of water and a fast hand-piece led to the most significant increase in particles. Combined use of the 3-in-1 air water syringe did not result in any detectable increase in the aerosol levels. Conclusions: Particulate matter was released during orthodontic debonding, although the concentration and volume was markedly less than that associated with the use of a fast hand-piece. No increase in particulates was associated with prolonged use of a 3-in-1 air-water syringe. Particulate levels reduced to baseline levels over a short period (approx. 5 minutes). Further research within alternative, open environments and without air exchange systems is required.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ahmed R Din","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Annika Hindocha","author_inst":"Barts Health NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Tulsi Patel","author_inst":"Barts Health NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Sanjana Sudarshan","author_inst":"Barts NHS Health Trust"},{"author_name":"Neil Cagney","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Amine Koched","author_inst":"TSI France Inc."},{"author_name":"Jens-Dominik Mueller","author_inst":"QueenMary University of London"},{"author_name":"Noha Seoudi","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Claire Morgan","author_inst":"Barts NHS Health Trust"},{"author_name":"Shakeel Shahdad","author_inst":"Barts NHS Health Trust"},{"author_name":"Padhraig S Fleming","author_inst":"Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Yunguang Li","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Yinqin Zhu","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyu Zhang","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Zhuang Liu","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Rebiguli Aji","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Xia Cai","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences and Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan "},{"author_name":"Yutang Li","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences and Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan "},{"author_name":"Di Qu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences and Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan "},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Shibo Jiang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Qiao Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Hongbin Ji","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and"},{"author_name":"Yihua Sun","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Lu Lu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yunjiao Zhou","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Thomas Rogers","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Michelle I Rossulek","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Jean G Sathish","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Claire Steppan","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Martyn Ticehurst","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Lawrence W.

The analysis of data is carried out with the use of the standard statistical analysis methods of random events and methods of mathematical statistics for the non-accidental time-series of observations. In particular, a correlation and autocorrelation analysis of the observational data was carried out, the periodicity in the time- series of [C] were revealed, the calculation of the interval prediction values of [C] taking into account the periodicity in the time-series of observations from August 1 to 31, 2020 (ARM, AZE) and from August 1 to September 11, 2020 (WLD, GEO, TUR, RUS) were carried out. Comparison of real and calculated predictions data on [C] in the study sites from August 1 to August 31, 2020 is carried out. It was found that daily, monthly and mean weekly real values of [C] for all the studied locations practically fall into the 99% confidence interval of the predicted values of [C] for the specified time period. A dangerous situation with the spread of coronavirus infection may arise when the mean weekly values of [C] of the 99% upper level of the forecast confidence interval are exceeded within 1-2 weeks. Favorable - when the mean weekly values of [C] decrease below 99% of the lower level of the forecast confidence interval.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Avtandil G.

In this study, we conducted a global systematic literature review to summarize trends in the modelling techniques used for Covid-19 from January 1st 2020 to June 30th 2020. We further examined the reliability and correctness of predictions by comparing predicted and observed values for cumulative cases and deaths. From an initial 2170 peer-reviewed articles and preprints found with our defined keywords, 148 were fully analyzed. We found that most studies on the modelling of Covid-19 were from Asia (52.70%) and Europe (25%). Most of them used compartmental models (SIR and SEIR) (57%) and statistical models (growth models and time series) (28%) while few used artificial intelligence (5%) and Bayesian approach (3%). For cumulative cases, the ratio predicted\/observed values and the ratio of the amplitude of confidence interval (CI) or credibility interval (CrI) of predictions and the central value were on average larger than 1 (4.49-9.98 and 1.10-1.94, respectively) indicating cases of incorrect predictions, large uncertainty on predictions, and large variation across studies. There was no clear difference among models used for these two ratios. However, the ratio predicted\/observed values was relatively smaller for SIR models than for SEIR models, indicating that more complex models might not be more accurate for predictions. We further found that values of both ratios decreased with the number of days covered by studies, indicating that the wider the time covered by the data, the higher the correctness and accuracy of predictions. In 21.62% of studies, observed values fall within the CI or CrI of the cumulative cases predicted by studies. Only six of the 148 selected studies (4.05%) predicted the number of deaths. For 33.3% of these predictions, the ratio of predicted to actual number of deaths was close to 1. We also found that the Bayesian model made predictions closer to reality than the compartmental and the statistical models, although these differences are only suggestive due to the small size of the data. Our findings suggest that while predictions made by the different models are useful to understand the pandemic course and guide policy-making, there should be cautious in their usage.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Janyce E.

The nature of such reinfection risks will affect the choice of control tactics and vaccines. We constructed an SIR transmission model of waning and drifting that can be fitted to cross-neutralization serological data. In this model, waning occurs in individuals who have recovered from previous infections while drifting occurs during transmission to a previously infected individual. Interactions at the population level generate complex dynamics that cause drifting to occur in unanticipated but explainable ways across waning and drifting parameter sets. In particular, raising the fraction of transmissions where drifting occurs slows the rise of drifted strains to high levels and changes the equilibrium distribution of strains from {cup} shaped (extreme strains dominate) to {cap} shaped (central strains dominate). In {cup} shaped parameter regimes, endemic infection levels can rise after many years to above the original epidemic peak. The model simulates results from cross-neutralization assays given sera from previously infected individuals when multiple drifted strains are used in the assays. Fitting the model to such assay data can estimate waning and drifting parameters. Given the parameters, the model predicts infection patterns. We propose a process for using fits of our model to serological and other data called Decision Robustness and Identifiability Analysis (DRIA). This can inform decisions about vaccine options such as whether to prepare for changes in vaccine composition because the virus is changing to escape immunity.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"James S Koopman","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Carl P Simon","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jiri Jarkovsky","author_inst":"Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic"},{"author_name":"Martin Komenda","author_inst":"Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic"},{"author_name":"Jarmila Razova","author_inst":"Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic"},{"author_name":"Ladislav Dusek","author_inst":"Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic"},{"author_name":"Tomas Pavlik","author_inst":"Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic"},{"author_name":"Noha Seoudi","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Claire Morgan","author_inst":"Barts NHS Health Trust"},{"author_name":"Shakeel Shahdad","author_inst":"Barts NHS Health Trust"},{"author_name":"Padhraig S Fleming","author_inst":"Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Yunguang Li","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Yinqin Zhu","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyu Zhang","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Zhuang Liu","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Rebiguli Aji","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Xia Cai","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences and Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan "},{"author_name":"Yutang Li","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences and Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan "},{"author_name":"Di Qu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences and Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan "},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Shibo Jiang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Qiao Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Hongbin Ji","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and"},{"author_name":"Yihua Sun","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Lu Lu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yunjiao Zhou","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Thomas Rogers","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Michelle I Rossulek","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Jean G Sathish","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Claire Steppan","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Martyn Ticehurst","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Lawrence W.

To this end we developed a deterministic transmission model based on the renewal equation and fitted the model to daily case and death data in the first few months of 2020 in 79 countries and states, representing 4.2 billions individuals. Based on a region-specific infection fatality ratio, we inferred the time-varying probability of case detection and the time-varying decline in transmissiblity. As a validation, the predicted total number of infected was close to that found in serosurveys; more importantly, the inferred probability of detection strongly correlated with the number of daily tests per inhabitant, with 50% detection achieved with 0.003 daily tests per inhabitants. Most of the decline in transmission was explained by the reductions in transmissibility (social distancing), which avoided 10 millions deaths in the regions studied over the first four months of 2020. In contrast, symptom-based testing and isolation of positive cases was not an efficient way to control the spread of the disease, as a large part of transmission happens before symptoms and only a small fraction of infected individuals was typically detected. The latter is explained by the limited number of tests available, and the fact that increasing test capacity increases the probability of detection less than proportionally. Together these results suggest that little control can be achieved by symptom-based testing and isolation alone.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Antoine Belloir","author_inst":"Ecole Polytechnique"},{"author_name":"Francois Blanquart","author_inst":"CNRS"},{"author_name":"Huynh Kim Mai","author_inst":"IP, Nha Trang, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Bao Trieu","author_inst":"IP, Nha Trang, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Le Xuan Huy","author_inst":"IP, Nha Trang, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Ho Thi Thanh Thuy","author_inst":"Viet A, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Le Thanh Chung","author_inst":"Da Nang CDC, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Ngoc Anh","author_inst":"Da Nang CDC, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thi Thu Hong","author_inst":"OUCRU, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Bui Duc Thang","author_inst":"Da Nang CDC, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thi Hoai Thu","author_inst":"Da Nang CDC, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Le Thi Kim Chi","author_inst":"Da Nang CDC, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thi Hanh","author_inst":"Da Nang University of Medical Technology and Pharmacy, Da Nang city, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Huy Hoang","author_inst":"Da Nang University of Medical Technology and Pharmacy, Da Nang city, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Chau Nguyen","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases"},{"author_name":"Guy Thwaites","author_inst":"OUCRU, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Do Thai Hung","author_inst":"IP, Nha Trang, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Le Van Tan","author_inst":"OUCRU-VN"},{"author_name":"Ngo Thi Kim Yen","author_inst":"DoH, Da Nang, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Shibo Jiang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Qiao Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Hongbin Ji","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and"},{"author_name":"Yihua Sun","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Lu Lu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yunjiao Zhou","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Thomas Rogers","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Michelle I Rossulek","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Jean G Sathish","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Claire Steppan","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Martyn Ticehurst","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Lawrence W.

However, no prior studies have examined temporal trends and differential effects of social vulnerability on COVID-19 incidence and death rates. The purpose of this study was to examine temporal trends among counties with high and low social vulnerability and to quantify disparities in these trends over time. We hypothesized that highly vulnerable counties would have higher incidence and death rates compared to less vulnerable counties and that this disparity would widen as the pandemic progressed. Methods: We conducted a retrospective longitudinal analysis examining COVID-19 incidence and death rates from March 1 to August 31, 2020 for each county in the US. We obtained daily COVID-19 incident case and death data from USAFacts and the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering. We classified counties using the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), a percentile-based measure from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in which higher scores represent more vulnerability. Using a Bayesian hierarchical negative binomial model, we estimated daily risk ratios (RRs) comparing counties in the first (lower) and fourth (upper) SVI quartiles. We adjusted for percentage of the county designated as rural, percentage in poor or fair health, percentage of adult smokers, county average daily fine particulate matter (PM2.5), percentage of primary care physicians per 100,000 residents, and the proportion tested for COVID-19 in the state. Results: In unadjusted analyses, we found that for most of March 2020, counties in the upper SVI quartile had significantly fewer cases per 100,000 than lower SVI quartile counties. However, on March 30, we observed a crossover effect in which the RR became significantly greater than 1.00 (RR = 1.10, 95% PI: 1.03, 1.18), indicating that the most vulnerable counties had, on average, higher COVID-19 incidence rates compared to least vulnerable counties. Upper SVI quartile counties had higher death rates on average starting on March 30 (RR = 1.17, 95% PI: 1.01,1.36). The death rate RR achieved a maximum value on July 29 (RR = 3.22, 95% PI: 2.91, 3.58), indicating that most vulnerable counties had, on average, 3.22 times more deaths per million than the least vulnerable counties. However, by late August, the lower quartile started to catch up to the upper quartile. In adjusted models, the RRs were attenuated for both incidence cases and deaths, indicating that the adjustment variables partially explained the associations. We also found positive associations between COVID-19 cases and deaths and percentage of the county designated as rural, percentage of resident in fair or poor health, and average daily PM2.5. Conclusions: Results indicate that the impact of COVID-19 is not static but can migrate from less vulnerable counties to more vulnerable counties over time. This highlights the importance of protecting vulnerable populations as the pandemic unfolds.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brian Neelon","author_inst":"Medical University of South Carolina"},{"author_name":"Fedelis Mutiso","author_inst":"Medical University of South Carolina"},{"author_name":"Noel T Mueller","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"John L Pearce","author_inst":"Medical University of South Carolina"},{"author_name":"Sara E Benjamin-Neelon","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Sharon Stevelink","author_inst":"Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hotopf","author_inst":"Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"},{"author_name":"Reza Razavi","author_inst":"The School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London"},{"author_name":"- On behalf of the KCL CHECK research team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Bui Duc Thang","author_inst":"Da Nang CDC, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thi Hoai Thu","author_inst":"Da Nang CDC, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Le Thi Kim Chi","author_inst":"Da Nang CDC, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Thi Hanh","author_inst":"Da Nang University of Medical Technology and Pharmacy, Da Nang city, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Huy Hoang","author_inst":"Da Nang University of Medical Technology and Pharmacy, Da Nang city, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Chau Nguyen","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases"},{"author_name":"Guy Thwaites","author_inst":"OUCRU, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Do Thai Hung","author_inst":"IP, Nha Trang, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Le Van Tan","author_inst":"OUCRU-VN"},{"author_name":"Ngo Thi Kim Yen","author_inst":"DoH, Da Nang, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Shibo Jiang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Qiao Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Hongbin Ji","author_inst":"CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Aca"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and"},{"author_name":"Yihua Sun","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Lu Lu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yunjiao Zhou","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Thomas Rogers","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Michelle I Rossulek","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Jean G Sathish","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Claire Steppan","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Martyn Ticehurst","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Lawrence W.
