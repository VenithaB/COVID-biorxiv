We aimed to obtain a model to predict SARS-CoV-2 infection in suspected patients reported to the Brazilian surveillance system. Methods: We analyzed suspected patients reported to the National Surveillance System that corresponded to the following case definition: patients with respiratory symptoms and fever, who traveled to regions with local or community transmission or who had close contact with a suspected or confirmed case. Based on variables routinely collected, we obtained a multiple model using logistic regression. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and accuracy indicators were used for validation. Results: We described 1468 COVID-19 cases (confirmed by RT-PCR) and 4271 patients with other illnesses. With a data subset, including 80% of patients from Sao Paulo (SP) and Rio Janeiro (RJ), we obtained a function which reached an AUC of 95.54% (95% CI: 94.41% - 96.67%) for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and accuracy of 90.1% (sensitivity 87.62% and specificity 92.02%). In a validation dataset including the other 20% of patients from SP and RJ, this model exhibited an AUC of 95.01% (92.51% - 97.5%) and accuracy of 89.47% (sensitivity 87.32% and specificity 91.36%). Conclusion: We obtained a model suitable for the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 based on routinely collected surveillance data. Applications of this tool include early identification for specific treatment and isolation, rational use of laboratory tests, and input for modeling epidemiological trends.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fredi A Diaz-Quijano","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Jose Mario Nunes da Silva","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo, School of Public Health, Postgraduate Student in Epidemiology."},{"author_name":"Fabiana Ganem","author_inst":"Secretariat of Health Surveillance, Department of Immunization and Communicable Diseases, Ministry of Health, Brasilia, DF, Brazil."},{"author_name":"Silvano Oliveira","author_inst":"Secretariat of Health Surveillance, Department of Immunization and Communicable Diseases, Ministry of Health, Brasilia, DF, Brazil."},{"author_name":"Andrea Liliana Vesga-Varela","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo, School of Public Health, Postgraduate Student in Public Heath."},{"author_name":"Julio Croda","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Mato Grosso do Sul, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.05.20054494","rel_title":"Physician Deaths from Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19)","rel_date":"2020-04-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.05.20054494","rel_abs":"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused much morbidity and mortality to patients but also health care providers. We tabulated the cases of physician deaths from COVID-19 associated with front-line work in hopes of mitigating future events. METHOD: On April 5, 2020, Google internet search was performed using the keywords doctor, physician, death, COVID, COVID-19, and coronavirus in English and Farsi, and in Chinese using the Baidu search engine. RESULTS: We found 198 physician deaths from COVID-19, but complete details were missing for 49 individuals. The average age of the physicians that died was 63.4 years (range 28 to 90 years) and the median age was 66 years of age. Ninety percent of the deceased physicians were male (175\/194). General practitioners and emergency room doctors (78\/192), respirologists (5\/192), internal medicine specialists (11\/192) and anesthesiologists (6\/192) comprised 52% of those dying. Two percent of the deceased were epidemiologists (4\/192), 2% were infectious disease specialists (4\/192), 5% were dentists (9\/192), 4% were ENT (8\/192), and 4% were ophthalmologists (7\/192). The countries with the most reported physician deaths were Italy (79\/198), Iran (43\/198), China (16\/198), Philippines (14\/198), United States (9\/192) and Indonesia (7\/192). CONCLUSION: Physicians from all specialties may die from COVID, and these deaths will likely increase as the pandemic progresses. Lack of personal protective equipment was cited as a common cause of death. Consideration should be made to exclude older physicians from front-line work.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Edsel B Ing","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Alis Qinyuan Xu","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Ali Salimi","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Nurhan Torun","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconness, Ophthalmology"},{"author_name":"Andrea Liliana Vesga-Varela","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo, School of Public Health, Postgraduate Student in Public Heath."},{"author_name":"Julio Croda","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Mato Grosso do Sul, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.07.20053272","rel_title":"Connecting BCG Vaccination and COVID-19: Additional Data","rel_date":"2020-04-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.07.20053272","rel_abs":"The reasons for a wide variation in severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) across the affected countries of the world are not known.

Methods and Findings: We conducted a longitudinal pretest-posttest comparison group study to estimate the change in COVID-19 case growth before versus after implementation of statewide social distancing measures in the U.S. The primary exposure was time before (14 days prior to, and up to 3 days after) versus after (beginning 4 days after, and up to 21 days after) implementation of the first statewide social distancing measures. Statewide restrictions on internal movement were examined as a secondary exposure. The primary outcome was the COVID-19 case growth rate. The secondary outcome was the COVID-19-attributed mortality growth rate. All states initiated social distancing measures between March 10-25, 2020. The mean daily COVID-19 case growth rate decreased beginning four days after implementation of the first statewide social distancing measures, by 0.9% per day (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3% to -0.4%; P<0.001). We did not estimate a statistically significant difference in the mean daily case growth rate before versus after implementation of statewide restrictions on internal movement (0.1% per day; 95% CI, -0.04% to 0.3%, P=0.14), but there is significant difficulty in disentangling the unique associations with statewide restrictions on internal movement from the unique associations with the first social distancing measures. Beginning seven days after social distancing, the COVID-19-attributed mortality growth rate decreased by 1.7% per day (95% CI, 3.0% to -0.7%; P<0.001). Our analysis is susceptible to potential bias resulting from the aggregate nature of the ecological data, potential confounding by contemporaneous changes (e.g., increases in testing), and potential underestimation of social distancing due to spillovers across neighboring states. Conclusions: Statewide social distancing measures were associated with a decrease in the COVID-19 epidemic case growth rate that was statistically significant and a decrease in the COVID-19-attributed mortality growth rate that was not statistically significant.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mark J Siedner","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guy Harling","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Zahra Reynolds","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rebecca F Gilbert","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Haneuse","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, Harvard T.H.

Methods: The R0 of COVID-19 was estimated using the serial interval distribution and the number of incidence cases. The serial interval was fit with a gamma distribution. The probable incidence and cumulative incidence in the next 30 days were predicted using the assumption that daily incidence follows a Poisson distribution determined by daily infectiousness. Data analysis was done using earlyR and projections packages in R software. Results: The maximum-likelihood value of R0 was 2.7 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.1 to 3.4) for the COVID-19 epidemic in the early 14 days and decreased to 1.13 (95% CI: 1.03 to 1.25) by the end of the day 41.

ELIGIBLE DATA: Countries and US states with at least 800 COVID-19 deaths as of April 24, 2020 and with information on the number of deaths in people with age <65. Data were available for 11 European countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK), Canada, and 12 US states (California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey and New York) We also examined available data on COVID-19 deaths in people with age <65 and no underlying diseases.

RESULTS: Individuals with age <65 account for 4.8-9.3% of all COVID-19 deaths in 10 European countries and Canada, 13.0% in the UK, and 7.8-23.9% in the US locations. People <65 years old had 36- to 84-fold lower risk of COVID-19 death than those [&ge;]65 years old in 10 European countries and Canada and 14- to 56-fold lower risk in UK and US locations. The absolute risk of COVID-19 death as of May 1, 2020 for people <65 years old ranged from 6 (Canada) to 249 per million (New York City). The absolute risk of COVID-19 death for people [&ge;]80 years old ranged from 0.3 (Florida) to 10.6 per thousand (New York). The COVID-19 death risk in people <65 years old during the period of fatalities from the epidemic was equivalent to the death risk from driving between 13 and 101 miles per day for 11 countries and 6 states, and was higher (equivalent to the death risk from driving 143-668 miles per day) for 6 other states and the UK. People <65 years old without underlying predisposing conditions accounted for only 0.7-2.6% of all COVID-19 deaths (data available from France, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, Georgia, and New York City). CONCLUSIONS: People <65 years old have very small risks of COVID-19 death even in pandemic epicenters and deaths for people <65 years without underlying predisposing conditions are remarkably uncommon. Strategies focusing specifically on protecting high-risk elderly individuals should be considered in managing the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"John P. A.

The suppression of the epidemics is directly related to this value, and is attained when R<1.Here, we find an analytical expression for R as a function of mobility restrictions and confinement measures, using an epidemic model tailored for COVID-19. This expression for R is an extremely useful tool to design containment policies that are able to suppress the epidemics. We applied our epidemic model for the case of Spain, successfully forecasting both the observed incidence in each region and the overload of the health system. The expression for R allowed us to determine the precise reduction of mobility kappa_0 needed to bend the curve of epidemic incidence, which turned out to be kappa_0 {approx} 0.7. This value, for the case of Spain, translates to a total lockdown with the exception of the mobility associated to essential services, a policy that was finally enforced on March 28.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alex Arenas","author_inst":"Universitat Rovira i Virgili"},{"author_name":"Wesley Cota","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Vicosa"},{"author_name":"Jesus Gomez-Gardenes","author_inst":"Universidad de Zaragoza"},{"author_name":"Sergio Gomez","author_inst":"Universitat Rovira i Virgili"},{"author_name":"Clara Granell","author_inst":"Universidad de Zaragoza"},{"author_name":"Joan T.

This buffer will ease the burden on hospital labs in their heroic efforts to diagnose a large population of patients.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Martina F Scallan","author_inst":"University College Cork, Cork, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Catherine Dempsey","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Cork University Hospital, Wilton, Cork, Ireland"},{"author_name":"John MacSharry","author_inst":"Schools of Microbiology and Medicine, APC Microbiome Ireland , University College Cork"},{"author_name":"Conor P Hogan","author_inst":"Eli Lilly Kinsale Ltd, Kinsale, Co.

Methods: By reinterpreting the data in the article \"Diagnostic Value of Combined Detection of Serum 2019 novel coronavirus IgM and IgG Antibodies in novel coronavirusin Infection\", the positive likelihood ratio of IgM and IgG antibody in diagnosis of COVID-19 (nucleic acid positive patients) was calculated, and the posterior probability of IgM and IgG antibodies and their tandem detection to diagnose was finally calculated. Results: The positive likelihood ratios of single IgM and IgG antibody were 18.50 and 12.65 respectively, and the posterior probabilities were 90.18% and 86.26% respectively. However, the posterior probability of the two antibodies tandem detection is 99.15%, which can give clinicians quantitative confidence in the diagnosis of COVID-19 from suspected cases. According to the results of this study, combining the advantages and disadvantages of nucleic acid detection and antibody detection, the clinical pathway for clinicians to diagnose COVID-19 is found. Conclusion: For suspected cases, IgM and IgG antibody tests should be firstly done at the same time. If the antibody tests are all positive, COVID-19 can be confirmed. If not, nucleic acid detection (one or more times) is performed, and in extreme cases, high-throughput viral genome sequencing is performed.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Feng Yangchun","author_inst":"Xinjiang Medical University"},{"author_name":"Catherine Dempsey","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Cork University Hospital, Wilton, Cork, Ireland"},{"author_name":"John MacSharry","author_inst":"Schools of Microbiology and Medicine, APC Microbiome Ireland , University College Cork"},{"author_name":"Conor P Hogan","author_inst":"Eli Lilly Kinsale Ltd, Kinsale, Co.

Exponential spread can be slowed by social distancing and population-wide isolation measures, but those place a tremendous burden on society, and, once lifted, exponential spread can re-emerge. Regular population-scale testing, combined with contact tracing and case isolation, should help break the cycle of transmission, but current detection strategies are not capable of such large-scale processing. Here we present a protocol for LAMP-Seq, a barcoded Reverse-Transcription Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) method that is highly scalable. Individual samples are stabilized, inactivated, and amplified in three isothermal heat steps, generating barcoded amplicons that can be pooled and analyzed en masse by sequencing. Using unique barcode combinations per sample from a compressed barcode space enables extensive pooling, potentially further reducing cost and simplifying logistics. We validated LAMP-Seq on 28 clinical samples, empirically optimized the protocol and barcode design, and performed initial safety evaluation. Relying on world-wide infrastructure for next-generation sequencing, and in the context of population-wide sample collection, LAMP-Seq could be scaled to analyze millions of samples per day.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jonathan L Schmid-Burgk","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard; Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ricarda Maria Schmithausen","author_inst":"University Hospital Bonn"},{"author_name":"David Li","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Ronja Hollstein","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Amir Ben-Shmuel","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Israel Institute for Biological Research, Ness Ziona, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ofir Israeli","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Israel Institute for Biological Research, Ness Ziona, Israel"},{"author_name":"Shay Weiss","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Israel Institute for Biological Research, Ness Ziona, Israel"},{"author_name":"Nir Paran","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Israel Institute for Biological Research, Ness Ziona, Israel"},{"author_name":"Gero Wilbring","author_inst":"Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jana Liebing","author_inst":"Institute for Experimental Oncology, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"David Feldman","author_inst":"Institute for Protein Design, University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Mikolaj Slabicki","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Baerbel Lippke","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Esther Sib","author_inst":"Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jacob Borrajo","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Strecker","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Julia Reinhardt","author_inst":"Institute for Experimental Oncology, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Per Hoffmann","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany and Genomics Research Group, Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel, Switzerl"},{"author_name":"Brian Cleary","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Michael Hoelzel","author_inst":"Institute for Experimental Oncology, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Markus M Noethen","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Martin Exner","author_inst":"Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Kerstin U Ludwig","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Aviv Regev","author_inst":"MIT and Broad Inst. of MIT &  Harvard"},{"author_name":"Feng Zhang","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard; McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"molecular biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.03.20052563","rel_title":"Interaction between malarial transmission and BCG vaccination with COVID-19 incidence in the world map: A changing landscape human immune system?","rel_date":"2020-04-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.03.20052563","rel_abs":"Background: COVID-19 (Corona virus Disease-2019) is a new public health emergency and is a pandemic currently. Incidence and mortality of COVID-19 vary in different geographical areas. In this study we aimed to analyse the relationship between malaria transmission and BCG vaccination with COVID-19 incidence in the world map. Materials and methods: We collected malaria cases data (World Health Organisation (WHO), 2018), worldwide COVID-19 cases and mortality data (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) and data on BCG vaccination. COVID-19 incidence and mortality was compared. Findings: Data on 5316978938 persons from 166 countries were analysed. Malaria incidence rate was negatively correlated with COVID-19 incidence rate (correlation coefficient = -0.513, p<0.001). Malaria free countries had significantly higher number of COVID-19 cases compared to malaria endemic countries. In Europe and Americas, countries, which have higher BCG vaccination coverage, had significantly less mortality per thousand population compared to those with low BCG coverage (median 0.0002 (0-0.0005) vs 0.0029 (0.0002-0.0177), p=0.017). The case fatality ratio of COVID-19 was related nonlinearly to the malaria incidence. Conclusions: The results suggest the changing human immune system as we progress to eliminate parasitic diseases with time. Chloroquine exposure in malaria endemic zones might have a protective effect.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rudra Prosad Goswami","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Dheeraj K Mittal","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Rama Prosad Goswami","author_inst":"School of Tropical Medicine, Kolkata, India"},{"author_name":"Ronja Hollstein","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Amir Ben-Shmuel","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Israel Institute for Biological Research, Ness Ziona, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ofir Israeli","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Israel Institute for Biological Research, Ness Ziona, Israel"},{"author_name":"Shay Weiss","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Israel Institute for Biological Research, Ness Ziona, Israel"},{"author_name":"Nir Paran","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Israel Institute for Biological Research, Ness Ziona, Israel"},{"author_name":"Gero Wilbring","author_inst":"Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jana Liebing","author_inst":"Institute for Experimental Oncology, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"David Feldman","author_inst":"Institute for Protein Design, University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Mikolaj Slabicki","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Baerbel Lippke","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Esther Sib","author_inst":"Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jacob Borrajo","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Strecker","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Julia Reinhardt","author_inst":"Institute for Experimental Oncology, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Per Hoffmann","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany and Genomics Research Group, Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel, Switzerl"},{"author_name":"Brian Cleary","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Michael Hoelzel","author_inst":"Institute for Experimental Oncology, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Markus M Noethen","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Martin Exner","author_inst":"Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Kerstin U Ludwig","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Aviv Regev","author_inst":"MIT and Broad Inst. of MIT &  Harvard"},{"author_name":"Feng Zhang","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard; McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.06.026765","rel_title":"Noisy Pooled PCR for Virus Testing","rel_date":"2020-04-08","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.06.026765","rel_abs":"Fast testing can help mitigate the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

We develop a scalable approach for determining the viral status of pooled patient samples. Our approach converts group testing to a linear inverse problem, where false positives and negatives are interpreted as generated by a noisy communication channel, and a message passing algorithm estimates the illness status of patients. Numerical results reveal that our approach estimates patient illness using fewer pooled measurements than existing noisy group testing algorithms. Our approach can easily be extended to various applications, including where false negatives must be minimized.

With many PCR-based molecular assays, an extraction step is routinely used as part of the protocol. This step can take up a significant amount of time and labor, especially if the extraction is performed manually. Long assay time, partly caused by slow sample preparation steps, has created a large backlog when testing patient samples suspected of COVID-19. Using flu and RSV clinical specimens, we have collected evidence that the RT-qPCR assay can be performed directly on patient sample material from a nasal swab immersed in virus transport medium (VTM) without an RNA extraction step. We have also used this approach to test for the direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 reference materials spiked in VTM. Our data, while preliminary, suggest that using a few microliters of these untreated samples still can lead to sensitive test results. If RNA extraction steps can be omitted without significantly affecting clinical sensitivity, the turn-around time of COVID-19 tests and the backlog we currently experience can be reduced drastically. Next, we will confirm our findings using patient samples.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arunkumar Arumugam","author_inst":"AI Biosciences, Inc."},{"author_name":"Season S Wong","author_inst":"AI Biosciences, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jindrich Cinati","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Virology, University Hospital Frankfurt, Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ellen Van Damme","author_inst":"Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, Beerse, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Christophe Buyck","author_inst":"Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, Beerse, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Marnix Van Loock","author_inst":"Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, Beerse, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Brian Woodfall","author_inst":"Janssen Biopharma Inc, South San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Sandra Ciesek","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Virology, University Hospital Frankfurt, Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany; German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), Frankf"},{"author_name":"Gero Wilbring","author_inst":"Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jana Liebing","author_inst":"Institute for Experimental Oncology, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"David Feldman","author_inst":"Institute for Protein Design, University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Mikolaj Slabicki","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Baerbel Lippke","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Esther Sib","author_inst":"Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jacob Borrajo","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Strecker","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Julia Reinhardt","author_inst":"Institute for Experimental Oncology, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Per Hoffmann","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany and Genomics Research Group, Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel, Switzerl"},{"author_name":"Brian Cleary","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Michael Hoelzel","author_inst":"Institute for Experimental Oncology, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Markus M Noethen","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Martin Exner","author_inst":"Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Kerstin U Ludwig","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Aviv Regev","author_inst":"MIT and Broad Inst. of MIT &  Harvard"},{"author_name":"Feng Zhang","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard; McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"molecular biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.03.20052530","rel_title":"Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19: A living systematic review protocol","rel_date":"2020-04-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.03.20052530","rel_abs":"OBJECTIVE: To determine the relative impact of the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine on outcomes important to patients with COVID 19. DESIGN: This is the protocol of a living systematic review. DATA SOURCES: We will conduct searches in PubMed\/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), trial registries, grey literature and in a centralised repository in L-OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence). L-OVE is a platform that maps PICO questions to evidence from Epistemonikos database. In response to the COVID-19 emergency, L-OVE was adapted to expand the range of evidence it covers and customised to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place. The search will cover the period until the day before submission to a journal. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES AND METHODS: We will follow a common protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews, already published and submitted to PROSPERO (awaiting ID allocation). We will include randomised controlled trials evaluating the effect of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine - as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs - versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. Randomised trials evaluating chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in infections caused by other coronaviruses, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and non-randomised studies in COVID-19 will be searched in case no direct evidence from randomised trials is found, or if the direct evidence provides low- or very low-certainty for critical outcomes. Two reviewers will independently screen each study for eligibility, extract data, and assess the risk of bias. We will perform random-effects meta-analyses and use GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

These features include enhancement of the nuclear localization signals in the nucleocapsid protein and distinct inserts in the spike glycoprotein that appear to be associated with high case fatality rate of these coronaviruses as well as the host switch from animals to humans. The identified features could be crucial elements of coronavirus pathogenicity and possible targets for diagnostics, prognostication and interventions.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Noam Auslander","author_inst":"NCBI\/NIH"},{"author_name":"Ayal B Gussow","author_inst":"NCBI\/NIH"},{"author_name":"Guilhem Faure","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Yuri I.

Notwithstanding, our model predicts that the current measures are not enough to avoid overloading the health system, since the demand for intensive care units will soon surpass the number available. We also show that an urgent intense quarantine might be the only solution to avoid this scenario and, consequently, minimize the number of severe cases and deaths. On the other hand, we demonstrate that the early relaxation of the undergoing isolation measures would lead to an increase of millions of infections in a short period of time and the consecutive collapse of the health system.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Askery Canabarro","author_inst":"International Institute of Physics-UFRN\/Federal University of Alagoas-UFAL"},{"author_name":"Elayne Tenorio","author_inst":"Hospital Santa Casa de Misericordia de Maceio"},{"author_name":"Renato Martins","author_inst":"HIV\/AIDS  Testing  and  Counseling  Center"},{"author_name":"Lais Martins","author_inst":"Superior School of Health Science"},{"author_name":"Samurai Brito","author_inst":"International Institute of Physics - UFRN"},{"author_name":"Rafael Chaves","author_inst":"International  Institute  of  Physics and School  of  Science  and  Technology - UFRN"},{"author_name":"COVID-19 L-OVE Working Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Sandra Ciesek","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Virology, University Hospital Frankfurt, Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany; German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), Frankf"},{"author_name":"Gero Wilbring","author_inst":"Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jana Liebing","author_inst":"Institute for Experimental Oncology, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"David Feldman","author_inst":"Institute for Protein Design, University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Mikolaj Slabicki","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Baerbel Lippke","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Esther Sib","author_inst":"Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jacob Borrajo","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Strecker","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Julia Reinhardt","author_inst":"Institute for Experimental Oncology, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Per Hoffmann","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany and Genomics Research Group, Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel, Switzerl"},{"author_name":"Brian Cleary","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Michael Hoelzel","author_inst":"Institute for Experimental Oncology, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Markus M Noethen","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Martin Exner","author_inst":"Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Kerstin U Ludwig","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Aviv Regev","author_inst":"MIT and Broad Inst. of MIT &  Harvard"},{"author_name":"Feng Zhang","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard; McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.06.028316","rel_title":"Extraction-free COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) diagnosis by RT-PCR to increase capacity for national testing programmes during a pandemic","rel_date":"2020-04-08","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.06.028316","rel_abs":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory tract infection.

Emerging evidence suggests that a subset of COVID-19 is characterized by the development of a cytokine storm syndrome (CSS), and interleukin (IL)-6 levels are predictors of COVID-19 severity and in-hospital mortality. Targeting hyper-inflammation in COVID-19 may be critical for reducing mortality. Catecholamines enhance inflammatory injury by augmenting the production of IL-6 and other cytokines through a self-amplifying feed-forward loop in immune cells that requires alpha-1 adrenergic receptor (1-AR) signaling. Prophylactic inhibition of catecholamine synthesis with the 1-AR antagonist prazosin reduced catecholamines and cytokine responses in mice, and resulted in markedly increased survival following various hyper-inflammatory stimuli. These findings offer a rationale for studying 1-AR antagonists in the prophylaxis of patients with COVID-19-CSS and ARDS. As high infection rates threaten to overwhelm hospital capacity during this pandemic, preventative approaches that ameliorate COVID-19 severity and reduce excessive mortality are desperately needed. We hypothesize that treatment with prazosin of individuals who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 could reduce catecholamine surges, secondary cytokine dysregulation, and mortality. To investigate a potential role for 1-AR antagonists in preventing poor outcomes in ARDS, we conducted a retrospective analysis of hospitalized patients diagnosed with ARDS. Using data from the Truven Health MarketScan Research Database (2010-2017), we identified 13,125 men (age 45-64) with ARDS, of whom 655 patients (5.0%) were prescribed 1-AR antagonists in the previous year. Applying logistic regression models, we found that patients with prior use of 1-AR antagonists had lower odds of invasive mechanical ventilation compared to non-users (adjusted OR=0.75, 95% CI 0.59-0.95, p=0.019). Perhaps more importantly, those patients had a ~36% lower incidence of both being ventilated and dying in the hospital (adjusted OR=0.59, 95% CI 0.34-0.95, p=0.042). By contrast, prior use of beta-adrenergic receptor ({beta}-AR) antagonists was not correlated with either outcome. We extended these analyses to patients admitted with pneumonia. Of 108,956 subjects in this cohort, 5,498 patients (5.0%) were taking 1-AR antagonist. Similar to ARDS, patients with pneumonia on 1-AR antagonists (but no {beta}-AR antagonists) had a lower odds of mechanical ventilation (adjusted OR=0.83, 95% CI 0.75-0.92, p<0.001) and of both being ventilated and dying in the hospital (adjusted OR=0.77, 95% CI 0.62-0.94, p=0.014) compared to non-users. Mirroring findings from pre-clinical models, these data support a clinical rationale to study 1-AR antagonists in the prevention of severe complications of pneumonia, ARDS, and COVID-19. Prospective, randomized clinical trials of alpha-1 receptor antagonists (e.g. prazosin) administered prior to the onset of severe symptoms are needed to assess their efficacy in preventing CSS and reducing mortality in COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maximilian F Konig","author_inst":"Ludwig Center, Lustgarten Laboratory, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at The Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD, USA; Division of Rheumat"},{"author_name":"Mike Powell","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Engineering, Institute of Computational Medicine, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Verena Staedtke","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Ren-Yuan Bai","author_inst":"Department of Neurosurgery, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"David L Thomas","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Nicole Fischer","author_inst":"The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Sakibul Huq","author_inst":"Department of Neurosurgery, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Adham M Khalafallah","author_inst":"Department of Neurosurgery, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Allison Koenecke","author_inst":"Institute for Computational & Mathematical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Ruoxuan Xiong","author_inst":"Institute for Computational & Mathematical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Brett Mensh","author_inst":"Janelia Research Campus, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Ashburn, VA, USA and Optimize Science"},{"author_name":"Nickolas Papadopoulos","author_inst":"Ludwig Center, Lustgarten Laboratory, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at The Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Kenneth W Kinzler","author_inst":"Ludwig Center, Lustgarten Laboratory, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at The Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Bert Vogelstein","author_inst":"Ludwig Center, Lustgarten Laboratory, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at The Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Joshua T Vogelstein","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Engineering, Institute of Computational Medicine, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Susan Athey","author_inst":"Stanford Graduate School of Business, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Shibin Zhou","author_inst":"Ludwig Center, Lustgarten Laboratory, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at The Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Chetan Bettegowda","author_inst":"Ludwig Center, Lustgarten Laboratory, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at The Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD, USA; Department of Neuro"},{"author_name":"Brian Cleary","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Michael Hoelzel","author_inst":"Institute for Experimental Oncology, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Markus M Noethen","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Martin Exner","author_inst":"Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Kerstin U Ludwig","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Aviv Regev","author_inst":"MIT and Broad Inst. of MIT &  Harvard"},{"author_name":"Feng Zhang","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard; McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.06.027805","rel_title":"Sequence-based prediction of vaccine targets for inducing T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 utilizing the bioinformatics predictor RECON","rel_date":"2020-04-08","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.06.027805","rel_abs":"BackgroundThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created an urgency to identify novel vaccine targets for protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Consistent with observations for SARS-CoV, a closely related coronavirus responsible for the 2003 SARS outbreak, early reports identify a protective role for both humoral and cell-mediated immunity for SARS CoV-2.\n\nMethodsIn this study, we leveraged HLA-I and HLA-II T cell epitope prediction tools from RECON(R) (Real-time Epitope Computation for ONcology), our bioinformatic pipeline that was developed using proteomic profiling of individual HLA-I and HLA-II alleles to predict rules for peptide binding to a diverse set of such alleles. We applied these binding predictors to viral genomes from the Coronaviridae family, and specifically to identify SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes.\n\nResultsTo test the suitability of these tools to identify viral T cell epitopes, we first validated HLA-I and HLA-II predictions on Coronaviridae family epitopes deposited in the Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR) database. We then use our HLA-I and HLA-II predictors to identify 11,776 HLA-I and 7,991 HLA-II candidate binding peptides across all 12 open reading frames (ORFs) of SARS-CoV-2. This extensive list of identified candidate peptides is driven by the length of the ORFs and the significant number of HLA-I and HLA-II alleles that we are able to predict (74 and 83, respectively), providing over 99% coverage for the US, European and Asian populations, for both HLA-I and HLA-II. From our SARS-CoV-2 predicted peptide-HLA-I allele pairs, 368 pairs identically matched previously reported pairs in the ViPR database, originating from other forms of coronaviruses. 320 of these pairs (89.1%) had a positive MHC-binding assay result. This analysis reinforces the validity our predictions.\n\nConclusionsUsing this bioinformatic platform, we identify multiple putative epitopes for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells whose HLA binding properties cover nearly the entire population and thus may be effective when included in prophylactic vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 to induce broad cellular immunity.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Asaf Poran","author_inst":"Neon Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Dewi Harjanto","author_inst":"Neon Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Matthew Malloy","author_inst":"Neon Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Michael S.

We attempted to quantitatively evaluate the risk of COVID-19 infections on students caused by school reopening. Study design: We collected the data of the numbers of teachers, population size and newly confirmed COVID-19 cases in the past 14 days in typical provinces\/cities of China, and then analyzed the risk of COVID-19 infections in schools with respect to each province\/city. Methods: A step-by-step procedure was explored to calculate the probability of COVID-19 infections on students as transmitted from infected teachers. Two critical assumptions for analysis were proposed: (i) only locally generated cases were counted while imported cases were omitted; (ii) the secondary attack rate of the COVID-19 virus in schools is similar to that in households in China, ranging from 3-10%. Results: The probability of COVID-19 resurgence within one week on students of primary, middle and high schools in China (outside Hubei) is extremely low (<0.2%) in each province\/city, and such probability can be updated daily and weekly based on the newly confirmed cases in the past 14 days. In some areas without newly confirmed cases in the past 14 days, the risk is zero. Conclusions: Our work provides guidance for local governments to make risk level-based policies for school reopening.

COVID-19 is marked by its rapid progression from mild to severe conditions, particularly in the absence of adequate medical care. However, the physiological changes associated with COVID-19 are barely understood. In this study, we performed untargeted metabolomic and lipidomic analyses of plasma from a cohort of COVID-19 patients who had experienced different symptoms. We found the metabolite and lipid alterations exhibit apparent correlation with the course of disease in these COVID-19 patients, indicating that the development of COVID-19 affected patient metabolism. Moreover, many of the metabolite and lipid alterations, particularly ones associated with hepatic functions, have been found to align with the progress and severity of COVID-19. This work provides valuable knowledge about blood biomarkers associated with COVID-19 and potential therapeutic targets, and presents important resource for further studies of COVID-19 pathogenesis.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Di Wu","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Ting Shu","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Yang","author_inst":"Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jian-Xin Song","author_inst":"Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Mingliang Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Metware Biotechnology Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Chengye Yao","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Liu Wen","author_inst":"Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Muhan Huang","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Yuan Yu","author_inst":"Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Qingyu Yang","author_inst":"Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tingju Zhu","author_inst":"Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jiqian Xu","author_inst":"Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jingfang Mu","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Yaxin Wang","author_inst":"Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hong Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan Metware Biotechnology Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Tang Tang","author_inst":"Wuhan Metware Biotechnology Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Yujie Ren","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Yongran Wu","author_inst":"Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Shu-Hai Lin","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Yang Qiu","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Ding-Yu Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital"},{"author_name":"You Shang","author_inst":"Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xi Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Aviv Regev","author_inst":"MIT and Broad Inst. of MIT &  Harvard"},{"author_name":"Feng Zhang","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard; McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pathology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.04.20053363","rel_title":"EARLY DETECTION OF COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-04-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.04.20053363","rel_abs":"Since SARS-Cov-2 epidemic appeared in Wuhan China, it became challenge for health authorities to counter Covid-19 epidemic. Early evaluation of suspects, screening for Covid-19 and management posed challenge to health authorities especially in developing countries which were not ready to cope with it. Early mild symptoms appeared during course of disease provide a chance to early detect Covid-19. We use retrospective methodology to collect available data on early sign and symptoms of Covid-19 through accessing World Health Organization (WHO) webpages, New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), Nature Journal, Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA) network, British Medical Journal (BJM), Lancet and other world renowned journal publications to establish a relationship of early symptoms for detection of Covid-19. Data of 2707 Covid-19 laboratory confirmed cases was collected and analyzed for early signs. Available data was categorized into physical and blood biomarkers. This categorized data was assessed for scoring early detection of Covid-19 by scoring Hashmi-Asif Covid-19 formula. Each characteristic was given a score in Hashmi-Asif Covid-19 chart with maximum score of 28. Scoring 16 on chart means Covid-19 will fully develop in near future. Correlation of each sign and symptoms with development of Covid-19 in formula showed significant correlation assessed by Pearson correlation and Spearman Correlation coefficient (rho) showed significant correlation of development of Covid-19 with fever 64.11% (P=0.001), cough 65% and dry mucus 19.67% equally sensitive (P=0.000), leukopenia 19.06% (P=0.006), lymphopenia 52.93% (P=0.005), thrombopenia 19.1% (P=0.013), elevated Aspartate aminotransferase 12.79% (P=0.007) and elevated Alanine aminotransferase 11.34% (P=0.006).

Using the standard setup, we demonstrate that ventilating two patients with mismatched lung compliances from a single ventilator will lead to clinically-significant reductions in tidal volume in the patient with the lowest respiratory compliance. Using the modified setup, we demonstrate that it is possible to achieve the same tidal volumes in two patients with mismatched lung compliances, and we show that the tidal volume of one patient can be manipulated independently of the other. The results indicate that, with appropriate modifications, two patients could be supported from a single ventilator with independent control of tidal volumes.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jose A.

For controlling COVID-19 outbreaks, many countries have implemented two non-pharmaceutical interventions: suppression like immediate lockdowns in cities at epicentre of outbreak; or mitigation that slows down but not stopping epidemic for reducing peak healthcare demand. Both interventions have apparent pros and cons; the effectiveness of any one intervention in isolation is limited. We aimed to conduct a feasibility study for robustly estimating the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths, peaks and lengths of COVID-19 breakouts by taking multiple pharmaceutical interventions in London and the UK, accounting for reduction of healthcare demand. Methods: We developed a model to attempt to infer the impact of mitigation, suppression and multiple rolling interventions for controlling COVID-19 outbreaks in London and the UK. Our model assumed that each intervention has equivalent effect on the reproduction number R across countries and over time; where its intensity was presented by average-number contacts with susceptible individuals as infectious individuals; early immediate intensive intervention led to increased health need and social anxiety. We considered two important features: direct link between Exposed and Recovered population, and practical healthcare demand by separation of infections into mild and critical cases. Our model was fitted and calibrated with data on cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Hubei to estimate how suppression intervention impacted on the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths over time during January 2020, and April 2020. We combined the calibrated model with data on the cases of COVID-19 in London, the UK (non-London) and the UK during February 2020 and March 2020 to estimate the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths, and healthcare demand by using multiple interventions. Findings: We estimated given that multiple interventions with an intensity range from 3 to 15, one optimal strategy was to take suppression with intensity 3 in London from 23rd March for 100 days, and 3 weeks rolling intervention with intensity between 3 and 5 in non-London regions. In this scenario, the total infections and deaths in the UK were limited to 2.43 million and 33.8 thousand; the peak time of healthcare demand was due to the 65th day (April 11th), where it needs hospital beds for 25.3 thousand severe and critical cases. If we took a simultaneous 3 weeks rolling intervention with intensity between 3 and 5 in all regions of the UK, the total infections and deaths increased slightly to 2.69 million and 37 thousand; the peak time of healthcare kept the same at the 65th day, where it needs equivalent hospital beds for severe and critical cases of 25.3 thousand. But if we released high band of rolling intervention intensity to 6 or 8 and simultaneously implemented them in all regions of the UK, the COVID-19 outbreak would not end in 1 year and distribute a multi-modal mode, where the total infections and deaths in the UK possibly reached to 16.2 million and 257 thousand.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Po Yang","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Jun Qi","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Shuhao Zhang","author_inst":"Yunnan University"},{"author_name":"Gaoshan Bi","author_inst":"Yunnan University"},{"author_name":"Xulong Wang","author_inst":"Yunnan University"},{"author_name":"Yun Yang","author_inst":"Yunnan University"},{"author_name":"Bin Sheng","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Xuxin Mao","author_inst":"National Institute of Economic and Social Research"},{"author_name":"Steven E.

The model correctly classified severe patients with an accuracy of 93.5%, and was further validated using ten independent patients, seven of which were correctly classified. We identified molecular changes in the sera of COVID-19 patients implicating dysregulation of macrophage, platelet degranulation and complement system pathways, and massive metabolic suppression.
