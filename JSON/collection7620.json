The model is based on a propagation unit of time. The state of the epidemic at the end of the time unit is then related to that at the start through recurrence relationships. By propagating these relationships over the required number of time units, a projection can be made over time. The model is readily implemented on a spreadsheet and is therefore potentially widely accessible. It can serve as a useful tool for scenario planning and forecasting not just for an entire population, but also for a specific community within a population.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fook Hou Lee","author_inst":"National University of Singapore"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.041319","rel_title":"A blueprint for the implementation of a validated approach for the detection of SARS-Cov2 in clinical samples in academic facilities","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.041319","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic is expanding at an unprecedented rate. As a result, diagnostic services are stretched to their limit, and there is a clear need for the provision of additional diagnostic capacity. Academic laboratories, many of which are closed due to governmental lockdowns, may be in a position to support local screening capacity by adapting their current laboratory practices. Here, we describe the process of developing a SARS-Cov2 diagnostic workflow in a conventional academic Containment Level 2 (CL2) laboratory. Our outline includes simple SARS-Cov2 deactivation upon contact, the methods for a quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) detecting SARS-Cov2, a description of process establishment and validation, and some considerations for establishing a similar workflow elsewhere. This was achieved under challenging circumstances through the collaborative efforts of scientists, clinical staff, and diagnostic staff to mitigate to the ongoing crisis. Within 14 days, we created a validated COVID-19 diagnostics service for healthcare workers in our local hospital. The described methods are not exhaustive, but we hope may offer support to other academic groups aiming to set up something comparable in a short time frame.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sushmita Sridhar","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID)"},{"author_name":"Sally Forrest","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID)"},{"author_name":"Iain Kean","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID)"},{"author_name":"Jamie Young","author_inst":"Academic department of Medical genetics"},{"author_name":"Josefin Bartholdson Scott","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease"},{"author_name":"Mailis Maes","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID)"},{"author_name":"Joana Pereira-Dias","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID)"},{"author_name":"Surendra Parmar","author_inst":"Public Health England Diagnostic Laboratory, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Matthew Routledge","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Lucy Rivett","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Gordon Dougan","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID)"},{"author_name":"Michael Weekes","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID)"},{"author_name":"Martin Curran","author_inst":"Public Health England Diagnostic Laboratory, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Ian G.

Methods: We simulate partial unlock of social distancing for epidemics over a range of replication factor, immunity duration and seasonality factor for strategies targeting immunity thresholds using overshoot optimization. Results: Seasonality change must be taken into account as one of the steps in an easing sequence, and a two step unlock, including seasonal effects, minimizes overshoot and deaths. It may cause undershoot, which causes rebounds and assists survival of the pathogen. Conclusions: Partial easing levels, even low levels for economic relief while waiting on a vaccine, have population immunity thresholds based on the reduced replication rates and may experience overshoot as well. We further find a two step strategy remains highly sensitive to variations in case ratio, replication factor, seasonality and timing. We demonstrate a three or more step strategy is more robust, and conclude that the best possible approach minimizes deaths under a range of likely actual conditions which include public response.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robert L Shuler","author_inst":"Shuler Research (former NASA JSC)"},{"author_name":"Theodore Koukouvitis","author_inst":"Shuler Research"},{"author_name":"Dyske Suematsu","author_inst":"Shuler Research"},{"author_name":"Jamie Young","author_inst":"Academic department of Medical genetics"},{"author_name":"Josefin Bartholdson Scott","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease"},{"author_name":"Mailis Maes","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID)"},{"author_name":"Joana Pereira-Dias","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID)"},{"author_name":"Surendra Parmar","author_inst":"Public Health England Diagnostic Laboratory, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Matthew Routledge","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Lucy Rivett","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Gordon Dougan","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID)"},{"author_name":"Michael Weekes","author_inst":"Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology & Infectious Disease (CITIID)"},{"author_name":"Martin Curran","author_inst":"Public Health England Diagnostic Laboratory, Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Ian G.

The course of pandemic evolution has shown great differences among countries and not much is yet known about the level of generated immunity, which might appear not to be long-lasting. In this situation, management of a recurrent disease seems to be a plausible scenario that countries worldwide will have to face, before effective drugs or a vaccine appear. Spain in Europe, appears to be the first country deciding to partly lift the strict social distancing regulations imposed. Whether this action may lead to further epidemic recrudescence, to a following second wave of cases or conversely, help return to previous normality, is a subject of great debate and interest to all other countries affected by COVID-19. Here we applied a modified SEIR compartmental model accounting for the spread of infection during the latent period, in which we had also incorporated effects of social confinement. We now modify this previous model configuration to mimic potential post-confinement scenarios, by simulating from instant massive liberation of different portions of the confined population, up to a more gradual incorporation of people to work. Results show how current lockdown conditions should be extended at least two weeks more to prevent a new escalation in cases and deaths, as well as a larger second wave occurring in just a few months. Conversely, best-case scenario in terms of lower COVID-19 incidence and casualties should gradually incorporate workers back in a daily proportion at most 30 percent higher than that of previous confinement. The former should begin not earlier than by the end of April and it would represent approximately 600 thousand people or a 3.75% rate for the whole of Spain.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Leonardo Lopez","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Xavier Rodo","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Brian Summa","author_inst":"Tulane University"},{"author_name":"Bihe Hu","author_inst":"Tulane University"},{"author_name":"Carola Wenk","author_inst":"Tulane University"},{"author_name":"Aibek Akmatbekov","author_inst":"LSU Health Sciences Center - New Orleans"},{"author_name":"Jack L Harbert","author_inst":"LSU Health Sciences Center - New Orleans"},{"author_name":"Richard S.

Here, we describe the validation of a coronavirus antigen microarray containing immunologically significant antigens from SARS-CoV-2, in addition to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, common human coronavirus strains, and other common respiratory viruses. A comparison of antibody profiles detected on the array from control sera collected prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic versus convalescent blood specimens from virologically confirmed COVID-19 cases demonstrates near complete discrimination of these two groups, with improved performance from use of antigen combinations that include both spike protein and nucleoprotein. This array can be used as a diagnostic tool, as an epidemiologic tool to more accurately estimate the disease burden of COVID-19, and as a research tool to correlate antibody responses with clinical outcomes.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rafael R de Assis","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Aarti Jain","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Rie Nakajima","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Algis Jasinskas","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Jiin Felgner","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Joshua Miago Obiero","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Oluwasanmi Oladapo Adenaiye","author_inst":"University of Maryland"},{"author_name":"Sheldon Tai","author_inst":"University of Maryland"},{"author_name":"Filbert H Hong","author_inst":"University of Maryland"},{"author_name":"Philip Norris","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Mars Stone","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Graham Simmons","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Anil Bagri","author_inst":"Cerus Corporation"},{"author_name":"Martin Schreiber","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Andreas Buser","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"Andreas Holbro","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"Manuel Battegay","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"Philip Hosimer","author_inst":"Ortho Clinical Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Charles Noesen","author_inst":"Ortho Clinical Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Donald K Milton","author_inst":"University of Maryland School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"- Prometheus Study Group","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Huw Davies","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Paul Contestable","author_inst":"Ortho Clinical Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Laurence M Corash","author_inst":"Cerus Corporation"},{"author_name":"Michael P Busch","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Philip L Felgner","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Saahir Khan","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.13.20064519","rel_title":"Estimating the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the United States","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.13.20064519","rel_abs":"We apply a model developed by The COVID-19 Response Team [S.

We include the timing of each state's implementation of interventions including encouraging social distancing, closing schools, banning public events, and a lockdown \/ stay-at-home order. We assume fatalities are reported correctly and infer the number and timing of infections based on the infection fatality rate measured in populations that were tested universally for SARS-CoV-2. Underreporting of deaths would drive our estimates to be too low. Reporting of deaths on the wrong day could drive errors in either direction.

This gene is most well known for its role in regulating blood pressure. But in recent times, its drawn a lot of attention from the scientific community because it may also serve as a doorway of sorts, enabling viruses like SARS-CoV-2 to infect cells. Our researchers looked at the ACE2 gene in more than 200,000 people, comparing their exact DNA sequences to see where there are differences among people. Variation in the DNA sequence of a gene is common and is sometimes meaningless. But other times, small changes in the DNA sequence can alter the protein that is made from that gene. In this case the ACE2 gene makes the ACE2 protein, which is what the SARS-CoV-2 virus interacts with. We found a lot of variation between individuals and checked to see if that variation coincided with any traits (i.e., people with variant X tend to have high blood pressure more often than people without variant X). All of the traits we looked at were non-COVID-19-related traits, meaning we havent asked these people anything about COVID-19 yet (this is because these DNA sequences were collected before the pandemic).\n\nWe found that there are a number of variations observed among people in a specific part of the ACE2 gene. These variations are expected to alter the shape or functionality of a specific part of the ACE2 protein: The part that interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We dont yet know what the real-life significance of this variation is, but its possible that these variants decrease the proteins ability to interact with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, thus decreasing the persons likelihood of being infected. We can speculate that there will be a spectrum of vulnerability to COVID-19 among people, where some people are more vulnerable than others, and that variants in this part of the ACE2 gene may be one of the reasons. The research we presented here shines a light on this part of the ACE2 gene and may give future researchers a direction to go in as they try to figure out what makes people vulnerable to COVID-19 and similar viruses.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elizabeth Trilby Cirulli","author_inst":"Human Longevity, Inc."},{"author_name":"Stephen Riffle","author_inst":"Helix"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Bolze","author_inst":"Helix"},{"author_name":"Nicole L Washington","author_inst":"Helix"},{"author_name":"Jiin Felgner","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Joshua Miago Obiero","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Oluwasanmi Oladapo Adenaiye","author_inst":"University of Maryland"},{"author_name":"Sheldon Tai","author_inst":"University of Maryland"},{"author_name":"Filbert H Hong","author_inst":"University of Maryland"},{"author_name":"Philip Norris","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Mars Stone","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Graham Simmons","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Anil Bagri","author_inst":"Cerus Corporation"},{"author_name":"Martin Schreiber","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Andreas Buser","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"Andreas Holbro","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"Manuel Battegay","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"Philip Hosimer","author_inst":"Ortho Clinical Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Charles Noesen","author_inst":"Ortho Clinical Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Donald K Milton","author_inst":"University of Maryland School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"- Prometheus Study Group","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Huw Davies","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Paul Contestable","author_inst":"Ortho Clinical Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Laurence M Corash","author_inst":"Cerus Corporation"},{"author_name":"Michael P Busch","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Philip L Felgner","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Saahir Khan","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"genetics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.13.20063701","rel_title":"Initial stage of the COVID-19 infection process in human population","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.13.20063701","rel_abs":"The simplest approximation for the first stages of the infection spread is considered.

COVID-19-associated deaths are mainly attributed to severe pneumonia and respiratory failure. Recent work demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the lung. To better understand ACE2 abundance and expression patterns in the lung we interrogated our in-house single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset containing 70,085 EPCAM+ lung epithelial cells from paired normal and lung adenocarcinoma tissues. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a diverse repertoire of airway lineages that included alveolar type I and II, bronchioalveolar, club\/secretory, quiescent and proliferating basal, ciliated and malignant cells as well as rare populations such as ionocytes. While the fraction of lung epithelial cells expressing ACE2 was low (1.7% overall), alveolar type II (AT2, 2.2% ACE2+) cells exhibited highest levels of ACE2 expression among all cell subsets. Further analysis of the AT2 compartment (n = 27,235 cells) revealed a number of genes co-expressed with ACE2 that are important for lung pathobiology including those associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; HHIP), pneumonia and infection (FGG and C4BPA) as well as malarial\/bacterial (CD36) and viral (DMBT1) scavenging which, for the most part, were increased in smoker versus light or non-smoker cells. Notably, DMBT1 was highly expressed in AT2 cells relative to other lung epithelial subsets and its expression positively correlated with ACE2. We describe a population of ACE2-positive AT2 cells that co-express pathogen (including viral) receptors (e.g. DMBT1) with crucial roles in host defense thus comprising plausible phenotypic targets for treatment of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":32,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guangchun Han","author_inst":"Department of Genomic Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Ansam Sinjab","author_inst":"Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Warapen Treekitkarnmongkol","author_inst":"Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Patrick Brennan","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Kieko Hara","author_inst":"Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Kyle Chang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Elena Bogatenkova","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Beatriz Sanchez-Espiridion","author_inst":"Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Carmen Behrens","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic, Head and Neck Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Boning Gao","author_inst":"Hamon Center for Therapeutic Oncology Research, University of Texas Southwestern, Dallas, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Luc Girard","author_inst":"Hamon Center for Therapeutic Oncology Research, University of Texas Southwestern, Dallas, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Jianjun Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic, Head and Neck Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Boris Sepesi","author_inst":"Department of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Tina Cascone","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic, Head and Neck Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Lauren Byers","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic, Head and Neck Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Don L.

Rapidly increasing infections has raised intense worldwide attention. How to model the evolution of COVID-19 effectively and efficiently is of great significance for prevention and control. Methods: We propose the multi-chain Fudan-CCDC model based on the original single-chain model in [8] to describe the evolution of COVID-19 in Singapore. Multi-chains can be considered as the superposition of several single chains with different characteristics. We identify parameters of models by minimizing the penalty function. Results: The numerical simulation results exhibit the multi-chain model performs well on data fitting. Though unsteady the increments are, they could still fall within the range of 25% fluctuation from simulation results. It is predicted by multi-chain models that Singapore are experiencing a nonnegligible risk of explosive outbreak, thus stronger measures are urgently needed to contain the epidemic. Conclusion: The multi-chain Fudan-CCDC model provides an effective way to early detect the appearance of imported infectors and super spreaders and forecast a second outbreak. It can also explain the data in those countries where the single-chain model shows deviation from the data.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hanshuang Pan","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Nian Shao","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yue Yan","author_inst":"Shanghai University of Finance and Economics"},{"author_name":"Xinyue Luo","author_inst":"Shanghai University of Finance and Economics"},{"author_name":"Shufen Wang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Ling Ye","author_inst":"Daishan County Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jin Cheng","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Wenbin Chen","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Carmen Behrens","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic, Head and Neck Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Boning Gao","author_inst":"Hamon Center for Therapeutic Oncology Research, University of Texas Southwestern, Dallas, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Luc Girard","author_inst":"Hamon Center for Therapeutic Oncology Research, University of Texas Southwestern, Dallas, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Jianjun Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic, Head and Neck Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Boris Sepesi","author_inst":"Department of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Tina Cascone","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic, Head and Neck Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Lauren Byers","author_inst":"Department of Thoracic, Head and Neck Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Don L.

As the pandemic progresses, information about the modes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among humans is critical to apply appropriate infection control measures and to slow its spread. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted efficiently via direct contact and via the air (via respiratory droplets and\/or aerosols) between ferrets. Intranasal inoculation of donor ferrets resulted in a productive upper respiratory tract infection and long-term shedding, up to 11 to 19 days post-inoculation. SARS-CoV-2 transmitted to four out of four direct contact ferrets between 1 and 3 days after exposure and via the air to three out of four independent indirect recipient ferrets between 3 and 7 days after exposure. The pattern of virus shedding in the direct contact and indirect recipient ferrets was similar to that of the inoculated ferrets and infectious virus was isolated from all positive animals, showing that ferrets were productively infected via either route. This study provides experimental evidence of robust transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via the air, supporting the implementation of community-level social distancing measures currently applied in many countries in the world and informing decisions on infection control measures in healthcare settings 3.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mathilde Richard","author_inst":"ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Adinda Kok","author_inst":"ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Dennis de Meulder","author_inst":"ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Theo M.

Computed tomography (CT) has been widely used in the diagnosis of this novel pneumonia. This study aims to understand the role of CT for the diagnosis and the main imaging manifestations of patients with COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a rapid review and meta-analysis on studies about the use of chest CT for the diagnosis of COVID-19. We comprehensively searched databases and preprint servers on chest CT for patients with COVID-19 between 1 January 2020 and 31 March 2020. The primary outcome was the sensitivity of chest CT imaging. We also conducted subgroup analyses and evaluated the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Results: A total of 104 studies with 5694 patients were included. Using RT-PCR results as reference, a meta-analysis based on 64 studies estimated the sensitivity of chest CT imaging in COVID-19 was 99% (95% CI, 0.97-1.00). If case reports were excluded, the sensitivity in case series was 96% (95% CI, 0.93-0.99). The sensitivity of CT scan in confirmed patients under 18 years old was only 66% (95% CI, 0.11-1.00). The most common imaging manifestation was ground-glass opacities (GGO) which was found in 75% (95% CI, 0.68-0.82) of the patients. The pooled probability of bilateral involvement was 84% (95% CI, 0.81-0.88). The most commonly involved lobes were the right lower lobe (84%, 95% CI, 0.78-0.90) and left lower lobe (81%, 95% CI, 0.74-0.87). The quality of evidence was low across all outcomes. Conclusions: In conclusion, this meta-analysis indicated that chest CT scan had a high sensitivity in diagnosis of patients with COVID-19. Therefore, CT can potentially be used to assist in the diagnosis of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Meng Lv","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Mengshu Wang","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Nan Yang","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine; Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xufei Luo","author_inst":"School of Public Health of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou"},{"author_name":"Wei Li","author_inst":"Department of Radiology; Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xin Chen","author_inst":"Department of Radiology; Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yunlan Liu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Mengjuan Ren","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xianzhuo Zhang","author_inst":"The First School of Clinical Medicine, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Ling Wang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yanfang Ma","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Junqiang Lei","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Toshio Fukuoka","author_inst":"Emergency and Critical Care Center, the Department of General Medicine, Department of Research and Medical Education at Kurashiki Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hyeong Sik Ahn","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Myeong Soo Lee","author_inst":"Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Zhengxiu Luo","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine; Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yaolong Chen","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Enmei Liu","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine; Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jinhui Tian","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xiaohui Wang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Jerry Shay","author_inst":"Department of Cell Biology, University of Texas Southwestern, Dallas, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"John V.

As the development of a vaccine could require at least 12-18 months, and the typical timeline from hit finding to drug registration of an antiviral is >10 years, repositioning of known drugs can significantly accelerate the development and deployment of therapies for COVID-19. To identify therapeutics that can be repurposed as SARS-CoV-2 antivirals, we profiled a library of known drugs encompassing approximately 12,000 clinical-stage or FDA-approved small molecules. Here, we report the identification of 30 known drugs that inhibit viral replication. Of these, six were characterized for cellular dose-activity relationships, and showed effective concentrations likely to be commensurate with therapeutic doses in patients. These include the PIKfyve kinase inhibitor Apilimod, cysteine protease inhibitors MDL-28170, Z LVG CHN2, VBY-825, and ONO 5334, and the CCR1 antagonist MLN-3897. Since many of these molecules have advanced into the clinic, the known pharmacological and human safety profiles of these compounds will accelerate their preclinical and clinical evaluation for COVID-19 treatment.","rel_num_authors":31,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Laura Riva","author_inst":"Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute"},{"author_name":"Shuofeng Yuan","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Xin Yin","author_inst":"Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute"},{"author_name":"Laura Martin-Sancho","author_inst":"Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute"},{"author_name":"Naoko Matsunaga","author_inst":"Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Burgstaller","author_inst":"University of Vienna and Medical University of Vienna"},{"author_name":"Lars Pache","author_inst":"Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute"},{"author_name":"Paul De Jesus","author_inst":"Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute"},{"author_name":"Mitchell V.

COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) thought to have jumped species, from another mammal to humans. A pandemic caused by this virus is running rampant throughout the world. Thousands of cases of COVID-19 are reported in England and over 10,000 patients have died. Whilst there has been progress in managing this disease, it is not clear which factors, besides age, affect the severity and mortality of COVID-19. A recent analysis of COVID-19 in Italy identified links between air pollution and death rates. Here, we explored the correlation between three major air pollutants linked to fossil fuels and SARS-CoV-2 lethality in England. We compare up-to-date, real-time SARS-CoV-2 cases and death measurements from public databases to air pollution data monitored across over 120 sites in different regions. We found that the levels of some markers of poor air quality, nitrogen oxides and ozone, are associated with COVID-19 lethality in different English regions. We conclude that the levels of some air pollutants are linked to COVID-19 cases and morbidity. We suggest that our study provides a useful framework to guide health policy in countries affected by this pandemic.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marco Travaglio","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Yizhou Yu","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Rebeka Popovic","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Liza Selley","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Nuno Santos Leal","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"L.

Currently, no effective vaccine is available to prevent COVID-19 and an intense global development activity is in progress. In this context, the different technology platforms face several challenges resulting from the involvement of a new virus still not fully characterised. Finding of the right conditions for virus amplification for the development of vaccines based on inactivated or attenuated whole viral particles is among them. Here, we describe the establishment of a workflow based on shotgun tandem mass spectrometry data to guide the optimisation of the conditions for viral amplification. In parallel, we analysed the dynamic of the host cell proteome following SARS-CoV-2 infection providing a global overview of biological processes modulated by the virus and that could be further explored to identify drug targets to address the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lucia Grenga","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Fabrice Gallais","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Olivier Pible","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Jean-Charles Gaillard","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Duarte Gouveia","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Helene Batina","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Niza Bazaline","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Sylvie Ruat","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Karen Culotta","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Guylaine Miotello","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Debroas","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Marie-Anne Roncato","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Gerard Steinmetz","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Foissard","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Anne Desplan","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Beatrice Alpha-Bazin","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Christine Almunia","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Fabienne Gas","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Laurent Bellanger","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Jean Armengaud","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Lisa Miorin","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kris White","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey R Johnson","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Christopher Benner","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Ren Sun","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Peter Schultz","author_inst":"Calibr at Scripps Research"},{"author_name":"Andrew I Su","author_inst":"Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Garcia-Sastre","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Arnab Chatterjee","author_inst":"Calibr at Scripps Research"},{"author_name":"Kwok-Yung Yuen","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Sumit Chanda","author_inst":"Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute"},{"author_name":"Humam Kadara","author_inst":"Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.06.20055251","rel_title":"Relationship between COVID-19 death toll doubling time and national BCG vaccination policy","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.06.20055251","rel_abs":"In this manuscript, we showed a statistically significant difference of the doubling times of the death toll between the group of countries with national universal Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination and the group without it for recent years.

Therefore we used a doubling time of the death toll as a more stable indicator instead. We also investigated the dependency of the BCG strains. Among the 42 BCG-vaccinated countries, the median doubling time of the eight countries using \"Tokyo 172-1\" strain at least partially (Japan, Iraq, Malaysia, South Korea, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and Bangladesh) was 7.2 days, and that of the other 34 vaccinated countries was 5.5 days.

Methods: We searched Cochrane library, Medline, Embase, Web of Science, CBM, Wanfang Data and CNKI from their inception to March 31, 2020. In addition, we searched related studies on COVID-19 published before March 31, 2020 through Google Scholar. We evaluated the risk of bias of included studies, and synthesized the results using a qualitative synthesis. Results: Six studies met our inclusion criteria. Five studies on SARS showed an overall risk of death of 7.2% to 20.0%. One study of SARS patients who used macrolides, quinolones or beta lactamases showed that the mean duration of hospital stay was 14.2, 13.8 and 16.2 days, respectively, and their average duration of fever was 14.3, 14.0 and 16.2 days, respectively. One cohort study on MERS indicated that macrolide therapy was not associated with a significant reduction in 90-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.47-1.51, P = 0.56) and improvement in MERS-CoV RNA clearance (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.88, 95% CI 0.47, -1.64], P = 0.68). According to the findings of 33 studies, the proportion of antibiotics use ranged from 19.4% to 100.0% in children and 13.2% to 100.0% in adults, despite the lack of etiological evidence. The most commonly used antibiotics in adults were quinolones, cephalosporins and macrolides and in children meropenem and linezolid. Conclusions: The benefits of antibiotic agents for adults with SARS or MERS were questionable in the absence of bacterial coinfections. There is no evidence to support the use of antibiotic agents for children with COVID-19 in the absence of bacterial coinfection.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jianjian Wang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Yuyi Tang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yanfang Ma","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Qi Zhou","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Weiguo Li","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Muna Baskota","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yinmei Yang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xingmei Wang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qingyuan Li","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xufei Luo","author_inst":"School of Public Health of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou"},{"author_name":"Toshio Fukuoka","author_inst":"Emergency and Critical Care Center, the Department of General Medicine, Department of Research and Medical Education at Kurashiki Central Hospital, Japan"},{"author_name":"Hyeong Sik Ahn","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea"},{"author_name":"Myeong Soo Lee","author_inst":"Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Zhengxiu Luo","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Enmei Liu","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yaolong Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Christine Almunia","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Fabienne Gas","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Laurent Bellanger","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Jean Armengaud","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Lisa Miorin","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kris White","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey R Johnson","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Christopher Benner","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Ren Sun","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Peter Schultz","author_inst":"Calibr at Scripps Research"},{"author_name":"Andrew I Su","author_inst":"Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Garcia-Sastre","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Arnab Chatterjee","author_inst":"Calibr at Scripps Research"},{"author_name":"Kwok-Yung Yuen","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Sumit Chanda","author_inst":"Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute"},{"author_name":"Humam Kadara","author_inst":"Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pediatrics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.20064923","rel_title":"Effects of temperature and humidity on the spread of COVID-19: A systematic review.","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.20064923","rel_abs":"Background: Faced with the global pandemic of COVID-19, declared by World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11th 2020, and the need to better understand the seasonal behavior of the virus, our team conducted this systematic review to describe current knowledge about the emergence and replicability of the virus and its correlation with different weather factors such as temperature and relative humidity. Methods: The review was registered with the PROSPERO database. The electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, LILACS, OpenGrey and Google Scholar were examined with the searches restricted to the years 2019 and 2020. Risk of bias assessment was performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist tool. The GRADE tool was used to assess the quality of the evidence. Results: The initial screening identified 517 articles. After examination of the full texts, seventeen studies met the review's eligibility criteria. Great homogeneity was observed in the findings regarding the effect of temperature and humidity on the seasonal viability and transmissibility of COVID-19. Cold and dry conditions were potentiating factors on the spread of the virus. After quality assessment, four studies had a high risk of bias and thirteen studies were scored as moderate risk of bias. The certainty of evidence was graded as low for both outcomes evaluated. Conclusion: Considering the existing scientific evidence, warm and wet climates seem to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The certainty of the evidence generated was graded as low. However, these variables alone could not explain most of the variability in disease transmission.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paulo Mecenas","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Renata Bastos","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Antonio Vallinoto","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"David Normando","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Weiguo Li","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Muna Baskota","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yinmei Yang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xingmei Wang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qingyuan Li","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xufei Luo","author_inst":"School of Public Health of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou"},{"author_name":"Toshio Fukuoka","author_inst":"Emergency and Critical Care Center, the Department of General Medicine, Department of Research and Medical Education at Kurashiki Central Hospital, Japan"},{"author_name":"Hyeong Sik Ahn","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea"},{"author_name":"Myeong Soo Lee","author_inst":"Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Zhengxiu Luo","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Enmei Liu","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yaolong Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Christine Almunia","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Fabienne Gas","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Laurent Bellanger","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Jean Armengaud","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Lisa Miorin","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kris White","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey R Johnson","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Christopher Benner","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Ren Sun","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Peter Schultz","author_inst":"Calibr at Scripps Research"},{"author_name":"Andrew I Su","author_inst":"Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Garcia-Sastre","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Arnab Chatterjee","author_inst":"Calibr at Scripps Research"},{"author_name":"Kwok-Yung Yuen","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Sumit Chanda","author_inst":"Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute"},{"author_name":"Humam Kadara","author_inst":"Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.20064956","rel_title":"Multinational modeling of SARS-CoV-2 spreading dynamics: Insights on the heterogeneity of COVID-19 transmission and its potential healthcare burden","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.20064956","rel_abs":"Background: Modelling and projections of COVID-19 using a single set of transmission parameters can be an elaborated because the application of different levels of containment measures at different stages of the worldwide COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: We developed a piecewise fitting SEIR methodology to fit the progress of the COVID-19 that can be applied on any of the 185 countries listed in John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. The contagious contact rate, the rate of removal and the initially exposed population were obtained at three different stages of the pandemic for a set of 18 countries, and globally for the total number of cases worldwide. The active number of infections and the removed populations were fitted simultaneously to validate the SEIR model against the available time series reports on the number of confirmed infections, recoveries and deaths. We evaluate the effect of a reduction of contagious contact rate on the level of burden put on local healthcare infrastructure considering different levels of intervention. As a guideline for future public health interventions, we also estimated the maximum number of future cases and its potential peak date. Findings: We project that the peak in the number of infections worldwide will take place after the third quarter of 2020 with a decline rate that might extend beyond 2020. For 12 out of the 18 countries analyzed, we observe that, following the trend at the date of this study, the number of severe infections will surpass their healthcare capacity. For a 90% reduction scenario of the contagious contact rate, four out of the 18 countries analyzed will undergo a significant delay in the peak of infection, extending the course of the epidemic further than our simulation window (365 days). Interpretation: We identify three stages for the COVID-19 transmission dynamics, which suggest that it is highly heterogeneous between countries and its contagious contact rate, is currently affected by both local responses of the public health interventions and to the population's adherence to the measures.

When a system is continuously changing over time (e.g., infectious diseases)differential equations, which may include parameters, are used for modeling the system. The process of finding those parameters that best fit the given data from the system is called an inverse problem. This study aims at analyzing the novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) spread in South Korea using the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model. We collect the data from Korea Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (KCDC). We assume that each parameter in the SIR model is a function of time so that we can compute important parameters, such as the basic reproduction number (R0), more delicately. Using neural networks, we propose a method to find the best time-varying parameters and the solution for the model simultaneously. Moreover, using time-dependent parameters, we find that traditional numerical algorithms, such as the Runge-Kutta methods, can successfully approximate the SIR model while fitting the COVID-19 data, thus modeling the propagation patterns of COVID-19 more precisely.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hyeontae Jo","author_inst":"POSTECH"},{"author_name":"Hwijae Son","author_inst":"POSTECH"},{"author_name":"Se Young Jung","author_inst":"Seoul National University Bundang Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hyung Ju Hwang","author_inst":"POSTECH"},{"author_name":"Weiguo Li","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Muna Baskota","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yinmei Yang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xingmei Wang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qingyuan Li","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xufei Luo","author_inst":"School of Public Health of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou"},{"author_name":"Toshio Fukuoka","author_inst":"Emergency and Critical Care Center, the Department of General Medicine, Department of Research and Medical Education at Kurashiki Central Hospital, Japan"},{"author_name":"Hyeong Sik Ahn","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea"},{"author_name":"Myeong Soo Lee","author_inst":"Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Zhengxiu Luo","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Enmei Liu","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yaolong Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Christine Almunia","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Fabienne Gas","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Laurent Bellanger","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Jean Armengaud","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Lisa Miorin","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kris White","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey R Johnson","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Christopher Benner","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Ren Sun","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Peter Schultz","author_inst":"Calibr at Scripps Research"},{"author_name":"Andrew I Su","author_inst":"Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Garcia-Sastre","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Arnab Chatterjee","author_inst":"Calibr at Scripps Research"},{"author_name":"Kwok-Yung Yuen","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Sumit Chanda","author_inst":"Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute"},{"author_name":"Humam Kadara","author_inst":"Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.20065375","rel_title":"Informing Homemade Emergency Facemask Design: The Ability of Common Fabrics to Filter Ultrafine Particles","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.20065375","rel_abs":"Objectives: We examined the ability of fabrics which might be used to create homemade face masks to filter out ultrafine (0.1m and smaller in diameter) particles at the velocity of adult human coughing. Method: Twenty commonly available fabrics and materials were evaluated for their ability to reduce air concentrations of ultrafine particles at a face velocity of 16.5 m\/s. Further assessment was made on the filtration ability of select fabrics while damp and of fabric combinations which might be used to construct homemade masks. Results: Single fabric layers blocked a range of ultrafine particles. When fabrics were layered, significantly more ultrafine particles were filtered. Nonwoven fusible interfacing significantly increased filtration. Conclusions: The current coronavirus pandemic has left many communities without access N95 facemasks. Our findings suggest that face masks made from layered common fabric can help filter ultrafine particles and provide some protection for the wearer when commercial facemasks are unavailable.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eugenia O'Kelly","author_inst":"Cambridge University"},{"author_name":"Sophia Pirog","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"James Ward","author_inst":"Cambridge University"},{"author_name":"P John Clarkson","author_inst":"Cambridge University"},{"author_name":"Weiguo Li","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Muna Baskota","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yinmei Yang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xingmei Wang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qingyuan Li","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xufei Luo","author_inst":"School of Public Health of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou"},{"author_name":"Toshio Fukuoka","author_inst":"Emergency and Critical Care Center, the Department of General Medicine, Department of Research and Medical Education at Kurashiki Central Hospital, Japan"},{"author_name":"Hyeong Sik Ahn","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea"},{"author_name":"Myeong Soo Lee","author_inst":"Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Zhengxiu Luo","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Enmei Liu","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yaolong Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Christine Almunia","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Fabienne Gas","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Laurent Bellanger","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Jean Armengaud","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Lisa Miorin","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kris White","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey R Johnson","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Christopher Benner","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Ren Sun","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Peter Schultz","author_inst":"Calibr at Scripps Research"},{"author_name":"Andrew I Su","author_inst":"Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Garcia-Sastre","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Arnab Chatterjee","author_inst":"Calibr at Scripps Research"},{"author_name":"Kwok-Yung Yuen","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Sumit Chanda","author_inst":"Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute"},{"author_name":"Humam Kadara","author_inst":"Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.20065607","rel_title":"Applying the SEIR Model in Forecasting The COVID-19 Trend in Malaysia: A Preliminary Study","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.20065607","rel_abs":"On March 18, 2020 the Malaysian government implemented a 14-day Movement Control Order (MCO) as part of the mitigation plan in controlling the COVID-19 epidemic in the country.

A rapidly progressing epidemic of COVID-19 ensued within China, with multiple exportations to other countries. We aimed to measure perceptions and responses towards COVID-19 in three countries to understand how population-level anxiety can be mitigated in the early phases of a pandemic. Methods Between February and March 2020, we conducted online surveys in Singapore, China and Italy with a total of 4,505 respondents to measure knowledge, perceptions, anxiety and behaviours towards the COVID-19 epidemic, and identified factors associated with lower anxiety and more positive behavioural responses. Findings Respondents reported high awareness of COVID-19 and its accompanying symptoms, comparable information seeking habits and similarly high levels of information sufficiency, adherence to and acceptance of public health control measures. Higher self-efficacy was associated with lower anxiety levels in all three countries, while willingness to comply with restrictive measures and greater information sufficiency were associated with more positive behavioural changes to reduce spread of infection. Interpretation Population-level anxiety and behavioural responses to an outbreak can be influenced by information provided. This should be used to inform future outbreak preparedness plans, taking into account the importance of increasing population-level self-efficacy and information sufficiency to reduce anxiety and promote positive behavioural changes.

This study aims to identify and evaluate the forms of supportive care for patients with respiratory diseases. Methods: An umbrella review of supportive care for patient respiratory diseases was undertaken. We comprehensively searched the following databases: Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), Wanfang Data and CBM (SinoMed) from their inception to 31 March 2020, and other sources to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses related to supportive treatments for patient with respiratory diseases including COVID-19, SARS, MERS and influenza. We assessed the methodological quality using the AMSTAR score and the quality of the evidence for the primary outcomes of each included systematic review and meta-analysis. Results: We included 18 systematic reviews and meta-analyses in this study. Most studies focused on the respiratory and circulatory support. Ten studies were of high methodological quality, five studies of medium quality, and three studies of low quality. According to four studies extracorporeal membrane oxygenation did not reduce mortality in adults (OR\/RR ranging from 0.71 to 1.28), but two studies reported significantly lower mortality in patients receiving venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation than in the control group (OR\/RR ranging from 0.38 to 0.73). Besides, monitoring of vital signs and increasing the number of medical staff may also reduce the mortality in patients with respiratory diseases. Conclusions: Our overview suggests that supportive care may reduce the mortality of patients with respiratory diseases to some extent. However, the quality of evidence for the primary outcomes in the included studies was low to moderate. Further systematic reviews and meta-analyses are needed to address the evidence gap regarding the supportive care for SARS, MERS and COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xufei Luo Sr.","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Meng Lv Jr.","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqing Wang Jr.","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xin Long Jr.","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Mengjuan Ren Jr.","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xianzhuo Zhang Sr.","author_inst":"The First School of Clinical Medicine, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yunlan Liu Jr.","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Weiguo Li Sr.","author_inst":"Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics"},{"author_name":"Qi Zhou Jr.","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yanfang Ma Jr.","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Toshio Fukuoka Sr.","author_inst":"Emergency and Critical Care Center, the Department of General Medicine, Department of Research and Medical Education at Kurashiki Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hyeong Sik Ahn Jr.","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Myeong Soo Lee Sr.","author_inst":"Korea Cochrane Centre, Korea"},{"author_name":"Zhengxiu Luo Sr.","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Childrens Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Enmei Liu Sr.","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Childrens Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xiaohui Wang Jr.","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yaolong Chen Sr.","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Fabienne Gas","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Laurent Bellanger","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Jean Armengaud","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Lisa Miorin","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kris White","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey R Johnson","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Christopher Benner","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Ren Sun","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Peter Schultz","author_inst":"Calibr at Scripps Research"},{"author_name":"Andrew I Su","author_inst":"Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Garcia-Sastre","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Arnab Chatterjee","author_inst":"Calibr at Scripps Research"},{"author_name":"Kwok-Yung Yuen","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Sumit Chanda","author_inst":"Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute"},{"author_name":"Humam Kadara","author_inst":"Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.20065094","rel_title":"Rapid Open Development and Clinical Validation of Multiple New 3D-Printed Nasopharyngeal Swabs in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.20065094","rel_abs":"Abstract The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused a severe international shortage of the nasopharyngeal swabs that are required for collection of optimal specimens, creating a critical bottleneck in the way of high-sensitivity virological testing for COVID-19. To address this crisis, we designed and executed an innovative, radically cooperative, rapid-response translational-research program that brought together healthcare workers, manufacturers, and scientists to emergently develop and clinically validate new swabs for immediate mass production by 3D printing. We performed a rigorous multi-step preclinical evaluation on 160 swab designs and 48 materials from 24 companies, laboratories, and individuals, and shared results and other feedback via a public data repository (http:\/\/github.com\/rarnaout\/Covidswab\/). We validated four prototypes through an institutional review board (IRB)-approved clinical trial that involved 276 outpatient volunteers who presented to our hospital's drive-through testing center with symptoms suspicious for COVID-19. Each participant was swabbed with a reference swab (the control) and a prototype, and SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results were compared. All prototypes displayed excellent concordance with the control ({kappa}=0.85-0.89). Cycle-threshold (Ct) values were not significantly different between each prototype and the control, supporting the new swabs' non-inferiority (Mann-Whitney U [MWU] p>0.05). Study staff preferred one of the prototypes over the others and the control swab overall. The total time elapsed between identification of the problem and validation of the first prototype was 22 days. The swabs are available to order (http:\/\/printedswabs.org). Our experience holds lessons for the rapid development, validation, and deployment of new technology for this pandemic and beyond.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cody J Callahan","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Rose Lee","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kate Zulauf","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Lauren Tamburello","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Keneth P Smith","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Joe Previtera","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Annie Cheng","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Alex Green","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Havard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Ahmed Abdul Azim","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Amanda Yano","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Nancy Doraiswami","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"James Kirby","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Ramy Arnaout","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Zhengxiu Luo Sr.","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Childrens Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Enmei Liu Sr.","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Childrens Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xiaohui Wang Jr.","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yaolong Chen Sr.","author_inst":"Evidence-based Medicine Center, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Fabienne Gas","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Laurent Bellanger","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Jean Armengaud","author_inst":"CEA"},{"author_name":"Lisa Miorin","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kris White","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey R Johnson","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Christopher Benner","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Ren Sun","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Peter Schultz","author_inst":"Calibr at Scripps Research"},{"author_name":"Andrew I Su","author_inst":"Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Garcia-Sastre","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Arnab Chatterjee","author_inst":"Calibr at Scripps Research"},{"author_name":"Kwok-Yung Yuen","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Sumit Chanda","author_inst":"Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute"},{"author_name":"Humam Kadara","author_inst":"Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.20064808","rel_title":"Coronavirus PPE: a positive pressure hood assembled from ubiquitous,low-cost materials","rel_date":"2020-04-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.20064808","rel_abs":"A positive pressure protective hood system was purposefully constructed only from materials commonly found worldwide, including bendable aluminum mesh, elastic head straps, velcro tape, a plastic sheet, a furnace filter and two computer central processing unit (CPU) cooling fans.

An experiment with identical fire detectors showed adequate inner isolation of the hood prototype from paper combustion particulates, which have a size range slightly smaller than putative coronavirus aerosols, for at least 90 seconds. The theoretical advantages of this system include significant reduction in healthcare provider exposure to coronavirus-containing respiratory fomites, respiratory droplets and aerosols (vs. traditional static masks and shields) during high risk procedures such as endotracheal intubation or routine care of an upright and coughing patient.

As with any public health emergency, a major component of the global response is timely, effective science. However, particular factors specific to COVID-19 must be overcome to ensure that research efforts are optimised. We aimed to model the impact of COVID-19 on the clinical academic response in the UK, and to provide recommendations for COVID-related research. Methods: We constructed a simple stochastic model to determine clinical academic capacity in the UK in four policy approaches to COVID-19 with differing population infection rates: Italy model (6%), mitigation (10%), relaxed mitigation (40%) and do-nothing (80%) scenarios. The ability to conduct research in the COVID-19 climate is affected by the following key factors: (i) infection growth rate and population infection rate (from UK COVID-19 statistics and WHO); (ii) strain on the healthcare system (from published model); and (iii) availability of clinical academic staff with appropriate skillsets affected by frontline clinical activity and sickness (from UK statistics). Findings: In Italy model, mitigation, relaxed mitigation and do-nothing scenarios, from 5 March 2020 the duration (days) and peak infection rates (%) are 95(2.4%), 115(2.5%), 240(5.3%) and 240(16.7%) respectively. Near complete attrition of academia (87% reduction, less than 400 clinical academics) occurs 35 days after pandemic start for 11, 34, 62, 76 days respectively, with no clinical academics at all for 37 days in the do-nothing scenario. Restoration of normal academic workforce (80% of normal capacity) takes 11,12, 30 and 26 weeks respectively. Interpretation: Pandemic COVID-19 crushes the science needed at system level. National policies mitigate, but the academic community needs to adapt. We highlight six key strategies: radical prioritisation (eg 3-4 research ideas per institution), deep resourcing, non-standard leadership (repurposing of key non-frontline teams), rationalisation (profoundly simple approaches), careful site selection (eg protected sites with large academic backup) and complete suspension of academic competition with collaborative approaches.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amitava Banerjee","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Michail Katsoulis","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Alvina G Lai","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Laura Pasea","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Thomas A Treibel","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Manisty","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Spiros Denaxas","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Quarta","author_inst":"Ospedale Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Harry Hemingway","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Joao Cavalcante","author_inst":"Minneapolis Heart Institute, Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Firstly, a high number of patients require hospital admission. Second, a high number of healthcare staff are either falling ill with the infection, or self-isolating. This poses significant problems for the staffing of busy hospital departments. We have created a simple model which allows users to stress test their rota. The model provides plots of staff availability over time using either a constant infection rate, or a changing infection rate fitted to population-based infection curves. It allows users to gauge the extent and timing of dips in staff availability. The basic constant infection rate model is available within an on-line web application (https:\/\/covid19.shef.ac.uk). As for any model, our work is imperfect. However, it allows a range of infection rates to be simulated quickly across different work patterns. We hope it will be useful to those planning staff deployment and will stimulate debate on the most effective patterns of work during the COVID-19 epidemic.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chloe N Schooling","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Norbert Gyenge","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Visakan Kadirkamanathan","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"James J.P.
