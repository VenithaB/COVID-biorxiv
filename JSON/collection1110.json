Methods A matched cohort analysis of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. The impact of CP treatment on all cause in-hospital mortality was evaluated using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional-hazards models, and the impact of CP treatment on the time to hospital discharge was assessed using a stratified log-rank analysis. Results 64 patients who received CP a median of 7 days after symptom onset were compared to a matched control group of 177 patients. Overall in-hospital mortality was 14.9%. There was no significant difference in the risk of in-hospital mortality between the two groups (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.39 - 2.20). There was also no significant difference in the overall rate of hospital discharge (rate ratio [RR} 1.28, 95% CI 0.91 - 1.81), but a subgroup analysis of patients 65-years-old or greater who received CP demonstrated a significantly increased hospital discharge rate among these patients (RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.03 - 3.36). There was a greater than expected frequency of transfusion reactions in the CP group (2.8% reaction rate observed per unit transfused). Conclusions The use of CP in this study was a safe treatment for COVID-19. There was no overall significant reduction of in-hospital mortality or increased rate of hospital discharge associated with the use of CP in this study, although there was a signal for improved outcomes among the elderly. Further adequately powered randomized studies should target this subgroup when assessing the efficacy CP treatment.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ralph Rogers","author_inst":"Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University"},{"author_name":"Fadi Shehadeh","author_inst":"Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University"},{"author_name":"Evangelia Mylona","author_inst":"Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University"},{"author_name":"Josiah Rich","author_inst":"Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University"},{"author_name":"Marguerite Neill","author_inst":"Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University"},{"author_name":"Francine Touzard-Romo","author_inst":"Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University"},{"author_name":"Sara Geffert","author_inst":"Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University"},{"author_name":"Jerome Larkin","author_inst":"Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey A Bailey","author_inst":"Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University"},{"author_name":"Shaolei Lu","author_inst":"Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University"},{"author_name":"Joseph Sweeney","author_inst":"Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University"},{"author_name":"Eleftherios Mylonakis","author_inst":"Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.18.20177303","rel_title":"Role of IgM and IgA Antibodies to the Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-08-21","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.18.20177303","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 has infected millions of people and is on a trajectory to kill more than one million globally. Virus entry depends on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. Although previous studies demonstrated anti-spike and -RBD antibodies as essential for protection and convalescent plasma as a promising therapeutic option, little is known about the immunoglobulin (Ig) isotypes capable of blocking virus entry. Here, we studied spike- and RBD-specific Ig isotypes in plasma\/sera from two acutely infected and 29 convalescent individuals. Spike- and RBD-specific IgM, IgG1, and IgA1 antibodies were produced by all or nearly all subjects at varying levels and detected at 7-8 days post-disease onset. IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, and IgA2 were also present but at much lower levels. All samples also displayed neutralizing activity. IgM, IgG, and IgA were capable of mediating neutralization, but neutralization titers correlated better with binding levels of IgM and IgA1 than IgG.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"J\u00e9romine Klingler","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY U.S.A."},{"author_name":"Svenja Weiss","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY U.S.A."},{"author_name":"Vincenza Itri","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY U.S.A."},{"author_name":"Xiaomei Liu","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY U.S.A."},{"author_name":"Kasopefoluwa Y.

Making these decisions needs a comprehensive understanding about the dynamics by which the disease spreads. In this work, we propose an epidemic agent-based model that simulates the spread of the disease. We show that the model is able to generate an important aspect of the pandemic: multiple waves of infection. A key point in the model description is the aspect of 'fear' which can govern how agents behave under different conditions. We also show that the model provides an appropriate test-bed to apply different containment strategies and this work presents the results of applying two such strategies: testing, contact tracing, and travel restriction. The results show that while both strategies could result in flattening the epidemic curve and significantly reduce the maximum number of infected individuals; testing should be applied along with tracing previous contacts of the tested individuals to be effective. The results show how the curve is flattened with testing partnered with contact tracing, and the imposition of travel restrictions.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amirarsalan Rajabi","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science, University of Central Florida"},{"author_name":"Alexander V.

Design: Parametric and non-parametric correlation coefficients are calculated to quantify the relationship between humidity and influenza, using five years of weekly data. Bayesian spatio-temporal models-with a Poisson and a Gaussian likelihood-are estimated to find the relationship between regional humidity and the daily cases of SARS-CoV-2 in the municipalities and provinces of the Netherlands. Results: An inverse (negative) relationship is observed between specific humidity and the incidence of influenza between 2015 and 2019. The space-time analysis indicates that an increase of specific humidity of one gram of water vapor per kilogram of air (1 g\/kg) is related to a reduction of approximately 5% in the risk of COVID-19 infections. Conclusion: The increase in humidity during the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 in the Netherlands helped to reduce the risk of regional COVID-19 infections. Public policies that promote higher levels of specific humidification-above 6 g\/Kg-can lead to significant reductions in the spread of respiratory viruses, such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Edsard Ravelli","author_inst":"Ravelli Management"},{"author_name":"Rolando Gonzales Martinez","author_inst":"Universitetet i Agder"},{"author_name":"Ece C.

Data were from the UCL COVID 19 Social Study; a panel study collecting data weekly during the COVID 19 pandemic. The analytical sample consisted of 55,204 adults living in the UK who were followed up for the strict 11 week lockdown period from 21st March to 31st May 2020. Data were analyzed using fixed effects and Arellano Bond models. We found that changes in time spent on a range of activities were associated with changes in mental health and wellbeing. After controlling for bidirectionality, behaviors involving outdoor activities including gardening and exercising predicted subsequent improvements in mental health and wellbeing, while increased time spent on following news about COVID 19 predicted declines in mental health and wellbeing. These results are relevant to the formulation of guidance for people obliged to spend extended periods in isolation during health emergencies, and may help the public to maintain wellbeing during future pandemics.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Feifei Bu","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Andrew Steptoe","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Hei Wan Mak","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Daisy Fancourt","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Tak-Shing T.

There is an urgent unmet need to provide an easy-to-produce, affordable medicine to prevent transmission and provide early treatment for this disease. The nasal cavity and the rhinopharynx are the sites of initial replication of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, a nasal spray may be a suitable dosage form for this purpose. The main objective of our study was to test the antiviral action of three candidate nasal spray formulations against SARS-CoV-2. We have found that iota-carrageenan in concentrations as low as 6 {micro}g\/ mL inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero cell cultures. The concentrations found to be active in vitro against SARS-CoV-2 may be easily achieved by the application of nasal sprays already marketed in several countries. Xylitol at a concentration of 5 % m\/V has proved to be viricidal on its own and the association with iota-carrageenan may be beneficial, as well.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julio Cesar Vega","author_inst":"Amcyte Pharma Inc."},{"author_name":"Shruti Bansal","author_inst":"Regional Biocontainment laboratory, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee, United States of America"},{"author_name":"Colleen B.

This problem arises since COVID 19 symptoms resemble with other cases. One of the golden standards is by examining the lung using the chest X ray radiograph (CXR). Currently there is growing COVID 19 cases followed by the CXR images waiting to be analyzed and this may outnumber the health capacity. Learning from that current situation and to fulfill the demand for CXRs analysis, a novel solution is required. The tool is expected can detect and distinguish the COVID 19 case lung rely on CXR. Respectively, this study aims to propose the use of AI and machine learning aided tool to distinguish the COVID 19 and non COVID 19 cases based on the CXR lung image. The compared non COVID 19 CXR cases in this study include normal (healthy), influenza A, tuberculosis, and active smoker. The results confirm that the machine learning tool is able to distinguish the COVID 19 CXR lungs based on lung consolidation. Moreover, the tool is also able to recognize an abnormality of COVID 19 lung in the form of patchy ground glass opacity.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrio Adwibowo","author_inst":"University of Indonesia"},{"author_name":"Shruti Bansal","author_inst":"Regional Biocontainment laboratory, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee, United States of America"},{"author_name":"Colleen B.

Multiple vaccine candidates are under development, but no vaccine is currently available. Methods: Healthy adults 18-55 and 65-85 years of age were randomized in an ongoing, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded dose-escalation study to receive 2 doses at 21-day intervals of placebo or either of 2 lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine candidates: BNT162b1, which encodes a secreted trimerized SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain, or BNT162b2, which encodes a prefusion stabilized membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike. In each of 13 groups of 15 participants, 12 received vaccine and 3 received placebo. Groups were distinguished by vaccine candidate, age of participant, and vaccine dose level. Interim safety and immunogenicity data of BNT162b1 in younger adults have been reported previously from US and German trials. We now present additional safety and immunogenicity data from the US Phase 1 trial that supported selection of the vaccine candidate advanced to a pivotal Phase 2\/3 safety and efficacy evaluation. Results: In both younger and older adults, the 2 vaccine candidates elicited similar dose-dependent SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing geometric mean titers (GMTs), comparable to or higher than the GMT of a panel of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent sera. BNT162b2 was associated with less systemic reactogenicity, particularly in older adults. Conclusion: These results support selection of the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate for Phase 2\/3 large-scale safety and efficacy evaluation, currently underway.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Edward E.

Objective. To quantify national and sub-national effect sizes of NPIs in the US. Design. This is an observational study for which we obtained daily county level COVID-19 cases and deaths from January 22, 2020 through the phased removal of social distancing protections. A stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial (SW-CRT) analytical approach is used, leveraging the phased implementation of policies. Data include 3142 counties from all 50 US states and the District of Columbia. Exposures. County-level NPIs were obtained from online county and state policy databases, then classified into four intervention levels: Level 1 (low), declaration of a State of Emergency; Level 2 (moderate), school closures, restricting nursing home access, or closing restaurants and bars; Level 3 (high), non-essential business closures, suspending non-violent arrests, suspending elective medical procedures, suspending evictions, or restricting mass gatherings of at least 10 people; and Level 4 (aggressive). sheltering in place \/ stay-at-home, public mask requirements, or travel restrictions. Additional county-level data were obtained to record racial (Black, Hispanic), economic (educational level, poverty), demographic (rural\/urban) and climate factors (temperature, specific humidity, solar radiation). Main Outcomes. The primary outcomes are rates of COVID-19 cases, deaths and case doubling times. NPI effects are measured separately for nine US Census Region (Pacific, Mountain, West North Central, East North Central, West South Central, East South Central, South Atlantic, Middle Atlantic, New England). Results. Aggressive NPIs (level 4) significantly reduced COVID-19 case and death rates in all US Census Regions, with effect sizes ranging from 4.1% to 25.7% and 5.5% to 25.5%, respectively, for each day they were active. No other intervention level achieved significance across all US Regions. Intervention levels 3 and 4 both increased COVID-19 doubling times, with effects peaking at 25 and 40 days after initiation of each policy, respectively. The effectiveness of level 3 NPIs varied, reducing case rates in all regions except North Central states, but associated with significantly higher death rates in all regions except Pacific states. Intervention levels 1 and 2 did not indicate any effect on COVID-19 propagation and, in some regions, these interventions were associated with increased COVID-19 cases and deaths. Heterogeneity of NPI effects are associated with racial composition, poverty, urban-rural environment, and climate factors. Conclusion. Aggressive NPIs are effective tools to reduce COVID-19 propagation and mortality. Reducing social and environmental disparities may improve NPI effects in regions where less strict policies are in place.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"William Pan","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Stefanos Tyrovolas","author_inst":"Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de Deu, Universitat de Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Iago Gine Vazquez","author_inst":"Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de Deu, Universitat de Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Rishav Raj","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Daniel Fernandez","author_inst":"Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Salud Mental, CIBERSAM"},{"author_name":"Ben Zaitchik","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Paul Lantos","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Christopher W.

Understanding the relationship between short- and long-term exposure to air pollution and adverse COVID-19 health outcomes is crucial for developing solutions to this global crisis. Objectives: To conduct a scoping review of epidemiologic research on the link between short- and long-term exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 health outcomes. Method: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane, MedRxiv, and BioRxiv for preliminary epidemiological studies of the association between air pollution and COVID-19 health outcomes. 28 papers were finally selected after applying our inclusion\/exclusion criteria; we categorized these studies as long-term studies, short-term time-series studies, or short-term cross-sectional studies. One study included both short-term time-series and a cross-sectional study design. Results: 27 studies of the 28 reported evidence of statistically significant positive associations between air pollutant exposure and adverse COVID-19 health outcomes; 11 of 12 long-term studies and all 16 short-term studies reported statistically significant positive associations. The 28 identified studies included various confounders, spatial and temporal resolutions of pollution concentrations, and COVID-19 health outcomes. Discussion: We discuss methodological challenges and highlight additional research areas based on our findings. Challenges include data quality issues, ecological study design limitations, improved adjustment for confounders, exposure errors related to spatial resolution, geographic variability in testing, mitigation measures and pandemic stage, clustering of health outcomes, and a lack of publicly available data and code.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anushka Bhaskar","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Jay Chandra","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Danielle Braun","author_inst":"Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline Cellini","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Francesca Dominici","author_inst":"Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Ben Zaitchik","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Paul Lantos","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Christopher W.

This version improves the functionality of the software, including an easy way to determine the potential biological features affected by the candidates found. The quadruplex definitions of the algorithm were optimized for 2019-nCoV. Using a lax quadruplex definition ruleset, which accepts amongst other parameters two residue G- and C-tracks, hundreds of potential quadruplex candidates were discovered. These sequences were evaluated by their in vitro formation probability, their position in the viral RNA, their uniqueness and their conservation rates (calculated in over three thousand different COVID-19 clinical cases and sequenced at different times and locations during the ongoing pandemic). These results were compared sequentially to other Coronaviridae members, other Group IV (+)ssRNA viruses and the entire realm. Sequences found in common with other species were further analyzed and characterized. Sequences with high scores unique to the 2019-nCoV were studied to investigate the variations amongst similar species. Quadruplex formation of the best candidates was then confirmed experimentally. Using NMR and CD spectroscopy, we found several highly stable RNA quadruplexes that may be suitable theranostic targets against the 2019-nCoV.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=151 SRC=\"FIGDIR\/small\/257493v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (50K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ab4843org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@152ebeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@afd7aforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@793707_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Efres Belmonte Reche","author_inst":"Advanced (magnetic) Theranostic Nanostructures Lab, INL-International Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory, Av.

We identify 209 unique HLA-II-bound peptide sequences, many forming nested sets, which map to sites throughout S including glycosylated regions. Comparison of the glycosylation profile of the S protein to that of the HLA-II-bound S peptides revealed substantial trimming of glycan residues on the latter, likely introduced during antigen processing.

Appropriate animal models are essential for testing of vaccines and therapeutics and for mechanistic studies of infection and the host response. The Spike (S) protein of SARS-COV-2 has a high affinity for the human ACE2 receptor, which is expressed on multiple cell types including alveolar epithelial and vascular endothelial cells. Wild-type mice are not susceptible to developing coronavirus-mediated diseases. Accordingly, several human (h)ACE2 transgenic mouse models have been developed for coronavirus research. However, these mice have failed to closely mimic important aspects of the human immunopathological responses to SARS-CoV-2. We report herein that DRAGA (HLA-A2.HLA-DR4.Rag1KO.IL-2R{gamma}c KO.NOD) mice infused with human hematopoietic stem cells from cord blood reconstitute a fully functional human immune system, as well as engraft human epithelial and endothelial cells, sustain SARS-CoV-2 infection, and develop severe COVID-19-like symptoms. In pilot experiments, infected mice developed parenchymal and epithelial lung infiltrations with granzyme B+ and perforin+ CD8+ T cells and alveolar CD61+ microthrombi, mimicking human immunopathological responses to SARS-CoV-2. We propose the DRAGA mouse as a novel pre-clinical tool for studying COVID-19 immunopathology and human immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, including events leading to the cytokine storm and coagulopathies, as well as for testing of candidate vaccines and therapeutics.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Teodor-Doru Brumeanu","author_inst":"Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Department of Medicine, Bethesda, MD 20814, U.S.A."},{"author_name":"Pooja Vir","author_inst":"Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Department of Medicine, Bethesda, MD 20814, U.S.A."},{"author_name":"Soumya Shashikumar","author_inst":"Naval Medical Research Center\/Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Infectious Diseases Directorate, Silver Spring, MD 20910, U.S.A."},{"author_name":"Ahmad Faisal Karim","author_inst":"Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Department of Medicine, Bethesda, MD 20814, U.S.A."},{"author_name":"Swagata Kar","author_inst":"Bioqual Inc., Rockville, MD 20852, U.S.A."},{"author_name":"Kevin K.

Our assay measures both recombinant NP and endogenous NP from viral lysates and tissue culture supernatants (TCS) in a sandwich-based format using two monoclonal antibodies against the NP analyte. Viral NP was detected and quantified in both tissue culture supernatants and cell lysates, with large differences observed between 24 hours and 48 hours of infection. We simulated the viral infection by spiking in recombinant NP into 384-well plates with live Vero-E6 cells and were able to detect the NP with high sensitivity and a large dynamic range. Anti-viral agents that inhibit either viral cell entry or replication will decrease the AlphaLISA NP signal. Thus, this assay can be used for high-throughput screening of small molecules and biologics in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kirill Gorshkov","author_inst":"National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences"},{"author_name":"Catherine Z Chen","author_inst":"National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NIH"},{"author_name":"Juan Carlos de la Torre","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis Z Martinez-Sobrido","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Thomas Moran","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine, Mt.

The genetic dynamics of quasispecies afford RNA viruses a great fitness on cell tropism and host range. However, no quasispecies data of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported yet. To explore quasispecies haplotypes and its transmission characteristics, we carried out single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing of the full-length of SARS-CoV-2 spike gene within 14 RNA samples from 2 infection clusters, covering first-to third-generation infected-patients. We observed a special quasispecies structure of SARS-CoV-2 (modeled as  One-King): one dominant haplotype (mean abundance ~70.15%) followed by numerous minor haplotypes (mean abundance < 0.10%). We not only discovered a novel dominant haplotype of F1040 but also realized that minor quasispecies were also worthy of attention. Notably, some minor haplotypes (like F1040 and currently pandemic one G614) could potentially reveal adaptive and converse into the dominant one. However, minor haplotypes exhibited a high transmission bottleneck (~6% could be stably transmitted), and the new adaptive\/dominant haplotypes were likely originated from genetic variations within a host rather than transmission. The evolutionary rate was estimated as 2.68-3.86 x 10-3 per site per year, which was larger than the estimation at consensus genome level. The  One-King model and conversion event expanded our understanding of the genetic dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, and explained the incomprehensible phenomenon at the consensus genome level, such as limited cumulative mutations and low evolutionary rate. Moreover, our findings suggested the epidemic strains may be multi-host origin and future traceability would face huge difficulties.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fengming Sun","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University)"},{"author_name":"Xiuhua Wang","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University)"},{"author_name":"Shun Tan","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Chongqing Public Health Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yunjie Dan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University)"},{"author_name":"Yanqiu Lu","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Chongqing Public Health Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Juan Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University)"},{"author_name":"Junli Xu","author_inst":"Beijing Novogene Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Zhaoxia Tan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University)"},{"author_name":"Xiaomei Xiang","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University)"},{"author_name":"Yi Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University)"},{"author_name":"Weiwei He","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University)"},{"author_name":"Xing Wan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University)"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University)"},{"author_name":"Yaokai Chen","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Chongqing Public Health Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Wenting Tan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University)"},{"author_name":"Guohong Deng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University)"},{"author_name":"Pei-Yong Shi","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"\u00d6zlem T\u00fcreci","author_inst":"BioNTech"},{"author_name":"Kristin R Thompkins","author_inst":"Vaccine Research and Development, Pfizer Inc."},{"author_name":"Kirsten E.

After the outbreak of COVID-19, potent neutralizing Abs to SARS-CoV-2 were promptly developed, and a few of those neutralizing Abs are being tested in clinical studies. However, there were few methodologies detailly reported on how to rapidly and efficiently generate neutralizing Abs of interest. Here, we present a strategically optimized method for precisive screening of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which enabled us to identify SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) specific Abs within 4 days, followed by another 2 days for neutralization activity evaluation. By applying the screening system, we obtained 198 Abs against the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Excitingly, we found that approximately 50% (96\/198) of them were candidate neutralizing Abs in a preliminary screening of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and 20 of these 96 neutralizing Abs were confirmed with high potency. Furthermore, 2 mAbs with the highest neutralizing potency were identified to block authentic SARS-CoV-2 with the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) at concentrations of 9.88 ng\/ml and 11.13 ng\/ml. In this report, we demonstrated that the optimized neutralizing Abs screening system is useful for the rapid and efficient discovery of potent neutralizing Abs against SARS-CoV-2. Our study provides a methodology for the generation of preventive and therapeutic antibody drugs for emerging infectious diseases.","rel_num_authors":37,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"XiaoJian

(SARS-CoV-2) emerged in China at the end of 2019, and became pandemic. The zoonotic virus most likely originated from bats, but definite intermediate hosts have not yet been identified. Raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) are kept for fur production, in particular in China, and were suspected as potential intermediate host for both SARS-CoV6 and SARS-CoV2. Here we demonstrate susceptibility of raccoon dogs for SARS-CoV-2 infection after intranasal inoculation and transmission to direct contact animals. Rapid, high level virus shedding, in combination with minor clinical signs and pathohistological changes, seroconversion and absence of viral adaptation highlight the role of raccoon dogs as a potential intermediate host. The results are highly relevant for control strategies and emphasize the risk that raccoon dogs may represent a potential SARS-CoV-2 reservoir. Our results support the establishment of adequate surveillance and risk mitigation strategies for kept and wild raccoon dogs.\n\nArticle Summary LineRaccoon dogs are susceptible to and efficiently transmit SARS-CoV2 and may serve as intermediate host","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Conrad Martin Freuling","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Angele Breithaupt","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Thomas Mueller","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Julia Sehl","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Anne Balkema-Buschmann","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Melanie Rissmann","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Antonia Klein","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Claudia Wylezich","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Dirk Hoeper","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Kerstin Wernike","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Andrea Aebischer","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Donata Hoffmann","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Virginia Friedrichs","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Anca Dorhoi","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Martin Groschup","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Martin Beer","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Thomas C Mettenleiter","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Feiyang Luo","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, College of Basic Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Shuyi Song","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, College of Basic Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Shunhua Long","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, College of Basic Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Yanan Hao","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, College of Basic Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Luo Li","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, College of Basic Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Yang Wu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Wei Xu","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xia Cai","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Qingzhu Gao","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Guiji Zhang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Changlong He","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Kun Deng","author_inst":"The Third Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Li Du","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, College of Basic Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Yaru Nai","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, College of Basic Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Wang Wang","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, College of Basic Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE\/NHC\/CAMS), Department of Medical Microbiology and"},{"author_name":"Di Qu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Ailong Huang","author_inst":"Chongqing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ni Tang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Aishun Jin","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, College of Basic Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.20.258772","rel_title":"What if we perceive SARS-CoV-2 genomes as documents?

Its utility in text-mining and document retrieval tasks in various fields of scientific research is rather well known. An unsupervised machine learning approach, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) has particularly been utilized for identifying latent (or hidden) topics in document collections and for deciphering the words that define one or more topics using a generative statistical model. Here we describe how SARS-CoV-2 genomic mutation profiles can be structured into a  Bag of Words to enable identification of signatures (topics) and their probabilistic distribution across various genomes using LDA. Topic models were generated using ~47000 novel corona virus genomes (considered as documents), leading to identification of 16 amino acid mutation signatures and 18 nucleotide mutation signatures (equivalent to topics) in the corpus of chosen genomes through coherence optimization. The document assumption for genomes also helped in identification of contextual nucleotide mutation signatures in the form of conventional N-grams (e.g. bi-grams and tri-grams). We validated the signatures obtained using LDA driven method against the previously reported recurrent mutations and phylogenetic clades for genomes. Additionally, we report the geographical distribution of the identified mutation signatures in SARS-CoV-2 genomes on the global map. Use of the non-phylogenetic albeit classical approaches like topic modeling and other data centric pattern mining algorithms is therefore proposed for supplementing the efforts towards understanding the genomic diversity of the evolving SARS-CoV-2 genomes (and other pathogens\/microbes).","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sunil Nagpal","author_inst":"BioSciences R&D, TCS Research, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd.

Our data showed that CTSL, rather than ACE2, was significantly upregulated in the lung from COVID-19 patients. Dysregulation of protein translation, glucose metabolism, fatty acid metabolism was detected in multiple organs. Our data suggested upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, hyperinflammation might be triggered which in turn induces damage of gas exchange barrier in the lung, leading to hypoxia, angiogenesis, coagulation and fibrosis in the lung, kidney, spleen, liver, heart and thyroid. Evidence for testicular injuries included reduced Leydig cells, suppressed cholesterol biosynthesis and sperm mobility. In summary, this study depicts the multi-organ proteomic landscape of COVID-19 autopsies, and uncovered dysregulated proteins and biological processes, offering novel therapeutic

SARS-CoV-2 detection. However, the long test run time and costs associated with this type of molecular testing are a challenge in the actual pandemic scenario. Due to high testing demand, pooling sample strategy is an interesting approach to allow cost savings. We aim to evaluate pooling tests in experimental procedures, as well as perform in silico statistical modeling analysis validated with specimen samples obtained from a mass testing program of Industry Federation of the State of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). Although the sensitivity reduction in samples pooled with 32 individuals was observed, the high-test sensitivity is maintained even when 16 and 8 samples were pooled. The in silico analysis showed high-cost savings in populations with positive rates lower than 15.0% according to the pool size. This data was validated with the results obtained in our mass testing program: statistical modeling predicted a cost saving of 48.0%, which in practice, was 51.5%, already considering the expenditures with pool sampling that were analyzed individually. Our data confirmed that mathematical modeling is a powerful strategy to improve the pooling approach for SARS-CoV-2 mass testing around the world while maintaining high sensitivity and robustness.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Isadora Alonso Correa","author_inst":"Instituto Senai de Inovacao em Quimica Verde and Instituto de Microbiologia Paulo de Goes,

post-lockdown aeromedical retrieval (AR) diagnostic reasons and patient demographics during a period of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) social isolation. Methods: An observational study with retrospective data collection, consisting of Australians who received an AR between the 26 January to the 23 June 2020. The main outcome measures were patient diagnostic category proportions and trends prior (28 January to 15 March), during (16 March to 4 May), and following (5 May to 23 June 2020) social isolation restrictions. Results: There were 16981 ARs consisting of 1959 (11.5) primary evacuations (PE) and 12724 (88.5) inter-hospital transfer (IHT), with a population median age of 52 years old (interquartile range [IQR] 29.0 69.0), with 49.0% (n= 8283) of the cohort being male and 38.0% (n= 6399) being female. There were a total of 6 confirmed and 209 suspected cases of COVID-19, with the majority of cases (n=114; 53.0%) in the social isolation period. As compared to pre-restriction, the odds of retrieval for the restriction and post-restriction period differed across time between the major diagnostic groups. This included, an increase in cardiovascular retrieval for both restriction and post-restriction periods (OR 1.12 95% CI 1.02 1.24 and OR 1.18 95% CI 1.08 1.30 respectively), increases in neoplasm in the post restriction period (OR 1.31 95% CI 1.04 1.64), and increases for congenital conditions in the restriction period (OR 2.56 95% CI 1.39 4.71). Cardiovascular and congenital conditions had increased rates of priority 1 patients in the restriction and post restriction periods. There was a decrease in endocrine and metabolic disease retrievals in the restriction period (OR 0.72 95% CI 0.53 0.98). There were lower odds during the post-restriction period for a retrievals of the respiratory system (OR 0.78 95% CI 0.67 0.93), and disease of the skin (OR 0.78 95% CI 0.6 1.0). Distribution between the 2019 and 2020 time periods differed (p<0.05), with the lockdown period resulting in a significant reduction in activity. Conclusion: The lockdown period resulted in increased AR rates of circulatory and congenital conditions. However, this period also resulted in a reduction of overall activity, possibly due to a reduction in other infectious disease rates, such as influenza, due to social distancing.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fergus W Gardiner","author_inst":"Royal Flying Doctor Service"},{"author_name":"Marianne Gillam","author_inst":"University of South

pandemic, broad usage of non-pharmaceutical interventions played a crucial role in controlling epidemics. However, the substantial economic and societal costs of continuous use of border controls, travel restrictions, and physical distancing measures suggest that these measures may not be sustainable and that policymakers have to seek strategies to lift the restrictions. Taiwan was one of the few countries that demonstrated initial success in eliminating the COVID-19 outbreak without strict lockdown or school closure. To understand the key contributors to the successful control, we applied a stochastic branching model to empirical case data to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of more targeted case-based (including contact tracing and quarantine) and less targeted population-based interventions (including social distancing and face mask use) in Taiwan. We found that case-based interventions alone would not be sufficient to contain the epidemic, even in a setting where a highly efficient contact tracing program was in place. The voluntary population-based interventions have reduced the reproduction numbers by more than 60% and have likely played a critical role at the early stage of the outbreak. Our analysis of Taiwan's success highlights that coordinated efforts from both the government and the citizens are indispensable in the fight against COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ta-Chou V Ng","author_inst":"Institute of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, National Taiwan University College of Public Health,

biggest public health challenge in the last 100 years. No successful pharmaceutical treatment is yet available, thus effective public health interventions to contain COVID-19 include social distancing, isolation and quarantine measures. However the efficiency of these containment measures varied among countries and even within states in the same country. Despite Brazil being deeply affected by coronavirus, the federal government never proposed a coordinated action to control COVID-19 and Brazilian states, which are autonomous, each imposed different containment measures. The state of Goias declared strict social distancing measures in March 13, but gradually relaxed many of its first measures due specially to public pressure. Here we use a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model combined with Bayesian inference and a time-dependent spreading rate to assess how past state-level interventions affected the spread of COVID-19 in Goias. The interventions succeeded in decreasing the transmission rate in the state, however, after the third intervention the rate remained positive and exponential. Thus, other stricter interventions were made necessary to avoid the growth of new cases and a collapse in the health system. Governmental interventions need to be taken seriously by the population in order for them have the proposed outcome. Our results reflect the population's disregard with the measures imposed and the need for cooperation between governments and its citizens in the fight against COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christielly Mendonca Borges","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Goias"},{"author_name":"Marco Tulio Pacheco
