However, it is unknown if inhaled corticosteroid use is associated with reduced morbidity of the disease. Methods In a nationwide cohort of hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 test-positive individuals in Denmark, we estimated the 30-day hazard ratio of intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death among users of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) compared with users of non-ICS inhalers ({beta}2-agonist\/muscarinic-antagonists), or non-users of ICS, with Cox regression adjusted for age, sex, and other confounders. We repeated these analyses among influenza test-positive patients during 2010-2018. Results Among 2,180 hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients, 282 were admitted to ICU and 421 died within 30 days. ICS use was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.25 (95% CI [CI], 0.60 to 2.61) for ICU admission and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.54 to 1.31) for death compared with non-ICS inhaler use. Compared with no ICS use, the hazard ratio of ICU admission or death was 1.22 (95% CI, 0.77 to 1.94) and 1.05 (95% CI, 0.75 to 1.47), respectively. Among 10,279 hospitalized influenza patients, the hazard ratios were 1.43 (95% CI, 0.89 to 2.30) and 1.11 (95% CI, 0.85 to 1.46) for ICU admission, and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.63 to 1.01) and 1.03 (95% CI, 0.87 to 1.22) for death compared with non-ICS inhaler use and no ICS use, respectively. Conclusions Our results do not support an effect of inhaled corticosteroid use on COVID-19 morbidity, however we can only rule out moderate-to-large reduced or increased risks.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anders Husby","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Anton Pottegaard","author_inst":"University of Southern Denmark"},{"author_name":"Anders Peter Hviid","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.02.20186650","rel_title":"COMPARISON OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ENABLED METHODS IN THE COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHIC ASSESSMENT OF COVID-19 DISEASE.","rel_date":"2020-09-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.02.20186650","rel_abs":"Objectives: Comparison of three different Artificial intelligence (AI) methods of assessment for patients undergoing Computed tomography (CT) for suspected Covid-19 disease. Parameters studied were probability of diagnosis, quantification of disease severity and the time to reach the diagnosis . Methods: 107 consecutive patients of suspected Covid-19 patients were evaluated using the three AI methods labeled as AI-I,II, III alongwith visual analysis labeled as VT for predicting probability of Covid-19, determining CT severity score (CTSS) and index (CTSI) , percentage opacification (PO) and high opacification (POHO). Sensitivity, specificity along with area under curves were estimated for each method and the CTSS and CTSI correlated using Friedman test. Results: Out of 107 patients 71 patients were Covid-19 positive and 20 negative by RT-PCR while 16 did not get RT-PCR done. AI-III method showed higher sensitivity and specificity of 93% and 88% respectively to predict probability of Covid 19. It had 2 false positive patients of interstitial lung disease. AI-II method had sensitivity and specificity of 66% and 83% respectively while visual (VT) analysis showed sensitivity and specificity of 59.7% and 62% respectively. Statistically significant differences were also seen in CTSI and PO estimation between AI-I and III methods (p<0.0001) with AI-III showing fastest time to calculate results. Conclusions: AI-III method gave better results to make an accurate and quick diagnosis of the Covid-19 with AUC of 0.85 to predict probability of Covid-19 alongwith quantification of Covid-19 lesions in the form of PO, POHO as compared to other AI methods and also by visual analysis.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Atul Kapoor","author_inst":"Advanced diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Goldaa Mahajan","author_inst":"Advanced Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Aprajita Kapoor","author_inst":"Advanced Diagnostics"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"radiology and imaging"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.01.20186213","rel_title":"Performance of serum apolipoprotein-A1 as a sentinel of Covid-19","rel_date":"2020-09-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.01.20186213","rel_abs":"Background Since 1920, a decrease in serum cholesterol has been identified as a marker of severe pneumonia. We have assessed the performance of serum apolipoprotein-A1, the main transporter of HDL-cholesterol, to identify the early spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) in the general population and its diagnostic performance for the Covid-19. Methods We compared the daily mean serum apolipoprotein-A1 during the first 34 weeks of 2020 in a population that is routinely followed for a risk of liver fibrosis risk in the USA (212,297 sera) and in France (20,652 sera) in relation to a local increase in confirmed cases, and in comparison to the same period in 2019 (266,976 and 28,452 sera, respectively). We prospectively assessed the sensitivity of this marker in an observational study of 136 consecutive hospitalized cases and retrospectively evaluated its specificity in 7,481 controls representing the general population. Results The mean serum apolipoprotein-A1 levels in the survey populations began decreasing in January 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. This decrease was highly correlated with the daily increase in confirmed Covid-19 cases in the following 34 weeks, both in France and USA, including the June and mid-July recovery periods in France. Apolipoprotein-A1 at the 1.25 g\/L cutoff had a sensitivity of 90.6% (95%CI84.2-95.1) and a specificity of 96.1% (95.7-96.6%) for the diagnosis of Covid-19. The area under the characteristics curve was 0.978 (0.957-0.988), and outperformed haptoglobin and liver function tests. The adjusted risk ratio of apolipoprotein-A1 for survival without transfer to intensive care unit was 5.61 (95%CI 1.02-31.0;P=0.04). Conclusion Apolipoprotein-A1 could be a sentinel of the pandemic in existing routine surveillance of the general population.

While research efforts to develop a vaccine are on-going, others have suggested the use of available vaccines to boost innate immunity. Objective: We analysed three databases: UNICEF Immunization Coverage, Worldometer Corona Virus Updates and World Bank List of Economies to establish the association, if any, between vaccination for various diseases and COVID-19 death rates and recoveries across world economies. Results: Mean percentage death rates were lower in countries that vaccinated for Hepatitis-B birth dose (2.53% vs 3.79%, p = 0.001), Bacille Calmette-Guerin Vaccine (2.93% vs 5.10%, p = 0.025) and Inactivated Polio Vaccine 1st dose (2.8% vs 4.01%, p = 0.022) than those which did not report vaccination. In high income countries, a significant negative correlation with death rates was observed with vaccination for Measles-containing vaccine 2nd dose (r = -0.290, p = 0.032), Rubella- containing vaccine 1st dose (r= -0.325, p = 0.015), Hepatitis B 3rd dose (r = -0.562, p = 3.3 x10-5), Inactivated Polio vaccine 1st dose (r = -0.720, p = 0.008). Inactivated Polio Vaccine 1st dose and Measles-containing vaccine 2nd dose also correlated with better recoveries. In Low Income countries, only Rubella-containing vaccine correlated with lower deaths while Yellow fever vaccine was associated with poorer recoveries. Conclusion: Our analysis corroborates the potential benefit of vaccination and warrant further research to explore the rationale for repurposing other vaccines to fight COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Irene Gobe","author_inst":"University of Botswana"},{"author_name":"Garesego F Koto","author_inst":"University of Botswana"},{"author_name":"Kesaobaka Molebatsi","author_inst":"University  of Botswana"},{"author_name":"Margaret Mokomane","author_inst":"University of Botswana"},{"author_name":"Ishmael Kasvosve","author_inst":"University of Botswana"},{"author_name":"Modisa S Motswaledi","author_inst":"University of Botswana"},{"author_name":"Sepideh Akhavan","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Vincent Calvez","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Clemence Franc","author_inst":"BioPredictive"},{"author_name":"Jean Marie Castille","author_inst":"BioPredictive"},{"author_name":"Fabienne Drane","author_inst":"BioPredictive.com"},{"author_name":"Mehdi Sakka","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Dominique Bonnefont-Rousselot","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Jean Marc Lacorte","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"David Saadoun","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Yves Allenbach","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Olivier Benveniste","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Frederique Gandjbakhch","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Julien Mayaux","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Olivier Lucidarme","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Bruno Fautrel","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Vlad Ratziu","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Chantal Housset","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Dominique Thabut","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Patrice Cacoub","author_inst":"APHP"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.02.20187021","rel_title":"Impact of universal masking in health care and community on SARS-CoV-2 spread","rel_date":"2020-09-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.02.20187021","rel_abs":"Universal masking the health care setting and in the community to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 has been recently recommended by the WHO, but supporting data are rare.

Here, we performed longitudinal single-cell transcriptome sequencing and T cell\/B cell receptor sequencing on 3 healthy donors and 10 COVID-19 patients with asymptomatic, moderate, and severe conditions. We found asymptomatic patients displayed distinct innate immune responses, including increased CD56briCD16- NK subset, which was nearly missing in severe condition and enrichment of a new Th2-like cell type\/state expressing a ciliated cell marker. Unlike that in moderate condition, asymptomatic patients lacked clonal expansion of effector CD8+ T cells but had a robust effector CD4+ T cell clonal expansion, coincide with previously detected SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cells in unexposed individuals. Moreover, NK and effector T cells in asymptomatic patients have upregulated cytokine related genes, such as IFNG and XCL2. Our data suggest early innate immune response and type I immunity may contribute to the asymptomatic phenotype in COVID-19 disease, which could in turn deepen our understanding of severe COVID-19 and guide early prediction and therapeutics.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yue You","author_inst":"Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Guo-Lin Wang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Hui-Xia Gao","author_inst":"The Fifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Ming Cui","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Li-Jun Duan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Sheng-Bo Zhang","author_inst":"The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia"},{"author_name":"Yu-Ling Wang","author_inst":"The Fifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China"},{"author_name":"Lin Yao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Li Li","author_inst":"The Fifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China"},{"author_name":"Jian-Hua Lu","author_inst":"The Fifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China"},{"author_name":"Hai-Bin Wang","author_inst":"The Fifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China"},{"author_name":"Jing-Fang Fan","author_inst":"The Fifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China"},{"author_name":"Huan-Wei Zheng","author_inst":"The Fifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China"},{"author_name":"Er-Hei Dai","author_inst":"The Fifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China"},{"author_name":"Luyi Tian","author_inst":"Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Mai-Juan Ma","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Olivier Benveniste","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Frederique Gandjbakhch","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Julien Mayaux","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Olivier Lucidarme","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Bruno Fautrel","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Vlad Ratziu","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Chantal Housset","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Dominique Thabut","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Patrice Cacoub","author_inst":"APHP"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.02.280529","rel_title":"Mutation in position of 32 (G>U) of S2M differentiate human SARS-CoV2 from Bat Coronavirus","rel_date":"2020-09-03","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.02.280529","rel_abs":"The new Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a zoonotic pathogen that has rapidly mutated and become transmissible to humans. There is little existing data on the mutations in SARS-CoV-2 and the impact of these polymorphisms on its transmission and viral load. In this study, the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence was analyzed to identify variants within the 3UTR region of its cis-regulatory RNA elements. A 43-nucleotide genetic element with a highly conserved stem-loop II-like motif (S2M), was discovered. The research revealed 32 G>U and 16 G>U\/A mutations located within the S2M sequence in human SARS-CoV-2 models. These polymorphisms appear to make the S2M secondary and tertiary structures in human SARS-CoV-2 models less stable when compared to the S2M structures of bat\/pangolin models. This grants the RNA structures more flexibility, which could be one of its escape mechanisms from host defenses or facilitate its entry into host proteins and enzymes. While this S2M sequence may not be omnipresent across all human SARS-CoV-2 models, when present, its sequence is always highly conserved. It may be used as a potential target for the development of vaccines and therapeutic agents.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Majid Vahed","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Vahed","author_inst":"University of Michigan-Ann Arbor"},{"author_name":"Aaron Sweeney","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Farshad H Shirazi","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mehdi Mirsaeidi","author_inst":"University of Miami"},{"author_name":"Sheng-Bo Zhang","author_inst":"The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia"},{"author_name":"Yu-Ling Wang","author_inst":"The Fifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China"},{"author_name":"Lin Yao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Li Li","author_inst":"The Fifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China"},{"author_name":"Jian-Hua Lu","author_inst":"The Fifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China"},{"author_name":"Hai-Bin Wang","author_inst":"The Fifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China"},{"author_name":"Jing-Fang Fan","author_inst":"The Fifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China"},{"author_name":"Huan-Wei Zheng","author_inst":"The Fifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China"},{"author_name":"Er-Hei Dai","author_inst":"The Fifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China"},{"author_name":"Luyi Tian","author_inst":"Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Mai-Juan Ma","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Olivier Benveniste","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Frederique Gandjbakhch","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Julien Mayaux","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Olivier Lucidarme","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Bruno Fautrel","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Vlad Ratziu","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Chantal Housset","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Dominique Thabut","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Patrice Cacoub","author_inst":"APHP"}],"version":"1","license":"cc0","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.03.280370","rel_title":"Development of SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Specific Monoclonal Antibodies","rel_date":"2020-09-03","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.03.280370","rel_abs":"The global COVID-19 pandemic has caused massive disruptions in every society around the world.

Translation of the replicon produces a replicase complex that amplifies and prolong SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein expression. A single prime vaccination in mice led to robust antibody responses, with neutralizing antibody titers increasing up to day 60. Activation of cell mediated immunity produced a strong viral antigen specific CD8+ T lymphocyte response. Assaying for intracellular cytokine staining for IFN-{gamma} and IL-4 positive CD4+ T helper lymphocytes as well as anti-spike glycoprotein IgG2a\/IgG1 ratios supported a strong Th1 dominant immune response. Finally, single LUNAR-COV19 vaccination at both 2 g and 10 g doses completely protected human ACE2 transgenic mice from both mortality and even measurable infection following wild-type SARS-CoV-2 challenge.

In the present study we constructed the phylo-geo-network of nCOV-2019 genomes from across India to understand the viral evolution in the country. A total of 611 full length genomes were extracted from different states of India from the EpiCov repository of GISAID initiative and NCBI. Their alignment uncovered 270 parsimony informative sites. Further, 339 genomes were divided into 51 haplogroups. The network revealed the core haplogroup as that of reference sequence NC_045512.2 (Haplogroup A1) with 157 identical sequences present across 16 states. The rest were having not more than ten identical sequences across not more than three locations. Interestingly, some locations with fewer samples have more haplogroups and most haplogroups (41) are localized exclusively to any one state only, suggesting the local evolution of viruses. The two most common lineages are B6 and B1 (Pangolin) whereas clade A2a (Covidex) appears to be the most predominant in India.

Studies confirmed significant genome differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, suggesting that the distinctions in pathogenicity might be related to genomic diversity. However, the relationship between genomic differences and SARS-CoV-2 fitness has not been fully explained, especially for open reading frame (ORF)-encoded accessory proteins. RNA viruses have a high mutation rate, but how SARS-CoV-2 mutations accelerate adaptation is not clear. This study shows that the host-genome similarity (HGS) of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly higher than that of SARS-CoV, especially in the ORF6 and ORF8 genes encoding proteins antagonizing innate immunity in vivo. A power law relationship was discovered between the HGS of ORF3b, ORF6, and N and the expression of interferon (IFN)-sensitive response element (ISRE)-containing promoters. This finding implies that high HGS of SARS-CoV-2 genome may further inhibit IFN I synthesis and cause delayed host innate immunity. An ORF1ab mutation, 10818G>T, which occurred in virus populations with high HGS but rarely in low-HGS populations, was identified in 2594 genomes with geolocations of China, the USA and Europe. The 10818G>T caused the amino acid mutation M37F in the transmembrane protein nsp6. The results suggest that the ORF6 and ORF8 genes and the mutation M37F may play important roles in causing COVID-19. The findings demonstrate that HGS analysis is a promising way to identify important genes and mutations in adaptive strains, which may help in searching potential targets for pharmaceutical agents.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Weitao Sun","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Safdar Ali","author_inst":"Aliah University"},{"author_name":"Shiwei Chen","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Yan Shan Leong","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Hwee Cheng Tan","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Summer L.

Using an online survey with 1669 respondents, we sought to understand why and how by querying about perceived barriers and motivators to physical activity that changed because of the pandemic, and how those changes impacted mental health. Consistent with prior reports, our respondents were less physically active (aerobic activity, -11%, p <0.05; strength-based activity, -30%, p<0.01) and more sedentary (+11%, p<0.01) during the pandemic as compared to 6-months before. The pandemic also increased psychological stress (+22%, p <0.01) and brought on moderate symptoms of anxiety and depression. Respondents whose mental health deteriorated the most were also the ones who were least active (depression r = -.21, p<0.01; anxiety r = -.12, p<0.01). The majority of respondents were unmotivated to exercise because they were too anxious (+8%, p <0.01), lacked social support (+6%, p =<0.01), or had limited access to equipment (+23%, p <0.01) or space (+41%, p <0.01). The respondents who were able to stay active reported feeling less motivated by physical health outcomes such as weight loss (-7%, p<0.01) or strength (-14%, p<0.01) and instead more motivated by mental health outcomes such as anxiety relief (+14%, p <0.01). Coupled with previous work demonstrating a direct relationship between mental health and physical activity, these results highlight the potential protective effect of physical activity on mental health and point to the need for psychological support to overcome perceived barriers so that people can continue to be physically active during stressful times like the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maryam  Yvonne Marashi","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Emma Nicholson","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Michelle Ogrodnik","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Barbara Fenesi","author_inst":"University of Western Ontario: Western University"},{"author_name":"Jennifer  J Heisz","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Summer L.

There are multiple antibody tests to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, but their performance varies according to their platforms and the antigenic targets, making interpretation of the results challenging. Additionally, currently available serological tests do not exclude the possibility that positive responses are due to cross reactive antibodies to community coronaviruses. This study describes the development and validation of a high throughput multiplex bead based antibody detection assay with the capacity to identify, simultaneously, patient responses to five distinct SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The antibody response to these proteins are SARS-CoV-2 specific as antibodies against four community coronaviruses do not cross-react. Assay configuration is essentially identical to the single antigen bead assays used in the majority of histocompatibility laboratories around the world and could easily be implemented into routine screening of transplant candidates and recipients. This new assay provides a novel tool to interrogate the spectrum of immune responses to SAR-CoV-2 and is uniquely suitable for use in the transplant setting.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robert A Bray","author_inst":"Emory University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jar-How Lee","author_inst":"terasaki Innovation Center"},{"author_name":"Peter Brescia","author_inst":"Th-ermo-Fisher Scientific"},{"author_name":"Deepali Kumar","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"},{"author_name":"Thoa Nong","author_inst":"Thermo-Fisher Scientific"},{"author_name":"Remi Shih","author_inst":"Thermo-Fisher Scientific"},{"author_name":"E Steve Woodle","author_inst":"University of Cincinnati School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jonathan S Maltzman","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine and VA Palo Alto Health Care System, Palo Alto, CA"},{"author_name":"Howard M Gebel","author_inst":"Emory University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Paula Hartman","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jenny Park","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Maher Alayyoubi","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Hari Bhaskaran","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Adrian Dukanovic","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Belle Bao","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Brenda Clemente","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jerel Vega","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Scott Roberts","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jose A.

Methods and Materials Two studies were completed to determine clinical performance. In the first study, nasal specimens and either nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal specimens from 251 participants with COVID-19 symptoms (<=7 days from symptom onset [DSO]), >=18 years of age, were utilized to compare Veritor with the Lyra SARS-CoV-2 PCR Assay (Lyra). In the second study, nasal specimens from 361 participants with COVID-19 symptoms (<=5 DSO), >=18 years of age, were utilized to compare performance of Veritor to that of the Sofia 2 SARS Antigen FIA test (Sofia 2). Positive, negative, and overall percent agreement (PPA, NPA, and OPA, respectively) were the primary outcomes. Results In study 1, PPA for Veritor, compared to Lyra, ranged from 81.8%-87.5% for 0-1 through 0-6 DSO ranges. In study 2, Veritor had a PPA, NPA, and OPA of 97.4%, 98.1%, and 98.1%, respectively, with Sofia 2. Discordant analysis showed one Lyra positive missed by Veritor and five Lyra positives missed by Sofia 2; one Veritor positive result was negative by Lyra. Conclusions Veritor met FDA-EUA acceptance criteria for SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing (>=80% PPA point estimate) for the 0-5 and 0-6 DSO ranges. Veritor and Sofia 2 showed a high degree of agreement for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The Veritor test should facilitate rapid and reliable results for COVID-19 diagnosis utilizing easy-to-collect nasal swabs.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stephen Young","author_inst":"TriCore Reference Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Taylor","author_inst":"Louisiana State University Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Catherine Cammarata","author_inst":"Louisiana State University Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Celine Roger-Dalbert","author_inst":"Becton, Dickinson and Company"},{"author_name":"Amanda Montano","author_inst":"Tricore Reference Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Christen Griego-Fullbright","author_inst":"TriCore Reference Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Cameron Burgard","author_inst":"TriCore Reference Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Catherine Fernandez","author_inst":"Becton, Dickinson and Company"},{"author_name":"Karen Eckert","author_inst":"Becton, Dickinson and Company"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey C Andrews","author_inst":"Becton, Dickinson and Company"},{"author_name":"Huimiao Ren","author_inst":"Becton, Dickinson and Company"},{"author_name":"Joseph Allen","author_inst":"STAT Research"},{"author_name":"Ronald Ackerman","author_inst":"Comprehensive Clinical Research, LLC."},{"author_name":"Devin Gary","author_inst":"Becton, Dickinson and Company"},{"author_name":"Charles Cooper","author_inst":"Becton, Dickinson and Company"},{"author_name":"Brenda Clemente","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jerel Vega","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Scott Roberts","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jose A.

Since then, collection of CCP from COVID-19 recovered patients has been implemented in several donor centers across the country. Childrens Hospital Colorado rapidly put into practice a CCP collection protocol, necessitating the development and implementation of assays to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in CCP units. We evaluated 87 separate units of CCP collected from 36 donors over two to four sequential donations using both antigen-binding assays for SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and spike antigens, and a live virus focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT50). Our data shows that the majority of donors (83 percent) had a FRNT50 titer of 1\/80 or greater, and 61 percent had a titer greater than or equal to 1\/160, which meet the FDA criteria for acceptable CCP units. Additionally, our data indicates that analysis of antibodies to a single SARS-CoV-2 antigen is likely to miss a percentage of seroconverters. These individuals, however, tend to have neutralizing antibody titers of less than 1\/80. Of note, there was considerable variability in the short term, sustained antibody response, measured by neutralizing antibody titers, among our donor population.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kyle Annen","author_inst":"University of Colorado School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Thomas E Morrison","author_inst":"University of Colorado School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Melkon G DomBourian","author_inst":"University of Colorado School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mary K McCarthy","author_inst":"University of Colorado School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Leah Huey","author_inst":"University of Colorado School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Patricia A Merkel","author_inst":"University of Colorado School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Gillian Andersen","author_inst":"Children's Hospital, Colorado"},{"author_name":"Eileen Schwartz","author_inst":"Children's Hospital, Colorado"},{"author_name":"Vijaya Knight","author_inst":"University of Colorado School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey C Andrews","author_inst":"Becton, Dickinson and Company"},{"author_name":"Huimiao Ren","author_inst":"Becton, Dickinson and Company"},{"author_name":"Joseph Allen","author_inst":"STAT Research"},{"author_name":"Ronald Ackerman","author_inst":"Comprehensive Clinical Research, LLC."},{"author_name":"Devin Gary","author_inst":"Becton, Dickinson and Company"},{"author_name":"Charles Cooper","author_inst":"Becton, Dickinson and Company"},{"author_name":"Brenda Clemente","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jerel Vega","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Scott Roberts","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jose A.

Clusters of infection occurred in staff working in wards with patients known to have COVID-19 infection. Staff infections peaked when COVID-19 infected inpatient numbers were highest, and density of patients and certain patient behaviours were noted by staff to be linked to possible transmission events. Three small outbreaks on other wards occurred but all were recognised and brought under control. Availability of rapid turn-around staff testing, and regular review of local data and obtaining feedback from staff helped identify useful interventions which were iteratively implemented. Attention to staff wellbeing was critical to the response and a comprehensive support service was implemented. Conclusion(s): A comprehensive multimodal approach to containment was instituted with iterative refinement based on frontline workers observations and ongoing analysis of local data in real time.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kirsty Buising","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Deborah Williamson","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Cowie","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jennifer MacLachlan","author_inst":"Royal Melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Liz Orr","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christopher MacIsaac","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Eloise Williams","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Katherine Bond","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Stephen Muhi","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"James McCarthy","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Andrea Maier","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lou Irving","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Denise Heinjus","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cate Kelly","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Caroline Marshall","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Brenda Clemente","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jerel Vega","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Scott Roberts","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jose A.

FIB-4 is a noninvasive index of readily available laboratory measurements that represents hepatic fibrosis. The association of FIB-4 with COVID-19 outcomes has not been previously evaluated. Methods FIB-4 was evaluated at admission in a cohort of 267 patients admitted with early-stage COVID-19 confirmed through RT-PCR. Hazard of ventilator use and of high-flow oxygen was estimated using Cox regression models controlled for covariates. Risk of progress to severe cases and of death\/prolonged hospitalization (>30 days) were estimated using logistic regression models controlled for same covariates. Results Forty-one (15%) patients progressed to severe cases, 36 (14%) required high-flow oxygen support, 10 (4%) required mechanical ventilator support, and 1 died. Patients with high FIB-4 score (>3.25) were more likely to be older with pre-existing conditions. FIB-4 between 1.45-3.25 was associated with over 5-fold (95% CI: 1.2-28) increased hazard of high-flow oxygen use, over 4-fold (95% CI: 1.5-14.6) increased odds of progress to severe stage, and over 3-fold (95% CI: 1.4-7.7) increased odds of death or prolonged hospitalization. FIB-4>3.25 was associated with over 12-fold (95% CI: 2.3-68. 7) increased hazard of high-flow oxygen use and over 11-fold (95% CI: 3.1-45) increased risk of progress to severe disease. All associations were independent of sex, number of comorbidities, and inflammatory markers (D-dimer, C-reactive protein). Conclusions FIB-4 at early-stage of COVID-19 disease had an independent and dose-dependent association with adverse outcomes during hospitalization. FIB-4 provided significant prognostic value to adverse outcomes among COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fangfei Xiang","author_inst":"Guangzhou No. 8 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jing Sun","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Po-Hung Chen","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Peijin Han","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Haipeng Zheng","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shujiang Cai","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gregory D Kirk","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Mutsumi Nishida","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Takanori Teshima","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"James McCarthy","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Andrea Maier","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lou Irving","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Denise Heinjus","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cate Kelly","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Caroline Marshall","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Brenda Clemente","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jerel Vega","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Scott Roberts","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jose A.

Widespread, population level testing to detect active and past infections is critical to curb the COVID-19 pandemic. Antibody (serological) testing is the only option for detecting past infections outside the narrow window accessible to nucleic acid-based tests. However, currently available serological assays commonly lack scalability. Here, we describe the development of a rapid homogenous serological assay for the detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in patient plasma. We show that the fluorescence-based assay accurately detects seroconversion in COVID-19 patients from less than 1 microliter of plasma. Using a cohort of samples from COVID-19 infected or healthy individuals, we demonstrate detection with 100% sensitivity and specificity. This assay addresses an important need for a robust, low barrier to implementation, and scalable serological assay with complementary strengths to currently available serological platforms.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hong Yue","author_inst":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Rados\u0142aw P Nowak","author_inst":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Daan Overwijn","author_inst":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"N Connor Payne","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Fischinger","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Caroline Atyeo","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Lindsey R Baden","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Eric James Nilles","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth W Karlson","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xu G Yu","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Z Li","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Galit Alter","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Ralph Mazitschek","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Eric S Fischer","author_inst":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Caroline Marshall","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Brenda Clemente","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jerel Vega","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Scott Roberts","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jose A.

Design: We used a stochastic agent-based microsimulation model to create multiple simulations of possible epidemic trajectories that could eventuate over a five-week period following prolonged low levels of community transmission. Setting: We calibrated the model to the epidemiological and policy environment in New South Wales, Australia, at the end of August 2020. Participants: None Intervention: From September 1, 2020, we ran the stochastic model with the same initial conditions (i.e., those prevailing at August 31, 2020), and analyzed the outputs of the model to determine the probability of exceeding a given number of new diagnoses and active cases within five weeks, under three assumptions about future mask usage: a baseline scenario of 30% uptake, a scenario assuming no mask usage, and a scenario assuming mandatory mask usage with near-universal uptake (95%). Main outcome measure: Probability of exceeding a given number of new diagnoses and active cases within five weeks. Results: The policy environment at the end of August is sufficient to slow the rate of epidemic growth, but may not stop the epidemic from growing: we estimate a 20% chance that NSW will be diagnosing at least 50 new cases per day within five weeks from the date of this analysis. Mandatory mask usage would reduce this to 6-9%. Conclusions: Mandating the use of masks in community settings would significantly reduce the risk of epidemic resurgence.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robyn M Stuart","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Romesh G Abeysuriya","author_inst":"Burnet Institute"},{"author_name":"Cliff C Kerr","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Dina Mistry","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Daniel J Klein","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Richard Gray","author_inst":"The Kirby Institute, UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Margaret Hellard","author_inst":"Burnet Institute"},{"author_name":"Nick Scott","author_inst":"Burnet Institute"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth W Karlson","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xu G Yu","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Z Li","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Galit Alter","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Ralph Mazitschek","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Eric S Fischer","author_inst":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Caroline Marshall","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Brenda Clemente","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jerel Vega","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Scott Roberts","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jose A.

Serologic tests can be an important complementary approach. Objective: Assess the practical performance of RT-PCR based surveillance protocols, and the extent of undetected SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Shenzhen, China. Design: Cohort study nested in a public health response. Setting: Shenzhen, China; January-May 2020. Participants: 880 PCR-negative close-contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases and 400 residents without known exposure (main analysis). Fifty-seven PCR-positive case contacts (timing analysis). Measurements: Virological testing by RT-PCR. Measurement of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in PCR-negative contacts 2-15 weeks after initial testing using total Ab ELISA. Rates of undetected infection, performance of RT-PCR over the course of infection, and characteristics of seropositive but PCR-negative individuals were assessed. Results: The adjusted seropositivity rate for total Ab among 880 PCR-negative close-contacts was 4.1% (95%CI, 2.9% to 5.7%), significantly higher than among residents without known exposure to cases (0.0%, 95%CI, 0.0% to 1.0%). PCR-positive cases were 8.0 times (RR; 95% CI, 5.3 to 12.7) more likely to report symptoms than the PCR-negative individuals who were seropositive, but otherwise similar. RT-PCR missed 36% (95%CI, 28% to 44%) of infected close-contacts, and false negative rates appear to be highly dependent on stage of infection. Limitations: No serological data were available on PCR-positive cases. Sample size was limited, and only 20% of PCR-negative contacts met inclusion criteria. Conclusion: Even rigorous RT-PCR testing protocols may miss a significant proportion of infections, perhaps in part due to difficulties timing testing of asymptomatics for optimal sensitivity. Surveillance and control protocols relying on RT-PCR were, nevertheless, able to contain community spread in Shenzhen.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhen Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Public Health Information, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Qifang Bi","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, USA"},{"author_name":"Shisong Fang","author_inst":"Department of Pathogenic Biology, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Lan Wei","author_inst":"Department of Public Health Information, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xin Wang","author_inst":"Department of Pathogenic Biology, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Jianfan He","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Yongsheng Wu","author_inst":"Department of Public Health Information, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaojian Liu","author_inst":"Department of Public Health Information, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Gao","author_inst":"Department of Communicable Diseases Control and Prevention, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Renli Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Pathogenic Biology, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Wenfeng Gong","author_inst":"The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation"},{"author_name":"Qiru Su","author_inst":"Pediatric Research Institute, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Andrew Azman","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, USA"},{"author_name":"Justin Lessler","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, USA"},{"author_name":"Xuan Zou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Brenda Clemente","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jerel Vega","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Scott Roberts","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jose A.

Aim: To determine the prevalence and predictors of COVID-19-related depression, anxiety and stress symptoms among pregnant women. Materials and methods: This was a questionnaire-based cross-sectional study conducted among 456 pregnant women attending prenatal care at Abakaliki, Nigeria during COVID-19-related lockdown. They were screened for psychological morbidities using DASS 21 (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale). Results: Severe and extremely severe depression were reported in 33 (7.2%) and 29 (6.4%) participants respectively. 15 (3.3%) and 35 (7.7%) women had severe and extremely severe anxiety respectively. 105 (23%) had severe anxiety whereas 76 (16.7%) reported extremely severe stress. Multiparity (2 - 4) and occupations such as trading and farming were predictors of depression whereas grandmultiparity, urban residence and trading were identified as predictors of anxiety and stress. Conclusion: Depression, anxiety and stress symptoms were relatively common among pregnant women during COVID-19-related lockdown in Abakaliki, Nigeria. There is a need to integrate screening for depression, anxiety and stress in existing antenatal care programs so as to identify and prevent long term adverse psychological outcome related to COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Johnbosco Ifunanya Nwafor","author_inst":"Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki, Ebonyi State, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Ijeoma Nkem Okedo-Alex","author_inst":"Department of Community Medicine, Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital"},{"author_name":"Arinze Chidiebere Ikeotuonye","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lan Wei","author_inst":"Department of Public Health Information, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xin Wang","author_inst":"Department of Pathogenic Biology, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Jianfan He","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Yongsheng Wu","author_inst":"Department of Public Health Information, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaojian Liu","author_inst":"Department of Public Health Information, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Gao","author_inst":"Department of Communicable Diseases Control and Prevention, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Renli Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Pathogenic Biology, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Wenfeng Gong","author_inst":"The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation"},{"author_name":"Qiru Su","author_inst":"Pediatric Research Institute, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Andrew Azman","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, USA"},{"author_name":"Justin Lessler","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, USA"},{"author_name":"Xuan Zou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Brenda Clemente","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jerel Vega","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Scott Roberts","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jose A.

Given the lack of an effective pharmaceutical treatment for COVID-19, the high contagiousness of the disease and its varied clinical outcomes, identifying patients at risk of progressing to severe disease is crucial for the allocation of valuable healthcare resources during this pandemic. Current research has shown that there is a higher prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities amongst patients with severe COVID-19 or COVID-19-related deaths, but the link between cardiovascular disease and poorer prognosis is poorly understood. We believe that pre-existing immune dysregulation that accompanies cardiovascular disease predisposes patients to a harmful inflammatory immune response, leading to their higher risk of severe disease. Thus, in this project, we aim to characterize immune dysregulation in patients with cardiomyopathy, venous thromboembolism and COVID-19 patients by looking at immune-associated gene dysregulation, immune infiltration and dysregulated immunological pathways and gene signatures.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Grant E Castaneda","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Abby C Lee","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Wei Tse Li","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Chengyu Chen","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Jaideep Chakladar","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Eric Chang","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Weg Ongkeko","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Xiaojian Liu","author_inst":"Department of Public Health Information, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Gao","author_inst":"Department of Communicable Diseases Control and Prevention, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Renli Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Pathogenic Biology, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Wenfeng Gong","author_inst":"The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation"},{"author_name":"Qiru Su","author_inst":"Pediatric Research Institute, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Andrew Azman","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, USA"},{"author_name":"Justin Lessler","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, USA"},{"author_name":"Xuan Zou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Brenda Clemente","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jerel Vega","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Scott Roberts","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jose A.

In this discussion, we measure the seriousness of the disease by the ratio between Intensive Care Units (ICU) spaces occupied by COVID-19 patients and the number of still Active Cases (AC) each month from April to August 2020. We also use the ratio between the number of Deaths (D) and the number of Active Cases. What clearly emerges, from rigorous statistical analysis, is a progressive decrease of both the ratios, indicating progressive mitigation of the disease. This is particularly evident when comparing March-April with July-August; during the summer period the two ratios have become roughly 18 times lower. We test such sharp decreases against possible bias in counting active cases, and we confirm their statistical significance. We then interpret such evidence in terms of the well-known seasonality of the human immune system and the virus-inactivating effect of stronger UV rays in the summer. Our results can also shed light on related effects observed worldwide.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giuseppe De Natale","author_inst":"INGV, Osservatorio Vesuviano, 80124 Naples, Italy"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo De Natale","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Universita' degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Naples, Italy"},{"author_name":"Claudia Troise","author_inst":"INGV, Osservatorio Vesuviano, 80124 Naples, Italy"},{"author_name":"Renato Somma","author_inst":"INGV, Osservatorio Vesuviano, 80124 Naples, Italy"},{"author_name":"Vito Marchitelli","author_inst":"Department of Mobility, Public Works, Ecology, Env, Puglia Region Government, 70100 Bari, Italy"},{"author_name":"Antonio Coviello","author_inst":"CNR-IRISS, 80134 Naples, Italy"},{"author_name":"Karen Holmberg","author_inst":"Gallatin School of Individualized Study, New York University, USA"},{"author_name":"Xiaojian Liu","author_inst":"Department of Public Health Information, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Gao","author_inst":"Department of Communicable Diseases Control and Prevention, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Renli Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Pathogenic Biology, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Wenfeng Gong","author_inst":"The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation"},{"author_name":"Qiru Su","author_inst":"Pediatric Research Institute, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Andrew Azman","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, USA"},{"author_name":"Justin Lessler","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, USA"},{"author_name":"Xuan Zou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Brenda Clemente","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jerel Vega","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Scott Roberts","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jose A.

Study Design and Setting: This is a cross-sectional meta-epidemiological study. We searched medRxiv, PubMed, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for SRs of COVID-19. We evaluated the methodological quality using A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) checklists. The maximum AMSTAR score is 11, and minimum is 0. Higher score means better quality. Results: We included 9 Cochrane reviews as well as randomly selected 100 non-Cochrane reviews in medRxiv and PubMed. Compared with Cochrane reviews (mean 9.33, standard deviation 1.32), the mean AMSTAR scores of the articles in medRxiv were lower (mean difference -2.85, 95%confidence intervals (CI): -0.96 to -4.74) and those in PubMed was also lower (mean difference -3.28, 95% CI: -1.40 to -5.15), with no difference between the latter two. Conclusions: It should be noted that AMSTAR is not a perfect tool of assessing quality SRs other than intervention. Readers should pay attention to the potentially low methodological quality of COVID-19 SRs in both PubMed and medRxiv but less so in Cochrane COVID reviews.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yuki KATAOKA","author_inst":"Hyogo Prefectural Amagasaki General Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Shiho Oide","author_inst":"Department of Gynecology, Womens center, Yotsuya Medical Cube"},{"author_name":"Takashi Ariie","author_inst":"Department of Physical Therapy, School of Health Sciences at Fukuoka, International University of Health and Welfare"},{"author_name":"Yasushi Tsujimoto","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Dialysis, Kyoritsu Hospital"},{"author_name":"Toshi A.

We aimed to analyze how these effects can bias key epidemiological metrics used to track and monitor SARS-CoV-2 epidemics. Methods: An age-structured mathematical model was constructed to simulate progression of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics in populations. PCR testing to diagnose infection and cross-sectional surveys to measure seroprevalence were also simulated. Analyses were conducted on simulated outcomes assuming a natural epidemic time course and an epidemic in presence of interventions. Results: The prolonged PCR positivity biased the epidemiological measures. There was a lag of 10 days between the true epidemic peak and the actually-observed peak. Prior to epidemic peak, PCR positivity rate was 2-fold higher than that based only on current active infection, and half of those tested positive by PCR were in the prolonged PCR positivity stage after infection clearance. Post epidemic peak, PCR positivity rate poorly predicted true trend in active infection. Meanwhile, the prolonged PCR positivity did not appreciably bias estimation of the basic reproduction number R0. The time delay in development of detectable antibodies biased measured seroprevalence. The actually-observed seroprevalence substantially underestimated true prevalence of ever infection, with the underestimation being most pronounced around epidemic peak. Conclusions: Caution is warranted in interpreting PCR and serological testing data, and any drawn inferences need to factor the effects of the investigated biases for an accurate assessment of epidemic dynamics.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Monia Makhoul","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Epidemiology Group, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, Cornell University, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Farah Abou-Hijleh","author_inst":"Department of Public Health, College of Health Sciences, Academic Quality Affairs Office, QU Health, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Shaheen Seedat","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Epidemiology Group, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, Cornell University, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Ghina R Mumtaz","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon"},{"author_name":"Hiam Chemaitelly","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Epidemiology Group, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, Cornell University, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Houssein Ayoub","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Physics, College of Arts and Sciences, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Laith J Abu-Raddad","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Epidemiology Group, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, Cornell University, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Xiaojian Liu","author_inst":"Department of Public Health Information, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Gao","author_inst":"Department of Communicable Diseases Control and Prevention, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Renli Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Pathogenic Biology, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Wenfeng Gong","author_inst":"The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation"},{"author_name":"Qiru Su","author_inst":"Pediatric Research Institute, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Andrew Azman","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, USA"},{"author_name":"Justin Lessler","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, USA"},{"author_name":"Xuan Zou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Brenda Clemente","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jerel Vega","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Scott Roberts","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jose A.

In this work, we use individual-based computational models to explore how digital exposure notifications can be used in conjunction with non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as traditional contact tracing and social distancing, to influence COVID-19 disease spread in a population. Specifically, we use a representative model of the household and occupational structure of three counties in the state of Washington together with a proposed digital exposure notifications deployment to quantify impacts under a range of scenarios of adoption, compliance, and mobility. In a model in which 15% of the population participated, we found that digital exposure notification systems could reduce infections and deaths by approximately 8% and 6%, effectively complementing traditional contact tracing. We believe this can serve as guidance to health authorities in Washington state and beyond on how exposure notification systems can complement traditional public health interventions to suppress the spread of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matthew Abueg","author_inst":"Google Research"},{"author_name":"Robert Hinch","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Neo Wu","author_inst":"Google Research"},{"author_name":"Luyang Liu","author_inst":"Google Research"},{"author_name":"William J M Probert","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Austin Wu","author_inst":"Google LLC"},{"author_name":"Paul Eastham","author_inst":"Google Research"},{"author_name":"Yusef Shafi","author_inst":"Google Research"},{"author_name":"Matt Rosencrantz","author_inst":"Google Research"},{"author_name":"Michael Dikovsky","author_inst":"Google Research"},{"author_name":"Zhao Cheng","author_inst":"Google Research"},{"author_name":"Anel Nurtay","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Lucie Abeler-D\u00f6rner","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David G Bonsall","author_inst":"Big Data Institute"},{"author_name":"Michael V McConnell","author_inst":"Google LLC"},{"author_name":"Shawn O'Banion","author_inst":"Google Research"},{"author_name":"Christophe Fraser","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Scott Roberts","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jose A.
