We aimed to synthesize all available research on the asymptomatic rates and transmission rates where possible. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane COVID-19 trials, and Europe PMC (which covers pre-print platforms such as MedRxiv). We included primary studies reporting on asymptomatic prevalence where: (a) the sample frame includes at-risk population, and (b) there was sufficiently long follow up to identify pre-symptomatic cases. Meta-analysis used fixed effect and random effects models. We assessed risk of bias by combination of questions adapted from risk of bias tools for prevalence and diagnostic accuracy studies. Results: We screened 2,454 articles and included 13 low risk-of-bias studies from seven countries that tested 21,708 at-risk people, of which 663 were positive and 111 were asymptomatic. Diagnosis in all studies was confirmed using a RT-PCR test. The proportion of asymptomatic cases ranged from 4% to 41%. Meta-analysis (fixed effect) found that the proportion of asymptomatic cases was 17% (95% CI: 14% - 20%) overall; higher in aged care 20% (14% - 27%), and lower in non-aged care 16% (13% - 20%). Five studies provided direct evidence of forward transmission of the infection by asymptomatic cases. Overall, there was a 42% lower relative risk of asymptomatic transmission compared to symptomatic transmission (combined Relative Risk: 0.58; 95% CI 0.335-0.994, p=0.047). Discussion: Our estimates of the prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases and asymptomatic transmission rates are lower than many highly publicized studies, but still sufficient to warrant policy attention. Further robust epidemiological evidence is urgently needed, including in sub-populations such as children, to better understand the importance of asymptomatic cases for driving spread of the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Oyungerel Byambasuren","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Magnolia Cardona","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Katy Bell","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Justin Clark","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Mary-Louise McLaws","author_inst":"UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Paul Glasziou","author_inst":"Bond University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.09.20096859","rel_title":"Sensitivity of UK Covid-19 deaths to the timing of suppression measures and their relaxation","rel_date":"2020-05-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.09.20096859","rel_abs":"In this paper I examine the sensitivity of total UK Covid-19 deaths and the demand for intensive care and ward beds, to the timing and duration of suppression periods during a 500 day period. This is achieved via a SEIR model. Using an expected latent period of 4.5 days and infectious period of 3.8 days, R_0 was first estimated as 3.18 using observed death rates under unmitigated spread and then under the effects of the total lockdown (R_0=0.60) of 23 March. The case fatality rate given infection is taken as 1%. Parameter values for mean length of stay and conditional probability of death for ICU and non-ICU hospital admissions are guided by Ferguson et al.(2020). Under unmitigated spread the model predicts around 600,000 deaths in the UK. Starting with one exposed person at time zero and a suppression consistent with an R_0 of 0.60 on day 72, the model predicts around 39,000 deaths for a first wave, but this reduces to around 11,000 if the intervention takes place one week earlier. If the initial suppression were in place until day 200 and then relaxed to an R_0 of 1.5 between days 200 and 300, to be followed by a return to an R_0 of 0.60, the model predicts around 43,000 deaths. This would increase to around 64,000 if the release from the first suppression takes place 20 days earlier. The results indicate the extreme sensitivity to timing and the consequences of even small delays to suppression and premature relaxation of such measures.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"John S Dagpunar","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Magnolia Cardona","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Katy Bell","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Justin Clark","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Mary-Louise McLaws","author_inst":"UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Paul Glasziou","author_inst":"Bond University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.09.20096370","rel_title":"Chest Computed Tomography Findings in Asymptomatic Patients with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.09.20096370","rel_abs":"Background: Little is known about the damage to the respiratory system in asymptomatic patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Objective: Herein, we evaluated the findings of chest computed tomography (CT) and radiography in patients with COVID-19 who were asymptomatic. Methods: We retrospectively investigated patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 but who did not show any symptoms. Among the 139 patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized, 10 (7.2%) were asymptomatic. Their chest CT and radiographic findings were analyzed. Results: In the results, all patients (100%) had ground glass opacity (GGO) on chest CT. Further, the GGO lesions were predominantly distributed peripherally and posteriorly in all patients. In 9 (90%) patients, the GGO lesions were combined with reticular opacity. Air-bronchogram due to bronchiolectasis surrounded by GGO was observed in 8 patients (80%). Additionally, the lung lesions were dominant on the right side in all patients. Conclusions: In conclusion, considering our results that the lung is affected in asymptomatic patients, it will be necessary to extend the indications of COVID-19 testing for effective management of COVID-19 during the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Min Cheol Chang","author_inst":"Yeungnam University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jian Hur","author_inst":"Yeungnam University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Donghwi Park","author_inst":"Ulsan University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Justin Clark","author_inst":"Bond University"},{"author_name":"Mary-Louise McLaws","author_inst":"UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Paul Glasziou","author_inst":"Bond University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.15.077313","rel_title":"CoV-AbDab: the Coronavirus Antibody Database","rel_date":"2020-05-15","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.15.077313","rel_abs":"The emergence of a novel strain of betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has led to a pandemic that has been associated with hundreds of thousands of deaths. Research is ongoing around the world to create vaccines and therapies to minimise rates of disease spread and mortality. Crucial to these efforts are molecular characterisations of neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Such antibodies would be valuable for measuring vaccine efficacy, diagnosing exposure, and developing effective biotherapeutics. Here, we describe our new database, CoV-AbDab, which already contains data on over 380 published\/patented antibodies and nanobodies known to bind to at least one betacoronavirus. This database is the first consolidation of antibodies known to bind SARS-CoV-2 and other betacoronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. We supply relevant metadata such as evidence of cross-neutralisation, antibody\/nanobody origin, full variable domain sequence (where available) and germline assignments, epitope region, links to relevant PDB entries, homology models, and source literature. Our preliminary analysis exemplifies a spectrum of potential applications for the database, including identifying characteristic germline usage biases in receptor-binding domain antibodies and contextualising the diagnostic value of the SARS-CoV binding CDRH3s through comparison to over 500 million antibody sequences from SARS-CoV serologically naive individuals. Community submissions are invited to ensure CoV-AbDab is efficiently updated with the growing body of data analysing SARS-CoV-2.

Methods: Only confirmed COVID-19 cases who are Vietnamese and locally infected with available data on date of symptom onset and clearly defined window of possible SARS-CoV-2 exposure were included. We used three parametric forms with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method for Bayesian Inference to estimate incubation period for Vietnamese COVID-19 cases. Leave-one-out Information Criterion was used to assess the performance of three models. Results: A total of 19 cases identified from 23 Jan 2020 to 13 April 2020 was included in our analysis. Average incubation periods estimated using different distribution model ranged from 6.0 days to 6.4 days with the Weibull distribution demonstrated the best fit to the data. The estimated mean of incubation period using Weibull distribution model was 6.4 days (95% credible interval (CI): 4.89 - 8.5), standard deviation (SD) was 3.05 (95%CI 3.05 - 5.30), median was 5.6, ranges from 1.35 to 13.04 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentiles). Extreme estimation of incubation periods is within 14 days from possible infection. Conclusion: This analysis provides evidence for an average incubation period for COVID-19 of approximately 6.4 days. Our findings support existing guidelines for 14 days of quarantine of persons potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Although for extreme cases, the quarantine period should be extended up to three weeks.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Long Viet Bui","author_inst":"Center for Research - Consulting and Support of Community Health"},{"author_name":"Ha Thu Nguyen","author_inst":"108 Millitary Central Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Hagai Levine","author_inst":"Hebrew University-Hadassah"},{"author_name":"Ha Nguyen","author_inst":"People's Police Academy, Hanoi, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Thu Anh Nguyen","author_inst":"Woolcock Institute of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Thuy Phuong Nguyen","author_inst":"Menzies Institute for Medical Research, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Australia"},{"author_name":"Truong Nguyen","author_inst":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Hanoi, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Toan Thi Thanh Do","author_inst":"Hanoi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ngoc Pham Tuan","author_inst":"198 Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Hanh My Bui","author_inst":"Hanoi Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.11.20096263","rel_title":"Reappearance of Effector T Cells Predicts Successful Recovery from COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.11.20096263","rel_abs":"Background: Elucidating the role of T cell responses in COVID-19 is of utmost importance to understand the clearance of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: 90 individuals were enrolled in this study, 30 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 60 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC). Using two comprehensive 11-color flow cytometric panels conforming to Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) and approved for clinical diagnostics, we longitudinally examined cell count differences in lymphocyte populations and T cell activation in COVID-19 patients. Findings: Absolute numbers of lymphocyte subsets were differentially decreased in COVID-19 patients according to clinical severity. In severe disease (SD) patients, all lymphocyte subsets were reduced, whilst in mild disease (MD) NK, NKT and {gamma}{delta} T cells were at the level of HC. Additionally, we provide evidence of T cell activation in MD but not SD, when compared to HC. Interestingly, follow up samples revealed a marked increase in effector T cells and memory subsets in convalescing but not in non-convalescing patients. Interpretation: Our data suggest that activation and expansion of innate and adaptive lymphocytes play a major role in COVID-19. Additionally, recovery is associated with formation of T cell memory as suggested by the missing formation of effector and central memory T cells in SD but not in MD. Our data imply that the presence of SARS-CoV-2 responsive T cells contributes to convalescence in MD. Thus, understanding the T cell-response in the context of clinical severity might serve as foundation to overcome the lack of effective anti-viral immune response in severely affected COVID-19 patients and can offer prognostic value as biomarker for disease outcome and control.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ivan Odak","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, Hannover Medical School, Germany"},{"author_name":"Joana Barros-Martins","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, Hannover Medical School, Germany"},{"author_name":"Berislav Bosnjak","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, Hannover Medical School, Germany"},{"author_name":"Klaus Stahl","author_inst":"Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Endocrinology, Hannover Medical School, Germany"},{"author_name":"Sascha David","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Hypertension, Hannover Medical School, Germany"},{"author_name":"Olaf Wiesner","author_inst":"Department of Pneumology and German Center of Lung Research (DZL), Hannover Medical School, Germany"},{"author_name":"Markus Busch","author_inst":"Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Endocrinology, Hannover Medical School, Germany"},{"author_name":"Marius M Hoeper","author_inst":"Department of Pneumology and German Center of Lung Research (DZL), Hannover Medical School, Germany"},{"author_name":"Isabell Pink","author_inst":"Department of Pneumology and German Center of Lung Research (DZL), Hannover Medical School, Germany"},{"author_name":"Tobias Welte","author_inst":"Department of Pneumology and German Center of Lung Research (DZL), Hannover Medical School, Germany"},{"author_name":"Markus Cornberg","author_inst":"Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Endocrinology, Hannover Medical School, Germany; Centre for Individualised Infection Medicine (CiiM), Hannover, G"},{"author_name":"Matthias Stoll","author_inst":"Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Hannover Medical School, Germany"},{"author_name":"Lilia Goudeva","author_inst":"Institute of Transfusion Medicine and Transplant Engineering, Hannover Medical School, Germany"},{"author_name":"Rainer Blasczyk","author_inst":"Institute of Transfusion Medicine and Transplant Engineering, Hannover Medical School, Germany"},{"author_name":"Arnold Ganser","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Germany"},{"author_name":"Immo Prinz","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, Hannover Medical School, Germany; Centre for Individualised Infection Medicine (CiiM), Hannover, Germany; Cluster of Excellence RESIST "},{"author_name":"Reinhold Foerster","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, Hannover Medical School, Germany; Centre for Individualised Infection Medicine (CiiM), Hannover, Germany; Cluster of Excellence RESIST "},{"author_name":"Christian Koenecke","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Germany; Centre for Individualised Infection Medicine (Ci"},{"author_name":"Christian R Schultze-Florey","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology, Hannover Medical School, Germany; Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.11.20093096","rel_title":"Risk factors for clinical progression in patients with COVID-19: a retrospective study of electronic health record data in the United Kingdom","rel_date":"2020-05-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.11.20093096","rel_abs":"Background: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak presents a significant threat to global health. A better understanding of patient clinical profiles is essential to drive efficient and timely health service strategies. In this study, we aimed to identify risk factors for a higher susceptibility to symptomatic presentation with COVID-19 and a transition to severe disease. Methods: We analysed data on 2756 patients admitted to Chelsea & Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust between 1st January and 23rd April 2020. We compared differences in characteristics between patients designated positive for COVID-19 and patients designated negative on hospitalisation and derived a multivariable logistic regression model to identify risk factors for predicting risk of symptomatic COVID-19. For patients with COVID-19, we used univariable and multivariable logistic regression to identify risk factors associated with progression to severe disease defined by: 1) admission to the hospital AICU, 2) the need for mechanical ventilation, 3) in-hospital mortality, and 4) at least one measurement of elevated D-dimer (equal or superior to 1,000 ug\/L) indicative of increased risk of venous thromboembolism. Results: The patient population consisted of 1148 COVID-19 positive and 1608 COVID-19 negative patients. Age, sex, self-reported ethnicity, C-reactive protein, white blood cell count, respiratory rate, body temperature, and systolic blood pressure formed the most parsimonious model for predicting risk of symptomatic COVID-19 at hospital admission. Among 1148 patients with COVID-19, 116 (10.1%) were admitted to the AICU, 71 (6.2%) required mechanical ventilation, 368 (32.1%) had at least one record of D-dimer levels [&ge;]1,000 g\/L, and 118 patients died. In the multivariable logistic regression, age (OR = 0.953 per 1 year, 95% CI: 0.937-0.968) C-reactive protein (OR = 1.004 per 1 mg\/L, 95% CI: 1.002-1.007), and white blood cell counts (OR = 1.059 per 109\/L, 95% CI: 1.010-1.111) were found to be associated with admission to the AICU. Age (OR = 0.973 per 1 year, 95% CI: 0.955-0.990), C-reactive protein (OR = 1.003 per 1 mg\/L, 95% CI: 1.000-1.006) and sodium (OR = 0.915 per 1 mmol\/L, 0.868-0.962) were associated with mechanical ventilation. Age (OR = 1.023 per 1 year, 95% CI: 1.004-1.043), CRP (OR = 1.004 per 1 mg\/L, 95% CI: 1.002-1.006), and body temperature (OR = 0.723 per 1oC, 95% CI: 0.541-0.958) were associated with elevated D-dimer. For mortality, we observed associations with age (OR = 1.060 per 1 year, 95% CI: 1.040-1.082), female sex (OR = 0.442, 95% CI: 0.442, 95% CI: 0.245-0.777), Asian ethnic background (OR = 2.237 vs White ethnic background, 95% CI: 1.111-4.510), C-reactive protein (OR = 1.004 per 1 mg\/L, 95% CI: 1.001-1.006), sodium (OR = 1.038 per 1 mmol\/L, 95% CI: 1.001-1.006), and respiratory rate (OR = 1.054 per 1 breath\/min, 95% CI: 1.024-1.087). Conclusion: Our analysis suggests there are several demographic, clinical and laboratory findings associated with a symptomatic presentation of COVID-19. Moreover, significant associations between patient deterioration were found with age, sex and specific blood markers, chiefly C-reactive protein, and could help early identification of patients at risk of poorer prognosis. Further work is required to clarify the extent to which our observations are relevant beyond current settings.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robert A Fletcher","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Thomas Matcham","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Marta Tib\u00farcio","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Arseni Anisimovich","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Stojan Jovanovi\u0107","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Luca Albergante","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Nadezda Lipunova","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Anne Hancock","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Lucy Mackillop","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE.

This clinical figure is significantly different from that of anosmia after upper respiratory infection, which occurs in only a small proportion of patients and does not recover or requires months to recover. The background mechanisms of COVID-19 induced olfactory dysfunction have not been elucidated.Methods To address the unique pathophysiology of olfactory dysfunction associated with COVID-19, we examined the existence and distribution of ACE2 (virus binding receptor), TMPRSS2 and Furin (proteases to facilitate virus entry) in the nasal mucosa, composed of the respiratory mucosa (RM) and olfactory mucosa (OM), and the olfactory bulb (OB) in mouse and human tissues by immunohistochemistry and gene analyses.Results Ace2, Tmprss2, and Furin gene expressions were confirmed in the nasal mucosa and OB. ACE2 was widely expressed all in the RM, OM and OB. Co-expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and Furin was observed in the RM including the RE and subepithelial glands and in the OM, especially in the supporting cells on the olfactory epithelium and the Bowman\u2019s glands. Notably, the olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) in the OM were positive for ACE2 but almost negative for TMPRSS2 and Furin. The cells in the OB expressed ACE2 strongly and Furin weakly and did not express TMPRSS2.Conclusions ACE2 was widely expressed in the RM, OM and OB, but TMPRSS2 and Furin were expressed in certain types of cells and were absent in the ORNs. These findings, together with clinically reported ones, suggest that COVID-19 related anosmia can occur due to mainly sensorineural and central dysfunction and, to some extent, conductive olfactory dysfunction. That the ORNs express ACE2 but not TMPRSS2 or Furin may explain the early recovery of anosmia.Short Summary Protein expression patterns of ACE2, TMPRSS, and Furin suggest that COVID-19 related anosmia can occur due to mainly sensorineural dysfunction without olfactory neuronal damage.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rumi Ueha","author_inst":"The University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Kenji Kondo","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, The University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Ryoji Kagoya","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, The University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Shigeyuki Shichino","author_inst":"Division of Molecular Regulation of Inflammatory and Immune Diseases, Research Institute for Biomedical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science"},{"author_name":"Satoshi Ueha","author_inst":"Division of Molecular Regulation of Inflammatory and Immune Diseases, Research Institute for Biomedical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science"},{"author_name":"Tatsuya Yamasoba","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, the University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Nadezda Lipunova","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Anne Hancock","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Lucy Mackillop","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE.

This study aims to investigate factors associated with COVID-19 positivity for the first 669 UK Biobank participants; compared with individuals who tested negative, and with the untested, presumed negative, rest of the population. Methods: We studied 1,474 participants from the UK Biobank who had been tested for COVID-19. Given UK testing policy, this implies a hospital setting, suggesting at least moderate to severe symptoms. We considered the following exposures: age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, ACEi\/ARB use, prior myocardial infarction (MI), and smoking. We undertook comparisons between: 1) COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 tested negative participants; and 2) COVID-19 tested positive and the remaining participants (tested negative plus untested, n=501,837). Logistic regression models were used to investigate univariate and mutually adjusted associations. Results: Among participants tested for COVID-19, non-white ethnicity, male sex, and greater BMI were independently associated with COVID-19 positive result. Non-white ethnicity, male sex, greater BMI, diabetes, hypertension, prior MI, and smoking were independently associated with COVID-19 positivity compared to the remining cohort (test negatives plus untested). However, similar associations were observed when comparing those who tested negative for COVID-19 with the untested cohort; suggesting that these factors associate with general hospitalisation rather than specifically with COVID-19. Conclusions: Among participants tested for COVID-19 with presumed moderate to severe symptoms in a hospital setting, non-white ethnicity, male sex, and higher BMI are associated with a positive result. Other cardiometabolic morbidities confer increased risk of hospitalisation, without specificity for COVID-19. Notably, ACE\/ARB use did not associate with COVID-19 status.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zahra Raisi-Estabragh","author_inst":"William Harvey Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Celeste McCracken","author_inst":"William Harvey Research Institute, NIHR Barts Biomedical Research Centre, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Maddalena Ardissino","author_inst":"Sir Alexander Fleming Building, Imperial College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Mae S Bethell","author_inst":"North West Anglia NHS Foundation Trust, Hinchingbrooke Hospital, Huntingdon, UK"},{"author_name":"Jackie Cooper","author_inst":"William Harvey Research Institute, NIHR Barts Biomedical Research Centre, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Cyrus Cooper","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Nicholas C Harvey","author_inst":"MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Steffen E Petersen","author_inst":"William Harvey Research Institute, NIHR Barts Biomedical Research Centre, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Lucy Mackillop","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE.

In particular, we verify a given clustering result for the GISAID data set, which was obtained analyzing the molecular differences in coronavirus populations by phylogenetic trees. For this purpose, we use alignment-free dissimilarity measures for sequences and combine them with learning vector quantization classifiers for virus type discriminant analysis and classification. Those vector quantizers belong to the class of interpretable machine learning methods, which, on the one hand side provide additional knowledge about the classification decisions like discriminant feature correlations, and on the other hand can be equipped with a reject option. This option gives the model the property of self controlled evidence if applied to new data, i.e. the models refuses to make a classification decision, if the model evidence for the presented data is not given. After training such a classifier for the GISAID data set, we apply the obtained classifier model to another but unlabeled SARS-CoV-2 virus data set. On the one hand side, this allows us to assign new sequences to already known virus types and, on the other hand, the rejected sequences allow speculations about new virus types with respect to nucleotide base mutations in the viral sequences.\n\nAuthor summaryThe currently emerging global disease COVID-19 caused by novel SARS-CoV-2 viruses requires all scientific effort to investigate the development of the viral epidemy, the properties of the virus and its types. Investigations of the virus sequence are of special interest. Frequently, those are based on mathematical\/statistical analysis. However, machine learning methods represent a promising alternative, if one focuses on interpretable models, i.e. those that do not act as black-boxes. Doing so, we apply variants of Learning Vector Quantizers to analyze the SARS-CoV-2 sequences. We encoded the sequences and compared them in their numerical representations to avoid the computationally costly comparison based on sequence alignments. Our resulting model is interpretable, robust, efficient, and has a self-controlling mechanism regarding the applicability to data. This framework was applied to two data sets concerning SARS-CoV-2. We were able to verify previously published virus type findings for one of the data sets by training our model to accurately identify the virus type of sequences. For sequences without virus type information (second data set), our trained model can predict them. Thereby, we observe a new scattered spreading of the sequences in the data space which probably is caused by mutations in the viral sequences.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas Villmann","author_inst":"University of Applied Sciences Mittweida"},{"author_name":"Marika Kaden","author_inst":"Hochschule Mittweida"},{"author_name":"Katrin  Sophie Bohnsack","author_inst":"Hochschule Mittweida"},{"author_name":"Mirko Weber","author_inst":"Hochschule Mittweida"},{"author_name":"Mateusz Kudla","author_inst":"Hochschule Mittweida"},{"author_name":"Kaja Gutowska","author_inst":"Politechnika Poznanska"},{"author_name":"Jacek Blazewicz","author_inst":"Politechnika Poznanska"},{"author_name":"Steffen E Petersen","author_inst":"William Harvey Research Institute, NIHR Barts Biomedical Research Centre, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Lucy Mackillop","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE.

During the current COVID-19 pandemic, physicians in emergency rooms (ER) of many hospitals have a considerably higher patient load and need to decide within a short time frame whom to hospitalize. Based on our clinical experiences in dealing with COVID-19 patients at the University Hospital Zurich, we created a triage score with the acronym AIFELL consisting of clinical, radiological and laboratory findings. The score was then evaluated in a retrospective analysis of 122 consecutive patients with suspected COVID-19 from March until mid-April 2020. Descriptive statistics, Student's t-test, ANOVA and Scheffe's post hoc analysis confirmed the diagnostic power of the score. The results suggest that the AIFELL score has potential as a triage tool in the ER setting intended to select probable COVID-19 cases for hospitalization in spontaneously presenting or referred patients with acute respiratory symptoms.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ian Levenfus","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Enrico Ullmann","author_inst":"Department of Pediatric Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, University of Leipzig Medical Center, Leipzig, Germany"},{"author_name":"Edouard Battegay","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Mac\u00e9 M.

Moreover, very limited information is available about SARS-CoV-2 expressed regions and immune responses. In this paper an effort has been made, to facilitate vaccine development by proposing multiple epitopes as potential vaccine candidates by utilising SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome data. Here, publicly available RNA-seq data of SARS-CoV-2 infection in NHBE and A549 human cell lines were used to construct SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome to understand disease pathogenesis and immune responses. In the first step, epitope prediction, MHC class I and II gene identification for epitopes, population coverage, antigenicity, immunogenicity, conservation and crossreactivity analysis with host antigens were performed by using SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome, and in the second step, structural compatibility of identified T-and B-cell epitopes were evaluated with MHC molecules and B-cell receptors through molecular docking studies. Quantification of MHC gene expression was also performed that indicated high variation in allele types and expression level of MHC genes with respect to cell lines. In A549 cell line, HLA-A*30:01:01:01 and HLA-B*44:03:01:01 were highly expressed, whereas 92 variants of HLA-A*24 genes such as HLA-A*24:02:01:01, HLA-A*24:286, HLA-A*24:479Q, HLA-A*24:02:134 and HLA-A*24:02:116 were highly expressed in NHBE cell lines. Prevalence of HLA-A*24 alleles was suggested as risk factors for H1N1 infection, and associated with type-1 diabetes. HLA-C*03:03, linked with male infertility factors was also highly expressed in SARS-CoV-2 infected NHBE cell lines. Finally, three potential T-cell and five B-cell epitopes were selected for molecular docking studies with twenty-two MHC molecules and two B-cell receptors respectively. The results of in silico analysis indicated that proposed epitopes have high potential to recognize immune response of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study will facilitate in vitro and in vivo vaccine related research studies.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sandeep Kumar Kushwaha Sr.","author_inst":"National Institute of Animal Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Veerbhan Kesarwani Jr.","author_inst":"National Institute of Animal Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Samraggi Choudhury Jr.","author_inst":"National Institute of Animal Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Sonu Gandhi Sr.","author_inst":"National Institute of Animal Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Shailesh Sharma Sr.","author_inst":"National Institute of Animal Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Kaja Gutowska","author_inst":"Politechnika Poznanska"},{"author_name":"Jacek Blazewicz","author_inst":"Politechnika Poznanska"},{"author_name":"Steffen E Petersen","author_inst":"William Harvey Research Institute, NIHR Barts Biomedical Research Centre, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Lucy Mackillop","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE.

Using the SIR model for epidemic spread, we design and implement a method to determine the earliest time of release from lockdown restrictions, constrained by a specified threshold on the subsequent peaks of infection. Trade-offs between the threshold and the earliest times of removing lockdown restrictions are illustrated.

A critical element involves essential workforce management since current protocols recommend release from duty for symptomatic individuals, including essential personnel. Testing capacity is also problematic in several countries, where diagnosis demand outnumbers available local testing capacity. Purpose: This work describes a machine learning model derived from hemogram exam data performed in symptomatic patients and how they can be used to predict qRT-PCR test results. Methods: A Naive-Bayes model for machine learning is proposed for handling different scarcity scenarios, including managing symptomatic essential workforce and absence of diagnostic tests. Hemogram result data was used to predict qRT-PCR results in situations where the latter was not performed, or results are not yet available. Adjusts in assumed prior probabilities allow fine-tuning of the model, according to actual prediction context. Results: Proposed models can predict COVID-19 qRT-PCR results in symptomatic individuals with high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Data assessment can be performed in an individual or simultaneous basis, according to desired outcome. Based on hemogram data and background scarcity context, resource distribution is significantly optimized when model-based patient selection is observed, compared to random choice. The model can help manage testing deficiency and other critical circumstances. Conclusions: Machine learning models can be derived from widely available, quick, and inexpensive exam data in order to predict qRT-PCR results used in COVID-19 diagnosis. These models can be used to assist strategic decision-making in resource scarcity scenarios, including personnel shortage, lack of medical resources, and testing insufficiency.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marcio Dorn","author_inst":"Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Avila","author_inst":"Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"Clarice Sampaio Alho","author_inst":"Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Kahmann","author_inst":"Federal University of Rio Grande"},{"author_name":"Gregory Hart","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Katherine Rosenfeld","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Prashanth Selvaraj","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Rafael C.

The model extends a basic epidemiological model and assumes that a specified fraction of a population dons masks at a given initial number of infections. The model includes a contribution from the ocular (nasolacrimal duct) route, and does not include contributions from contact (fomite) routes. The model accommodates dose-response (probability of infection) functions that are linear or non-linear. Our motivation to study near-population-wide mask wearing arises from the concept that, between two mask wearers, the concentration of particles at inhalation should be the square of the mask penetration fraction. This combination, or team, of masks can provide a strong dose-lowering squaring effect, which enables the use of lower-efficiency, lower-cost, lower pressure-drop (easier breathing) masks. For an epidemic with basic reproduction number R0=2.5 and with a linear dose-response, the critical mask efficiency is calculated to be 0.5 for a mask adoption level of 0.8 of the population. Importantly, this efficiency is well below that of a N95 mask, and well above that of some fabric masks. Numerical solutions of the model at near-critical levels of mask efficiency and mask adoption demonstrate avoidance of epidemics. To be conservative we use mask efficiencies measured with the most-penetrating viral-particle sizes. The critical mask adoption level for surgical masks with an efficiency of 0.58 is computed to be 0.73. With surgical masks (or equally efficient substitutes) and 80% and 90% adoption levels, respiratory epidemics with R0 of about 3 and 4, respectively, would be theoretically extinguished.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alan D Kot","author_inst":"Independent Research"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Avila","author_inst":"Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"Clarice Sampaio Alho","author_inst":"Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Kahmann","author_inst":"Federal University of Rio Grande"},{"author_name":"Gregory Hart","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Katherine Rosenfeld","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Prashanth Selvaraj","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Rafael C.

However, even if most social distancing measures are continued, other public health measures will be needed to control the epidemic. Contact tracing via conventional methods or mobile app technology is central to control strategies during de-escalation of social distancing. We aimed to identify key factors for a contact tracing strategy (CTS) to be successful. Methods We evaluated the impact of timeliness and completeness in various steps of a CTS using a stochastic mathematical model with explicit time delays between time of infection and symptom onset, and between symptom onset, diagnosis by testing, and isolation (testing delay). The model also includes tracing of close contacts (e.g. household members) and casual contacts, followed by testing regardless of symptoms and isolation if positive, with different delays (tracing delay) and coverages (tracing coverage). We computed effective reproduction numbers of a CTS (Rcts) for a population with social distancing measures and various scenarios for isolation of index cases and tracing and quarantine of its contacts. Findings For the best-case scenario (testing and tracing delays of 0 days and tracing coverage of 80%), and assuming that around 40% of transmission occur before symptom onset, the model predicts that the effective reproduction number of 1.2 (with social distancing only) will be reduced to 0.8 by adding contact tracing. A testing delay of 2 days requires tracing delay to be at most 1 day, or tracing coverage to be at least 80% to keep Rcts below 1. With a testing\/isolation delay of 3 days, even the most efficient CTS cannot reach Rcts values below 1. The effect of minimizing tracing delay (e.g., with app-based technology) declines with decreasing coverage of app use, but app-based tracing alone remains more effective than conventional tracing alone even with 20% coverage. The proportion of transmissions per index case that can be prevented depends on testing and tracing delays, and ranges from up to 80% in the best-case scenario (testing and tracing delays of 0 days) to 42% with a 3-day testing delay and 18% with a 5-day testing delay. Interpretation In our model, minimizing testing delay had the largest impact on reducing onward transmissions. Optimizing testing and tracing coverage and minimizing tracing delays, for instance with app-based technology, further enhanced CTS effectiveness, with a potential to prevent up to 80% of all transmissions. Access to testing should therefore be optimized, and mobile app technology may reduce delays in the CTS process and optimize contact tracing coverage.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mirjam E Kretzschmar","author_inst":"University Medical Center Utrecht"},{"author_name":"Ganna Rozhnova","author_inst":"University Medical Center Utrecht"},{"author_name":"Martin Bootsma","author_inst":"University Medical Center Utrecht"},{"author_name":"Michiel E van Boven","author_inst":"University Medical Center Utrecht"},{"author_name":"Janneke van de Wijgert","author_inst":"University Medical Center Utrecht"},{"author_name":"Marc Bonten","author_inst":"University Medical Center Utrecht"},{"author_name":"Prashanth Selvaraj","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Rafael C.

The chosen transmission parameters are -reproduction number (R0), doubling time and growth rate during the early epidemic phase (15 days into lockdown) and 30 days into lockdown (23rd April 2020) through maximum likelihood approach. The overall analysis shows the decreasing trends in reproductive numbers and growth rate (with few exceptions) and incremental doubling time. The curtailment strategies employed by the Indian government seemed to be effective in reducing the transmission parameters of the COVID-19 epidemic. The effective reproductive numbers are still higher above the threshold of 1 and the resultant absolute numbers tend to be exponentiating fundamentally. The curtailment strategy thus may take into account these findings while formulating further course of actions.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arun Mitra","author_inst":"All India Institute Medical Sciences, Bhopal"},{"author_name":"Abhijit P Pakhare","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhopal"},{"author_name":"Adrija Roy","author_inst":"All India Institute Medical Sciences, Bhubaneshwar, India"},{"author_name":"Ankur Joshi","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhopal, India"},{"author_name":"Janneke van de Wijgert","author_inst":"University Medical Center Utrecht"},{"author_name":"Marc Bonten","author_inst":"University Medical Center Utrecht"},{"author_name":"Prashanth Selvaraj","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Rafael C.

All COVID-19 cases at the time and subsequently after, were transferred to a single center, Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital, where the patients received standardized investigations and treatments. The objective of this study was to characterize the demographics, clinical manifestations and outcomes in this unique patient population. Methods This retrospective cohort study was conducted between 24th February 2020 and 20th April 2020. All consecutive patients in the entire State of Kuwait diagnosed with COVID-19 according to WHO guidelines and admitted to Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital were recruited. Patients received standardized investigations and treatments. Multivariable analysis was used to determine the associations between risk factors and outcomes. Findings Of 1096 patients, the median age was 41 years and 81% of patients were male. Most patients were asymptomatic on admission (49.5%), 69.4% had no signs of infection and 94.6% were afebrile. Only 3.6% of patients required an ICU admission and 1.7% were dead at the study cutoff date. On multivariate analysis, the risk factors found to be significantly associated with admission to intensive care were age above 50 years old, a qSOFA score above 0, smoking, elevated CRP and elevated procalcitonin levels. Asthma, smoking and elevated procalcitonin levels correlated significantly with mortality in our cohort. Interpretation To our knowledge, this is the first large retrospective cohort study observing the characteristics of the initial consecutive COVID-19 patients of an entire country. Further, large proportion of asymptomatic patients provides novel insights into the clinical features of patients with milder disease.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sulaiman Almazeedi","author_inst":"Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sarah Al Youha","author_inst":"Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mohammad H Jamal","author_inst":"Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mohannad Al-Haddad","author_inst":"Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ali Al-Muhaini","author_inst":"Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fahad Al-Ghimlas","author_inst":"Public Health Administration, Ministry of Health, Kuwait"},{"author_name":"Salman Al-Sabah","author_inst":"Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rafael C.

COVID-19 infection has limited preventive or therapeutic drug options at this stage. Some of common existing drugs like angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have been hypothesised to impact on disease severity. However, up till now, no studies investigating this association were conducted in the most vulnerable and affected population groups, i.e. older people residing in nursing homes. The purpose of this study has been to explore the association of ACEi\/ARB and\/or statins with clinical manifestations in COVID-19 infected older people residing in nursing homes. Methods and Findings. We undertook a retrospective multi-centre cohort study in two Belgian nursing homes that experienced similar COVID-19 outbreaks. COVID-19 diagnoses were based on clinical suspicion and\/or viral presence using PCR of nasopharyngeal samples. A total of 154 COVID-19 positive subjects was identified. The outcomes were defined as 1) serious COVID-19 defined as a long-stay hospital admission (length of stay [&ge;] 7 days) or death (at hospital or nursing home) within 14 days of disease onset, and 2) asymptomatic, i.e. no disease symptoms in the whole study-period while still being PCR diagnosed. Disease symptoms were defined as any COVID-19-related clinical symptom (e.g. coughing, dyspnoea, sore throat) or sign (low oxygen saturation and fever) for [&ge;] 2 days out of 3 consecutive days. Logistic regression models with Firth corrections were applied on these 154 subjects to analyse the association between ACEi\/ARB and\/or statin use with the outcomes. Age, sex, functional status, diabetes and hypertension were used as covariates. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the robustness of our statistical significant findings. We found a statistically significant association between statin intake and the absence of symptoms during COVID-19 infection (unadjusted OR 2.91; CI 1.27-6.71; p=0.011), which remained statistically significant after adjusting for age, sex, functional status, diabetes mellitus and hypertension. The strength of this association was considerable and clinically important. Although the effects of statin intake on serious clinical outcome (long-stay hospitalisation or death) were in the same beneficial direction, these were not statistically significant (OR 0.75; CI 0.25-1.85; p=0.556). There was also no statistically significant association between ACEi\/ARB and asymptomatic status (OR 1.52; CI 0.62-3.50; p=0.339) or serious clinical outcome (OR 0.79; CI 0.26-1.95; p=0.629). Conclusions. Our data indicate that statin intake in old, frail people could be associated with a considerable beneficial effect on COVID-19 related clinical symptoms. The role of statins and any interaction with renin-angiotensin system drugs need to be further explored in larger observational studies as well as randomised clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anton De Spiegeleer","author_inst":"Ghent University, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Antoon Bronselaer","author_inst":"Ghent University, Belgium"},{"author_name":"James T Teo","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UK"},{"author_name":"Geert Byttebier","author_inst":"Bioconstat BV, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Guy De Tre","author_inst":"Ghent University, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Luc Belmans","author_inst":"Ghent University, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Richard Dobson","author_inst":"Kings College London, UK"},{"author_name":"Evelien Wynendaele","author_inst":"Ghent University, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Christophe Van De Wiele","author_inst":"Ghent University, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Filip Vandaele","author_inst":"VZW Zorg-Saam Zusters Kindsheid Jesu, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Diemer Van Dijck","author_inst":"Corilus Health IT Center, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Daniel Bean","author_inst":"King's College London, UK"},{"author_name":"David Fedson","author_inst":"Former University of Virginia, USA"},{"author_name":"Bart De Spiegeleer","author_inst":"Ghent University, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Wenjun Wang","author_inst":"1.Key Laboratory of Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of Biomedical Engineering and Translational Medicine, Chinese PLA General Hospital;

Surgical smoke can act as a carrier for tissue particles, viruses, and bacteria. To quantify airborne transmission from a physical point of view, we consider surgical smoke produced by thermal destruction of tissue during the use of electrosurgical instruments as a marker of airborne particle diffusion-transportation. Surgical smoke plumes are also known to be dangerous for human health, especially to surgical staff who receive long-term exposure over the years. There are limited quantified metrics reported on long-term effects of surgical smoke on staff's health. The purpose of this paper is to provide a mathematical framework and experimental protocol to assess the transport and diffusion of hazardous airborne particles in every large operating room suite. Measurements from a network of air quality sensors gathered during a clinical study provide validation for the main part of the model. Overall, the model estimates staff exposure to airborne contamination from surgical smoke and biological material. To address the clinical implication over a long period of time, the systems approach is built upon previous work on multi-scale modeling of surgical flow in a large operating room suite and takes into account human behavior factors.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marc Garbey","author_inst":"The Houston Methodist Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Guillaume Joerger","author_inst":"ORintelligence, GEPROVAS"},{"author_name":"Shannon Furr","author_inst":"ORintelligence"},{"author_name":"Geert Byttebier","author_inst":"Bioconstat BV, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Guy De Tre","author_inst":"Ghent University, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Luc Belmans","author_inst":"Ghent University, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Richard Dobson","author_inst":"Kings College London, UK"},{"author_name":"Evelien Wynendaele","author_inst":"Ghent University, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Christophe Van De Wiele","author_inst":"Ghent University, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Filip Vandaele","author_inst":"VZW Zorg-Saam Zusters Kindsheid Jesu, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Diemer Van Dijck","author_inst":"Corilus Health IT Center, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Daniel Bean","author_inst":"King's College London, UK"},{"author_name":"David Fedson","author_inst":"Former University of Virginia, USA"},{"author_name":"Bart De Spiegeleer","author_inst":"Ghent University, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Wenjun Wang","author_inst":"1.Key Laboratory of Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of Biomedical Engineering and Translational Medicine, Chinese PLA General Hospital;

Design: Retrospective cohort study with data extracted from the electronic records of patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to our institution. Setting: Suburban general hospital serving the most populous London borough. Participants: The first 450 inpatients admitted to our hospital with swab-confirmed COVID-19 infection. Primary outcome: The primary outcome measure was death during the index hospital admission. Results: The median (IQR) age was 72 (56, 83), with 150 (33%) over 80 years old and 60% male. Presenting clinical and biochemical features were consistent with those reported elsewhere. The ethnic breakdown of patients admitted was similar to that of our underlying local population with no excess of BAME deaths. Inpatient mortality was high at 38%. Patients over 80 presented earlier in their disease course and were significantly less likely to present with the typical features of cough, breathlessness and fever. Cardiac co-morbidity and markers of cardiac dysfunction were more common, but not those of bacterial infection. Mortality was significantly higher in this group (60% vs 28%, p <0.001). 31 (7%) of patients were classified as having hospital-onset COVID-19 infection. The peak of hospital-onset infections occurred at the same time as the overall peak of admitted infections. Despite being older and more frail, the outcomes for this cohort were no worse. Conclusions: Inpatient mortality was high, especially among the over-80s, who were more likely to present atypically. The ethnic composition of our caseload was similar to the underlying population. While a significant number of patients presented with COVID-19 while already in hospital, their outcomes were no worse.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Simon E Brill","author_inst":"Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Hannah Jarvis","author_inst":"Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ezgi Ozcan","author_inst":"Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Thomas Burns","author_inst":"Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Rabia Warraich","author_inst":"Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Lisa Amani","author_inst":"Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Amina Jaffer","author_inst":"Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Paget","author_inst":"Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Anand Sivaramakrishnan","author_inst":"Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Dean Creer","author_inst":"Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Diemer Van Dijck","author_inst":"Corilus Health IT Center, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Daniel Bean","author_inst":"King's College London, UK"},{"author_name":"David Fedson","author_inst":"Former University of Virginia, USA"},{"author_name":"Bart De Spiegeleer","author_inst":"Ghent University, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Wenjun Wang","author_inst":"1.Key Laboratory of Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of Biomedical Engineering and Translational Medicine, Chinese PLA General Hospital;

Thus, there is a need for immediate targeted actions. We designed a longitudinal study in a hot outbreak zone to analyze the serial findings between infected patients for detecting temporal changes from February 2020. In a hospital-based open-cohort study, patients are followed from admission until one year from their discharge (the 1st, 4th, 12th weeks, and the first year). The patient recruitment phase finished at the end of August 2020, and the follow-up continues by the end of August 2021. The measurements included demographic, socio-economics, symptoms, health service diagnosis and treatment, contact history, and psychological variables. The signs improvement, death, length of stay in hospital were considered primary, and impaired pulmonary function and psychotic disorders were considered main secondary outcomes. Moreover, clinical symptoms and respiratory functions are being determined in such follow-ups. Among the first 600 COVID-19 cases, 490 patients with complete information (39% female; the average age of 57 {+\/-} 15 years) were analyzed. Seven percent of these patients died. The three main leading causes of admission were: fever (77%), dry cough (73%), and fatigue (69%). The most prevalent comorbidities between COVID-19 patients were hypertension (35%), diabetes (28%), and ischemic heart disease (14%). The percentage of primary composite endpoints (PCEP), defined as death, the use of mechanical ventilation, or admission to an intensive care unit was 18%. The Cox proportional-hazards model for PCEP indicated the following significant risk factors: Oxygen saturation < 80% (HR= 6.3; [CI 95%: 2.5,15.5]), lymphopenia (HR= 3.5; [CI 95%: 2.2,5.5]), Oxygen saturation 80%-90% (HR= 2.5; [CI 95%: 1.1,5.8]), and thrombocytopenia (HR= 1.6; [CI 95%: 1.1,2.5]).

However, death counts and relative risks based on crude numbers can be misleading. Instead, age specific death rates should be used for comparability. Given the difficulty of ascertainment of Covid-19 specific deaths, excess all-cause mortality is currently more appropriate for comparisons. By estimating age- and sex-specific death rates we aim to get more accurate estimates of the excess mortality attributed to Covid-19, as well as the difference between men and women in Sweden. Design: We make use of Swedish register data about total weekly deaths, total population at risk, and estimate age- and sex-specific weekly death rates for 2020 and the 5 previous years. The data is provided by Statistics Sweden. Results: From the first week of April and onwards, the death rates at all ages above 60 are higher than those in previous years in Sweden. Persons above age 80 are dis-proportionally more affected, and men suffer higher levels of excess mortality than women at all ages with 75% higher death rates for males and 50% higher for females. Current excess mortality corresponds to a decline in remaining life expectancy of 3 years for men and 2 years for women. Conclusion: The Covid-19 pandemic has so far had a clear and consistent effect on total mortality in Sweden, with male death rates being comparably more affected. What consequences the pandemic will eventually have on mortality and life expectancy will depend on the progression of the pandemic, the extent that some of the deaths would have occurred in the absence of the pandemic, only somewhat later, the consequences for other health conditions, as well as the health care sector at large.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Karin Modig","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Marcus Ebeling","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research"},{"author_name":"Babak Amra","author_inst":"Bamdad Respiratory research center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran"},{"author_name":"Zohreh Naderi","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonology, University of Medical Science, Isfahan University, Isfahan, Iran"},{"author_name":"Shaghayegh Haghjooy Javanmard","author_inst":"Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Applied Physiology Research Center, Cardiovascular Research Institute, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isf"},{"author_name":"Bijan Iraj","author_inst":"Isfahan Endocrine and Metabolism Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran"},{"author_name":"Somayeh Haji Ahmadi","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran"},{"author_name":"Azin Shayganfar","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran"},{"author_name":"Mehrnegar Dehghan","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran"},{"author_name":"Nilufar Khademi","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran"},{"author_name":"Nastaran Sadat Hosseini","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran"},{"author_name":"Mojgan Mortazavi","author_inst":"Isfahan kidney diseases research center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran"},{"author_name":"Marjan Mansourian","author_inst":"Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya-Barcelona Tech (UPC)"},{"author_name":"Miquel Angel Mananas","author_inst":"Biomedical Engineering Research Centre (CREB), Automatic Control Department (ESAII) Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya-Barcelona Tech (UPC), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Hamid Reza Marateb","author_inst":"Biomedical Engineering Research Centre (CREB), Automatic Control Department (ESAII) Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya-Barcelona Tech (UPC), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Peyman Adibi","author_inst":"Digestive Diseases Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran"},{"author_name":"Xia Fu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, The First People's Hospital of Jiangxia District"},{"author_name":"Yanqing Fan","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Meifang Li","author_inst":"Department of Medical Imaging, Affiliated Hospital of Putian University"},{"author_name":"Na Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Chengdu Public Health Clinical Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Lin Li","author_inst":"1.Department of Radiology, Wuhan Huangpi People's Hospital;

Due to hospital closure, a lot of consulting services have been moved online. Because of the shortage of medical professionals, many people cannot receive online consultations timely. To address this problem, we aim to develop a medical dialogue system that can provide COVID19-related consultations. We collected two dialogue datasets - CovidDialog - (in English and Chinese respectively) containing conversations between doctors and patients about COVID-19. On these two datasets, we train several dialogue generation models based on Transformer, GPT, and BERT-GPT. Since the two COVID-19 dialogue datasets are small in size, which bear high risk of overfitting, we leverage transfer learning to mitigate data deficiency. Specifically, we take the pretrained models of Transformer, GPT, and BERT-GPT on dialog datasets and other large-scale texts, then finetune them on our CovidDialog datasets. Experiments demonstrate that these approaches are promising in generating meaningful medical dialogue about COVID-19. But more advanced approaches are needed to build a fully useful dialogue system that can offer accurate COVID-related consultations.

Today, it appears as a threat to human civilization. Scientists and medical practitioners across the world are involved to trace out the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 (also called 2019 novel coronavirus and referred as 2019-nCoV), its transmission route, cause of pathogenicity, and possible remedial action. In this work, we aim to find out the origin, evolutionary patternthat led to its pathogenicity and possible transmission pathway of 2019-nCoV. To achieve the aims we conducted a large-scale deep phylogenetic analysis on the 162 complete Orthocoronavirinae genomes consisting of four genera namely Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus, their gene trees analysis and subsequently genome and gene recombination analyses. Our analyses revealed that i) bat, pangolin and anteater are the natural hosts of 2019-nCoV, ii) outbreak of 2019-nCoV took place via inter-intra species transmission mode, iii) host-specific adaptive mutation made 2019-nCoV more virulent, and the presence of widespread recombination events led to the evolution of new 2019-nCoV strain and\/or could be determinant of its pathogenicity.\n\nHighlightsO_LIOrthocoronavirinae genome phylogeny revealed that bat, pangolin and anteater are natural reservoir hosts of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV\/SARS-CoV-2).\nC_LIO_LIHost-specific adaptive mutation occurred among the coronaviruses.\nC_LIO_LITransmission of 2019-nCoV to human took place by inter-intra species mode of transmission.\nC_LIO_LIPresence of widespread recombination events led to the evolution of new 2019-nCoV strain and\/or could be determinant of its pathogenicity.\nC_LI","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amresh Kumar Sharma","author_inst":"University of Allahabad"},{"author_name":"Anup Som","author_inst":"University of Allahabad"},{"author_name":"Bowen Tan","author_inst":"CMU"},{"author_name":"Zeqian Ju","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Subrato Chakravorty","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Xuehai He","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Shu Chen","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Xingyi Yang","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Qingyang Wu","author_inst":"UC Davis"},{"author_name":"Zhou Yu","author_inst":"UC Davis"},{"author_name":"Eric Xing","author_inst":"CMU"},{"author_name":"Pengtao Xie","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Marjan Mansourian","author_inst":"Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya-Barcelona Tech (UPC)"},{"author_name":"Miquel Angel Mananas","author_inst":"Biomedical Engineering Research Centre (CREB), Automatic Control Department (ESAII) Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya-Barcelona Tech (UPC), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Hamid Reza Marateb","author_inst":"Biomedical Engineering Research Centre (CREB), Automatic Control Department (ESAII) Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya-Barcelona Tech (UPC), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Peyman Adibi","author_inst":"Digestive Diseases Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran"},{"author_name":"Xia Fu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, The First People's Hospital of Jiangxia District"},{"author_name":"Yanqing Fan","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Meifang Li","author_inst":"Department of Medical Imaging, Affiliated Hospital of Putian University"},{"author_name":"Na Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Chengdu Public Health Clinical Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Lin Li","author_inst":"1.Department of Radiology, Wuhan Huangpi People's Hospital;

Virus entry into cells depends on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S). Although there is no vaccine, it is likely that antibodies will be essential for protection. However, little is known about the human antibody response to SARS-CoV-21-5. Here we report on 149 COVID-19 convalescent individuals. Plasmas collected an average of 39 days after the onset of symptoms had variable half-maximal neutralizing titers ranging from undetectable in 33% to below 1:1000 in 79%, while only 1% showed titers >1:5000. Antibody cloning revealed expanded clones of RBD-specific memory B cells expressing closely related antibodies in different individuals. Despite low plasma titers, antibodies to three distinct epitopes on RBD neutralized at half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) as low as single digit ng\/mL. Thus, most convalescent plasmas obtained from individuals who recover from COVID-19 do not contain high levels of neutralizing activity. Nevertheless, rare but recurring RBD-specific antibodies with potent antiviral activity were found in all individuals tested, suggesting that a vaccine designed to elicit such antibodies could be broadly effective.","rel_num_authors":46,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Davide F.

We have solved the crystal structure of the nsp10-nsp16 complex bound to the pan-MTase inhibitor sinefungin in the active site. Based on the structural data we built a model of the MTase in complex with RNA that illustrates the catalytic reaction. A structural comparison to the Zika MTase revealed low conservation of the catalytic site between these two RNA viruses suggesting preparation of inhibitors targeting both these viruses will be very difficult.
