Viral surveillance is costly but rarely optimized using model-guided prioritization strategies, and predictions from a single model may be highly uncertain. Here, we generate an ensemble of eight network- and trait-based statistical models that predict mammal-virus associations, and we use model predictions to develop a set of priority recommendations for sampling potential bat reservoirs and intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 and related betacoronaviruses. We find over 200 bat species globally could be undetected hosts of betacoronaviruses. Although over a dozen species of Asian horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.) are known to harbor SARS-like coronaviruses, we find at least two thirds of betacoronavirus reservoirs in this bat genus might still be undetected. Although identification of other probable mammal reservoirs is likely beyond existing predictive capacity, some of our findings are surprisingly plausible; for example, several civet and pangolin species were highlighted as high-priority species for viral sampling. Our results should not be over-interpreted as novel information about the plausibility or likelihood of SARS-CoV-2s ultimate origin, but rather these predictions could help guide sampling for novel potentially zoonotic viruses; immunological research to characterize key receptors (e.g., ACE2) and identify mechanisms of viral tolerance; and experimental infections to quantify competence of suspected host species.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel Becker","author_inst":"Indiana University"},{"author_name":"Gregory F Albery","author_inst":"Georgetown University"},{"author_name":"Anna R Sjodin","author_inst":"University of Idaho"},{"author_name":"Timothee Poisot","author_inst":"Universite de Montreal"},{"author_name":"Tad Dallas","author_inst":"Louisiana State University"},{"author_name":"Evan A.

Application includes basic laboratories and makeshift field clinics where a few drops of blood from a finger prick could be rapidly tested in parallel for the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 with a test turnaround time of only 2-4 h. To evaluate our imaging device, we probed and imaged coronavirus microarrays with COVID-19-positive and negative sera and achieved a performance on par with a commercial microarray reader 100x more expensive than our imaging device. This work will enable large scale serosurveillance, which can play an important role in the months and years to come to implement efficient containment and mitigation measures, as well as help develop therapeutics and vaccines to treat and prevent the spread of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Per Niklas Hedde","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Timothy J Abram","author_inst":"Velox Biosystems"},{"author_name":"Aarti Jain","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Rie Nakajima","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Rafael Ramiro de Assis","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Trevor Pearce","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Algis Jasinskas","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Melody N Toosky","author_inst":"Velox Biosystems"},{"author_name":"Saahir Khan","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Philip L Felgner","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Enrico Gratton","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Weian Zhao","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Colin J Carlson","author_inst":"Georgetown University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.23.112235","rel_title":"Targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease to Repurpose Drugs for COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-23","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.23.112235","rel_abs":"Guided by a computational docking analysis, about 30 FDA\/EMA-approved small molecule medicines were characterized on their inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (MPro).

Their uses in COVID-19 patients potentiate dual functions by both raising endosomal pH to slow SARS-CoV-2 entry into the human cell host and inhibiting MPro in infected cells. A live virus-based microneutralization assay showed that bepridil inhibited cytopathogenic effect induced by SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells completely at and dose-dependently below 5 M and in A549 cells completely at and dose-dependently below 6.25 M.

Computational methods to predict serodiagnostic epitopes that are specific for the pathogen could help accelerate the development of new diagnostics. A systematic survey of 27 SARS-CoV-2 proteins was conducted to assess whether existing B-cell epitope prediction methods, combined with comprehensive mining of sequence databases and structural data, could predict whether a particular protein would be suitable for serodiagnosis. Nine of the predictions were validated with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 proteins in the ELISA format using plasma and sera from patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and a further 11 predictions were compared to the recent literature. Results appeared to be in agreement with 12 of the predictions, in disagreement with 3, while a further 5 were deemed inconclusive. We showed that two of our top five candidates, the N-terminal fragment of the nucleoprotein and the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein, have the highest sensitivity and specificity and signal-to-noise ratio for detecting COVID-19 sera\/plasma by ELISA. Mixing the two antigens together for coating ELISA plates led to a sensitivity of 94% (N=80 samples from persons with RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV2 infection), and a specificity of 97.2% (N=106 control samples).","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Kim","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Institute for Protein Design (IPD), University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA."},{"author_name":"Lauren Carter","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Institute for Protein Design (IPD), University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA."},{"author_name":"Neil King","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Institute for Protein Design (IPD), University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA."},{"author_name":"Ivan Anishchenko","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Institute for Protein Design (IPD), University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA"},{"author_name":"Lynn K Barrett","author_inst":"Center for Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases (CERID), Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, "},{"author_name":"Justin K Craig","author_inst":"Center for Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases (CERID), Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, "},{"author_name":"Logan Tillery","author_inst":"Center for Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases (CERID), Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, "},{"author_name":"Roger Shek","author_inst":"Center for Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases (CERID), Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, "},{"author_name":"David M Koelle","author_inst":"Center for Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases (CERID), Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, "},{"author_name":"Anna Wald","author_inst":"Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA"},{"author_name":"Jim Boonyaratanakornkit","author_inst":"Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA"},{"author_name":"Nina Isoherranen","author_inst":"Department of Pharmaceutics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA"},{"author_name":"Alexander L Greninger","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA"},{"author_name":"Keith R Jerome","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA"},{"author_name":"Helen Chu","author_inst":"Center for Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases (CERID), Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, "},{"author_name":"Wesley C Van Voorhis","author_inst":"Center for Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases (CERID), Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, "}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.23.107334","rel_title":"Lung epithelial stem cells express SARS-CoV-2 entry factors: implications for COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-23","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.23.107334","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 can infiltrate the lower respiratory tract, resulting in severe respiratory failure and a high death rate.

Presently there are more than 800 COVID-19 clinical trials globally, many with drug combinations, resulting in an empirical process with an enormous number of possible combinations. To identify the most promising potential therapies, we developed a biophysical model for the SARS-CoV-2 viral cycle and performed a sensitivity analysis for individual model parameters and all possible pairwise parameter changes (162 = 256 possibilities). We found that model-predicted virion production is fairly insensitive to changes in most viral entry, assembly, and release parameters, but highly sensitive to some viral transcription and translation parameters. Furthermore, we found a cooperative benefit to pairwise targeting of transcription and translation, predicting that combined targeting of these processes will be especially effective in inhibiting viral production.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brian T Castle","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Carissa Dock","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Mahya Hemmat","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Susan Kline","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Christopher Tignanelli","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Radha Rajasingham","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"David Masopust","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Paolo Provenzano","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Ryan Langlois","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Timothy Schacker","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Ashley Haase","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"David J Odde","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Ryan Ungaro","author_inst":"The Dr. Henry D.

Participants 31,180 live singleton infants born in Denmark between March 12, and April 14, from 2015 to 2020 Main outcome measures The Main outcome measure was the odds ratio of premature birth, per preterm category, during the lockdown period compared with the calendar match period in the five previous years. Results A total of 31 180 newborns were included in the study period, of these 58 were born extremely premature (gestational age below 28 weeks). The distribution of gestational ages was significantly different (p = 0.004) during the lockdown period compared to the previous five years. The extremely premature birth rate during the lockdown was significantly lower than the corresponding mean rate for the same dates in the previous years (odds ratio 0.09 [95 % CI 0.01 - 0.04], p < 0.001). No significant difference between the lockdown and previous years was found for other gestational age categories. Conclusions The birth rate of extremely premature infants decreased significantly (~90 % reduction) during the Danish nationwide lockdown from a stable rate in the preceding five years. The reasons for this decrease are unclear. Identification of possible causal mechanisms might stimulate changes in clinical practice. Ideally, some cases of extreme prematurity are preventable which may decrease infant morbidity and mortality.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gitte Hedermann","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Paula L Hedley","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Marie Baekvad-Hansen","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Henrik Hjalgrim","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Klaus Rostgaard","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Porntiva Poorisrisak","author_inst":"Rigshospitalet"},{"author_name":"Morten Breindahl","author_inst":"Rigshospitalet"},{"author_name":"Mads Melbye","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"David Hougaard","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Michael Christiansen","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Ulrik Lausten-Thomsen","author_inst":"Rigshospitalet"},{"author_name":"David J Odde","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Ryan Ungaro","author_inst":"The Dr. Henry D.

Design: Ecological retrospective cohort study Setting Local authority districts (LADs) in England, Scotland and Wales (Great Britain (GB)). Participants All LAD deaths registered by week 16 of 2020. Main Outcome Measures Death registration where COVID-19 is mentioned as a contributing factor per 100,000 people in all settings, and in i) cares homes, ii) hospitals or iii) home only, in comparison to non-COVID-19 related deaths. Results Across GB by week 16 of 2020, 20,684 deaths had been registered mentioning COVID-19, equivalent to 25.6 per 100,000 people. Significant risk factors for LAD COVID-19 death in comparison to non-COVID-19 related death were air pollution and proportion of the population who were female. Significant protective factors were higher air temperature and proportion of the population who were ex-smokers. Conversely, for all COVID-19 unrelated deaths in comparison to COVID-19 deaths, higher rates of communal living, higher population rates of chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cerebrovascular disease deaths under 75 and dementia were predictive of death, whereas, higher rates of flight passengers was protective. Looking at individual setttings, the most notable findings in care homes was Scotland being a significant risk factor for COVID-19 related deaths compared to England. For hospital setting, the proportion of the population who were from black and Asian minority ethnic (BAME) groups significantly predicted COVID-19 related death. Conclusions This is the first study within GB to assess COVID-19 related deaths in comparison to COVID-19 unrelated deaths across hospital, care homes and home combined. As an ecological study, the results cannot be directly extrapolated to individuals. However, the analysis may be informative for public health policy and protective measures. From our hypothesis-generating analysis, we propose that air pollution is a significant risk factor and high temperature a significant protective factor for COVID-19 related deaths. These factors cannot readily be modelled at an individual level. Scottish local authorities and local authorities with a higher proportion of individuals of BAME origin are potential risk factors for COVID-19 related deaths in care homes and in hospitals, respectively. Altogether, this analysis shows the benefits of access to high quality open data for public information, public health policy and further research.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samuel Paul Leighton","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Danielle Jane Leighton","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"James Herron","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Rachel Upthegrove","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Cavanagh","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Georgios Gkoutos","author_inst":"University of Birmingham & Associate Director of Health Data Research UK"},{"author_name":"Breda Cullen","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Pavan K Mallikarjun","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"David Hougaard","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Michael Christiansen","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Ulrik Lausten-Thomsen","author_inst":"Rigshospitalet"},{"author_name":"David J Odde","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Ryan Ungaro","author_inst":"The Dr. Henry D.

Methods: Baseline UK Biobank data (2006-10) for England were linked to SARS-CoV-2 test results from Public Health England (16 March to 26 July 2020). Included participants were employed or self-employed at baseline, alive and aged less than 65 years in 2020. Poisson regression models adjusted sequentially for baseline demographic, socioeconomic, work-related, health, and lifestyle-related risk factors to assess risk ratios (RRs) for testing positive in hospital or death due to COVID-19 by three occupational classification schemes (including Standard Occupation Classification 2000). Results: Of 120,075 participants, 271 had severe COVID-19. Relative to non-essential workers, healthcare workers (RR 7.43, 95% CI:5.52,10.00), social and education workers (RR 1.84, 95% CI:1.21,2.82) and other essential workers (RR=1.60, 95% CI:1.05,2.45) had higher risk of severe COVID-19. Using more detailed groupings, medical support staff (RR 8.70, 95% CI:4.87,15.55), social care (RR 2.46, 95% CI:1.47,4.14) and transport workers (RR= 2.20, 95% CI:1.21,4.00) had highest risk within the broader groups. Compared to white non-essential workers, non-white non-essential workers had a higher risk (RR 3.27, 95% CI: 1.90,5.62) and non-white essential workers had the highest risk (RR 8.34, 95% CI:5.17,13.47). Using SOC2000 major groups, associate professional and technical occupations, personal service occupations and plant and machine operatives had higher risk, compared to managers and senior officials. Conclusions: Essential workers have higher risk of severe COVID-19. These findings underscore the need for national and organizational policies and practices that protect and support workers with elevated risk of severe COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Miriam Mutambudzi","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Claire L Niedzwiedz","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Ewan B Macdonald","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Alastair H Leyland","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Frances S Mair","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Jana J Anderson","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Carlos A Celis-Morales","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"John Cleland","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"John Forbes","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Jason MR Gill","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Claire Hastie","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Frederick K Ho","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Bhautesh D Jani","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Daniel F Mackay","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Barbara I Nicholl","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Naveed I Sattar","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Paul I Welsh","author_inst":"University Of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Jill P Pell","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Srinivasa Vittal Katikireddi","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Evangelia Demou","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Mark Curran","author_inst":"Janssen R&D"},{"author_name":"Carrie Brodmerkel","author_inst":"Janssen R&D"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline Perrigoue","author_inst":"Janssen R&D"},{"author_name":"Joshua R Friedman","author_inst":"Janssen R&D"},{"author_name":"Ke Hao","author_inst":"Center for Biostatistics, Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Icahn Institute for Data Science and G"},{"author_name":"Eric E Schadt","author_inst":"Center for Biostatistics, Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Icahn Institute for Data Science and G"},{"author_name":"Jun Zhu","author_inst":"Center for Biostatistics, Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Icahn Institute for Data Science and G"},{"author_name":"Huaibin M Ko","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Judy Cho","author_inst":"Icahn Institute for Data Science and Genomic Technology, The Dr. Henry D.

However, accurate estimates of the asymptomatic proportion require systematic detection and follow-up to differentiate between truly asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases. We conducted a rapid review and meta-analysis of current evidence regarding the asymptomatic proportion of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections based on methodologically-appropriate studies in community settings. Methods: We searched Medline and EMBASE for peer-reviewed articles, and BioRxiv and MedRxiv for pre-prints published prior to 05\/05\/2020. We included studies based in community settings that involved systematic PCR testing on participants and follow-up symptom monitoring regardless of symptom status. We extracted data on study characteristics, frequencies of PCR-confirmed infections by symptom status, and (if available) cycle threshold values and\/or duration of viral shedding by symptom status. We computed estimates of the asymptomatic proportion and 95% confidence intervals for each study and overall using random effect meta-analysis. Findings: We screened 270 studies and included 6. The pooled estimate for the asymptomatic proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections was 11% (95% CI 4%-18%). Estimates of baseline viral load appeared to be similar for asymptomatic and symptomatic cases based on available data in three studies, though detailed reporting of cycle threshold values and natural history of viral shedding by symptom status was limited. Interpretation: The asymptomatic proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections is relatively low when estimated from methodologically-appropriate studies. Further investigation into the degree and duration of infectiousness for asymptomatic infections is warranted.

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid19) is expanding worldwide. The characteristics of this infection in patients varies from country to country. To move forward, clinical data on infected patients are needed. Here, we report a comparison between fatalities and recovery of patients with severe Covid19, based on demographic and clinical characteristics. Methods. Between 5 March and 12 May 2020 in Mashhad, Iran, 1,278 of 4,000 suspected Covid19 patients were confirmed positive by real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay of upper respiratory specimens. We compared the demographic, exposure history and clinical symptoms of 925 survivors and 353 fatal cases with confirmed disease. Results. Mean (SD) age for all confirmed patients was 56.9 (18.7) years, 67.1 (15.9) years in fatal cases and 53.0 (18.3) years in survivors. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that the outcome of patients was associated with age (OR = 1.049, P = 0.0001, 95% CI = 1.040 to 1.057). Despite a high burden of Covid19 infections in the 30 to 39 and 40 to 49 year age groups, most of these (89.6% and 87.2%, respectively) recovered. The median (IQR) duration of hospitalization was 9.0 (6.0 to 14.0) days. The most prevalent comorbidities were cardiovascular disorders (21%) and diabetes (16.3%). Dyspnoea (72.7%), cough (68.1%) and fever (63.8%) were the most frequent clinical symptoms. Healthcare workers, of whom two (3%) died, comprised 5.2% of infected cases. Combination antiviral and antibiotic therapy was used in 43.0% of cases. Conclusions. The characteristics of severe Covid19 varied substantially between fatal cases and survivors, with diabetes and cardiovascular disorders the most prevalent comorbidities. In contrast to other studies, there were a higher number of fatalities in younger patients in our settings.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ladan Goshayeshi","author_inst":"Mashhad University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mina Akbari Rad","author_inst":"Mashhad University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Robert Bergquist","author_inst":"Geospatial Health Journal"},{"author_name":"Abolghasem Allahyari","author_inst":"Mashhad University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"- MUMS Covid-19 Research Team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Benyamin Hoseini","author_inst":"Mashhad University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"wenjun cao","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Eye & ENT Hospital, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"John Cleland","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"John Forbes","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Jason MR Gill","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Claire Hastie","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Frederick K Ho","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Bhautesh D Jani","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Daniel F Mackay","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Barbara I Nicholl","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Naveed I Sattar","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Paul I Welsh","author_inst":"University Of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Jill P Pell","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Srinivasa Vittal Katikireddi","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Evangelia Demou","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Mark Curran","author_inst":"Janssen R&D"},{"author_name":"Carrie Brodmerkel","author_inst":"Janssen R&D"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline Perrigoue","author_inst":"Janssen R&D"},{"author_name":"Joshua R Friedman","author_inst":"Janssen R&D"},{"author_name":"Ke Hao","author_inst":"Center for Biostatistics, Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Icahn Institute for Data Science and G"},{"author_name":"Eric E Schadt","author_inst":"Center for Biostatistics, Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Icahn Institute for Data Science and G"},{"author_name":"Jun Zhu","author_inst":"Center for Biostatistics, Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Icahn Institute for Data Science and G"},{"author_name":"Huaibin M Ko","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Judy Cho","author_inst":"Icahn Institute for Data Science and Genomic Technology, The Dr. Henry D.

Objective To assess if the effect estimate of any intervention improves the outcomes and safety profile. Data sources PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central were searched from December 1, 2019 to May 11, 2020. Study selection Any prospective\/retrospective clinical study on SARS-CoV-2 patients above 18 years of age with report on therapeutic interventions. Data synthesis and extraction Data was screened and extracted by two independent investigators. Main outcomes and measures The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. The secondary outcomes were rates of mechanical ventilation, viral clearance, adverse events, discharge, progression to severe disease, median time for clinical recovery and anti-viral clearance. Pooled rates and odds ratios (OR) were calculated. Results A total of 29 studies with 5207 participants were included in the analysis. The pooled all-cause in-hospital mortality rate was 12.8% (95%CI: 8.1%-17.4%) in intervention arm. There was no significant difference in mortality between both arms overall (OR: 1.36, 95% CI: 0.97-1.89). The mortality was significantly higher in the Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) group compared to control: (1.86, 95% CI: 1.38-2.50). The need for mechanical ventilation in patients with mild-moderate disease was 13.5% vs 9.8% in intervention and control groups, with no significant difference (OR: 1.58, 95% CI: 0.60-4.15).The median duration for viral clearance in the intervention arm was 6.1 (IQR: 4.3-8.8) days and control arm was 9 (IQR: 4.5-14) days, with no significant difference between the groups (p = 0.37). There was no significant difference between pooled adverse event rates in intervention and control groups: 34% vs 29.5% (OR: 1.44, 95% CI: 0.70-2.94), respectively. However, incidence of adverse events was significantly higher in HCQ sub-group (OR: 3.88, 95% CI: 1.60-9.45, I2 = 0%). There was no significant difference in other secondary outcomes. Conclusion and relevance The use of hydroxychloroquine was associated with increased mortality and adverse event rates. No other therapeutic intervention including Lopinavir\/Ritonavir, Remdesivir or Tocilizumab seem to alter the natural course of the disease. There is a further need for well-designed randomized clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Viveksandeep Thoguluva Chandrasekar","author_inst":"University of Kansas Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Bhanuprasad Venkatesalu","author_inst":"Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, Michigan, USA"},{"author_name":"Harsh K Patel","author_inst":"Ochsner Clinic Foundation, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA"},{"author_name":"Marco Spadaccini","author_inst":"Humanitas University and Research Hospital, Rozanno, Milan, USA"},{"author_name":"Jacob Manteuffel","author_inst":"Henry Ford Hospital, Michigan, Detroit, USA"},{"author_name":"Mayur S Ramesh","author_inst":"Henry Ford Health System"},{"author_name":"wenjun cao","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Eye & ENT Hospital, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"John Cleland","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"John Forbes","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Jason MR Gill","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Claire Hastie","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Frederick K Ho","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Bhautesh D Jani","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Daniel F Mackay","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Barbara I Nicholl","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Naveed I Sattar","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Paul I Welsh","author_inst":"University Of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Jill P Pell","author_inst":"University of Glasgow, Institute of Health and Wellbeing"},{"author_name":"Srinivasa Vittal Katikireddi","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Evangelia Demou","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Mark Curran","author_inst":"Janssen R&D"},{"author_name":"Carrie Brodmerkel","author_inst":"Janssen R&D"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline Perrigoue","author_inst":"Janssen R&D"},{"author_name":"Joshua R Friedman","author_inst":"Janssen R&D"},{"author_name":"Ke Hao","author_inst":"Center for Biostatistics, Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Icahn Institute for Data Science and G"},{"author_name":"Eric E Schadt","author_inst":"Center for Biostatistics, Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Icahn Institute for Data Science and G"},{"author_name":"Jun Zhu","author_inst":"Center for Biostatistics, Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Icahn Institute for Data Science and G"},{"author_name":"Huaibin M Ko","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Judy Cho","author_inst":"Icahn Institute for Data Science and Genomic Technology, The Dr. Henry D.

Evolution model considers the possibility of infections from asymptomatic, symptomatic and hospitalized individuals. Evolution model considers the possibility that individuals who have recovered from the disease become symptomatic again. Observation model accounts for underreport of cases and deaths. Observation model accounts for delays in reporting cases and deaths. Model parameters were initially estimated with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, by using the data of the city of Rio de Janeiro from February 28, 2020 to April 29, 2020. These estimations were used as initial input values for the solution of the state estimation problem for the city of Rio de Janeiro. Algorithm of Liu & West for the Particle Filter was used for the solution of the state estimation problem because it allows the simultaneous estimation of state variables and model parameters. State estimation problem was solved with the data of the city of Rio de Janeiro, from February 28, 2020 to May 05, 2020. Monte Carlo simulations were run for 20 future days, considering uncertainties in the model parameters and state variables. Initial conditions were given by the state variables and corresponding distributions estimated with the particle filter on May 05, 2020. Distributions of the model parameters were also given by the estimations obtained for this date. Data of the city of Rio de Janeiro, from May 06, 2020 to May 15, 2020, were used for the validation of the solution of the state estimation problem. The present model, with the parameters obtained with the Particle Filter, accurately fits the number of reported cases and the number of reported deaths, for 10 days ahead of the period used for the solution of the state estimation problem. The Ratio of Infected Individuals per Reported Cases was around 15 on May 05, 2020. The Indexes of Under-Reported Cases and Deaths were around 12 and 2, respectively, on May 05, 2020. The Effective Reproduction Number was around 1.6 on February 28, 2020 and dropped to around 0.9 on May 05, 2020. However, uncertainties related to this parameter are large and the effective reproduction number is between 0.3 and 1.5, at the 95% credibility level.

Methods: This systematic review will include in vitro, animal, and clinical studies evaluating the efficacy of a list of 34 specific compounds and four groups of drugs identified in a previous scoping review. Studies will be identified both from traditional literature databases and pre-print servers. Outcomes assessed will include time to clinical improvement, time to viral clearance, mortality, length of hospital stay, and proportions transferred to the intensive care unit and intubated, respectively. We will use the GRADE methodology to assess the quality of the evidence. Discussion: The challenge posed by COVID-19 requires not just a rapid review of drugs that can be repurposed but also a sustained effort to integrate new evidence into a living systematic review.

Here, we studied 181 COVIDpos and 7,775 COVIDneg patients subjected to 1.3 million laboratory tests across 194 assays during a two-month observation period centered around their SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing dates. We found that compared to COVIDneg at the time of clinical presentation and diagnostic testing, COVIDpos patients tended to have higher plasma fibrinogen levels and similarly low platelet counts, with approximately 25% of patients in both cohorts showing outright thrombocytopenia. However, these measures show opposite longitudinal trends as the infection evolves, with declining fibrinogen and increasing platelet counts to levels that are lower and higher compared to the COVIDneg cohort, respectively. Our EHR augmented curation efforts suggest a minority of patients develop thromboembolic events after the PCR testing date, including rare cases with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), with most patients lacking the platelet reductions typically observed in consumptive coagulopathies. These temporal trends present, for the first time, fine-grained resolution of COVID-19 associated coagulopathy (CAC), via a digital framework that synthesizes longitudinal lab measurements with structured medication data and neural network-powered extraction of outcomes from the unstructured EHR. This study demonstrates how a precision medicine platform can help contextualize each patients specific coagulation profile over time, towards the goal of informing better personalization of thromboprophylaxis regimen.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Colin Pawlowski","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Tyler Wagner","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Arjun Puranik","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Karthik Murugadoss","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Liam Loscalzo","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"AJ Venkatakrishnan","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Rajiv K Pruthi","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Damon E Houghton","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"John C O'Horo","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"William G Morice","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic Laboratories"},{"author_name":"John Halamka","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Badley","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Elliot S Barnathan","author_inst":"Janssen pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson (J&J)"},{"author_name":"Hideo Makimura","author_inst":"Janssen pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson (J&J)"},{"author_name":"Najat Khan","author_inst":"Janssen pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson (J&J)"},{"author_name":"Venky Soundararajan","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Ludwig Christian Hinske","author_inst":"Ludwig Maximilian University"},{"author_name":"Dennis L.

The underreporting of COVID-19 deaths in the state of Minas Gerais (MG), where is concentrated the second largest population of the country, reveals government unpreparedness, as there is a low capacity of testing in the population, which prevents the real understanding of the general panorama of Sars-Cov-2 dissemination. The goals of this research are to analyze the causes of deaths in the different Brazilian government databases (ARPEN and SINAN) and to assess whether there are sub-records shown by the unexpected increase in the frequency of deaths from causes clinically similar to COVID-19. A descriptive and quantitative analysis of the number of COVID-19 deaths and similar causes was made in different databases. Ours results demonstrate that the different official sources had a discrepancy of 209.23% between these data referring to the same period. There was also a 648.61% increase in SARS deaths in 2020, when compared to the average of previous years. Finally, it was shown that there was an increase in the rate of pneumonia and respiratory insufficiency (RI) by 5.36% and 5.72%, respectively. In conclusion, there is an underreporting of COVID-19 deaths in MG due to the unexplained excess of SARS deaths, Respiratory insufficiency and pneumonia compared to previous years.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thiago Henrique Evangelista Alves","author_inst":"Federal University of Uberlandia,  Uberlandia, Minas Gerais, Brazil."},{"author_name":"Tafarel Andrade de Souza","author_inst":"Federal University of Uberlandia,  Uberlandia, Minas Gerais, Brazil."},{"author_name":"Samyla de Almeida Silva","author_inst":"Federal University of Uberlandia,  Uberlandia, Minas Gerais, Brazil."},{"author_name":"Nayani Alves Ramos","author_inst":"Federal University of Uberlandia,  Uberlandia, Minas Gerais, Brazil."},{"author_name":"Stefan Vilges de Oliveira","author_inst":"Federal University of Uberlandia,  Uberlandia, Minas Gerais, Brazil."},{"author_name":"AJ Venkatakrishnan","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Rajiv K Pruthi","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Damon E Houghton","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"John C O'Horo","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"William G Morice","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic Laboratories"},{"author_name":"John Halamka","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Badley","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Elliot S Barnathan","author_inst":"Janssen pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson (J&J)"},{"author_name":"Hideo Makimura","author_inst":"Janssen pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson (J&J)"},{"author_name":"Najat Khan","author_inst":"Janssen pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson (J&J)"},{"author_name":"Venky Soundararajan","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Ludwig Christian Hinske","author_inst":"Ludwig Maximilian University"},{"author_name":"Dennis L.

Almost every part of the world from which the victim of COVID 19 are, have not yet been able to find out a strong way to combat corona virus. Therefore, the main aim is to minimize the spreading of the COVID-19 by detecting most of the affected people during lockdown. Hence, it is necessary to understand what the nature of growth is of spreading of this corona virus with time after almost one month (30 days) of lockdown. In this paper we have developed a very simple mathematical model to describe the growth of spreading of corona virus in human being. This model is based on realistic fact and the statistics we have so far. For controlling the spread of the COVID-19, minimization of the growth with minimum number of days of lockdown is necessary. We have established a relation between the long-term recovery coefficient and the long-term infected coefficient. The growth can be minimized if such condition satisfies. We have also discussed how the different age of the people can be cured by applying different types of medicine. We have presented the data of new cases, recovery and deaths per day to visualize the different coefficient for India and establish our theory. We have also explained how the medicine could be effective to sustain and improve such condition for country having large population like India.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Achintya Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre"},{"author_name":"Debosmita Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"Bidhan Nagar Sub divisional Hospital"},{"author_name":"Joy Mukherjee","author_inst":"Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre"},{"author_name":"Nayani Alves Ramos","author_inst":"Federal University of Uberlandia,  Uberlandia, Minas Gerais, Brazil."},{"author_name":"Stefan Vilges de Oliveira","author_inst":"Federal University of Uberlandia,  Uberlandia, Minas Gerais, Brazil."},{"author_name":"AJ Venkatakrishnan","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Rajiv K Pruthi","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Damon E Houghton","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"John C O'Horo","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"William G Morice","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic Laboratories"},{"author_name":"John Halamka","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Badley","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Elliot S Barnathan","author_inst":"Janssen pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson (J&J)"},{"author_name":"Hideo Makimura","author_inst":"Janssen pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson (J&J)"},{"author_name":"Najat Khan","author_inst":"Janssen pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson (J&J)"},{"author_name":"Venky Soundararajan","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Ludwig Christian Hinske","author_inst":"Ludwig Maximilian University"},{"author_name":"Dennis L.

Here we present an online tool for the data driven inference and quantification of uncertainties for R0 as well as the time points of interventions for 51 European countries. The study relies on the Bayesian calibration of the simple and well established SIR model with data from reported daily infections. The model is able to fit the data for most countries without individual tuning of parameters. We deploy an open source Bayesian inference framework and efficient sampling algorithms to present a publicly available GUI (https:\/\/www.cse-lab.ethz.ch\/coronavirus\/) that allows the user to assess custom data and compare predictions for pairs of European countries. The results provide a ranking based on the rate of the disease's spread suggesting a metric for the effectiveness of social distancing measures. They also serve to demonstrate how geographic proximity and related times of interventions can lead to similarities in the progression of the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Petr Karnakov","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Georgios Arampatzis","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Ivica Ki\u010di\u0107","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Fabian Wermelinger","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Daniel W\u00e4lchli","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Costas Papadimitriou","author_inst":"University of Thessaly"},{"author_name":"Petros Koumoutsakos","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Damon E Houghton","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"John C O'Horo","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"William G Morice","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic Laboratories"},{"author_name":"John Halamka","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Badley","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Elliot S Barnathan","author_inst":"Janssen pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson (J&J)"},{"author_name":"Hideo Makimura","author_inst":"Janssen pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson (J&J)"},{"author_name":"Najat Khan","author_inst":"Janssen pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson (J&J)"},{"author_name":"Venky Soundararajan","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Ludwig Christian Hinske","author_inst":"Ludwig Maximilian University"},{"author_name":"Dennis L.

As of May 8th, 2020, more than half of the world is in lockdown, 3.6 million people have been infected, and over 250,000 of them have died. This is the first pandemic in human history that has been tracked on a daily basis across the world. Currently, progress is being tracked by a series of metrics, including new cases, deaths, and the effective reproduction number over time (R(t)), which epidemiologists have emphasized. While it is an important measure, R(t) is not observable and is dependent on the absolute number of active cases; therefore, two geographies could have a similar R(t) but be having very different experiences. Here, we propose a metric to monitor progress on addressing the COVID pandemic that we name \"progress to zero\" or P0. P0 corresponds to the percentage decline from a previously recorded peak level. The metric ranges from 0% (representing a geography that has not yet peaked) to 100% (representing a geography wherein 0 cases have been recorded for at least seven days). Our metric helps leaders focus on progress to a desired goal, easily can be tracked over time, can quickly identify retreat from progress, and is comparable across geographies regardless of their size.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Juan M Lavista Ferres","author_inst":"Microsoft"},{"author_name":"Ruth B Etzioni","author_inst":"Fred Hutch"},{"author_name":"William B.

Model the effect of partial and full reversal of containment measures on COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in Ecuador. Methods. Susceptible, Infected, Recovered (SIR) models were used to simulate the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 before and after the implementation (and reversal) of containment measures. A Healthcare Compartmental Epidemic Model (HeCEM), which accounts for Hospital and Intensive Care Unit admission rates, was developed to also simulate the effect of reversing social distancing containment measures. Reported COVID-19 cases between February 29th and April 23rd, 2020 were obtained from the Servicio Nacional de Gesti&oacuten de Riesgos y Emergencia, the national emergency management office of Ecuador. An ARIMA model was used to forecast reported number of cases based on the reported number of cases. SIR, HeCEM, and ARIMA model prediction errors were estimated. Results. SIR and HeCEM models predict that, at the moment, hospital and ICU bed needs for COVID-19 patients exceed the capacity in Ecuador. Partial or full reversal of containment measures before reaching the point where hospital and ICU beds are enough to meet the expected demand will result in secondary waves that delay reaching this equilibrium, resulting in thousands of excess deaths. Forecasts predict over 50,000 reported COVID-19 cases by July 25th, 2020. Conclusion. Partial reversal of containment measures should occur only after enough hospital and beds are available to meet the demand.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Miguel Reina Ortiz","author_inst":"University of South Florida"},{"author_name":"Vinita Sharma","author_inst":"The University of Iowa"},{"author_name":"William B.

However, the methods to quantify viral RNA and to link those quantities to the level of infection within the community vary. In this study, we sought to identify and optimize scalable methods for recovery of viral nucleic acids from wastewater and attempted to use a constitutive member of the gut virome, human-specific crAssphage, to help account for unknown levels of SARS-CoV-2 decay and dilution in the wastewater infrastructure. Results suggest that ultracentrifugation of a small volume of wastewater through a 50% sucrose cushion followed by total nucleic acid extraction yielded quantifiable virus in an area with a modest number of COVID-19 cases. Further, the ratio of log10(SARS-CoV-2):log10(crAssphage) appears to be associated with the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the Syracuse, NY area. In areas where ultracentrifuges are available, these methods may be used to link SARS-CoV-2 quantities in wastewater to levels of transmission within communities with sewer service.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hyatt Green","author_inst":"SUNY-ESF"},{"author_name":"Maxwell Wilder","author_inst":"SUNY-ESF"},{"author_name":"Frank A.

We also propose a method for forecasting case counts, which takes advantage of the common, latent information in the entire sample of curves, instead of just the history of a single country. Our framework facilitates to quantify the effects of demographic covariates and social mobility on doubling rates and case fatality rates through a time-varying regression model. Decreased workplace mobility is associated with lower doubling rates with a roughly two week delay, and case fatality rates exhibit a positive feedback pattern.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cody Carroll","author_inst":"University of California, Davis"},{"author_name":"Satarupa Bhattacharjee","author_inst":"University of California, Davis"},{"author_name":"Yaqing Chen","author_inst":"University of California, Davis"},{"author_name":"Paromita Dubey","author_inst":"University of California, Davis"},{"author_name":"Jianing Fan","author_inst":"University of California, Davis"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Gajardo","author_inst":"University of California, Davis"},{"author_name":"Xiner Zhou","author_inst":"University of California, Davis"},{"author_name":"Hans-Georg Mueller","author_inst":"University of California, Davis"},{"author_name":"Jane-Ling Wang","author_inst":"University of California, Davis"},{"author_name":"William G Morice","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic Laboratories"},{"author_name":"John Halamka","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Badley","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Elliot S Barnathan","author_inst":"Janssen pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson (J&J)"},{"author_name":"Hideo Makimura","author_inst":"Janssen pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson (J&J)"},{"author_name":"Najat Khan","author_inst":"Janssen pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson (J&J)"},{"author_name":"Venky Soundararajan","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Ludwig Christian Hinske","author_inst":"Ludwig Maximilian University"},{"author_name":"Dennis L.

However, \"flattening the curve\" had an undesirable effect, since the epidemic peak was delayed too far, almost to the government preset day for lifting restrictions (01 June 2020). If the peak indeed occurs in late May or early June, then the events of children's day and mother's day may either generate a later peak (worst case scenario), a long plateau with relatively constant but high incidence (middle case scenario) or the same peak date as in the original baseline epidemic curve, but with a post-peak interval of slower decay.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mario Santana-Cibrian","author_inst":"CONACYT - Instituto de Matematicas UNAM-Juriquilla"},{"author_name":"Manuel Adrian Acuna-Zegarra","author_inst":"Departamento de Matematicas, Universidad de Sonora"},{"author_name":"Jorge X.

Methods: A longitudinal cohort analysis of Washington State Department of Health COVID-19 confirmed case age distribution March 1-April 19 2020 for proportional change over time using chi square tests for significance (N = 13,934). Results: From March 1st to April 19, 2020 age distribution shifted with a 10% decline in cases age 60 years and older and a 20% increase in age 0-19\/20-39 years (chi-square = 223.10, p <.001). Number of cases over the eight-week analysis period were 0-19 years n = 515, 20-39 years n = 4078, 40-59 years n =4788, 60-79 years n = 3221, 80+ years n = 1332. New cases increased steadily among 0-19 and 20-39-year olds. After the peak (March 22, 2020), there was no decline among age 0-19 and a lesser decline among age 20-39 than older groups. As incidence declined in older age groups, the combined percentage of cases age 0-19 and 20-39 increased from 20% to 40% of total cases. Conclusions: Increased COVID-19 infection among children and young adults is not without serious morbidity and mortality risk to them and others they may come in contact with, indicating a targeted approach for awareness and safety measures is advisable to reduce incidence among the supposedly less vulnerable but more mobile young population age 0-19 and 20-39 years.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Judith Malmgren","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Boya Guo","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Henry G Kaplan","author_inst":"Swedish Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Paromita Dubey","author_inst":"University of California, Davis"},{"author_name":"Jianing Fan","author_inst":"University of California, Davis"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Gajardo","author_inst":"University of California, Davis"},{"author_name":"Xiner Zhou","author_inst":"University of California, Davis"},{"author_name":"Hans-Georg Mueller","author_inst":"University of California, Davis"},{"author_name":"Jane-Ling Wang","author_inst":"University of California, Davis"},{"author_name":"William G Morice","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic Laboratories"},{"author_name":"John Halamka","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Badley","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Elliot S Barnathan","author_inst":"Janssen pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson (J&J)"},{"author_name":"Hideo Makimura","author_inst":"Janssen pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson (J&J)"},{"author_name":"Najat Khan","author_inst":"Janssen pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson (J&J)"},{"author_name":"Venky Soundararajan","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Ludwig Christian Hinske","author_inst":"Ludwig Maximilian University"},{"author_name":"Dennis L.

Moderate NPIs took in Japan seemed to have reduced the COVID-19 patients and to lower death rates, thus, effects of those NPIs are worthy of investigation. We used open source data and divided the data into three periods: Jan 22 to Feb 25 (Period I), Feb 26 to Apr 6 (Period II), and Apr 7 to May 14 (Period III). We developed the SIRD model and applied the Monte Carlo Simulation to estimate a combination of optimal results, including the peak of infected cases, the peak date, and R0. For Period I, the estimated peak infected cases were smaller than the observed ones, the peak date was earlier than the observed one, and the R0 was about 4.66. For the other two periods, the estimated cases were more, and the peak dates were earlier than the observed ones. The R0 was 2.50 in Period II, and 1.79 in Period III. NPIs took in Japan might have reduced more than 50% of the daily contacts per people compared to that before COVID-19. Owing to the effects of NPIs, the Japanese society had avoided collapse of medical service. Nevertheless, the capacity of daily RT-PCR may have restricted the reported confirmed cases.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yingying Sun","author_inst":"Institute for Disaster Management and Reconstruction, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Jikai Sun","author_inst":"Department of Architecture and Architectural Engineering, Kyoto University"},{"author_name":"Henry G Kaplan","author_inst":"Swedish Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Paromita Dubey","author_inst":"University of California, Davis"},{"author_name":"Jianing Fan","author_inst":"University of California, Davis"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Gajardo","author_inst":"University of California, Davis"},{"author_name":"Xiner Zhou","author_inst":"University of California, Davis"},{"author_name":"Hans-Georg Mueller","author_inst":"University of California, Davis"},{"author_name":"Jane-Ling Wang","author_inst":"University of California, Davis"},{"author_name":"William G Morice","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic Laboratories"},{"author_name":"John Halamka","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Badley","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Elliot S Barnathan","author_inst":"Janssen pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson (J&J)"},{"author_name":"Hideo Makimura","author_inst":"Janssen pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson (J&J)"},{"author_name":"Najat Khan","author_inst":"Janssen pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson (J&J)"},{"author_name":"Venky Soundararajan","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Ludwig Christian Hinske","author_inst":"Ludwig Maximilian University"},{"author_name":"Dennis L.
