Here, with a focus on Israel, we sequenced 212 SARS-CoV-2 sequences and use them to perform a comprehensive analysis to trace the origins and spread of the virus. A phylogenetic analysis including thousands of globally sampled sequences allowed us to infer multiple independent introductions into Israel, followed by local transmission. Returning travelers from the U.S. contributed dramatically more to viral spread relative to their proportion in incoming infected travelers. Using phylodynamic analysis, we estimated that the basic reproduction number of the virus was initially around ~2.0-2.6, dropping by two-thirds following the implementation of social distancing measures. A comparison between reported and model-estimated case numbers indicated high levels of transmission heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 spread, with between 1-10% of infected individuals resulting in 80% of secondary infections. Overall, our findings underscore the ability of this virus to efficiently transmit between and within countries, as well as demonstrate the effectiveness of social distancing measures for reducing its spread.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Danielle Miller","author_inst":"TelAviv University"},{"author_name":"Michael A Martin","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Noam Harel","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University"},{"author_name":"Talia Kustin","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University"},{"author_name":"Omer Tirosh","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University"},{"author_name":"Moran Meir","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University"},{"author_name":"Nadav Sorek","author_inst":"Assuta Ashdod University-Affiliated Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shiraz Gefen-Halevi","author_inst":"Sheba Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Sharon Amit","author_inst":"Sheba Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Olesya Vorontsov","author_inst":"Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Dana Wolf","author_inst":"Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Avi Peretz","author_inst":"The Baruch Padeh Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yonat Shemer-Avni","author_inst":"Soroka Medical Center and the Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"},{"author_name":"Diana Roif-Kaminsky","author_inst":"Barzilai University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Na'ama Kopelman","author_inst":"Holon Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Amit Huppert","author_inst":"The Gertner Institute for Epidemiology and, Health Policy Research, Chaim Sheba Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Katia Koelle","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Adi Stern","author_inst":"Tel-Aviv University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"genetic and genomic medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.20.20102236","rel_title":"Convalescent plasma treatment of severe COVID-19: A matched control study","rel_date":"2020-05-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.20.20102236","rel_abs":"Background Since December 2019, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic, causing mass morbidity and mortality. Prior studies in other respiratory infections suggest that convalescent plasma transfusion may offer benefit to some patients. Here, the outcomes of thirty-nine hospitalized patients with severe to life-threatening COVID-19 who received convalescent plasma transfusion were compared against a cohort of retrospectively matched controls. Methods Plasma recipients were selected based on supplemental oxygen needs at the time of enrollment and the time elapsed since the onset of symptoms. Recipients were transfused with convalescent plasma from donors with a SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2) anti-spike antibody titer of [&ge;]1:320 dilution. Matched control patients were retrospectively identified within the electronic health record database. Supplemental oxygen requirements and survival were compared between plasma recipients and controls. Results Convalescent plasma recipients were more likely than control patients to remain the same or have improvements in their supplemental oxygen requirements by post-transfusion day 14, with an odds ratio of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.75~0.98; p=0.028). Plasma recipients also demonstrated improved survival, compared to control patients (log-rank test: p=0.039). In a covariates-adjusted Cox model, convalescent plasma transfusion improved survival for non-intubated patients (hazard ratio 0.19 (95% CI: 0.05 ~0.72); p=0.015), but not for intubated patients (1.24 (0.33~4.67); p=0.752). Conclusions Convalescent plasma transfusion is a potentially efficacious treatment option for patients hospitalized with COVID-19; however, these data suggest that non-intubated patients may benefit more than those requiring mechanical ventilation.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sean T.

Methods: We applied a simulated two-arm controlled study design to the data on compassionate use of remdesivir as a secondary analysis. Dynamics of risk states and death from COVID-19 patients defined by the six-point disease severity recommended by the WHO R&D and the time to discharge from hospital were used to evaluate the efficacy of remdesivir treatment compared with standard care. Results: Stratified by the risk state at enrollment, low-risk patients exhibited the highest efficacy of remdesivir in reducing subsequent progression to high-risk state by 67% (relative risk (RR)=0.33,95% CI: 0.30-0.35) and further to death by 55% (RR=0.45, 95%CI: 0.39-0.50). For the medium-risk patients, less but still statistically significant efficacy results were noted in reducing progression to high-risk state by 52% (RR=0.48, 95% CI: 0.45-0.51) and further to death by 40% (RR=0.60, 95% CI:0.54-0.66). High-risk state patients treated with remdesivir led to a 25% statistically significant reduction in death (RR=0.75, 95% CI: 0.69-0.82).

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of different spatial and demographic factors on COVID19 transmission and case fatality worldwide. Methods We assessed SARS CoV2 virus transmission and COVID19 related fatalities in 50 countries in all continents of the globe. Data from the COVID19 data repository of the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering, the European center for disease control and prevention, and the World Health Organization were used to obtain the daily number of cases and organize the incidence data. Disease spread, was assessed using the reproduction number of the disease across the sampled countries. R0 package of R statistical software was used to estimate the reproduction number of the COVID19 using the exponential growth method. After computing the reproductive number of each country in the study, a multiple linear regression model was fitted by taking the R0 value as dependent variable, and latitude and population density as an independent variable. Disease severity was analyzed using the case fatality ratio of COVID19. The proportion of deaths to the total numbers of cases was meta analyzed using metaphor package of R statistical software using random effect inverse variance weighting to come up with the case fatality ratio. Results We found no statistically significant association between disease spread and latitude or population density. The regression model analysis that accounted for age, population density and latitude showed that age distribution remains an important driver shaping the current distribution of COVID19 cases. The relative frequency of people above 65 years old was positively correlated with the cumulative numbers of COVID19 cases as well as case fatality ratio in each country. The multiple linear regression model fitted between CFR and the three major covariates showed that, the demographic distribution of the sampled countries is strongly associated with the case fatality ratio. An increase in the elderly population proportion by 1 percent was associated with an increase in CFR by 0.32. Correlation with proportion of populations over 65 years old is concordant with the previous findings relationship between case fatality ratio and patient age. Conclusion This analysis provides important information that can inform the decisions of local and global health authorities. Particularly, as our study confirms that death and severity of COVID19 are associated with age, in countries with the biggest outbreaks, strategies must be employed to ensure that high risk groups, such as old people received adequate protection from COVID19.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tewodros B Endailalu","author_inst":"Clinton Health Access Initiative"},{"author_name":"Fitsum W Hadgu","author_inst":"Clinton Health Access Initiative"},{"author_name":"Chen-Yang Hsu","author_inst":"Dachung Hospital, Miaoli, Taiwan."},{"author_name":"Chao-Chih Lai","author_inst":"Emergency Department of Taipei City Hospital, Ren-Ai Branch, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Amy Ming-Fang Yen","author_inst":"School of Oral Hygiene, College of Oral Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan."},{"author_name":"Sam Li-Sheng Chen","author_inst":"School of Oral Hygiene, College of Oral Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Hsiu-Hsi Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, College of Public Health, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan."},{"author_name":"Pranai Tandon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Adel Bassily-Marcus","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Bander","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Charles Sanky","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Amy Dupper","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Allen Zheng","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Deena R.

From a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the spike (S) glycoprotein isolated from the B cells of infected subjects, we identified several mAbs that exhibited potent neutralizing activity with IC50 values as low as 0.9 or 15 ng\/mL in pseudovirus or wild-type (wt) SARS-CoV-2 neutralization tests, respectively. The most potent mAbs fully block the receptor-binding domain of S (SRBD) from interacting with human ACE2. Competition-binding, structural, and functional studies allowed clustering of the mAbs into defined classes recognizing distinct epitopes within major antigenic sites on the SRBD. Electron microscopy studies revealed that these mAbs recognize distinct conformational states of trimeric S protein. Potent neutralizing mAbs recognizing unique sites, COV2-2196 and COV2-2130, bound simultaneously to S and synergistically neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus. In two murine models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, passive transfer of either COV2-2916 or COV2-2130 alone or a combination of both mAbs protected mice from severe weight loss and reduced viral burden and inflammation in the lung. These results identify protective epitopes on the SRBD and provide a structure-based framework for rational vaccine design and the selection of robust immunotherapeutic cocktails.","rel_num_authors":31,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Seth J Zost","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Pavlo Gilchuk","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"James Brett Case","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Elad Binshtein","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Rita E Chen","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Joseph X Reidy","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Andrew Trivette","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Rachel S Nargi","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Rachel E Sutton","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Naveen Suryadevara","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Lauren E Williamson","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Elaine C Chen","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Taylor Jones","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Samuel Day","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Luke Myers","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ahmed O Hassan","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Natasha M Kafai","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Emma S Winkler","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Julie M Fox","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James J Steinhardt","author_inst":"AstraZeneca"},{"author_name":"Kuishu Ren","author_inst":"AstraZeneca"},{"author_name":"Yueh-Ming Loo","author_inst":"AstraZeneca"},{"author_name":"Nicole L Kallewaard","author_inst":"AstraZeneca"},{"author_name":"David R Martinez","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Schafer","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Lisa E Gralinski","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Ralph S Baric","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Larissa B Thackray","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael S Diamond","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Robert H Carnahan Jr.","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"James E Crowe Jr.","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.21.109546","rel_title":"A high-throughput neutralizing antibody assay for COVID-19 diagnosis and vaccine evaluation","rel_date":"2020-05-22","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.21.109546","rel_abs":"Virus neutralization remains the gold standard for determining antibody efficacy.

We designed a pool of candidates based on a pre-existing and well-characterized repertoire of blood transcriptional modules. Available Covid-19 blood transcriptome data was also used to guide this process. Further selection steps relied on expert curation. Additionally, we developed several custom web applications to support the evaluation of candidates. As a proof of principle, we designed three targeted blood transcript panels, each with a different translational connotation: therapeutic development relevance, SARS biology relevance and immunological relevance. Altogether the work presented here may contribute to the future expansion of immune profiling capabilities via targeted profiling of blood transcript abundance in Covid-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Darawan Rinchai","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Basirudeen Kabeer","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Toufiq","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Zohreh Calderone","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Sara Deola","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Tobias Brummaier","author_inst":"Shoklo Malaria Research Unit, Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Mae Sot, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Mathieu Garand","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Branco","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Nicole Baldwin","author_inst":"Baylor Institute for Immunology Research and Baylor Research Institute, Dallas, Texas, USA"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Alfaki","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Matthew Altman","author_inst":"Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, University of Washington and Systems Immunology, Benaroya Research Institute, Seattle, Washington, USA"},{"author_name":"Alberto Ballestrero","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Universita degli Studi di Genova and IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa IT"},{"author_name":"Matteo Bassetti","author_inst":"Division of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy, and Department of Health Sciences, University of Genoa, Ital"},{"author_name":"Gabriele Zoppoli","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Universita degli Studi di Genova and IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa IT"},{"author_name":"Andrea De Maria","author_inst":"Division of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy, and Department of Health Sciences, University of Genoa, Ital"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Tang","author_inst":"Nepean Clinical School, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia"},{"author_name":"Davide Bedognetti","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Damien Chaussabel","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Julie M Fox","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James J Steinhardt","author_inst":"AstraZeneca"},{"author_name":"Kuishu Ren","author_inst":"AstraZeneca"},{"author_name":"Yueh-Ming Loo","author_inst":"AstraZeneca"},{"author_name":"Nicole L Kallewaard","author_inst":"AstraZeneca"},{"author_name":"David R Martinez","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Schafer","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Lisa E Gralinski","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Ralph S Baric","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Larissa B Thackray","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael S Diamond","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Robert H Carnahan Jr.","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"James E Crowe Jr.","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.21.108043","rel_title":"Open-source 3D printed Ventilation Device","rel_date":"2020-05-22","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.21.108043","rel_abs":"COVID-19 is an acute respiratory tract infection caused by a coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2.

Rapid, accurate, and easily configurable molecular diagnostic tests are imperative to prevent global spread of new diseases. CRISPR-based diagnostic approaches are proving to be useful as field-deployable solutions. In a basic form of this assay, the CRISPR-Cas12 enzyme complexes with a synthetic guide RNA (gRNA). This complex is activated when it highly specifically binds to target DNA, and the activated complex non-specifically cleaves single-stranded DNA reporter probes labeled with a fluorophore-quencher pair. We recently discovered that electric field gradients can be used to control and accelerate this CRISPR assay by co-focusing Cas12-gRNA, reporters, and target. We achieve an appropriate electric field gradient using a selective ionic focusing technique known as isotachophoresis (ITP) implemented on a microfluidic chip. Unlike previous CRISPR diagnostic assays, we also use ITP for automated purification of target RNA from raw nasopharyngeal swab sample. We here combine this ITP purification with loop-mediated isothermal amplification, and the ITP-enhanced CRISPR assay to achieve detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (from raw sample to result) in 30 min for both contrived and clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples. This electric field control enables a new modality for a suite of microfluidic CRISPR-based diagnostic assays.\n\nSignificance statementRapid, early-stage screening is especially crucial during pandemics for early identification of infected patients and control of disease spread. CRISPR biology offers new methods for rapid and accurate pathogen detection. Despite their versatility and specificity, existing CRISPR-diagnostic methods suffer from the requirements of up-front nucleic acid extraction, large reagent volumes, and several manual steps--factors which prolong the process and impede use in low resource settings. We here combine on-chip electric-field control in combination with CRIPSR biology to directly address these limitations of current CRISPR-diagnostic methods. We apply our method to the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in clinical samples. Our method takes 30 min from raw sample to result, a significant improvement over existing diagnostic methods for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ashwin Ramachandran","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Diego A Huyke","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Eesha Sharma","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Malaya K.

The CbAEs potently blocked viral infection in the extracellular milieu through their lipase activity. Mechanistic studies showed that this lipase activity directly disrupted the viral envelope structure, thus inactivating infectivity. A mutation of CbAE-1 in its lipase motif fully abrogated the virucidal ability.

The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 S protein directly interacts with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the host cell membrane. In this study, we used computational saturation mutagenesis approaches, including structure-based energy calculations and sequence-based pathogenicity predictions, to quantify the systemic effects of missense mutations on SARS-CoV-2 S protein structure and function. A total of 18,354 mutations in S protein were analyzed and we discovered that most of these mutations could destabilize the entire S protein and its RBD. Specifically, residues G431 and S514 in SARS-CoV-2 RBD are important for S protein stability. We analyzed 384 experimentally verified S missense variations and revealed that the dominant pandemic form, D614G, can stabilize the entire S protein. Moreover, many mutations in N-linked glycosylation sites can increase the stability of the S protein. In addition, we investigated 3,705 mutations in SARS-CoV-2 RBD and 11,324 mutations in human ACE2 and found that SARS-CoV-2 neighbor residues G496 and F497 and ACE2 residues D355 and Y41 are critical for the RBD-ACE2 interaction. The findings comprehensively provide potential target sites in the development of drugs and vaccines against COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shaolei Teng","author_inst":"Howard University"},{"author_name":"Adebiyi Sobitan","author_inst":"Howard University"},{"author_name":"Raina Rhoades","author_inst":"Howard University"},{"author_name":"Dongxiao Liu","author_inst":"Howard University"},{"author_name":"Qiyi Tang","author_inst":"Howard University"},{"author_name":"Ubiratan da Silva Batista","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Camila Cavadas Barbosa","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Arturo Reyes-Sandoval","author_inst":"The Jenner Institute, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, 12 Oxford OX1 2JD, UK"},{"author_name":"Luiz Felipe Leomil Coelho","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Alfenas, Brazil."},{"author_name":"Breno de Mello Silva","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Qiang Ding","author_inst":"Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Linqi Zhang","author_inst":"Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Chengfeng Qin","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Gong Cheng","author_inst":"Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Andrea De Maria","author_inst":"Division of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy, and Department of Health Sciences, University of Genoa, Ital"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Tang","author_inst":"Nepean Clinical School, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia"},{"author_name":"Davide Bedognetti","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Damien Chaussabel","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Julie M Fox","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James J Steinhardt","author_inst":"AstraZeneca"},{"author_name":"Kuishu Ren","author_inst":"AstraZeneca"},{"author_name":"Yueh-Ming Loo","author_inst":"AstraZeneca"},{"author_name":"Nicole L Kallewaard","author_inst":"AstraZeneca"},{"author_name":"David R Martinez","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Schafer","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Lisa E Gralinski","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Ralph S Baric","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Larissa B Thackray","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael S Diamond","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Robert H Carnahan Jr.","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"James E Crowe Jr.","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.21.109280","rel_title":"A previously uncharacterized gene in SARS-CoV-2 illuminates the functional dynamics and evolutionary origins of the COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-05-22","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.21.109280","rel_abs":"Understanding the emergence of novel viruses requires an accurate and comprehensive annotation of their genomes. Overlapping genes (OLGs) are common in viruses and have been associated with the origins of pandemics, but are still widely overlooked. We identify ORF3c, a novel OLG in SARS-CoV-2 that is also present in Guangxi pangolin-CoVs but not more closely related pangolin-CoVs (Guangdong) or bat-CoVs (RaTG13 and RmYN02). We then document evidence of translation from ribosome profiling and conduct an evolutionary analysis at three levels: between-species (n=21 betacoronavirus genomes), between-host (n=3,978 SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences), and within-host (401 deeply sequenced SARS-CoV-2 samples). ORF3c has been independently identified and shown to elicit a strong antibody response in COVID-19 patients. However, it has been misclassified as ORF3b, an unrelated gene in other SARS-related betacoronaviruses, leading to confusion and unfounded functional inferences. Our results liken ORF3c to other viral accessory genes and stress the importance of studying OLGs.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chase W.

Methods Three psychiatric centers in Paris and its suburbs took part in the study. We compared the number of total psychiatric emergency consultations during the 4 first weeks of the lockdown in France to the corresponding 4 weeks in 2019. We also compared the number of consultations during these 4-week time periods in 2020 and 2019 across different diagnostic categories. Findings In the 4 first weeks of the lockdown in France, 553 emergency psychiatry consultations were carried out, compared to 1224 consultations during the corresponding period of 2019, representing a 54.8 % decrease. This decrease was evident across all psychiatric disorders, including anxiety (number of consultations in 2020 representing 36.1 % of 2019), mood (41.1 %), and psychotic disorders (57.3 %). The number of suicide attempts also decreased (number of suicide attempts in 2020 representing 42.6 % of 2019). In comparison to 2019, the proportion of total consultations for anxiety disorders also decreased (16.6 % vs. 20.8 %), whilst the proportion of total consultations increased for psychotic disorders (31.1 % vs. 24.1 %). Conclusions The total number of psychiatric emergency consultations during lockdown dramatically decreased. The psychological consequences of lockdown may be delayed, indicating that psychiatric services should be prepared for a secondary increase in emergency presentations.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Baptiste Pignon","author_inst":"Albert Chenevier hospital, Creteil, France"},{"author_name":"Raphael Gourevitch","author_inst":"Sainte Anne Hospital, Paris"},{"author_name":"Sarah Tebeka","author_inst":"Louis Mourier hospital, Colombes, France"},{"author_name":"Caroline Dubertret","author_inst":"Louis Mourier hospital, Colombes, France"},{"author_name":"Helene Cardot","author_inst":"Louis Mourier hospital, Colombes, France"},{"author_name":"Valerie Dauriac-Le Masson","author_inst":"Sainte-Anne hospital, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Anne-Kristelle Trebalag","author_inst":"Sainte-Anne hospital, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"David Barruel","author_inst":"Sainte-Anne hospital, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Liova Yon","author_inst":"Sainte Anne Hospital, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Francois Hemery","author_inst":"Henri Mondor hospital, Creteil, France"},{"author_name":"Marie Loric","author_inst":"Henri Mondor hospital, Creteil, France"},{"author_name":"Corentin Rabu","author_inst":"Henri Mondor Hospital, Creteil, France"},{"author_name":"Antoine Pelissolo","author_inst":"Albert Chenevier, Creteil, France"},{"author_name":"Marion Leboyer","author_inst":"Albert Chenevier, Creteil, France"},{"author_name":"Franck Schurhoff","author_inst":"Albert Chenevier hospital, Creteil, France"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Pham-Scottez","author_inst":"Sainte Anne hospital, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Davide Bedognetti","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Damien Chaussabel","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Julie M Fox","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James J Steinhardt","author_inst":"AstraZeneca"},{"author_name":"Kuishu Ren","author_inst":"AstraZeneca"},{"author_name":"Yueh-Ming Loo","author_inst":"AstraZeneca"},{"author_name":"Nicole L Kallewaard","author_inst":"AstraZeneca"},{"author_name":"David R Martinez","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Schafer","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Lisa E Gralinski","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Ralph S Baric","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Larissa B Thackray","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael S Diamond","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Robert H Carnahan Jr.","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"James E Crowe Jr.","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.18.20101618","rel_title":"Performance of six SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays in comparison with microneutralisation","rel_date":"2020-05-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.18.20101618","rel_abs":"There is an urgent need for reliable high-throughput serological assays for the management of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Preferably, the performance of serological tests for a novel virus should be determined with clinical specimens against a gold standard, i.e. virus neutralisation. We evaluated specificity and sensitivity of six commercial immunoassays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgA and IgM antibodies, including four automated assays [Abbott SARS-COV-2 IgG (CE marked), Diasorin Liaison SARS-CoV-2 S1\/S2 IgG (research use only), and Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA (CE marked)], and two rapid lateral flow (immunocromatographic) tests [Acro Biotech 2019-nCoV IgG\/IgM (CE marked) and Xiamen Biotime Biotechnology SARS-CoV-2 IgG\/IgM (CE marked)] in comparison with a microneutralisation test (MNT). Two specimen panels from serum samples sent to Helsinki University Hospital Laboratory (HUSLAB) were compiled: the patient panel included sera from PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients, and the negative panel included sera sent for screening of autoimmune diseases and respiratory virus antibodies in 2018 and 2019. The MNT was carried out for all COVID-19 samples (70 serum samples, 62 individuals) and for 53 samples from the negative panel. Forty-one out of 62 COVID-19 patients showed neutralising antibodies with median of 11 days (range 3-51) after onset of symptoms. The specificity and sensitivity values of the commercial tests against MNT, respectively, were as follows: 95.1%\/80.5% (Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG), 94.9%\/43.8% (Diasorin Liaison SARS-CoV-2 IgG), 68.3%\/87.8% (Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgA), 86.6%\/70.7% (Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG), 74.4%\/56.1% (Acro 2019-nCoV IgG), 69.5%\/46.3% (Acro 2019-nCoV IgM), 97.5%\/71.9% (Xiamen Biotime SARS-CoV-2 IgG), and 88.8%\/81.3% (Xiamen Biotime SARS-CoV-2 IgM).

Methods: Hospital staff who had recovered from mild forms of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using two assays: a rapid immunodiagnostic test (99.4% specificity) and the S-Flow assay (~99% specificity).The neutralizing activity of the sera was tested with a pseudovirus-based assay. Results: Of 162 hospital staff who participated in the investigation, 160 reported SARS-CoV- 2 infection that had not required hospital admission and were included in these analyses. The median time from symptom onset to blood sample collection was 24 days (IQR: 21-28, range 13-39). The rapid immunodiagnostic test detected antibodies in 153 (95.6%) of the samples and the S-Flow assay in 159 (99.4%), failing to detect antibodies in one sample collected 18 days after symptom onset (the rapid test did not detect antibodies in that patient). Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) were detected in 79%, 92% and 98% of samples collected 13-20, 21-27 and 28-41 days after symptom onset, respectively (P=0.02). Conclusion: Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in virtually all hospital staff sampled from 13 days after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. This finding supports the use of serologic testing for the diagnosis of individuals who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection. The neutralizing activity of the antibodies increased overtime. Future studies will help assess the persistence of the humoral response and its associated neutralization capacity in recovered patients.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samira Fafi-Kremer","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Timothee Bruel","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Yoann Madec","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Grant","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Laura Tondeur","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Ludivine Grzelak","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Staropoli","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Francois Anna","author_inst":"Pasteur-Theravectys"},{"author_name":"Philippe Souque","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Catherine Mutter","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Collongues","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Bolle","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Aurelie Velay","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Lefebvre","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Marie Mielcarek","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Meyer","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"David Rey","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Pierre Charneau","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Bruno Hoen","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Jerome De Seze","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Olivier Schwartz","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Arnaud Fontanet","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Nicole L Kallewaard","author_inst":"AstraZeneca"},{"author_name":"David R Martinez","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Schafer","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Lisa E Gralinski","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Ralph S Baric","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Larissa B Thackray","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael S Diamond","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Robert H Carnahan Jr.","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"James E Crowe Jr.","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.18.20101709","rel_title":"Risk stratification of hospitalized COVID-19 patients through comparative studies of laboratory results with influenza","rel_date":"2020-05-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.18.20101709","rel_abs":"Background The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in December 2019 overlaps with the flu season. Methods We compared clinical and laboratory results from 719 influenza and 973 COVID-19 patients from January to April 2020. We compiled laboratory results from the first 14 days of the hospitalized patients using parameters that are most significantly different between COVID-19 and influenza and hierarchically clustered COVID-19 patients based on these data. The clinical outcomes were compared among different clusters. Results Temporal analyses of laboratory results revealed that compared to influenza, patients with COVID-19 exhibited a continued increase in the white blood cell count, rapid decline of hemoglobin, more rapid increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and D-dimer, and higher level of alanine transaminase, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and fibrinogen. Using these results, we sub-classified the COVID-19 patients into 5 clusters through a hierarchical clustering analysis. We then reviewed the medical record of these patients and risk stratified them based on the clinical outcomes. The cluster with the highest risk showed 27.8% fatality, 94% ICU admission, 94% intubation, and 28% discharge rates compared to 0%, 38%, 22%, and 88% in the lowest risk cluster, respectively. Patients in the highest risk cluster had leukocytosis including neutrophilia and monocytosis, severe anemia, higher BUN, creatinine, D-dimer, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and troponin. Conclusions There are significant differences in the clinical and laboratory courses between COVID-19 and influenza. Risk stratification in hospitalized COVID-19 patients using laboratory data could be useful to predict clinical outcomes and pathophysiology of these patients.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yang Mei","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Samuel E Weinberg","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Lihui Zhao","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Chao Qi","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Adam Frink","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Amir Behdad","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Peng Ji","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Francois Anna","author_inst":"Pasteur-Theravectys"},{"author_name":"Philippe Souque","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Catherine Mutter","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Collongues","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Bolle","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Aurelie Velay","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Lefebvre","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Marie Mielcarek","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Meyer","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"David Rey","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Pierre Charneau","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Bruno Hoen","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Jerome De Seze","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Olivier Schwartz","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Arnaud Fontanet","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Nicole L Kallewaard","author_inst":"AstraZeneca"},{"author_name":"David R Martinez","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Schafer","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Lisa E Gralinski","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Ralph S Baric","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Larissa B Thackray","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael S Diamond","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Robert H Carnahan Jr.","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"James E Crowe Jr.","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.18.20099325","rel_title":"The \"Double Eights Mask Brace\" Improves the Fit and Protection and Protection of a Basic Surgical Mask Amidst Covid-19 Pandemic","rel_date":"2020-05-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.18.20099325","rel_abs":"Study Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in widespread shortages in personal protective equipment, including N95 respirators. While basic surgical facemasks are more commonly available, their efficacy is limited due primarily to their poor face seal. This pilot study examined the impact of a rubber band mask brace on a basic surgical mask, as determined by quantitative fit testing. Methods: Subjects wearing a basic surgical facemask and the rubber band mask brace underwent quantitative fit testing using machinery designed to certify N95 mask fit. Subjects were tested with the brace anchored behind their eyes, with a paperclip behind the head, and on the side knobs of their face shields. The primary outcome measure was whether the subject passed the quantitative fit test at or above the OSHA verified standard for N95 masks. Results: Subjects (n=11) were 54.5% female, with a median height of 70 inches (IQR 68-74), weight of 170 lbs (IQR 145-215) and BMI of 24.6 (IQR 22.2-27.2), and encompassing 5 distinct N95 mask fit types. We found that 45%, 100% and 100% of subjects passed the quantitative fit test when the brace was anchored behind the ears, with a paperclip and on a face shield respectively. Conclusion: Of the 11 subjects included in the analysis, across a range of body habitus and N95 mask fit types, all passed the quantitative fit test when the mask brace was anchored on either face shield or with a paperclip. This data suggests the brace would offer an improved margin of safety when worn with a basic surgical mask.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel P Runde","author_inst":"University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Department of Emergency Medicine"},{"author_name":"Karisa Harland","author_inst":"University of Iowa College of Public Health, Department of Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Paul Van Heukelom","author_inst":"University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Department of Emergency Medicine"},{"author_name":"Brett Faine","author_inst":"Iowa College of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmacy Practice and Science,"},{"author_name":"Patrick OShaughnessy","author_inst":"University of Iowa College of Public Health, Department of Occupational and Environmental Health"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Mohr","author_inst":"University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Department of Emergency Medicine"},{"author_name":"Peng Ji","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Francois Anna","author_inst":"Pasteur-Theravectys"},{"author_name":"Philippe Souque","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Catherine Mutter","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Collongues","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Bolle","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Aurelie Velay","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Lefebvre","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Marie Mielcarek","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Meyer","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"David Rey","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Pierre Charneau","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Bruno Hoen","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Jerome De Seze","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Olivier Schwartz","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Arnaud Fontanet","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Nicole L Kallewaard","author_inst":"AstraZeneca"},{"author_name":"David R Martinez","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Schafer","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Lisa E Gralinski","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Ralph S Baric","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Larissa B Thackray","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael S Diamond","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Robert H Carnahan Jr.","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"James E Crowe Jr.","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.18.20066902","rel_title":"Doxycycline and Hydroxychloroquine as Treatment for High-Risk COVID-19 Patients: Experience from Case Series of 54 Patients in Long-Term Care Facilities","rel_date":"2020-05-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.18.20066902","rel_abs":"Importance: Patients in long-term care facilities (LTCF) are at a high-risk of contracting COVID-19 due to advanced age and multiple comorbidities. Without effective treatments, outbreaks in such facilities will become commonplace and will result in severe morbidity and mortality. The effectiveness of doxycycline (DOXY) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) combination therapy in high risk COVID-19 patients in long-term care facilities is not yet understood. Objective: The goal of this analysis is to describe outcomes after use of DOXY-HCQ combination in high-risk COVID-19 patients in LTCF. Design: Case-series analysis. Setting: Three (3) LTCFs in New York. Participants: From March 19 to March 30, 2020, fifty-four (54) patients, residents of three (3) LTCFs in New York and diagnosed (confirmed or presumed) with COVID-19, were included in this analysis. Exposure: All patients who were diagnosed (confirmed or presumed) with COVID-19 received DOXY-HCQ combination therapy along with standard of care. Main Outcomes and Measures: Patients characteristics, clinical recovery, radiological improvements, medication side-effects, hospital transfer, and death were assessed as outcome measures. Results: A series of fifty-four (54) high-risk patients, who developed a sudden onset of fever, cough, and shortness of breath (SOB) and were diagnosed or presumed to have COVID-19, were started with a combination of DOXY-HCQ and 85% (n=46) patients showed clinical recovery defined as: resolution of fever and SOB, or a return to baseline setting if patients are ventilator-dependent. A total of 11% (n=6) patients were transferred to acute care hospitals due to clinical deterioration and 6% (n=3) patients died in the facilities. Naive Indirect Comparison suggests these data were significantly better outcomes than the data reported in MMWR (reported on March 26, 2020) from a long-term care facility in King County, Washington where 57% patients were hospitalized, and 22% patients died. Conclusion: The clinical experience of this case series indicates DOXY-HCQ treatment in high-risk COVID-19 patients is associated with a reduction in clinical recovery, decreased transfer to hospital and decreased mortality were observed after treatment with DOXY-HCQ.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Imtiaz Ahmad","author_inst":"Allergy, Sleep & Lung Care, 21st Century Oncology, Fort Myers, FL"},{"author_name":"Mohammud Alam","author_inst":"Cordial Medical PC, Farmingdale, NY"},{"author_name":"Ryan Saadi","author_inst":"Center for Market Access and Medical Innovation, Warren, NJ"},{"author_name":"Saborny Mahmud","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD"},{"author_name":"Emily Saadi","author_inst":"Yale University, School of Public Health, New Haven, CT"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Mohr","author_inst":"University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Department of Emergency Medicine"},{"author_name":"Peng Ji","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Francois Anna","author_inst":"Pasteur-Theravectys"},{"author_name":"Philippe Souque","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Catherine Mutter","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Collongues","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Bolle","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Aurelie Velay","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Lefebvre","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Marie Mielcarek","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Meyer","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"David Rey","author_inst":"CHRU Strasbourg"},{"author_name":"Pierre Charneau","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Bruno Hoen","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Jerome De Seze","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Olivier Schwartz","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Arnaud Fontanet","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Nicole L Kallewaard","author_inst":"AstraZeneca"},{"author_name":"David R Martinez","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Schafer","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Lisa E Gralinski","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Ralph S Baric","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Larissa B Thackray","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael S Diamond","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Robert H Carnahan Jr.","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"James E Crowe Jr.","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.19.20086488","rel_title":"Early risk assessment for COVID-19 patients from emergency department data using machine learning","rel_date":"2020-05-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.19.20086488","rel_abs":"Background Since its emergence in late 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a pandemic, with more than 4.8 million reported cases and 310 000 deaths worldwide. While epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 have been reported, risk factors underlying the transition from mild to severe disease among patients remain poorly understood. Methods In this retrospective study, we analysed data of 820 confirmed COVID-19 positive patients admitted to a two-site NHS Trust hospital in London, England, between January 1st and April 23rd, 2020, with a majority of cases occurring in March and April. We extracted anonymised demographic data, physiological clinical variables and laboratory results from electronic healthcare records (EHR) and applied multivariate logistic regression, random forest and extreme gradient boosted trees. To evaluate the potential for early risk assessment, we used data available during patients' initial presentation at the emergency department (ED) to predict deterioration to one of three clinical endpoints in the remainder of the hospital stay: A) admission to intensive care, B) need for mechanical ventilation and C) mortality. Based on the trained models, we extracted the most informative clinical features in determining these patient trajectories. Results Considering our inclusion criteria, we have identified 126 of 820 (15%) patients that required intensive care, 62 of 808 (8%) patients needing mechanical ventilation, and 170 of 630 (27%) cases of in-hospital mortality. Our models learned successfully from early clinical data and predicted clinical endpoints with high accuracy, the best model achieving AUC-ROC scores of 0.75 to 0.83 (F1 scores of 0.41 to 0.56). Younger patient age was associated with an increased risk of receiving intensive care and ventilation, but lower risk of mortality. Clinical indicators of a patient's oxygen supply and selected laboratory results were most predictive of COVID-19 patient trajectories. Conclusion Among COVID-19 patients machine learning can aid in the early identification of those with a poor prognosis, using EHR data collected during a patient's first presentation at ED. Patient age and measures of oxygenation status during ED stay are primary indicators of poor patient outcomes.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Frank Stefan Heldt","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Marcela P Vizcaychipi","author_inst":"Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, 369 Fulham Road, London, SW10 9NH, UK"},{"author_name":"Sophie Peacock","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Mattia Cinelli","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Lachlan McLachlan","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Fernando Andreotti","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Stojan Jovanovic","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Robert Durichen","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Nadezda Lipunova","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Robert A Fletcher","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Anne Hancock","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Alex McCarthy","author_inst":"Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, 369 Fulham Road, London, SW10 9NH, UK"},{"author_name":"Richard A Pointon","author_inst":"Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, 369 Fulham Road, London, SW10 9NH, UK"},{"author_name":"Alexander Brown","author_inst":"Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, 369 Fulham Road, London, SW10 9NH, UK"},{"author_name":"James Eaton","author_inst":"Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, 369 Fulham Road, London, SW10 9NH, UK"},{"author_name":"Roberto Liddi","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Lucy Mackillop","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Lionel Tarassenko","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Rabia Tahir Khan","author_inst":"Sensyne Health plc, Schrodinger Building, Heatley Road, Oxford Science Park, Oxford, OX4 4GE"},{"author_name":"Jerome De Seze","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Olivier Schwartz","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Arnaud Fontanet","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Nicole L Kallewaard","author_inst":"AstraZeneca"},{"author_name":"David R Martinez","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Schafer","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Lisa E Gralinski","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Ralph S Baric","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Larissa B Thackray","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael S Diamond","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Robert H Carnahan Jr.","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"James E Crowe Jr.","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.19.20099317","rel_title":"Early antibody response to SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-05-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.19.20099317","rel_abs":"Background.

The analytical performance of the method used in the study (Maglumi 800, SNIBE, China) and the effect of two different serum and plasma matrices were also assessed. Results. IgG positivity was demonstrated in 100% of cases 15 days after the onset of the disease. IgM show lower concentrations and do not exceed 77% of cases after 15 days. The analytical performance of the method used was confirmed to be good in terms of imprecision, linearity, commutability in two blood sample matrices. Conclusion. The serological study through the search for specific IgG for SARS-CoV-2 results in our case series is sensitive and suitable for population research and can also play a role in diagnosis.

Methods: Information was collected on the first COVID-19 cases according to the First Few X WHO protocol. Case-control analyses of the sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of symptoms and risk factors for infection were conducted. Point prevalences of underlying health conditions among the UK general population were presented. Findings: The majority of FF100 cases were imported (51.4%), of which the majority had recent travel to Italy (71.4%). 24.7% were secondary cases acquired mainly through household contact (40.4%). Children had lower odds of COVID-19 infection compared with the general population. The clinical presentation of cases was dominated by cough, fever and fatigue. Non-linear relationships with age were observed for fever, and sensitivity and specificity of symptoms varied by age. Conditions associated with higher odds of COVID-19 infection (after adjusting for age and sex) were chronic heart disease, immunosuppression and multimorbidity. Conclusion: This study presents the first epidemiological and clinical summary of COVID-19 cases in Great Britain. The FFX study design enabled systematic data collection. The study was able to characterize the risk factors for infection with population prevalence estimates setting these relative risks into a public health context. It also provides important evidence for generating case definitions to support public health risk assessment, clinical triage and diagnostic algorithms.","rel_num_authors":32,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicola L Boddington","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Andre Charlett","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Suzanne Elgohari","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Jemma L Walker","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Helen Mcdonald","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chloe Byers","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Laura Coughlan","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Tatiana Garcia Vilaplana","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Rosie Whillock","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mary Sinnathamby","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Nikolaos Panagiotopoulos","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Louise Letley","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Pauline MacDonald","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Roberto Vivancos","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Obaghe Edeghere","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Joseph Shingleton","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Emma Bennett","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Daniel J Grint","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Helen Strongman","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kathryn E Mansfield","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher Rentsch","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Caroline Minassian","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ian J Douglas","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rohini Mathur","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Maria Peppa","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Simon Cottrell","author_inst":"Public Health Wales"},{"author_name":"Jim McMenamin","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Maria Zambon","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mary Ramsay","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Gavin Dabrera","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Saliba","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Jamie Lopez Bernal","author_inst":"Public Health England"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.18.20102509","rel_title":"Low blood sodium increases risk and severity of COVID-19: a systematic review, meta-analysis and retrospective cohort study","rel_date":"2020-05-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.18.20102509","rel_abs":"Background Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infects human lung tissue cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), and the body sodium is an important factor for regulating the expression of ACE2. Through a systematic review, meta-analysis and retrospective cohort study, we found that the low blood sodium population may significantly increase the risk and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods We extracted the data of serum sodium concentrations of patients with COVID-19 on admission from the articles published between Jan 1 and April 28, 2020, and analyzed the relationship between the serum sodium concentrations and the illness severity of patients. Then we used a cohort of 244 patients with COVID-19 for a retrospective analysis. Results We identified 36 studies, one of which comprised 2736 patients.The mean serum sodium concentration in patients with COVID-19 was 138.6 mmol\/L, which was much lower than the median level in population (142.0). The mean serum sodium concentration in severe\/critical patients (137.0) was significantly lower than those in mild and moderate patients (140.8 and 138.7, respectively). Such findings were confirmed in a retrospective cohort study, of which the mean serum sodium concentration in all patients was 137.5 mmol\/L, and the significant differences were found between the mild (139.2) and moderate (137.2) patients, and the mild and severe\/critical (136.6) patients. Interestingly, such changes were not obvious in the serum chlorine and potassium concentrations. Conclusions The low sodium state of patients with COVID-19 may not be the consequence of virus infection, but could be a physiological state possibly caused by living habits such as low salt diet and during aging process, which may result in ACE2 overexpression, and increase the risk and severity of COVID-19. These findings may provide a new idea for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yi Luo","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yirong Li","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Jiapei Dai","author_inst":"South-Central University for Nationalities"},{"author_name":"Jemma L Walker","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Helen Mcdonald","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chloe Byers","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Laura Coughlan","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Tatiana Garcia Vilaplana","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Rosie Whillock","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mary Sinnathamby","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Nikolaos Panagiotopoulos","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Louise Letley","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Pauline MacDonald","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Roberto Vivancos","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Obaghe Edeghere","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Joseph Shingleton","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Emma Bennett","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Daniel J Grint","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Helen Strongman","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kathryn E Mansfield","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher Rentsch","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Caroline Minassian","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ian J Douglas","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rohini Mathur","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Maria Peppa","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Simon Cottrell","author_inst":"Public Health Wales"},{"author_name":"Jim McMenamin","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Maria Zambon","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mary Ramsay","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Gavin Dabrera","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Saliba","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Jamie Lopez Bernal","author_inst":"Public Health England"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pharmacology and therapeutics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.17.20101915","rel_title":"Factors Contributing to Healthcare Professional Burnout During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Rapid Turnaround Global Survey","rel_date":"2020-05-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.17.20101915","rel_abs":"Background: Healthcare professionals (HCPs) on the front lines against COVID-19 may face increased workload, and stress. Understanding HCPs risk for burnout is critical to supporting HCPs and maintaining the quality of healthcare during the pandemic. Methods: To assess exposure, perceptions, workload, and possible burnout of HCPs during the COVID-19 pandemic we conducted a cross-sectional survey. The main outcomes and measures were HCPs self-assessment of burnout and other experiences and attitudes associated with working during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: A total of 2,707 HCPs from 60 countries participated in this study. Fifty-one percent of HCPs reported burnout. Burnout was associated with work impacting household activities (RR=1.57, 95% CI=1.39-1.78, P<0.001), feeling pushed beyond training (RR=1.32, 95% CI=1.20-1.47, P<0.001), exposure to COVID-19 patients (RR=1.18, 95% CI=1.05-1.32, P=0.005), making life prioritizing decisions (RR=1.16, 95% CI=1.02-1.31, P=0.03). Adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) was protective against burnout (RR=0.88, 95% CI=0.79-0.97, P=0.01). Burnout was higher in high-income countries (HICs) compared to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) (RR=1.18; 95% CI=1.02-1.36, P=0.018). Interpretation: Burnout is prevalent at higher than previously reported rates among HCPs working during the COVID-19 pandemic and is related to high workload, job stress, and time pressure, and limited organizational support. Current and future burnout among HCPs could be mitigated by actions from healthcare institutions and other governmental and non-governmental stakeholders aimed at potentially modifiable factors, including providing additional training, organizational support, support for family, PPE, and mental health resources.

All patients have been intubated in the first week from onset of ARDS and presented neurological signs of agitation and spatial disorientation after weaning from mechanical ventilation. The MRI picture and the clinical features are described. MRI lesions characteristics are unusual but demonstrate a highly consistent pattern through all the four patients with similar neurological symptoms. They do not fulfill any typical criteria for a definite neuroradiological entity. Their predominantly parieto-occipital distribution recalls posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), although the prevalent cortical involvement and diffusion MRI pattern are not typical of PRES. We speculate that this pattern may be related to a possible transient dysregulation of vasomotor reactivity.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicoletta Anzalone","author_inst":"Department of Neuroradiology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute and Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Antonella Castellano","author_inst":"Department of Neuroradiology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute and Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Roberta Scotti","author_inst":"Department of Neuroradiology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute and Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Anna Mara Scandroglio","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute and Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Massimo Filippi","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute and Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Fabio Ciceri","author_inst":"Department of Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute and Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Moreno Tresoldi","author_inst":"Unit of General Medicine and Advanced Care, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Andrea Falini","author_inst":"Department of Neuroradiology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute and Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Michael Abern","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Chicago"},{"author_name":"Martin Eklund","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Hari Vigneswaran","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Stevan M Weine","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Chicago"},{"author_name":"Pauline MacDonald","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Roberto Vivancos","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Obaghe Edeghere","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Joseph Shingleton","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Emma Bennett","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Daniel J Grint","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Helen Strongman","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kathryn E Mansfield","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher Rentsch","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Caroline Minassian","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ian J Douglas","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rohini Mathur","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Maria Peppa","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Simon Cottrell","author_inst":"Public Health Wales"},{"author_name":"Jim McMenamin","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Maria Zambon","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mary Ramsay","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Gavin Dabrera","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Saliba","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Jamie Lopez Bernal","author_inst":"Public Health England"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"radiology and imaging"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.17.20104562","rel_title":"COVID 19 in Bangladesh: Assumption of possible infection and death","rel_date":"2020-05-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.17.20104562","rel_abs":"Abstract: It is a painful job to predict the death of people. But sometimes it is important to predict the future and concern the government. A furious future is waiting for Bangladesh. Objective: Objective of the study is to assume the number of positive case and death till 30th December, 2020 in Bangladesh. Study design: This study was designed with systematic review and data analysis. Method: The study was completed by analyzing data available on website. First COVID 19 case in Bangladesh was identified on 8th March. Analyzing the data increasing rate\/common ratio of infection and death has been identified. Then this common ratio has been used in the formula of multiplication series. Data of China, Iran, Italy and the USA was also analyzed to assume how the death and case number increased. Social issues of Bangladesh were also analyzed. Considering all these the assumption was made. Result: It has been assumed that by the 43rd week (on 30th December, 2020) of first identification the total case can be 17024322 and total death can be 86265 by 30 December, 2020. As this is an assumption this can be true, partially true or false. But the base of assumption is strong enough so the possibility of being true or nearly true is higher. Policy Suggestion: Government should choose properly one between two options. Either government should declare curfew or let people lead normal life. A very weak lock down for a long time does not make any sense.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sadik Hasan Shuvo","author_inst":"Jatiya Kabi Kazi Nazrul Islam University"},{"author_name":"Antonella Castellano","author_inst":"Department of Neuroradiology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute and Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Roberta Scotti","author_inst":"Department of Neuroradiology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute and Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Anna Mara Scandroglio","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute and Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Massimo Filippi","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute and Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Fabio Ciceri","author_inst":"Department of Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute and Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Moreno Tresoldi","author_inst":"Unit of General Medicine and Advanced Care, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Andrea Falini","author_inst":"Department of Neuroradiology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute and Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Michael Abern","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Chicago"},{"author_name":"Martin Eklund","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Hari Vigneswaran","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Stevan M Weine","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Chicago"},{"author_name":"Pauline MacDonald","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Roberto Vivancos","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Obaghe Edeghere","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Joseph Shingleton","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Emma Bennett","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Daniel J Grint","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Helen Strongman","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kathryn E Mansfield","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher Rentsch","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Caroline Minassian","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ian J Douglas","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rohini Mathur","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Maria Peppa","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Simon Cottrell","author_inst":"Public Health Wales"},{"author_name":"Jim McMenamin","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Maria Zambon","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mary Ramsay","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Gavin Dabrera","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Saliba","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Jamie Lopez Bernal","author_inst":"Public Health England"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"}]}
