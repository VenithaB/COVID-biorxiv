It is often not easy to study the transmission onset time, as is difficult to know who infected whom exactly when. Methods We inferred transmission onset time from 72 infector-infectee pairs in South Korea, either with known or inferred contact dates by means of incubation period. Combining this data with known information of infector's symptom onset, we could generate the transmission onset distribution of COVID-19, using Bayesian methods. Serial interval distribution could be automatically estimated from our data. Results We estimated the median transmission onset to be 1.31 days (standard deviation, 2.64 days) after symptom onset with peak at 0.72 days before symptom onset. The pre-symptomatic transmission proportion was 37% (95% credible interval [CI], 16-52%). The median incubation period was estimated to be 2.87 days (95% CI, 2.33-3.50 days) and the median serial interval to be 3.56 days (95% CI, 2.72-4.44 days). Conclusions Considering the transmission onset distribution peaked with the symptom onset and the pre-symptomatic transmission proportion is substantial, the usual preventive measure might be too late to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"June Young Chun","author_inst":"National Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Gyuseung Baek","author_inst":"Seoul National University"},{"author_name":"Yongdai Kim","author_inst":"Seoul National University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.14.20100537","rel_title":"Projecting Demand-Supply Gap of Hospital Capacity in India in the face of COVID-19 pandemic using Age-Structured Deterministic SEIR model","rel_date":"2020-05-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.14.20100537","rel_abs":"BACKGROUND: Due to uncertainties encompassing the transmission dynamics of COVID-19, mathematical models informing the trajectory of disease are being proposed throughout the world. Current pandemic is also characterized by surge in hospitalizations which has overwhelmed even the most resilient health systems. Therefore, it is imperative to assess supply side preparedness in tandem with demand projections for comprehensive outlook. OBJECTIVE: Hence, we attempted this study to forecast the demand for hospital resources for one year period and correspondingly assessed capacity and tipping points of Indian health system to absorb surges in demand due to COVID-19. METHODS: We employed age- structured deterministic SEIR model and modified it to allow for testing and isolation capacity to forecast the demand under varying scenarios. Projections for documented cases were made for varying degree of mitigation strategies of a) No-lockdown b) Moderate-lockdown c) Full-lockdown. Correspondingly, data on a) General beds b) ICU beds and c) Ventilators was collated from various government records. Further, we computed the daily turnover of each of these resources which was then adjusted for proportion of cases requiring mild, severe and critical care to arrive at maximum number of COVID-19 cases manageable by health care system of India. FINDINGS: Our results revealed pervasive deficits in the capacity of public health system to absorb surge in demand during peak of epidemic. Also, continuing strict lockdown measures was found to be ineffective in suppressing total infections significantly, rather would only push the peak by a month. However, augmented testing of 500,000 tests per day during peak (mid-July) under moderate lockdown scenario would lead to more reported cases (5,500,000-6,000,000), leading to surge in demand for hospital resources. A minimum allocation of 10% public resources and 30% private resources would be required to commensurate with demand under that scenario. However, if the testing capacity is limited by 200,000 tests per day under same scenario, documented cases would plummet by half.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Veenapani Rajeev Verma","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Madras"},{"author_name":"Anuraag Saini","author_inst":"Vantage Research"},{"author_name":"Sumirtha Gandhi","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Madras"},{"author_name":"Umakant Dash","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Madras"},{"author_name":"Dr Muhammad Shaffi Fazaludeen Koya","author_inst":"Boston University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.14.20101725","rel_title":"COVID-19 Epidemic Forecast in Different States of India using SIR Model","rel_date":"2020-05-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.14.20101725","rel_abs":"The epidemiological data up to 12th May 2020 for India and its 24 states has been used to predict COVID-19 outbreak within classical SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model.

The population and spatial characteristics of COVID-19 infections are poorly understood, but there is increasing evidence that in addition to individual clinical factors, demographic, socioeconomic and racial characteristics play an important role. Methods. We analyzed positive COVID-19 testing results counts within New York City ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA) with Bayesian hierarchical Poisson spatial models using integrated nested Laplace approximations. Results. Spatial clustering accounted for approximately 32% of the variation in the data. For every one unit increase in a scaled standardized measure of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in a community, there was an approximate 8-fold increase in the risk of a positive COVID-19 test in a ZCTA (Incidence Density Ratio = 8.2, 95% Credible Interval 3.7, 18.3). There was a nearly five-fold increase in the risk of a positive COVID-19 test. (IDR = 4.8, 95% Cr I 2.4, 9.7) associated with the proportion of Black \/ African American residents. Increases in the proportion of residents older than 65, housing density and the proportion of residents with heart disease were each associated with an approximate doubling of risk. In a multivariable model including estimates for age, COPD, heart disease, housing density and Black\/African American race, the only variables that remained associated with positive COVID-19 testing with a probability greater than chance were the proportion of Black\/African American residents and proportion of older persons.

Being one of the most affected countries in Europe, in March 2020, Germany established several nonpharmaceutical interventions to contain the virus spread, including the closure of schools and child day care facilities (March 16-18, 2020) as well as a full \"lockdown\" with forced social distancing and closures of \"nonessential\" services (March 23, 2020). The present study attempts to analyze whether these governmental interventions had an impact on the declared aim of \"flattening the curve\", referring to the epidemic curve of new infections. This analysis is conducted from a regional perspective. On the level of the 412 German counties, logistic growth models were estimated based on daily infections (estimated from reported cases), aiming at determining the regional growth rate of infections and the point of inflection where infection rates begin to decrease and the curve flattens. All German counties exceeded the peak of new infections between the beginning of March and the middle of April. In a large majority of German counties, the epidemic curve has flattened before the \"lockdown\" was established. In a minority of counties, the peak was already exceeded before school closures. The growth rates of infections vary spatially depending on the time the virus emerged. Counties belonging to states which established an additional curfew show no significant improvement with respect to growth rates and mortality. Furthermore, mortality varies strongly across German counties, which can be attributed to infections of people belonging to the \"risk group\", especially residents of retirement homes. The results raise the question whether social ban measures and curfews really contribute to curve flattening within a pandemic.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas Wieland","author_inst":"Karlsruhe Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Michael Klein","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Cherisse Berry","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Spiros Frangos","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Dr Muhammad Shaffi Fazaludeen Koya","author_inst":"Boston University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.14.20101675","rel_title":"Reproducing SARS-CoV-2 epidemics byregion-specific variables and modeling contacttracing App containment","rel_date":"2020-05-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.14.20101675","rel_abs":"Targeted contact-tracing through mobile phone apps has been proposed as an instrument to help contain the spread of COVID-19 and manage the lifting of nation-wide lockdowns currently in place in USA and Europe. However, there is an ongoing debate on its potential efficacy, especially in the light of region-specific demographics. We built an expanded SIR model of COVID-19 epidemics that accounts for region-specific population densities, and we used it to test the impact of a contact-tracing app in a number of scenarios. Using demographic and mobility data from Italy and Spain, we used the model to simulate scenarios that vary in baseline contact rates, population densities and fraction of app users in the population. Our results show that, in support of efficient isolation of symptomatic cases, app-mediated contact-tracing can successfully mitigate the epidemic even with a relatively small fraction of users, and even suppress it altogether with a larger fraction of users. However, when regional differences in population density are taken into consideration, the epidemic can be significantly harder to contain in higher density areas, highlighting potential limitations of this intervention in specific contexts. This work corroborates previous results in favor of app-mediated contact-tracing as mitigation measure for COVID-19, and draw attention on the importance of region-specific demographic and mobility factors to achieve maximum efficacy in containment policies.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alberto Ferrari","author_inst":"FROM research foundation"},{"author_name":"Enrico Santus","author_inst":"Bayer, Decision Science & Advanced Analytics for MA, PV & RA Division."},{"author_name":"Davide Cirillo","author_inst":"Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), C\/ Jordi Girona 29, 08034, Barcelona,Spain."},{"author_name":"Miguel Ponce-de-Leon","author_inst":"Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), C\/ Jordi Girona 29, 08034, Barcelona,Spain."},{"author_name":"Nicola Marino","author_inst":"Women's Brain Project (WBP), Gunterhausen, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Maria Teresa Ferretti","author_inst":"Women's Brain Project (WBP), Gunterhausen, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Antonella Santuccione Chadha","author_inst":"Women's Brain Project (WBP), Gunterhausen, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Nikolaos Mavridis","author_inst":"Interactive Robots and Media Laboratory (IRLM), United Arab Emirates."},{"author_name":"Alfonso Valencia","author_inst":"Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), C\/ Jordi Girona 29, 08034, Barcelona,Spain."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.14.20101642","rel_title":"Knowledge of novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) among a Georgian population","rel_date":"2020-05-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.14.20101642","rel_abs":"Introduction Georgia confirmed its first case of SARS-COV-2 infection on February 26, 2020 and by March 31, a total of 110 cases have been reported. Limited understanding about epidemics can lead to panic and disrupt public health efforts to contain transmission. It is important to understand perceptions of the population regarding the disease. This study reports results of a survey designed to understand attitudes and knowledge regarding SARS-COV-2 virus among Georgian population, including health care workers (HCWs). Materials and methods The online survey was conducted using a Facebook advertisement. The target was the whole country and the language used was Georgian. We collected information on demographic data, knowledge of the disease, including perceived differences between coronavirus and influenza. We also included questions to capture the populations perceptions about government preparedness to combat the new coronavirus. Results The survey was open for three days (March 2-4, 2020). 5228 participants completed the survey. Of these, 40.3% were 25-45 years old, 58.2% were female, 20.7% had university degree and 10.3% were HCWs. For 25.8% of respondents, COVID-19 and influenza are the same diseases; 10.9% did not know if they are different. The majority correctly identified the transmission route and symptoms (96.9% and 98.0%, respectively). 19.1% think that Georgia is ready for COVID 19 epidemic, while according to 55% the county is not ready, but HCWs are trying hard to respond properly. For 18% response is inadequate. There was no difference in knowledge between HCWs, non-HCWs and unemployed. 20% of HCWs as well as other study subjects believe that SARS-COV-2 vaccine and medications do exist but are simply not available in Georgia.

All patients being attended at the rheumatology outpatient clinic of a tertiary hospital of Madrid, with medical diagnosis of inflammatory rheumatic disease, and with symptomatic COVID-19 disease were included. Main variable was the hospital admission related to COVID-19. Covariates: sociodemographic, clinical and treatments. We performed a multivariate logistic regression model to assess risk factors of hospital admission. RESULTS: 123 patients with IRD and COVID-19 disease were identified and included. We found 54 patients that need hospital admission, 59.2% were women, with a mean age at hospital admission of 69.7 (15.7) years, and a median lag time from symptoms onset to hospital admission of 5 (3-10) days. The median length of stay was 9 (6-14) days. A total of 12 patients died (22%) during their hospital admission.

Collaboration between researchers, public health workers and politicians has been established to deal with the epidemic. One important contribution from researchers in epidemiology is the analysis of trends so that both current state and short-term future trends can be carefully evaluated. Gompertz model has shown to correctly describe the dynamics of cumulative confirmed cases, since it is characterized by a decrease in growth rate that is able to show the effect of control measures. Thus, it provides a way to systematically quantify the Covid-19 spreading velocity. Moreover, it allows to carry out short-term predictions and long-term estimations that may facilitate policy decisions and the revision of in-place confinement measures and the development of new protocols. This model has been employed to fit the cumulative cases of Covid-19 from several Chinese provinces and from other countries with a successful containment of the disease. Results show that there are systematic differences in spreading velocity between countries. In countries that are in the initial stages of the Covid-19 outbreak, model predictions provide a reliable picture of its short-term evolution and may permit to unveil some characteristics of the long-term evolution. These predictions can also be generalized to short-term hospital and Intensive Care Units (ICU) requirements, which together with the equivalent predictions on mortality provide key information for health officials.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marti Catala","author_inst":"Comparative Medicine and Bioimage Centre of Catalonia"},{"author_name":"Sergio Alonso","author_inst":"Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya"},{"author_name":"Enrique Alvarez Lacalle","author_inst":"Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya"},{"author_name":"Daniel Lopez","author_inst":"Universitat  Politecnica de Catalunya"},{"author_name":"Pere-Joan Cardona","author_inst":"Comparative Medicine and Bioimage Centre of Catalonia"},{"author_name":"Clara Prats","author_inst":"Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya"},{"author_name":"Jose Ignacio Colomer","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico San Carlos, IdISSC, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Juan Angel Jover","author_inst":"Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Fernandez-Gutierrez","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico San Carlos, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Lydia Abasolo","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico San Carlos, IdISSC, Madrid, Spain"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.13.20101261","rel_title":"Is there a link between temperatures and COVID-19 contagions?

But it is vital to understand what is causing this: worries over potential adversities due to the pandemic, or the toll of experiencing adverse events. Objective: To explore the time-varying longitudinal relationship between (i) worries about adversity, and (ii) experience of adversity, and both anxiety and depression and test the moderating role of socio-economic position. Design: Longitudinal cohort study Setting: Community study Participants: A well-stratified sample of UK adults recruited into the UCL COVID -19 Social Study (a panel study collecting data weekly during the Covid-19 pandemic) via a combination of convenience and targeted recruitment. The sample was weighted to population proportions of gender, age, ethnicity, education and geographical location. Exposures: Worries or experiences of adversities during the COVID-19 pandemic Outcomes: Anxiety (GAD-7) and depression (PHQ-9) Results: Data were analysed from 41,909 UK adults (weighted data: 51% female, aged 18-99) followed up across 6 weeks (178,430 observations). Using fixed effects regression was used to explore within-person variation over time, cumulative number of worries and experience of adversities were both related to higher levels of anxiety and depression. Number of worries were associated more with anxiety than depression, but number of experiences were equally related to anxiety and depression. Individuals of lower socio-economic position were more negatively affected psychologically by adverse experiences. Conclusions & relevance: Measures over the first few weeks of lockdown in the UK appear to have been insufficient at reassuring people given we are still seeing clear associations with poor mental health both for cumulative worries and also for a range of specific worries relating to finance, access to essentials, personal safety and COVID-19. Interventions are required that both seek to prevent adverse events (e.g. redundancies) and that reassure individuals and support adaptive coping strategies.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Liam Wright","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Andrew Steptoe","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Daisy Fancourt","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Jennifer C.

A lack of awareness and poor understanding of the disease may result in rapid transmission of the disease in Bangladesh. This study aimed to investigate the awareness, perception, and attitude towards COVID-19 among Bangladeshi medical doctors. Method: This cross sectional, web-based study was conducted with the help of an online questionnaire and sent to the doctors which comprised of a series of questions regarding demographics of the participants, symptoms and incubation period of COVID-19, mode of transmission, measures to prevent transmission, availability of training and personal protective equipment in Bangladeshi hospitals, and attitude of doctors towards the treatment of suspected patients with COVID-19. Results: Of 800 medical doctors, a total 545 completed the survey (response 68.13%). Among the participants, 52.3% were females, 72.8% were below 30 years of age, and majority (52.8%) were working outside the cities in the villages and rural areas. A total of 404 (74.1%) doctors reported the correct incubation period of COVID-19. Majority doctors were aware of the symptoms with mode of transmission of COVID-19, measures to prevent hospital transmission, along with ways of identifying suspected patients with COVID-19. However, more than 90% of the doctors reported of inadequate intensive care unit and ventilator facilities along with extreme scarcity of personal protective equipment in the hospitals. 65.7% doctors prefer avoid working with a COVID-19 patient and more than 50% doctors have expressed that they would send the suspected COVID-19 patients to designated hospitals without providing treatment. Conclusion: The health authorities should take appropriate training measures to increase the awareness of the medical doctors along with providing sufficient amount of personal protective equipment for the medical doctors and supporting staff before deploying them in hospitals.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sadia Biswas Mumu","author_inst":"North South University"},{"author_name":"Most Nasrin Aktar","author_inst":"Brac University"},{"author_name":"Zabun Nahar","author_inst":"University of Asia Pacific"},{"author_name":"Shahana Sharmin","author_inst":"Brac University"},{"author_name":"Md Shaki Mostaid","author_inst":"Brac University"},{"author_name":"Eugene T.

More than two hundred countries around the world have already been affected by this severe virus as it spreads by human interaction. Moreover, the symptoms of novel coronavirus are quite similar to the general flu. Screening of infected patients is considered as a critical step in the fight against COVID-19. Therefore, it is highly relevant to recognize positive cases as early as possible to avoid further spreading of this epidemic. However, there are several methods to detect COVID-19 positive patients, which are typically performed based on respiratory samples and among them one of the critical approach which is treated as radiology imaging or X-Ray imaging. Recent findings from X-Ray imaging techniques suggest that such images contain relevant information about the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In this article, we have introduced a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based Faster Regions with Convolutional Neural Networks (Faster R-CNN) framework to detect COVID-19 patients from chest X-Ray images using available open-source dataset. Our proposed approach provides a classification accuracy of 97.36%, 97.65% of sensitivity, and a precision of 99.28%.

The unprecedented impact of the Covid-19 pandemics on modern society has ignited a \"gold rush\" for effective treatment and diagnostic strategies, with a significant diversion of economical, scientific and human resources towards dedicated clinical research. We aimed to describe trends in this rapidly changing landscape to inform adequate resource allocation. Methods. We developed informatic tools (Covid Trial Monitor) to analyze in real time growth rate, geographical distribution and characteristics of Covid-19 related trials. We defined structured semantic ontologies with controlled vocabularies to categorize trial interventions, study endpoints and study designs. Data and analyses are publicly available at https:\/\/bioinfo.ieo.it\/shiny\/app\/CovidCT Results. We observe a clear prevalence of monocentric trials with highly heterogeneous endpoints and a significant disconnect between geographic distribution and disease prevalence, implying that most countries would need to recruit unrealistic percentages of their total prevalent cases to fulfill enrolment. Conclusions. This geographically and methodologically incoherent growth sheds doubts on the actual feasibility of locally reaching target sample sizes and the probability of most of these trials providing reliable and transferable result. We call for the harmonization of clinical trial design criteria for Covid19 and the increased use of larger master protocols incorporating elements of adaptive designs.

In spite of several observational studies and a few randomized controlled trials, the effect of hydroxychloroquine on patients with COVID 19 infection remains unclear. We undertook this systematic review with meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine among patients with COVID 19 infection. Methods We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, medRxiv, and other relevant resources until August 1, 2020. We included randomized controlled trials and observational studies in which hydroxychloroquine was administered and compared to a control group. Data were extracted, and quality assessment of the studies was carried out. We evaluated symptomatic progression, mortality, viral clearance, evolution of changes on chest CT imaging, and adverse events. A fixed or random-effects model was used depending on outcome heterogeneity. Results We included 23 studies, including seven randomized controlled trials and 16 observational studies. Among these, 11,029 patients received hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination, while 12063 did not. Mortality was reported at different points in time. The overall mortality was not significantly different among patients who received hydroxychloroquine compared to the control group (OR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.72 to 1.22; p = 0.63). Clinical worsening did not differ between patients who received hydroxychloroquine compared to those who did not (OR 0.93, 95% CI: 0.57 to 1.52; p = 0.77). Negative conversion, assessed by RT PCR, did not differ significantly between the hydroxychloroquine and the control groups (OR: 0.67, CI: 0.21 to 2.11; p = 0.49). The evolution of changes on chest CT imaging was reported only in two studies; a more pronounced improvement was observed with the use of hydroxychloroquine compared to standard care (OR: 2.68, CI: 1.1 to 6.55; P = 0.03). The incidence of adverse events was significantly higher with hydroxychloroquine (OR: 5.95, CI: 2.56 to 13.83; p < 0.00001). Conclusions Our meta analysis does not suggest improvement in mortality, clinical progression, or negative conversion by RT PCR among patients with COVID-19 infection who are treated with hydroxychloroquine. There was a significantly higher incidence of adverse events with hydroxychloroquine use.

If several strains could be isolated worldwide, especially for in-vitro drug susceptibility testing and vaccine development, few laboratories routinely isolate SARS-CoV-2. This is due to the fact that the current co-culture strategy is highly time consuming and requires working in a biosafety level 3 laboratory. In this work, we present a new strategy based on high content screening automated microscopy (HCS) allowing large scale isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from clinical samples in 1 week. A randomized panel of 104 samples, including 72 tested positive by RT-PCR and 32 tested negative, were processed with our HCS procedure and were compared to the classical isolation procedure. Isolation rate was 43 % with both strategies on RT-PCR positive samples, and was correlated with the initial RNA viral load in the samples, where we obtained a positivity threshold of 27 Ct. Co-culture delays were shorter with HCS strategy, where 80 % of the positive samples were recovered by the third day of co-culture, as compared to only 25 % with the classic strategy. Moreover, only the HCS strategy allowed us to recover all the positive elements after 1 week of co-culture. This system allows rapid and automated screening of clinical samples with minimal operator work load, thus reducing the risks of contamination.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rania Francis","author_inst":"Aix-Marseille University"},{"author_name":"Marion Le Bideau","author_inst":"IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Priscilla Jardot","author_inst":"Aix-Marseille University"},{"author_name":"Clio Grimaldier","author_inst":"AP-HM"},{"author_name":"Didier Raoult","author_inst":"Aix-Marseille Univ, IRD, APHM, MEPHI, IHU-M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Infection, Marseille, France"},{"author_name":"Jacques Yaacoub Bou Khalil","author_inst":"Aix-Marseille University"},{"author_name":"Bernard La Scola","author_inst":"Aix-Marseille University"},{"author_name":"Luca Mazzarella","author_inst":"European Institute of Oncology IRCCS"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Fernandez-Gutierrez","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico San Carlos, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Lydia Abasolo","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico San Carlos, IdISSC, Madrid, Spain"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.12.20099572","rel_title":"COVID-19 Pandemic: Is Chronic Inflammation a Major Cause of Death?","rel_date":"2020-05-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.12.20099572","rel_abs":"Abstract Background. Today humanity is facing another infectious threat: a newly emerging virus SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19. It was already described that COVID-19 mortality among elderly people and people with such underlying conditions as obesity, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes s increased. Dysregulation of the immune responses vital for antiviral defense, which are typical for chronic inflammation, led us to a hypothesis that chronic inflammation is the main risk factor for increased susceptibility and mortality from COVID-19. Method. Based on the available information for 126 countries, statistical analysis to find out whether the difference in incidence and mortality within countries can be explained by the existing chronic inflammation among the countries population, was conducted. Results. A positive correlation between the percentage of people dying from chronic noncommunicable diseases and COVID-19 incidence (p<0.001) and mortality (p<0.001) within countries. Conclusion. The problem of COVID-19-caused high mortality rate may be a consequence of the high number of people having chronic low-grade inflammation as a precondition, and thus, one of the potential ways to reduce risk of morbidity and mortality is to focus on this widespread health problem, mainly occurring in developed countries and to take corresponding diagnostic, preventative, and treatment measures.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Albina Tskhay","author_inst":"Locus Fermentation Solutions, LLC"},{"author_name":"Alena Yezhova","author_inst":"Locus Fermentation Solutions, LLC"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Alibek","author_inst":"Locus Fermentation Solutions, LLC"},{"author_name":"Clio Grimaldier","author_inst":"AP-HM"},{"author_name":"Didier Raoult","author_inst":"Aix-Marseille Univ, IRD, APHM, MEPHI, IHU-M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Infection, Marseille, France"},{"author_name":"Jacques Yaacoub Bou Khalil","author_inst":"Aix-Marseille University"},{"author_name":"Bernard La Scola","author_inst":"Aix-Marseille University"},{"author_name":"Luca Mazzarella","author_inst":"European Institute of Oncology IRCCS"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Fernandez-Gutierrez","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico San Carlos, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Lydia Abasolo","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico San Carlos, IdISSC, Madrid, Spain"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.17.20104943","rel_title":"Association of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers with the Risk of Hospitalization and Death in Hypertensive Patients with Coronavirus Disease-19","rel_date":"2020-05-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.17.20104943","rel_abs":"Background: Whether angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) mitigate or exacerbate SARS-CoV-2 infection remains uncertain. In a national study, we evaluated the association of ACE inhibitors and ARB with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) hospitalization and mortality among individuals with hypertension. Methods: Among Medicare Advantage and commercially insured individuals, we identified 2,263 people with hypertension, receiving [&ge;]1 antihypertensive agents, and who had a positive outpatient SARS-CoV-2 test (outpatient cohort). In a propensity score-matched analysis, we determined the association of ACE inhibitors and ARBs with the risk of hospitalization for COVID-19. In a second study of 7,933 individuals with hypertension who were hospitalized with COVID-19 (inpatient cohort), we tested the association of these medications with in-hospital mortality. We stratified all our assessments by insurance groups. Results: Among individuals in the outpatient and inpatient cohorts, 31.9% and 29.8%, respectively, used ACE inhibitors and 32.3% and 28.1% used ARBs. In the outpatient study, over a median 30.0 (19.0 - 40.0) days after testing positive, 12.7% were hospitalized for COVID-19. In propensity score-matched analyses, neither ACE inhibitors (HR, 0.77 [0.53, 1.13], P = 0.18), nor ARBs (HR, 0.88 [0.61, 1.26], P = 0.48), were significantly associated with risk of hospitalization. In analyses stratified by insurance group, ACE inhibitors, but not ARBs, were associated with a significant lower risk of hospitalization in the Medicare group (HR, 0.61 [0.41, 0.93], P = 0.02), but not the commercially insured group (HR: 2.14 [0.82, 5.60], P = 0.12; P-interaction 0.09). In the inpatient study, 14.2% died, 59.5% survived to discharge, and 26.3% had an ongoing hospitalization.

Using data from an A549 cell line, primary human bronchial epithelial (NBHE), as well as from COVID-19-infected lung, we compare the changes in the gene expression, pathways and mechanisms between SARS-CoV2, influenza A, and respiratory syncytial virus. Results. We identified FDA-approved drugs that could be repurposed to help COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms related to hyper-inflammation. An important finding is that drugs in the same class will not achieve similar effects. For instance methylprednisolone and prednisolone were predicted to be effective in reverting many of the changes triggered by COVID-19, while other closely related steroids, such as prednisone or dexamethasone, were not. An independent clinical study evaluated 213 subjects, 81 (38%) and 132 (62%) in pre-and post-methylprednisolone groups, respectively. The composite end point was composed of escalation to intensive care units, need for mechanical ventilation, and death. The composite endpoint occurred at a significantly lower rate in post-methylprednisolone group compared to pre-methylprednisolone group (34.9% vs. 54.3%, p=0.005). Conclusion. Clinical results confirmed the efficacy of the in silico prediction that indicated methyl- prednisolone could improve outcomes in severe COVID-19. These findings are important for any future pandemic regardless of the virus.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sorin Draghici","author_inst":"Wayne State University"},{"author_name":"Tuan-Minh Nguyen","author_inst":"Wayne State University"},{"author_name":"Larry A Sonna","author_inst":"Bon Air Consulting"},{"author_name":"Cordelia Ziraldo","author_inst":"Advaita Bioinformatics"},{"author_name":"Radu L Vanciu","author_inst":"Advaita Bioinformatics"},{"author_name":"Raef Fadel","author_inst":"Henry Ford Health System"},{"author_name":"Austin Morrison","author_inst":"Henry Ford Health System"},{"author_name":"Mayur Ramesh","author_inst":"Henry Ford Health System"},{"author_name":"Gil Mor","author_inst":"Wayne State University"},{"author_name":"Saad B Omer","author_inst":"Yale Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Deneen Vojta","author_inst":"UnitedHealth Group"},{"author_name":"Harlan M Krumholz","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.18.20105197","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion in health care workers","rel_date":"2020-05-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.18.20105197","rel_abs":"Background The correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2 and their longevity remain unclear. Studies in severely ill individuals have identified robust cellular and humoral immune responses against the virus. Asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 has also been described, but it is unknown whether this is sufficient to produce antibody responses. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study recruiting 554 health care workers from University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust who were at work and asymptomatic. Participants were tested for current infection with SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swab for real-time polymerase chain reaction and for seroconversion by the measurement of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein antibodies by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Results were interpreted in the context of previous, self-reported symptoms of illness consistent with COVID-19. Results The point prevalence of infection with SARS-CoV-2, determined by the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on nasopharnygeal swab was 2.39% (n=13\/544). Serum was available on 516 participants. The overall rate of seroconversion in the cohort was 24.4% (n=126\/516). Individuals who had previously experienced a symptomatic illness consistent with COVID-19 had significantly greater seroconversion rates than those who had remained asymptomatic (37.5% vs 17.1%, {chi}2 =21.1034, p<0.0001). In the week preceding peak COVID-19-related mortality at UHBFT, seroconversion rates amongst those who were suffering from symptomatic illnesses peaked at 77.8%. Prior symptomatic illness generated quantitatively higher antibody responses than asymptomatic seroconversion. Seroconversion rates were highest amongst those working in housekeeping (34.5%), acute medicine (33.3%) and general internal medicine (30.3%) with lower rates observed in participants working in intensive care (14.8%) and emergency medicine (13.3%). Conclusions In a large cross-sectional seroprevalence study of health-care workers, we demonstrate that asymptomatic seroconversion occurs, however prior symptomatic illness is associated with quantitatively higher antibody responses. The identification that the potential for seroconversion in health-care workers can associate differentially with certain hospital departments may inform future infection control and occupational health practices.","rel_num_authors":32,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adrian M Shields","author_inst":"Clinical Immunology Service, Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of

medical fraternity also expressed concerns regarding public health strategies of government and hospital readiness in response to upgoing case surge. To gauge such response, we assessed service availability and Infection prevention and control (IPC) status in 110 hospitals situated across seven provinces. An electronic survey was sent out to the frontline clinicians working on those hospitals between 24th March and 7th April 2020; one response per hospital was analyzed. Hospitals were divided into small, medium, and large based on the total number of beds (small:<=15; medium:16-50; large:>50), and further categorized into public, private, and mixed based on the ownership. Out of 110 hospitals, 81% (22\/27) of small, 39% (11\/28) of medium, and 33% (18\/55) of large hospitals had not allocated isolation beds for COVID-19 suspects. All small, majority of medium (89%; 25\/28), and 50% of large hospitals did not have a functional intensive care unit (ICU) at the time of study. Nasopharyngeal (NP)\/throat swab kits were available in one-third (35\/110), whereas viral transport media (VTM), portable fridge box, and refrigerator were available in one-fifth (20%) of hospitals. Only one hospital (large\/tertiary) had a functional PCR machine. Except for General practitioners, other health cadres- crucial during pandemics, were low in number. On IPC measures, the supplies of simple face masks, gloves, and hand sanitizers were adequate in the majority of hospitals, however, N95-respirators, Filter masks, and PPE-suits were grossly lacking. Government COVID-19 support was unevenly distributed across provinces; health facilities in Province 2, Gandaki, and Province 5 received fewer resources than others. Our findings alert the Nepalese and other governments to act early and proactively during health emergencies and not wait until the disease disrupts their health systems. Other countries of similar economic levels may undertake similar surveys to measure and improve their pandemic response.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Suraj

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), declared a pandemic in March 2020, may present with disproportionately higher rates in underrepresented racial\/ethnic minority populations in the United States, including African American communities who have traditionally been over-represented in negative health outcomes. Study Objective: To understand the impact of the density of African American communities (defined as the percentage of African Americans in a county) on COVID-19 prevalence and death rate within the three most populous counties in each U.S. state and territory (n=152). Design: An ecological study using linear regression was employed for the study. Setting: The top three most populous counties of each U.S. state and territory were included in analyses for a final sample size of n=152 counties. Participants: Confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths that were accumulated between January 22, 2020 and April 12, 2020 in each of the three most populous counties in each U.S. state and territory were included. Main outcome measures: Linear regression was used to determine the association between African American density and COVID-19 prevalence (defined as the percentage of cases for the county population), and death rate (defined as number of deaths per 100,000 population). The models were adjusted for median age and poverty. Results: There was a direct association between African American density and COVID-19 prevalence; COVID-19 prevalence increased 5% for every 1% increase in county AA density (p<.01). There was also an association between county AA density and COVID-19 deaths, such; the death rate increased 2 per 100,000 for every percentage increase in county AA density (p=.02). Conclusion: These study findings indicate that communities with a high African American density have been disproportionately burdened with COVID-19. Further study is needed to indicate if this burden is related to environmental factors or individual factors such as types of employment or comorbidities that members of these community have.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elena Cyrus","author_inst":"Florida International University (FIU)"},{"author_name":"Rachel Clarke","author_inst":"Florida International University"},{"author_name":"Dexter Hadley","author_inst":"University of Central Florida"},{"author_name":"Zoran Bursac","author_inst":"Florida International University"},{"author_name":"Mary Jo Trepka","author_inst":"Florida International University"},{"author_name":"Jessy G Devieux","author_inst":"Florida International University"},{"author_name":"Ulas Bagci","author_inst":"University of Central Florida"},{"author_name":"Debra Furr-Holden","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Makella S Coudray","author_inst":"Florida International University"},{"author_name":"Yandra Mariano","author_inst":"Florida International University"},{"author_name":"Sandra Kiplagat","author_inst":"Florida International University"},{"author_name":"Ines Noel","author_inst":"University of San Diego"},{"author_name":"Gira Ravelo","author_inst":"Florida International University"},{"author_name":"Michelle Paley","author_inst":"University of Miami"},{"author_name":"Eric F Wagner","author_inst":"Florida International University"},{"author_name":"Dee McLoughlin","author_inst":"Institute of Inflammation and Ageing, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Gabriella Morley","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology and Infection, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Danai Papakonstantinou","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology and Infection, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Oliver Pickles","author_inst":"Surgical Research Laboratory, Institute of Cancer and Genomics Science, University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Poxon","author_inst":"Surgical Research Laboratory, Institute of Cancer and Genomics Science, University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Megan Richter","author_inst":"Clinical Immunology Service, Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Eloise Walker","author_inst":"Institute of Inflammation and Ageing, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Kasun Wanigasooriya","author_inst":"Surgical Research Laboratory, Institute of Cancer and Genomics Science, University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Yasunori Watanabe","author_inst":"Oxford Glycobiology Institute, Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Celina Whalley","author_inst":"Surgical Research Laboratory, Institute of Cancer and Genomics Science, University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Agnieszka E Zielinska","author_inst":"Institute of Inflammation and Ageing, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Max Crispin","author_inst":"School of Biological Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"David C Wraith","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Beggs","author_inst":"Surgical Research Laboratory, Institute of Cancer and Genomics Science, University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Adam F Cunningham","author_inst":"Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Mark T Drayson","author_inst":"Clinical Immunology Service, Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Alex G Richter","author_inst":"Clinical Immunology Service, Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, UK"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.19.104281","rel_title":"Isolation of and Characterization of Neutralizing Antibodies to Covid-19 from a Large Human Nai\u0308ve scFv Phage Display Library","rel_date":"2020-05-19","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.19.104281","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) has caused currently ongoing global plague and imposed great challenges to health managing systems all over the world, with millions of infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths.

In the present study, to better understand the biological impact of superinfection we sought to determine and compare the host transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 versus Aspergillus superinfection, using a model of reconstituted humain airway epithelium. Our analyses reveal that both simple infection and superinfection induce a strong deregulation of core components of innate immune and inflammatory responses, with a stronger response to superinfection in the bronchial epithelial model compared to its nasal counterpart. Our results also highlight unique transcriptional footprints of SARS-CoV-2 Aspergillus superinfection, such as an imbalanced type I\/type III IFN, and an induction of several monocyte- and neutrophil associated chemokines, that could be useful for the understanding of Aspergillus-associated COVID-19 and but also management of severe forms of aspergillosis in this specific

Strategies for COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-19","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.19.104042","rel_abs":"Considering the current status of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, sequence variations and possibly structural changes in the rapidly evolving SARS-CoV-2 is highly expected in the coming months. The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein is responsible for mediating viral attachment and fusion with cell membranes. Mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S-protein occur at the most variable part of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, and specific sites of S-protein have undergone positive selection impacting the viral pathogenicity. In the present work, we used high-throughput computation to design 100,000 mutants in RBD interfacial residues and identify novel affinity-enhancing and affinity-weakening mutations. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can establish a higher rate of infectivity and pathogenesis when it acquires combinatorial mutations at the interfacial residues in RBD. Mapping of the mutational landscape of the interaction site suggests that a few of these residues are the hot-spot residues with a very high tendency to undergo positive selection. Knowledge of the affinity-enhancing mutations may guide the identification of potential cold-spots for this mutation as targets for developing a possible therapeutic strategy instead of hot-spots, and vice versa. Understanding of the molecular interactions between the virus and host protein presents a detailed systems view of viral infection mechanisms. The applications of the present research can be explored in multiple antiviral strategies, including monoclonal antibody therapy, vaccine design, and importantly in understanding the clinical pathogenesis of the virus itself. Our work presents research directions for the exploitation of non-conventional solutions for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aditya K.
