Design Cross-sectional study via an online survey disseminated through professional networks and social media in 12 languages. We analysed responses using descriptive statistics and qualitative thematic analysis disaggregating by low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and high-income countries (HICs). Setting 81 countries, between March 24 and April 10, 2020. Participants 714 maternal and newborn healthcare providers. Main outcome measures Preparedness for and response to COVID-19, experiences of health workers providing care to women and newborns, and adaptations to 17 outpatient and inpatient care processes during the pandemic. Results Only one third of respondents received training on COVID-19 from their health facility and nearly all searched for information themselves. Half of respondents in LMICs received updated guidelines for care provision compared with 82% in HICs. Overall, only 47% of participants in LMICs, and 69% in HICs felt mostly or completely knowledgeable in how to care for COVID-19 maternity patients. Facility-level responses to COVID-19 (signage, screening, testing, and isolation rooms) were more common in HICs than LMICs. Globally, 90% of respondents reported somewhat or substantially higher levels of stress. There was a widespread perception of reduced use of routine maternity care services, and of modification in care processes, some of which were not evidence-based. Conclusions Substantial knowledge gaps exist in guidance on management of maternity cases with or without COVID-19. Formal information sharing channels for providers must be established and mental health support provided. Surveys of maternity care providers can help track the situation, capture innovations, and support rapid development of effective responses.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aline T Semaan","author_inst":"Department of Public Health, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp Belgium and Center for Research on Population and Health, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ameri"},{"author_name":"Constance Audet","author_inst":"Department of Public Health, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp Belgium"},{"author_name":"Elise Huysmans","author_inst":"Department of Public Health, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp Belgium"},{"author_name":"Bosede B Afolabi","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, College of Medicine, University of Lagos, Lagos, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Bouchra Assarag","author_inst":"National School of Public Health, Ministry of Health, Morocco"},{"author_name":"Aduragbemi Banke-Thomas","author_inst":"LSE Health, London School of Economics and Political Sciences, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Hannah Blencowe","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Severine Caluwaerts","author_inst":"Department of Public Health, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp Belgium"},{"author_name":"Oona M R Campbell","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Francesca L Cavallaro","author_inst":"Institute of Child Health, University College London, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Chavane","author_inst":"Department of Community Health, Faculty of Medicine, Eduardo Mondlane University, Maputo, Mozambique"},{"author_name":"Louise Tina Day","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Delamou","author_inst":"Africa Centre of Excellence for Prevention and Control of Transmissible Diseases (CEA-PCMT), University Gamal Abdel Nasser, Conakry, Guinea"},{"author_name":"Therese Delvaux","author_inst":"Department of Public Health, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp Belgium"},{"author_name":"Wendy Graham","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Giorgia Gon","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Peter Kascak","author_inst":"Trencin University Hospital, Trencin Slovakia"},{"author_name":"Mitsuaki Matsui","author_inst":"Department of Global Health, Nagasaki University School of Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nagasaki, Japan"},{"author_name":"Sarah G Moxon","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Annettee Nakimuli","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Makerere University and Mulago Specialized Women and Neonatal Hospital, Kampala Uganda"},{"author_name":"Andrea B Pembe","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences, Dar es Salaam Tanzania"},{"author_name":"Emma Radovich","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Thomas van den Akker","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Leiden University Medical Centre and Athena Institute, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Lenka Benova","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"sexual and reproductive health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20094409","rel_title":"APOE E4 GENOTYPE PREDICTS SEVERE COVID-19 IN THE UK BIOBANK COMMUNITY COHORT","rel_date":"2020-05-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20094409","rel_abs":"The novel respiratory disease COVID-19 produces varying symptoms, with fever, cough, and shortness of breath being common.

In another UK study of 16,749 patients hospitalized for COVID-19, dementia was among the common comorbidities and was associated with higher mortality. Additionally, impaired consciousness, including delirium, is common in severe cases. The ApoE e4 genotype is associated with both dementia and delirium, with the e4e4 (homozygous) genotype associated with a 14-fold increase in risk of Alzheimer's disease compared to the common e3e3 genotype, in populations with European ancestries.

Prediction models that combine several features to estimate the risk of infection have been developed in hopes of assisting medical staff worldwide in triaging patients when allocating limited healthcare resources. Results: We established a machine learning approach that trained on records from 51,831 tested individuals (of whom 4,769 were confirmed COVID-19 cases) while the test set contained data from the following week (47,401 tested individuals of whom 3,624 were confirmed COVID-19 cases). Our model predicts COVID-19 test results with high accuracy using only eight features: gender, whether age is above 60, known contact with an infected individual, and five initial clinical symptoms. Summary: Overall, based on the nationwide data publicly reported by the Israeli Ministry of Health, we developed a model that detects COVID-19 cases by simple features accessed by asking basic questions. Our framework can be used, among other considerations, to prioritize testing for COVID-19 when allocating limited testing resources.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yazeed Zoabi","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University"},{"author_name":"Noam Shomron","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University"},{"author_name":"Iason Katsamenis","author_inst":"National Technical University of Athens"},{"author_name":"Anastasios Doulamis","author_inst":"National Technical University of Athens"},{"author_name":"Nikolaos Doulamis","author_inst":"National Technical University of Athens"},{"author_name":"George A Kuchel","author_inst":"University of Connecticut Health"},{"author_name":"David Melzer","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Severine Caluwaerts","author_inst":"Department of Public Health, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp Belgium"},{"author_name":"Oona M R Campbell","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Francesca L Cavallaro","author_inst":"Institute of Child Health, University College London, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Chavane","author_inst":"Department of Community Health, Faculty of Medicine, Eduardo Mondlane University, Maputo, Mozambique"},{"author_name":"Louise Tina Day","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Delamou","author_inst":"Africa Centre of Excellence for Prevention and Control of Transmissible Diseases (CEA-PCMT), University Gamal Abdel Nasser, Conakry, Guinea"},{"author_name":"Therese Delvaux","author_inst":"Department of Public Health, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp Belgium"},{"author_name":"Wendy Graham","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Giorgia Gon","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Peter Kascak","author_inst":"Trencin University Hospital, Trencin Slovakia"},{"author_name":"Mitsuaki Matsui","author_inst":"Department of Global Health, Nagasaki University School of Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nagasaki, Japan"},{"author_name":"Sarah G Moxon","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Annettee Nakimuli","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Makerere University and Mulago Specialized Women and Neonatal Hospital, Kampala Uganda"},{"author_name":"Andrea B Pembe","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences, Dar es Salaam Tanzania"},{"author_name":"Emma Radovich","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Thomas van den Akker","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Leiden University Medical Centre and Athena Institute, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Lenka Benova","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20093955","rel_title":"Utility and limitations of Google searches on sensory loss as markers for new COVID-19 cases","rel_date":"2020-05-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20093955","rel_abs":"Web tools are widely used among population to obtain health related information, and these data are often employed for public health monitoring.

We examined the effect of timing of mandated social distancing on the rate of COVID-19 in 119 geographic regions derived from 41 states within United States and 78 countries. We found that highest number of new COVID-19 cases per day per million persons was significantly associated with total number of COVID-19 cases per million persons on the day before mandated social distancing (Beta;=0.66, p<0.0001). Our findings suggest that the initiation of mandated social distancing for each doubling in number of existing COVID-19 cases would result in eventual peak with 58% higher number of COVID-19 infections per day. Subgroup analysis on those regions where the highest number of new COVID-19 cases per day have peaked increased Beta to .85 (p<0.0001).

Measures: Information on symptomatology, exposures and health-seeking behaviour were collected from participants by self-report. Results: The 236 respondents reported illness compatible with COVID-19 and there was an increase in illness reporting during March 2020. Diagnostic swabs were not routinely performed. Cough (n=179, 75.8%), fever (n=138, 58.5%), breathlessness (n=84, 35.6%) were reported. Anosmia was reported in 42.2%. Fever generally settled within 1 week (n=110, 88%). Several respondents remained at home and did not seek formal medical attention despite reporting severe breathlessness and measuring hypoxia (n=5\/9, 55.6%). 2 patients required hospital admission but recovered following oxygen therapy. 84 respondents (41.2%) required greater than the obligated 7 days off work and 9 required greater than 3 weeks off. Conclusion: There was a significant increase in staff reporting illness compatible with possible COVID-19 during March 2020. Conclusions cannot be drawn about exact numbers of confirmed cases due to lack of diagnostic swabbing. There were significant numbers of respondents reporting anosmia; as well as early non-specific illness prior to onset of cough and fever. This may represent pre-symptomatic HCWs who are likely to be infectious and thus criteria for isolation and swabbing should be broadened. The study also revealed concerning lack of healthcare seeking in respondents with significant red flag symptoms (severe breathlessness, hypoxia). This should be addressed urgently to reduce risk of severe disease being detected late. Finally, this study should inform trusts that HCWs may require longer than 7 days off work to recover from illness.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Angus de Wilton","author_inst":"COVID-19 Response Team, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; Hospital of Tropical Diseases, London"},{"author_name":"Eliz Kilich","author_inst":"COVID-19 Response Team, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; Hospital of Tropical Diseases, London"},{"author_name":"Zain Chaudhry","author_inst":"COVID-19 Response Team, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; Hospital of Tropical Diseases, London"},{"author_name":"Lucy CK Bell","author_inst":"COVID-19 Response Team, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; Hospital of Tropical Diseases, London"},{"author_name":"Joshua Gahir","author_inst":"COVID-19 Response Team, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; Hospital of Tropical Diseases, London"},{"author_name":"Jane Cadman","author_inst":"COVID-19 Response Team, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Robert A Lever","author_inst":"Hospital of Tropical Diseases, London; University College London"},{"author_name":"Sarah Logan","author_inst":"Hospital of Tropical Diseases, London; COVID-19 Response Team, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust;"},{"author_name":"Oona M R Campbell","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Francesca L Cavallaro","author_inst":"Institute of Child Health, University College London, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Chavane","author_inst":"Department of Community Health, Faculty of Medicine, Eduardo Mondlane University, Maputo, Mozambique"},{"author_name":"Louise Tina Day","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Delamou","author_inst":"Africa Centre of Excellence for Prevention and Control of Transmissible Diseases (CEA-PCMT), University Gamal Abdel Nasser, Conakry, Guinea"},{"author_name":"Therese Delvaux","author_inst":"Department of Public Health, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp Belgium"},{"author_name":"Wendy Graham","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Giorgia Gon","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Peter Kascak","author_inst":"Trencin University Hospital, Trencin Slovakia"},{"author_name":"Mitsuaki Matsui","author_inst":"Department of Global Health, Nagasaki University School of Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nagasaki, Japan"},{"author_name":"Sarah G Moxon","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Annettee Nakimuli","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Makerere University and Mulago Specialized Women and Neonatal Hospital, Kampala Uganda"},{"author_name":"Andrea B Pembe","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences, Dar es Salaam Tanzania"},{"author_name":"Emma Radovich","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Thomas van den Akker","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Leiden University Medical Centre and Athena Institute, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Lenka Benova","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20094276","rel_title":"Characteristics of 1,573 healthcare workers who underwent nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 in Milano, Lombardy, Italy","rel_date":"2020-05-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20094276","rel_abs":"Background The management of healthcare workers (HCWs) exposed to confirmed cases of COVID-19 is still a matter of debate. It is unclear whether these subjects should be tested in the absence of symptoms and if those can guide diagnosis. Methods Occupational and clinical characteristics of all the consecutive HCWs who performed a nasopharyngeal swab for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in a University Hospital from February 24, 2020, to March 31, 2020, were collected. Frequencies of positive tests were compared according to selected variables. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were then applied. Findings Positive tests were 138 among 1,573 HCWs (8.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.4-10.3), with a marked difference between symptomatic (20.2%, 95%CI: 16.7-24.1) and asymptomatic (3.7%, 95%CI: 2.7-5.1) subjects (p<0.001). Physicians were the group with the highest frequency of positive tests (10.6%, 95%CI: 8.3-13.4) whereas clerical workers and technicians displayed the lowest frequency (2.9%, 95%CI: 0.8-7.3). The likelihood of being positive increased with the number of reported symptoms and the strongest predictors of a positive test were taste and smell alterations (odds ratio [OR]= 29.7) and fever (OR = 7.21). The median time from first positive test to a negative test was 23 days (95%CI: 19-24). Interpretation In this Italian group of HCWs exposed to confirmed cases of COVID-19 the presence of symptoms, especially taste and smell alterations and fever, was associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The median time to clear the virus from nasopharynx was 23 days.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"ANDREA LOMBARDI","author_inst":"IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Foundation"},{"author_name":"Dario Consonni","author_inst":"IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Foundation"},{"author_name":"Michele Carugno","author_inst":"IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Foundation"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Bozzi","author_inst":"IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Foundation"},{"author_name":"Davide Mangioni","author_inst":"IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Foundation"},{"author_name":"Antonio Muscatello","author_inst":"IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Foundation"},{"author_name":"Valeria Castelli","author_inst":"IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Foundation"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Palomba","author_inst":"IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Foundation"},{"author_name":"Anna Paola Cantu'","author_inst":"IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Foundation"},{"author_name":"Ferruccio Ceriotti","author_inst":"IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Foundation"},{"author_name":"Basilio Tiso","author_inst":"IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Foundation"},{"author_name":"Angela Cecilia Pesatori","author_inst":"IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Foundation"},{"author_name":"Luciano Riboldi","author_inst":"IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Foundation"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Bandera","author_inst":"IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Foundation"},{"author_name":"Andrea Gori","author_inst":"IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Foundation"},{"author_name":"Giorgia Gon","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Peter Kascak","author_inst":"Trencin University Hospital, Trencin Slovakia"},{"author_name":"Mitsuaki Matsui","author_inst":"Department of Global Health, Nagasaki University School of Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nagasaki, Japan"},{"author_name":"Sarah G Moxon","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Annettee Nakimuli","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Makerere University and Mulago Specialized Women and Neonatal Hospital, Kampala Uganda"},{"author_name":"Andrea B Pembe","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences, Dar es Salaam Tanzania"},{"author_name":"Emma Radovich","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Thomas van den Akker","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Leiden University Medical Centre and Athena Institute, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Lenka Benova","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20094227","rel_title":"Pandemic related Health literacy - A Systematic Review of literature in COVID-19, SARS and MERS pandemics","rel_date":"2020-05-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20094227","rel_abs":"Background: Health literacy plays an essential role in ones ability to acquire and understand critical medical information in the COVID-19 infodemic and other pandemics. Purpose: To summarize the assessment, levels and determinants of pandemic related health literacy and its associated clinical outcomes. Data sources: Medline, Embase, PsychINFO, CINAHL, arXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv, and Social Science Research Network. The start date was unrestricted and current as of 22 April 2020. Study selection Studies which evaluated health literacy related to novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) Data extraction Data on the characteristics of study designs, instruments, participants and level of health literacy were collected. Items used in instruments were grouped under the themes of knowledge, attitudes and practices. Determinants of health literacy were grouped into five domains (socio-demographic, medical, psychological\/psychiatric, health systems related and others). Data synthesis: Of 2,065 articles screened, 70 articles were included. 21, 17 and 32 studies evaluated health literacy related to COVID-19, SARS and MERS, respectively. The rates of low pandemic health literacy ranged from 4.3 to 57.9% among medical-related populations and 4.0% to 82.5% among non-medical populations. Knowledge about symptoms and transmission of infection; worry about infection and, practices related to mask usage and hand hygiene was most frequently evaluated. Socio-demographic determinants of health literacy were most studied, where higher education level, older age and female gender were associated with better health literacy. No studies evaluated outcomes associated with health literacy. Limitations Non-English articles were excluded. Conclusion: The level of pandemic related health literacy is sub-optimal. Healthcare administrators need to be aware of health literacy determinants when formulating policies in pandemics.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jun Jie Benjamin Seng","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Cheng Teng Yeam","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Weihao Caleb Huang","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Ngiap Chuan Tan","author_inst":"SingHealth Polyclinics"},{"author_name":"Lian Leng Low","author_inst":"Outram Community Hospital, SingHealth Community Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Antonio Muscatello","author_inst":"IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Foundation"},{"author_name":"Valeria Castelli","author_inst":"IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Foundation"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Palomba","author_inst":"IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Foundation"},{"author_name":"Anna Paola Cantu'","author_inst":"IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Foundation"},{"author_name":"Ferruccio Ceriotti","author_inst":"IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Foundation"},{"author_name":"Basilio Tiso","author_inst":"IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Foundation"},{"author_name":"Angela Cecilia Pesatori","author_inst":"IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Foundation"},{"author_name":"Luciano Riboldi","author_inst":"IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Foundation"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Bandera","author_inst":"IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Foundation"},{"author_name":"Andrea Gori","author_inst":"IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Foundation"},{"author_name":"Giorgia Gon","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Peter Kascak","author_inst":"Trencin University Hospital, Trencin Slovakia"},{"author_name":"Mitsuaki Matsui","author_inst":"Department of Global Health, Nagasaki University School of Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nagasaki, Japan"},{"author_name":"Sarah G Moxon","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Annettee Nakimuli","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Makerere University and Mulago Specialized Women and Neonatal Hospital, Kampala Uganda"},{"author_name":"Andrea B Pembe","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences, Dar es Salaam Tanzania"},{"author_name":"Emma Radovich","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Thomas van den Akker","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Leiden University Medical Centre and Athena Institute, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Lenka Benova","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20094235","rel_title":"Chaos, Percolation and the Coronavirus Spread: a two-step model.","rel_date":"2020-05-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20094235","rel_abs":"We discuss a two-step model for the rise and decay of a new coronavirus (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoV-2) first reported in December 2019, COVID-19. The first stage is well described by the same equation for turbulent flows, population growth and chaotic maps: a small number of infected d0 grows exponentially to a saturation value d{infty}. The typical growth time (aggressive spreading of the virus) is given by {tau}=1\/{lambda}, where {lambda} is the Lyapunov exponent. After a time tcrit determined by social distancing and\/or other measures, the spread decreases exponentially as for nuclear decays and non-chaotic maps. Some countries, like China, S. Korea and Italy are in this second stage while others including the USA are near the end of the growth stage. The model predicts 15,000 (+-2,250) casualties for the Lombardy region (Italy) at the end of the spreading around May 10,2020. Without the quarantine, the casualties would have been more than 50,000, hundred days after the start of the pandemic. The data from the 50 US states are of very poor quality because of an extremely late and confused response to the pandemic, resulting unfortunately in a large number of casualties, more than 70,000 on May 6, 2020.

This complexity presents challenges and opportunities for serological diagnostics. Methods A multiplex serological assay was developed to measure IgG and IgM antibody responses to seven SARS-CoV-2 spike or nucleoprotein antigens, two antigens for the nucleoproteins of the 229E and NL63 seasonal coronaviruses, and three non-coronavirus antigens. Antibodies were measured in serum samples from patients in French hospitals with RT-qPCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 259), and negative control serum samples collected before the start of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic (n = 335). A random forests algorithm was trained with the multiplex data to classify individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. A mathematical model of antibody kinetics informed by prior information from other coronaviruses was used to estimate time-varying antibody responses and assess the potential sensitivity and classification performance of serological diagnostics during the first year following symptom onset. A statistical estimator is presented that can provide estimates of seroprevalence in very low transmission settings. Results IgG antibody responses to trimeric Spike protein identified individuals with previous RT-qPCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with 91.6% sensitivity (95% confidence interval (CI); 87.5%, 94.5%) and 99.1% specificity (95% CI; 97.4%, 99.7%). Using a serological signature of IgG and IgM to multiple antigens, it was possible to identify infected individuals with 98.8% sensitivity (95% CI; 96.5%, 99.6%) and 99.3% specificity (95% CI; 97.6%, 99.8%). Informed by prior data from other coronaviruses, we estimate that one year following infection a monoplex assay with optimal anti-Stri IgG cutoff has 88.7% sensitivity (95% CI: 63.4%, 97.4%), and that a multiplex assay can increase sensitivity to 96.4% (95% CI: 80.9%, 100.0%). When applied to population-level serological surveys, statistical analysis of multiplex data allows estimation of seroprevalence levels less than 1%, below the false positivity rate of many other assays. Conclusion Serological signatures based on antibody responses to multiple antigens can provide accurate and robust serological classification of individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. This provides potential solutions to two pressing challenges for SARS-CoV-2 serological surveillance: classifying individuals who were infected greater than six months ago, and measuring seroprevalence in serological surveys in very low transmission settings.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jason Rosado","author_inst":"Malaria: Parasites and Hosts Unit, Department of Parasites and Insect Vectors, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Stephane Pelleau","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Cockram","author_inst":"Spatial Regulation of Genomes Unit, Department of Genomes and Genetics, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Sarah Helene Merkling","author_inst":"Insect-Virus Interactions Unit, Department of Virology, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Narimane Nekkab","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Caroline Demeret","author_inst":"Molecular Genetics of RNA Viruses Unit, Department of Virology, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Annalisa Meola","author_inst":"Structural Virology Unit, Department of Virology and CNRS UMR 3569, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Solen Kerneis","author_inst":"Equipe Mobile d Infectiologie, APHP Centre-Universite de Paris, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Terrier","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, National Referral Center for Rare Systemic Autoimmune Diseases, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris-Centre (APHP-CUP), Univer"},{"author_name":"Samira Fafi-Kremer","author_inst":"CHU de Strasbourg, Laboratoire de Virologie, F-67091 Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Jerome de Seze","author_inst":"Centre d'Investigation Clinique - INSERM CIC-1434, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Francois Dejardin","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Stephane Petres","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Rhea Longley","author_inst":"Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Marija Backovic","author_inst":"Structural Virology Unit, Department of Virology and CNRS UMR 3569, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Ivo Mueller","author_inst":"Division of Population Health and Immunity, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Michael T White","author_inst":"Malaria: Parasites and Hosts Unit, Department of Parasites and Insect Vectors, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Mitsuaki Matsui","author_inst":"Department of Global Health, Nagasaki University School of Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nagasaki, Japan"},{"author_name":"Sarah G Moxon","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Annettee Nakimuli","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Makerere University and Mulago Specialized Women and Neonatal Hospital, Kampala Uganda"},{"author_name":"Andrea B Pembe","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences, Dar es Salaam Tanzania"},{"author_name":"Emma Radovich","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Thomas van den Akker","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Leiden University Medical Centre and Athena Institute, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Lenka Benova","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.08.20094870","rel_title":"Estimating pre-symptomatic transmission of COVID-19: a secondary analysis using published data","rel_date":"2020-05-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.08.20094870","rel_abs":"Objective: To estimate the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection that can occur and timing of transmission relative to symptom onset. Setting\/design: Secondary analysis of international published data. Data sources: Meta-analysis of COVID-19 incubation period and a rapid systematic review of serial interval and generation time, which are published separately. Participants: Studies were selected for analysis if they had transparent methods and data sources and they provided enough information to simulate full distributions of serial interval or generation time. Twenty-three estimates of serial interval and five of generation time from 17 publications were included. Methods: Simulations were generated of incubation period and of serial interval or generation time. From these, transmission times relative to symptom onset were calculated and the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission was estimated. Outcome measures: Transmission time of SARS-CoV-2 relative to symptom onset and proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission. Results: Transmission time ranged from a mean of 2.91 (95% CI: 3.18-2.64) days before symptom onset to 1.20 (0.86-1.55) days after symptom onset. Unweighted pooling of estimates of transmission time based on serial interval resulted in a mean of 0.60 days before symptom onset (3.01 days before to 1.81 days after). Proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission ranged from 42.8% (39.8%-45.9%) to 80.6% (78.1%-83.0%). The proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission from pooled estimates was 56.4% (34.9%-78.0%). Conclusions: Whilst contact rates between symptomatic infectious and susceptible people are likely to influence the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission, there is substantial potential for pre-symptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a range of different contexts. Our work suggests that transmission is most likely in the day before symptom onset whereas estimates suggesting most pre-symptomatic transmission highlighted mean transmission times almost three days before symptom onset. This highlights the need for rapid case detection, contact tracing and quarantine.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Miriam Casey","author_inst":"Centre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis, UCD School of Veterinary Medicine, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin D04 W6F6, Ireland"},{"author_name":"John Griffin","author_inst":"1.\tCentre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis, UCD School of Veterinary Medicine, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin D04 W6F6, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Conor G McAloon","author_inst":"Section of Herd Health and Animal Husbandry, UCD School of Veterinary Medicine, University College Dublin, Dublin D04 W6F6, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Andrew W Byrne","author_inst":"One-Health Scientific Support Unit, Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM), Kildare Street, Dublin 2, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Jamie M Madden","author_inst":"1.\tCentre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis, UCD School of Veterinary Medicine, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin D04 W6F6, Ireland"},{"author_name":"David McEvoy","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Physiotherapy and Sports Science, Woodview House University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Aine B Collins","author_inst":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Kildare St., Dublin 2, Ireland and\tCentre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis, UCD School of Veterinar"},{"author_name":"Kevin Hunt","author_inst":"Centre for Food Safety, UCD School of Biosystems and Food Engineering, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin D04 W6F6, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Ann Barber","author_inst":"1.\tCentre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis, UCD School of Veterinary Medicine, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin D04 W6F6, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Francis Butler","author_inst":"Centre for Food Safety, UCD School of Biosystems and Food Engineering, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin D04 W6F6, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth A Lane","author_inst":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Kildare St., Dublin 2, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Kirsty O Brien","author_inst":"Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), Unit 1301, City Gate, Cork, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Patrick Wall","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Physiotherapy and Sports Science, Woodview House University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Kieran A Walsh","author_inst":"Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), Unit 1301, City Gate, Cork, Ireland."},{"author_name":"Simon J More","author_inst":"1.\tCentre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis, UCD School of Veterinary Medicine, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin D04 W6F6, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Ivo Mueller","author_inst":"Division of Population Health and Immunity, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Michael T White","author_inst":"Malaria: Parasites and Hosts Unit, Department of Parasites and Insect Vectors, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Mitsuaki Matsui","author_inst":"Department of Global Health, Nagasaki University School of Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nagasaki, Japan"},{"author_name":"Sarah G Moxon","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Annettee Nakimuli","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Makerere University and Mulago Specialized Women and Neonatal Hospital, Kampala Uganda"},{"author_name":"Andrea B Pembe","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences, Dar es Salaam Tanzania"},{"author_name":"Emma Radovich","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Thomas van den Akker","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Leiden University Medical Centre and Athena Institute, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Lenka Benova","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.08.20095059","rel_title":"Age-stratified model of the COVID-19 epidemic to analyze the impact of relaxing lockdown measures: nowcasting and forecasting for Switzerland","rel_date":"2020-05-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.08.20095059","rel_abs":"Compartmental models enable the analysis and prediction of an epidemic including the number of infected, hospitalized and deceased individuals in a population. They allow for computational case studies on non-pharmaceutical interventions thereby providing an important basis for policy makers. While research is ongoing on the transmission dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, it is important to come up with epidemic models that can describe the main stages of the progression of the associated COVID-19 respiratory disease. We propose an age-stratified discrete compartment model as an alternative to differential equation based S-I-R type of models. The model captures the highly age-dependent progression of COVID-19 and is able to describe the day-by-day advancement of an infected individual in a modern health care system. The fully-identified model for Switzerland not only predicts the overall histories of the number of infected, hospitalized and deceased, but also the corresponding age-distributions. The model-based analysis of the outbreak reveals an average infection fatality ratio of 0.4% with a pronounced maximum of 9.5% for those aged [&ge;]80 years. The predictions for different scenarios of relaxing the soft lockdown indicate a low risk of overloading the hospitals through a second wave of infections. However, there is a hidden risk of a significant increase in the total fatalities (by up to 200%) in case schools reopen with insufficient containment measures in place.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fadoua Balabdaoui","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Dirk Mohr","author_inst":"Swiss Federal Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Conor G McAloon","author_inst":"Section of Herd Health and Animal Husbandry, UCD School of Veterinary Medicine, University College Dublin, Dublin D04 W6F6, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Andrew W Byrne","author_inst":"One-Health Scientific Support Unit, Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM), Kildare Street, Dublin 2, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Jamie M Madden","author_inst":"1.\tCentre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis, UCD School of Veterinary Medicine, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin D04 W6F6, Ireland"},{"author_name":"David McEvoy","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Physiotherapy and Sports Science, Woodview House University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Aine B Collins","author_inst":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Kildare St., Dublin 2, Ireland and\tCentre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis, UCD School of Veterinar"},{"author_name":"Kevin Hunt","author_inst":"Centre for Food Safety, UCD School of Biosystems and Food Engineering, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin D04 W6F6, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Ann Barber","author_inst":"1.\tCentre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis, UCD School of Veterinary Medicine, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin D04 W6F6, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Francis Butler","author_inst":"Centre for Food Safety, UCD School of Biosystems and Food Engineering, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin D04 W6F6, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth A Lane","author_inst":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Kildare St., Dublin 2, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Kirsty O Brien","author_inst":"Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), Unit 1301, City Gate, Cork, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Patrick Wall","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Physiotherapy and Sports Science, Woodview House University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Kieran A Walsh","author_inst":"Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), Unit 1301, City Gate, Cork, Ireland."},{"author_name":"Simon J More","author_inst":"1.\tCentre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis, UCD School of Veterinary Medicine, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin D04 W6F6, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Ivo Mueller","author_inst":"Division of Population Health and Immunity, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Michael T White","author_inst":"Malaria: Parasites and Hosts Unit, Department of Parasites and Insect Vectors, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Mitsuaki Matsui","author_inst":"Department of Global Health, Nagasaki University School of Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nagasaki, Japan"},{"author_name":"Sarah G Moxon","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Annettee Nakimuli","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Makerere University and Mulago Specialized Women and Neonatal Hospital, Kampala Uganda"},{"author_name":"Andrea B Pembe","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences, Dar es Salaam Tanzania"},{"author_name":"Emma Radovich","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Thomas van den Akker","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Leiden University Medical Centre and Athena Institute, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Lenka Benova","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20094078","rel_title":"Time-Resolving the COVID-19 Outbreak using frequency domain analysis","rel_date":"2020-05-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20094078","rel_abs":"Difficulties assessing and predicting the current outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 can be traced, in part, to the limitations of a static description of a dynamic system.

Defining a quantity like the case fatality as a spectral density allows a more sensible comparison between different countries and demographics during an ongoing outbreak. Such a case fatality informs not only how many of the confirmed cases end up as fatalities, but also when. For COVID-19, knowing this time and using the entire case fatality spectrum allows determining that an outbreak had entered a steady-state (most likely its end) about 14 days before this is obvious from time-domain data. The lag between confirmations and deaths also helps to estimate the effectiveness of contact management: The larger the lag, the less time the average confirmed person had to infect people before quarantine.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Keno L Krewer","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research"},{"author_name":"Mischa Bonn","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research"},{"author_name":"Conor G McAloon","author_inst":"Section of Herd Health and Animal Husbandry, UCD School of Veterinary Medicine, University College Dublin, Dublin D04 W6F6, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Andrew W Byrne","author_inst":"One-Health Scientific Support Unit, Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM), Kildare Street, Dublin 2, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Jamie M Madden","author_inst":"1.\tCentre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis, UCD School of Veterinary Medicine, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin D04 W6F6, Ireland"},{"author_name":"David McEvoy","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Physiotherapy and Sports Science, Woodview House University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Aine B Collins","author_inst":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Kildare St., Dublin 2, Ireland and\tCentre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis, UCD School of Veterinar"},{"author_name":"Kevin Hunt","author_inst":"Centre for Food Safety, UCD School of Biosystems and Food Engineering, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin D04 W6F6, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Ann Barber","author_inst":"1.\tCentre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis, UCD School of Veterinary Medicine, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin D04 W6F6, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Francis Butler","author_inst":"Centre for Food Safety, UCD School of Biosystems and Food Engineering, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin D04 W6F6, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth A Lane","author_inst":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Kildare St., Dublin 2, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Kirsty O Brien","author_inst":"Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), Unit 1301, City Gate, Cork, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Patrick Wall","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Physiotherapy and Sports Science, Woodview House University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Kieran A Walsh","author_inst":"Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), Unit 1301, City Gate, Cork, Ireland."},{"author_name":"Simon J More","author_inst":"1.\tCentre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis, UCD School of Veterinary Medicine, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin D04 W6F6, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Ivo Mueller","author_inst":"Division of Population Health and Immunity, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Michael T White","author_inst":"Malaria: Parasites and Hosts Unit, Department of Parasites and Insect Vectors, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Mitsuaki Matsui","author_inst":"Department of Global Health, Nagasaki University School of Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nagasaki, Japan"},{"author_name":"Sarah G Moxon","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Annettee Nakimuli","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Makerere University and Mulago Specialized Women and Neonatal Hospital, Kampala Uganda"},{"author_name":"Andrea B Pembe","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences, Dar es Salaam Tanzania"},{"author_name":"Emma Radovich","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Thomas van den Akker","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Leiden University Medical Centre and Athena Institute, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Lenka Benova","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20094987","rel_title":"Low albumin levels are associated with poorer outcomes in a case series of COVID-19 patients in Spain: a retrospective cohort study","rel_date":"2020-05-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20094987","rel_abs":"OBJECTIVE To describe the clinical characteristics and epidemiological features of severe (non-ICU) and critically patients (ICU) with COVID-19 at triage, prior hospitalization, in one of the main hospitals in The Balearic Islands health care system. DESIGN Retrospective observational study SETTING Son Llatzer University Hospital in Palma de Mallorca (Spain) PARTICIPANTS Among a cohort of 52 hospitalized patients as of 31 March 2020, 48 with complete demographic information and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive test, were analyzed. Data were collected between March 15th, 2020, and March 31th 2020, inclusive of these dates. MAIN OUTCOMES Clinical, vital signs and routine laboratory outcomes at the time of hospitalization, including symptoms reported prior to hospitalization. Demographics and baseline comorbidities were also collected. Mortality was reported at the end of the study. RESULTS 48 patients (27 non-ICU and 21 ICU) resident in Mallorca, Spain (mean age, 66 years, [range, 33-88 years]; 67% males) with positive SARS-CoV-2 infection were analyzed. There were no differences in age or sex among groups (p >.05). Initial symptoms included fever (100%), coughing (85%), dyspnea (76%), diarrhea (42%) and asthenia (21%). The majority of patients in this case series were hospitalized because of low SpO2 (SpO2 below 90%) and presentation of bilateral pneumonia (94%) at triage. ICU patients had a higher prevalence of dyspnea compared to non-ICU patients (95% vs 61%, p = .022). Acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) was presented in 100% of the ICU-patients. All the patients included in the study required oxygen therapy. ICU-patients had lymphopenia as well as hypoalbuminemia. Inflammatory markers such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin were significantly higher in ICU patients compared to non-ICU (p < .001).Lower albumin levels were associated with poor prognosis measured as longer hospital length (r= -0.472, p <.001) and mortality (r= -0.424, p=.003). Interestingly we also found, that MCV was lower among of those patients who died (p=.0002). As of April 28, 2020, 10 patients (8 ICU and 2 non-ICU) had died (21% mortality) and while 100% of the non-ICU patients had been discharged, 33% of ICU patients still remained hospitalized (5 in ICU and 2 had been transferred to ward). CONCLUSION Critically ill patients with COVID-19 present lymphopenia, hypoalbuminemia as well high levels of inflammation. Lower levels of albumin were associated with poorer outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Albumin might be of importance because of its association with disease severity in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Roberto de la Rica","author_inst":"Health Research Institute of the Balearic Islands (IdISBa), Multidisciplinary Sepsis Group"},{"author_name":"Marcio Borges","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Son LLatzer, Intensive Care Unit"},{"author_name":"Maria Aranda","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Son Llatzer, Intensive Care Unit"},{"author_name":"Alberto del Castillo","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Son LLatzer, Intensive Care Unit"},{"author_name":"Antonia Socias","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Son LLatzer, Intensive Care Unit"},{"author_name":"Antoni Payeras","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Son LLatzer, Internal Medicine Unit"},{"author_name":"Gemma Rialp","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Son LLatzer, Intensive Care Unit"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Socias","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Son LLatzer, Intensive Care Unit"},{"author_name":"Lluis Masmiquel","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Son LLatzer, Health Research Institute of the Balearic Islands (IdISBa)"},{"author_name":"Marta Gonzalez-Freire","author_inst":"Health Research Institute of the Balearic Islands, IdISBa"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth A Lane","author_inst":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Kildare St., Dublin 2, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Kirsty O Brien","author_inst":"Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), Unit 1301, City Gate, Cork, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Patrick Wall","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Physiotherapy and Sports Science, Woodview House University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Kieran A Walsh","author_inst":"Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), Unit 1301, City Gate, Cork, Ireland."},{"author_name":"Simon J More","author_inst":"1.\tCentre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis, UCD School of Veterinary Medicine, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin D04 W6F6, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Ivo Mueller","author_inst":"Division of Population Health and Immunity, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Michael T White","author_inst":"Malaria: Parasites and Hosts Unit, Department of Parasites and Insect Vectors, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Mitsuaki Matsui","author_inst":"Department of Global Health, Nagasaki University School of Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nagasaki, Japan"},{"author_name":"Sarah G Moxon","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Annettee Nakimuli","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Makerere University and Mulago Specialized Women and Neonatal Hospital, Kampala Uganda"},{"author_name":"Andrea B Pembe","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences, Dar es Salaam Tanzania"},{"author_name":"Emma Radovich","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Thomas van den Akker","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Leiden University Medical Centre and Athena Institute, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Lenka Benova","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.08.20095075","rel_title":"A rapid review of available evidence on the serial interval and generation time of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.08.20095075","rel_abs":"Abstract: Background: The serial interval is the time between symptom onsets in an infector infectee pair. The generation time, also known as the generation interval, is the time between infection events in an infector infectee pair. The serial interval and the generation time are key parameters for assessing the dynamics of a disease. A number of scientific papers reported information pertaining to the serial interval and\/or generation time for COVID19. Objectives: Conduct a rapid review of available evidence to advise on appropriate parameter values for serial interval and generation time in national COVID19 transmission models for Ireland and on methodological issues relating to those parameters. Methods: A review of scientific literature was conducted covering the period between December 1, 2019 and April 27, 2020. Nineteen scientific papers were evaluated in detail from 27 papers that contained information on the serial interval and\/or generation time for COVID19. Results: The mean of the serial interval ranged from 3.1 to 7.5 days, based on 22 estimates, and the median from 1.9 to 6.0 days (based on 7 estimates). Only three estimates were provided for the mean of the generation time. These ranged from 3.9 to 5.2 days. One estimate of 5.0 days was provided for the median of the generation time. Discussion: The values of the estimates for serial interval and generation time are heavily influenced by the contact rates between infectious and susceptible individuals. Mitigation measures that are introduced in a country or region are of paramount importance in this regard. The serial interval estimate of 6.6 days (95% confidence interval: 0.7, 19.0) from the paper by Cereda et al.[10] is likely to be the most relevant to European countries. National estimates should be obtained as soon as possible.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"John M Griffin","author_inst":"Centre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis, UCD School of Veterinary Medicine, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin D04 W6F6, Ireland."},{"author_name":"Aine B Collins","author_inst":"Centre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis, UCD School of Veterinary Medicine, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin D04 W6F6, Ireland."},{"author_name":"Kevin Hunt","author_inst":"School of Biosystems and Food Engineering, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland"},{"author_name":"David McEvoy","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Physiotherapy and Sports Science, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Miriam Casey","author_inst":"Centre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis, UCD School of Veterinary Medicine, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin D04 W6F6, Ireland."},{"author_name":"Andrew W Byrne","author_inst":"One Health Scientific Support Unit, Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM), Kildare Street, Dublin 2, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Conor G McAloon","author_inst":"Section of Herd Health and Animal Husbandry, UCD School of Veterinary Medicine, University College Dublin, Dublin D04 W6F6, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Ann Barber","author_inst":"Centre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis, UCD School of Veterinary Medicine, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin D04 W6F6, Ireland."},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Ann Lane","author_inst":"Centre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis, UCD School of Veterinary Medicine, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin D04 W6F6, Ireland."},{"author_name":"Simon J More","author_inst":"Centre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis, UCD School of Veterinary Medicine, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin D04 W6F6, Ireland."},{"author_name":"Elizabeth A Lane","author_inst":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Kildare St., Dublin 2, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Kirsty O Brien","author_inst":"Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), Unit 1301, City Gate, Cork, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Patrick Wall","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Physiotherapy and Sports Science, Woodview House University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Kieran A Walsh","author_inst":"Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), Unit 1301, City Gate, Cork, Ireland."},{"author_name":"Simon J More","author_inst":"1.\tCentre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis, UCD School of Veterinary Medicine, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin D04 W6F6, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Ivo Mueller","author_inst":"Division of Population Health and Immunity, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Michael T White","author_inst":"Malaria: Parasites and Hosts Unit, Department of Parasites and Insect Vectors, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Mitsuaki Matsui","author_inst":"Department of Global Health, Nagasaki University School of Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nagasaki, Japan"},{"author_name":"Sarah G Moxon","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Annettee Nakimuli","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Makerere University and Mulago Specialized Women and Neonatal Hospital, Kampala Uganda"},{"author_name":"Andrea B Pembe","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences, Dar es Salaam Tanzania"},{"author_name":"Emma Radovich","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Thomas van den Akker","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Leiden University Medical Centre and Athena Institute, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Lenka Benova","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20094714","rel_title":"DOUBLE POWER LAW FOR COVID-19: PREDICTION OF NEW CASES AND DEATH RATES IN ITALY AND SPAIN","rel_date":"2020-05-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20094714","rel_abs":"The novel corona virus SARS-CoV-2 appeared at the end of 2019, spreading rapidly and causing a severe respiratory syndrome (COVID-19) with high mortality (2-5%). Until a vaccine or therapy is found, the most effective method of prophylaxis has been to minimize transmission via rigorous social distancing and seclusion of all but essential workers. Such measures, implemented at different times and to varying degrees worldwide, have reduced the rate of transmission compared with early phases of the pandemic, resulting in flattening of the curve followed by a gradual reduction in mortality after >6 weeks of rigorous social distancing measures. The cost of rigorous social distancing has been seen in radically reduced economic activity, job losses, disruption of schooling and social institutions. A key question facing policy makers and individuals is when to resume normal economic and social activity in the face of persistent community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 . To help address this question, we have developed a model that accurately describes the entire transmission and mortality curves in Italy and Spain, two hard-hit countries that have maintained severe social distancing measures for over 2 months. Our model quantitatively describes the rapid rise and slow decay of new cases and deaths observed under stringent social distancing (the long tail effect). We predict that even when social distancing is rigorously maintained, the number of COVID-19 deaths after peak mortality may be 2-3 times larger than the total number of deaths up to the peak.

Moreover, stark differences in age distribution by race and ethnicity groups are seldom accounted for in analyses. Methods: To address these gaps, we conducted a cross-sectional study using publicly-reported Covid-19 mortality data to assess the quality of race and ethnicity data (Black, Latinx, white), and estimated age-adjusted disparities using a random effects meta-analytic approach. Results: We found only 28 states, and NYC, reported race and ethnicity-stratified Covid-19 mortality along with large variation in the percent of missing race and ethnicity data by state. Aggregated relative risk of death estimates for Black compared to the white population was 3.57 (95% CI: 2.84-4.48). Similarly, Latinx population displayed 1.88 (95% CI: 1.61-2.19) times higher risk of death than white patients. Discussion: In states providing race and ethnicity data, we identified significant population-level Covid-19 mortality disparities. We demonstrated the importance of adjusting for age differences across population groups to prevent underestimating disparities in younger population groups. The availability of high-quality and comprehensive race and ethnicity data is necessary to address factors contributing to inequity in Covid-19 mortality.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cary P Gross","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Utibe R Essien","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Saamir Pasha","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Jacob R Gross","author_inst":"Tufts University"},{"author_name":"Shi-yi Wang","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Marcella Nunez-Smith","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Conor G McAloon","author_inst":"Section of Herd Health and Animal Husbandry, UCD School of Veterinary Medicine, University College Dublin, Dublin D04 W6F6, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Ann Barber","author_inst":"Centre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis, UCD School of Veterinary Medicine, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin D04 W6F6, Ireland."},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Ann Lane","author_inst":"Centre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis, UCD School of Veterinary Medicine, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin D04 W6F6, Ireland."},{"author_name":"Simon J More","author_inst":"Centre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis, UCD School of Veterinary Medicine, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin D04 W6F6, Ireland."},{"author_name":"Elizabeth A Lane","author_inst":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Kildare St., Dublin 2, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Kirsty O Brien","author_inst":"Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), Unit 1301, City Gate, Cork, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Patrick Wall","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Physiotherapy and Sports Science, Woodview House University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Kieran A Walsh","author_inst":"Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), Unit 1301, City Gate, Cork, Ireland."},{"author_name":"Simon J More","author_inst":"1.\tCentre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis, UCD School of Veterinary Medicine, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin D04 W6F6, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Ivo Mueller","author_inst":"Division of Population Health and Immunity, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Michael T White","author_inst":"Malaria: Parasites and Hosts Unit, Department of Parasites and Insect Vectors, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Mitsuaki Matsui","author_inst":"Department of Global Health, Nagasaki University School of Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nagasaki, Japan"},{"author_name":"Sarah G Moxon","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Annettee Nakimuli","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Makerere University and Mulago Specialized Women and Neonatal Hospital, Kampala Uganda"},{"author_name":"Andrea B Pembe","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences, Dar es Salaam Tanzania"},{"author_name":"Emma Radovich","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Thomas van den Akker","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Leiden University Medical Centre and Athena Institute, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Lenka Benova","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20094441","rel_title":"Mobility trends provide a leading indicator of changes in SARS-CoV-2 transmission","rel_date":"2020-05-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20094441","rel_abs":"Determining the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on transmission of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is paramount for the design and deployment of effective public health policies.

We find that reduced mobility explains a large decrease in the effective reproductive number attained by April 1st and further identify state-to-state variation in the inferred transmission-mobility relationship. These findings indicate that simply relaxing stay-at-home orders can rapidly lead to outbreaks exceeding the scale of transmission that has occurred to date.

We aimed to explore the association between negative nasopharyngeal SARS CoV 2 PCR clearance and different therapeutic interventions. METHODOLOGY: This was a retrospective cohort study of 93 patients who were admitted to medical ward with a PCR confirmed diagnosis of COVID 19 and met the inclusion criteria in a tertiary hospital in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. There were three interventional subgroups (group A (n=45): who received antimalarial drug only classified as (A1), combined with azithromycin (A2) or combined with antiviral drugs (A3)), and one supportive care group (group B) (n=48). The primary and secondary endpoints of the study were achieving negative SARS_CoV_2 nasopharyngeal PCR sample within five days or less from the start of the intervention and 12 days or less from the diagnose, respectively. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 43.9 years (SD:15.9). A median time of 3.00 days (IQR:2.00 to 6.50) needed from the time of starting the intervention\/supportive care to the first negative PCR sample. There was no statistically significant difference neither between the percentage of patients in the interventional group and the supportive care group who achieved the primary or the secondary endpoint, nor in the median time needed to achieve the first negative PCR sample (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Prescribing antimalarial medications was not shown to shorten the disease course nor to accelerate the negative PCR conversion rate.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammed Hassan Shabrawishi","author_inst":"Pulmonology department, Al Noor Specialist Hospital, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Abdallah Y Naser","author_inst":"Faculty of Pharmacy, Isra University, Amman, Jordan."},{"author_name":"Hassan Alwafi","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, Umm Alqura University, College of Medicine, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Ahmad Mansoor Aldobyany","author_inst":"Pulmonology department, King Abdullah Medical City, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Abdelfattah Ahmed Touman","author_inst":"Pulmonology department, King Abdullah Medical City, Mecca, Saudi Arabia."},{"author_name":"Chris Bates","author_inst":"TPP (Leeds) Ltd"},{"author_name":"John Parry","author_inst":"TPP (Leeds) Ltd"},{"author_name":"Jemma L Walker","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine; Public Health England; NIHR Health Protection Research Unit (HPRU) in Immunisation"},{"author_name":"J Anthony Scott","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine; NIHR Health Protection Research Unit (HPRU) in Immunisation"},{"author_name":"Liam Smeeth","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine; NIHR Health Protection Research Unit (HPRU) in Immunisation"},{"author_name":"Joanne Yarwood","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mary Ramsay","author_inst":"Public Health England; NIHR Health Protection Research Unit (HPRU) in Immunisation"},{"author_name":"Michael Edelstein","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Kieran A Walsh","author_inst":"Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), Unit 1301, City Gate, Cork, Ireland."},{"author_name":"Simon J More","author_inst":"1.\tCentre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis, UCD School of Veterinary Medicine, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin D04 W6F6, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Ivo Mueller","author_inst":"Division of Population Health and Immunity, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Michael T White","author_inst":"Malaria: Parasites and Hosts Unit, Department of Parasites and Insect Vectors, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Mitsuaki Matsui","author_inst":"Department of Global Health, Nagasaki University School of Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nagasaki, Japan"},{"author_name":"Sarah G Moxon","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Annettee Nakimuli","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Makerere University and Mulago Specialized Women and Neonatal Hospital, Kampala Uganda"},{"author_name":"Andrea B Pembe","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences, Dar es Salaam Tanzania"},{"author_name":"Emma Radovich","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Thomas van den Akker","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Leiden University Medical Centre and Athena Institute, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Lenka Benova","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20094086","rel_title":"Transmission in Latent Period Causes A Large Number of Infected People in the United States","rel_date":"2020-05-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20094086","rel_abs":"The cumulative number of confirmed cases in the United States exceeded one million on 29 April 2020, becoming the country of the most serious pandemic in the world.

It is still unclear how comorbidities affect the risk of infection and severity of COVID-19. Methods: A nationwide retrospective case-control study of 65,149 individuals, aged 18 years or older, whose medical cost for COVID-19 testing were claimed until April 8, 2020. The diagnosis of COVID-19 and severity of COVID-19 infection were identified from the reimbursement data using diagnosis codes and based on whether respiratory support was used, respectively. Odds ratios were estimated using multiple logistic regression, after adjusting for age, sex, region, healthcare utilization, and insurance status. Results: The COVID-19 group (5,172 of 65,149) was younger and showed higher proportion of females. 5.6% (293 of 5,172) of COVID-19 cases were severe. The severe COVID-19 group had older patients and a higher male ratio than the non-severe group. Cushing syndrome (Odds ratio range (ORR) 2.059-2.358), chronic renal disease (ORR 1.292-1.604), anemia (OR 1.132), bone marrow dysfunction (ORR 1.471-1.645), and schizophrenia (ORR 1.287-1.556) showed significant association with infection of COVID-19. In terms of severity, diabetes (OR 1.417, 95% CI 1.047-1.917), hypertension (OR 1.378, 95% CI 1.008-1.883), heart failure (ORR 1.562-1.730), chronic lower respiratory disease (ORR 1.361-1.413), non-infectious lower digestive system disease (ORR 1.361-1.418), rheumatoid arthritis (ORR 1.865-1.908), substance use (ORR 2.790-2.848), and schizophrenia (ORR 3.434-3.833) were related with severe COVID-19.

Next generation sequencing technologies have enabled large-scale genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 as thousands of isolates are being sequenced around the world and deposited in public data repositories. A number of methods using both short- and long-read technologies are currently being applied for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing, including amplicon approaches, metagenomic methods, and sequence capture or enrichment methods. Given the small genome size, the ability to sequence SARS-CoV-2 at scale is limited by the cost and labor associated with making sequencing libraries. Here we describe a low-cost, streamlined, all amplicon-based method for sequencing SARS-CoV-2, which bypasses costly and time-consuming library preparation steps. We benchmark this tailed amplicon method against both the ARTIC amplicon protocol and sequence capture approaches and show that an optimized tailed amplicon approach achieves comparable amplicon balance, coverage metrics, and variant calls to the ARTIC v3 approach and represents a cost-effective and highly scalable method for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daryl M Gohl","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"John Garbe","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Patrick Grady","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Jerry Daniel","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Ray H.

The ACE2 gene is expressed in SARS-CoV-2 target cells, including Type II Pneumocytes (Ziegler, 2020), and is activated by interferons. Viral RNA was also detected in breast milk (Wu et al., 2020), raising the possibility that ACE2 expression is under the control of cytokines through the JAK-STAT pathway. Here we show that Ace2 expression in mammary tissue is induced during pregnancy and lactation, which coincides with the establishment of a candidate enhancer. The prolactin-activated transcription factor STAT5 binds to tandem sites that coincide with activating histone enhancer marks and additional transcription components. The presence of pan JAK-STAT components in mammary alveolar cells and in Type II Pneumocytes combined with the autoregulation of both STAT1 and STAT5 suggests a prominent role of cytokine signaling pathways in cells targeted by SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lothar Hennighausen","author_inst":"NIDDK, NIH"},{"author_name":"Hye Kyung Lee","author_inst":"NIDDK, NIH"},{"author_name":"Patrick Grady","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Jerry Daniel","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Ray H.

Attenuation typically relies on de-optimisation of codon pairs and maximization of CpG dinculeotide frequencies. So as to formulate evolutionarily-informed attenuation strategies, that aim to force nucleotide usage against the estimated direction favoured by selection, here we examine available whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV2 to infer patterns of mutation and selection on synonymous sites. Analysis of mutational profiles indicates a strong mutation bias towards T with concomitant selection against T. Accounting for dinucleotide effects reinforces this conclusion, observed TT content being a quarter of that expected under neutrality. A significantly different mutational profile at CDS sites that are not 4-fold degenerate is consistent with contemporaneous selection against T mutations more widely. Although selection against CpG dinucleotides is expected to drive synonymous site G+C content below mutational equilibrium, observed G+C content is slightly above equilibrium, possibly because of selection for higher expression. Consistent with gene-specific selection against CpG dinucleotides, we observe systematic differences of CpG content between SARS-CoV2 genes. We propose an evolutionarily informed gene-bespoke approach to attenuation that, unusually, seeks to increase usage of the already most common synonymous codons. Comparable analysis of H1N1 and Ebola finds that GC3 deviated from neutral equilibrium is not a universal feature, cautioning against generalization of results.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alan M Rice","author_inst":"The Milner Centre for Evolution, University of Bath"},{"author_name":"Atahualpa Castillo Morales","author_inst":"The Milner Centre for Evolution, University of Bath"},{"author_name":"Alexander T Ho","author_inst":"The Milner Centre for Evolution, Department of Biology and Biochemistry, University of Bath"},{"author_name":"Christine Mordstein","author_inst":"The Milner Centre for Evolution, Department of Biology and Biochemistry, University of Bath"},{"author_name":"Stefanie M\u00fchlhausen","author_inst":"The Milner Centre for Evolution, Department of Biology and Biochemistry, University of Bath"},{"author_name":"Samir Watson","author_inst":"Aarhus University"},{"author_name":"Laura Cano","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute for Genetics and Molecular Medicine, The University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Bethan Young","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute for Genetics and Molecular Medicine, The University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Grzegorz Kudla","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Laurence D.

Most of the vaccine and drug development has focused on the spike proteins and viral RNA-polymerases. Using bioinformatics and structural modeling approach, we modeled the structure of the envelope (E)-protein of novel SARS-CoV-2. The E-protein of this virus shares sequence similarity with that of SARS-CoV-1, and is highly conserved in the N-terminal regions. Incidentally, compared to spike proteins, E proteins demonstrate lower disparity and mutability among the isolated sequences. Using homology modeling, we found that the most favorable structure could function as a gated proton channel. Combining pocket estimation and docking with water, we determined that GLU 8 and ASN 15 in the N-terminal region were in close proximity to form H-bonds. Additionally, two distinct \u201ccore\u201d structures were visible, the hydrophobic core and the central core, which may regulate the opening\/closing of the channel. We propose this as a mechanism of viral proton channeling activity which may play a critical role in viral infection. In addition, it provides a structural basis and additional avenues for generating therapeutic interventions against the virus.One Sentence Summary Structural modeling of the novel coronavirus envelope proteins (E-proteins) demonstrating its possible proton channeling activity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Manish Sarkar","author_inst":"Bose Institute"},{"author_name":"Soham Saha","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Alexander T Ho","author_inst":"The Milner Centre for Evolution, Department of Biology and Biochemistry, University of Bath"},{"author_name":"Christine Mordstein","author_inst":"The Milner Centre for Evolution, Department of Biology and Biochemistry, University of Bath"},{"author_name":"Stefanie M\u00fchlhausen","author_inst":"The Milner Centre for Evolution, Department of Biology and Biochemistry, University of Bath"},{"author_name":"Samir Watson","author_inst":"Aarhus University"},{"author_name":"Laura Cano","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute for Genetics and Molecular Medicine, The University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Bethan Young","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute for Genetics and Molecular Medicine, The University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Grzegorz Kudla","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Laurence D.
