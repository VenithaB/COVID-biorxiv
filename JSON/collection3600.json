The aim of this study was to examine the readability of international and national health organizations on Covid-19 information in their websites employing a previously validated tool. Methods: A purposive sample of publicly accessible governmental and popular international health organization websites was selected. The readability of the websites Covid-19 public health information was estimated using the previously validated SMOG readability formula, which determined reading level by correlating the number of polysyllabic words. Results: Of the 10 websites included in the analysis, none had Covid-19 public health information at the USDHHS recommended reading level. The material ranged in reading level at undergraduate level or above. Discussion: The findings indicate that the online Covid-19 materials need to be modified in order to reach recommended reading levels. This study can be of practical use to policy makers and public health government officials when designing, modifying, and evaluating Covid-19 materials. We recommend using simple, non-polysyllable words to ensure that Covid-19 public health information materials are written at the recommended reading levels.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patricia Moyinoluwa Ojo","author_inst":"University College Cork"},{"author_name":"Tolulope Omowonuola Okeowo","author_inst":"University College Cork"},{"author_name":"Ann Mary Thampy","author_inst":"University College Cork"},{"author_name":"Zubair Kabir","author_inst":"University College Cork"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.29.20142307","rel_title":"Temperature and Humidity Do Not Influence Global COVID-19 Incidence as Inferred from Causal Models","rel_date":"2020-06-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.29.20142307","rel_abs":"The relationship between meteorological factors such as temperature and humidity with COVID-19 incidence is still unclear after 6 months of the beginning of the pandemic. Some literature confirms the association of temperature with disease transmission while some oppose the same. This work intends to determine whether there is a causal association between temperature, humidity and Covid-19 cases. Three different causal models were used to capture stochastic, chaotic and symbolic natured time-series data and to provide a robust & unbiased analysis by constructing networks of causal relationships between the variables. Granger-Causality method, Transfer Entropy method & Convergent Cross-Mapping (CCM) was done on data from regions with different temperatures and cases greater than 50,000 as of 13th May 2020. From the Granger-Causality test we found that in only Canada, the United Kingdom, temperature and daily new infections are causally linked. The same results were obtained from Convergent Cross Mapping for India. Again using Granger-Causality test, we found that in Russia only, relative humidity is causally linked to daily new cases. Thus, a Generalized Additive Model with a smoothing spline function was fitted for these countries to understand the directionality. Using the combined results of the said models, we were able to conclude that there is no evidence of a causal association between temperature, humidity and Covid-19 cases.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Raghav Awasthi","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Aditya Nagori","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology"},{"author_name":"Pradeep Singh","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ridam Pal","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Vineet Joshi","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Tavpritesh Sethi","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.28.20142232","rel_title":"EVALUATION OF THE ROCHE ELECSYS ANTI-SARS-COV-2 ASSAY.","rel_date":"2020-06-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.28.20142232","rel_abs":"Background: Little is known about the performance of the Roche novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antibody (anti-SARS-CoV-2) assay. We provide an extensive evaluation of this fully automated assay on the Cobas e801\/e602 immunoassay analysers. Methods: We assessed the linearity, precision, and throughput of the Roche anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay. Sensitivity was calculated from 349 SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive samples; specificity was determined from 714 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-naive samples. We examined cross-reactivity against other antibody positive samples (syphilis, RF, ANA, ds-DNA, influenza, dengue, HBV, HCV) and the anti-SARS-CoV-2 kinetics. Results: The assay cut-off index (COI) was linear up to 90.7. The inter-assay precision was 2.9% for a negative control (COI=0.1) and 5.1% for a positive control (COI=3.0). Assay time is 18min and results are available 1 minute later; throughput for 300 samples was 76 minutes. No cross-reactivity was observed with other antibody positive samples; specificity was 100%. The assay has a sensitivity of 97.1% 14 days after PCR positivity (POS) and 100% at [&ge;]21 days POS; 48.2% of cases had anti-SARS-CoV-2 within 6 days POS. In 11 subjects in whom serum was available prior to a positive antibody signal (COI [&ge;]1.0) the interval between the last negative and first positive COI (time to sero-conversion) on average is 3 days (range 1-6 days) and 4 more days (range 1-7) for the anti-SARS-CoV-2 to plateau. Conclusion: The Roche anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay shows excellent performance with minimal cross-reactivity from other viral and confounding antibodies. Antibody development and sero-conversion appears quite early.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"CS Lau","author_inst":"Changi General Hospital"},{"author_name":"SP Hoo","author_inst":"Changi General Hospital"},{"author_name":"SF Yew","author_inst":"Changi General Hospital"},{"author_name":"SK Ong","author_inst":"Sengkang General Hospital"},{"author_name":"LT Lum","author_inst":"Sengkang General Hospital"},{"author_name":"PY Heng","author_inst":"Khoo Teck Puat Hospital"},{"author_name":"JG Tan","author_inst":"Khoo Teck Puat Hospital"},{"author_name":"MS Wong","author_inst":"Khoo Teck Puat Hospital"},{"author_name":"TC Aw","author_inst":"Changi General Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.28.20141945","rel_title":"A Robust, Safe and Scalable Magnetic Nanoparticle Workflow for RNA Extraction of Pathogens from Clinical and Environmental Samples","rel_date":"2020-06-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.28.20141945","rel_abs":"Diagnosis and surveillance of emerging pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 depend on nucleic acid isolation from clinical and environmental samples. Under normal circumstances, samples would be processed using commercial proprietary reagents in Biosafety 2 (BSL-2) or higher facilities. A pandemic at the scale of COVID-19 has caused a global shortage of proprietary reagents and BSL-2 laboratories to safely perform testing. Therefore, alternative solutions are urgently needed to address these challenges. We developed an open-source method called Magnetic- nanoparticle-Aided Viral RNA Isolation of Contagious Samples (MAVRICS) that is built upon reagents that are either readily available or can be synthesized in any molecular biology laboratory with basic equipment. Unlike conventional methods, MAVRICS works directly in samples inactivated in acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform (e.g., TRIzol), thus allowing infectious samples to be handled safely without biocontainment facilities. Using 36 COVID-19 patient samples, 2 wastewater samples and 1 human pathogens control sample, we showed that MAVRICS rivals commercial kits in validated diagnostic tests of SARS-CoV-2, influenza viruses, and respiratory syncytial virus. MAVRICS is scalable and thus could become an enabling technology for widespread community testing and wastewater monitoring in the current and future pandemics.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gerardo Ramos-Mandujano","author_inst":"Biological and Environmental Sciences and Engineering Division (BESE), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal 23955-6900, Kingdom of"},{"author_name":"Rahul Salunke","author_inst":"Biological and Environmental Sciences and Engineering Division (BESE), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal 23955-6900, Kingdom of"},{"author_name":"Sara Mfarrej","author_inst":"Biological and Environmental Sciences and Engineering Division (BESE), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal 23955-6900, Kingdom of"},{"author_name":"Andri Rachmadi","author_inst":"Biological and Environmental Sciences and Engineering Division (BESE), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal 23955-6900, Kingdom of"},{"author_name":"Sharif Hala","author_inst":"Biological and Environmental Sciences and Engineering Division (BESE), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal 23955-6900, Kingdom of"},{"author_name":"Jinna Xu","author_inst":"Biological and Environmental Sciences and Engineering Division (BESE), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal 23955-6900, Kingdom of"},{"author_name":"Fadwa S Alofi","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Department, King Fahad Hospital, Madinah, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Asim Khogeer","author_inst":"Plan and Research Department, General Directorate of Health Affairs Makkah Region, MOH, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Anwar M Hashem","author_inst":"Vaccines and Immunotherapy Unit, King Fahd Medical Research Center; King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Naif AM Almontashiri","author_inst":"College of Applied Medical Sciences, Taibah University, Madinah, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Afrah Alsomali","author_inst":"King Abdullah Medical Complex (KAMC), Jeddah, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Samir Hamdan","author_inst":"Biological and Environmental Sciences and Engineering Division (BESE), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal 23955-6900, Kingdom of"},{"author_name":"Peiying Hong","author_inst":"Biological and Environmental Sciences and Engineering Division (BESE), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal 23955-6900, Kingdom of"},{"author_name":"Arnab Pain","author_inst":"Biological and Environmental Sciences and Engineering Division (BESE), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal 23955-6900, Kingdom of"},{"author_name":"Mo Li","author_inst":"Biological and Environmental Sciences and Engineering Division (BESE), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal 23955-6900, Kingdom of"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.28.20140475","rel_title":"Reliability of serological tests for COVID-19: Comparison of three immunochromatography test kits for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.","rel_date":"2020-06-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.28.20140475","rel_abs":"Background: Several immunochromatographic serological test kits have been developed to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) specific antibodies, but their relative performance and potential clinical utility is unclear. Methods: Three commercially available serological test kits were evaluated using 99 serum samples collected from 29 patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Results: The IgM antibody-positive rates of the three serological test kits for samples taken at the early stage of the disease (0-6 days after onset) were 19.0%, 23.8%, and 19.0%, respectively. The IgM antibody-positive rates over the entire period were 21.2%, 60.6%, and 15.2%, respectively. The IgG antibody-positive rates for samples taken after 13 days of onset were 100.0%, 97.6%, and 97.6%, respectively. Conclusion: There were large differences among the results of the three test kits. Only few cases showed positive results for IgM in the early stage of disease and the IgM antibody-positive rates over the entire period were low, suggesting that the kits used in this study were unsuitable for diagnosis of COVID-19. The IgG antibody was positive in almost all samples after 13 days of onset, suggesting that it may be useful for determining infections in the recent past.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hidetsugu Fujigaki","author_inst":"Fujita Health University Graduate School of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Masao Takemura","author_inst":"Fujita Health University Graduate School of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Michiko Osawa","author_inst":"Fujita Health University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Aki Sakurai","author_inst":"Fujita Health University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kentaro Nakamoto","author_inst":"Fujita Health University Graduate School of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Koichi Seto","author_inst":"Fujita Health University"},{"author_name":"Takashi Fujita","author_inst":"Fujita Health University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tadayoshi Hata","author_inst":"Fujita Health University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hidehiko Akiyama","author_inst":"Fujita Health University Graduate School of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yohei Doi","author_inst":"Fujita Health University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kuniaki Saito","author_inst":"Department of Disease Control and Prevention, Fujita Health University Graduate School of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Samir Hamdan","author_inst":"Biological and Environmental Sciences and Engineering Division (BESE), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal 23955-6900, Kingdom of"},{"author_name":"Peiying Hong","author_inst":"Biological and Environmental Sciences and Engineering Division (BESE), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal 23955-6900, Kingdom of"},{"author_name":"Arnab Pain","author_inst":"Biological and Environmental Sciences and Engineering Division (BESE), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal 23955-6900, Kingdom of"},{"author_name":"Mo Li","author_inst":"Biological and Environmental Sciences and Engineering Division (BESE), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal 23955-6900, Kingdom of"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.28.20142240","rel_title":"Association of BMI and Obesity with Composite poor outcome in COVID-19 adult patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","rel_date":"2020-06-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.28.20142240","rel_abs":"Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the association between obesity and composite poor outcome in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search from PubMed and Embase database. We included all original research articles in COVID-19 adult patients and obesity based on classification of Body Mass Index (BMI) and composite poor outcome which consist of mortality, morbidity, admission of Intensive Care Unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), and severe COVID-19. Results: Nine studies were included in meta-analysis with 6 studies presented BMI as continuous outcome and 3 studies presented BMI as dichotomous outcome (obese and non-obese). Most studies were conducted in China (55.5%) with remaining studies from French, Germany, and United States (US). COVID-19 patients with composite poor outcome had higher BMI with mean difference 0.55 kg\/m2 (95% CI 0.07-1.03, P=0.02). BMI [&ge;]30 (obese) was associated with composite poor outcome with odds ratio 1.89 (95% CI 1.06-3.34, P=0.03). Multivariate meta-regression analysis by including three moderators: age, hypertension, and Diabetes Mellitus type 2 (DM type 2) showed the association between obesity and composite poor outcome was affected by age with regression coefficient =-0.06 and P=0.02. Subgroup analysis was not performed due to the limited number of studies for several outcomes. Conclusion: Obesity is a risk factor of composite poor outcome of COVID-19. On the other hand, COVID-19 patients with composite poor outcome have higher BMI. BMI is an important routine procedure that should be assessed in the management of COVID-19 patients and special attention should be given to patients with obesity.

Accurate information on the number of deaths caused by COVID-19 is vital for policy makers and health care providers. Methods: We performed a retrospective study of weekly data for Ohio. To estimate expected mortality in 2020 we employed data from 2010 through 2019, adjusted for secular trends and seasonality. We estimated excess mortality as the number of observed deaths less the number of expected deaths. We conducted the analysis for the entire population and by age, gender, and county. Results: We estimated 2,088 (95% CI 1,119-3,119) excess deaths due to natural causes in Ohio from March 15, 2020 through June 6, 2020. While the largest number excess of deaths was observed in the 80+ age group, our estimate of 366 (95% CI 110-655) excess deaths for those between 20 and 49 years of age substantially exceeds the reported number of COVID-19 deaths of 66. Conclusions: Our methodology addressed some of the challenges of estimating the number of deaths caused by COVID-19. Our finding of excess deaths being considerably greater than the reported number of COVID-19 deaths for those aged 20 to 49 years old suggests that current tracking methods may not capture a significant number of COVID-19 deaths for this group.

This drug is associated with a wide range of side effects, mainly anemia, so its use in patients with potential respiratory affectation could not be appropriate. The evidences of adverse events associated with RBV-use has mainly been derived in the context of hepatitis C (HCV) treatment, however the possible use of RBV in CoVID-19 patients could be limited to 14 days. Methods: Longitudinal study including HIV\/HCV coinfected patients. We evaluate the hemoglobin dynamics and reductions as well as evaluate the development rate of anemia during the first 2 weeks of therapy in HCV infected patients. Results: 189 patients were included in the study. The median hemoglobin levels were 14.6 g\/dL (IQR: 13.2-15.6 g\/dL) and 13.5 g\/dL (IQR: 12.3-14.5 g\/dL) at weeks 1 and 2 of therapy, respectively.

These are often collectively labelled social distancing and lockdown. On the 23rd June 2020, Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom announced substantial easings of restrictions. This paper examines some of the data he presented. Methods: Generalised additive models, with negative binomial errors and cyclic term representing day-of-week effects, were fitted to data on the daily numbers of new confirmed cases of COVID-19. Exponential rates for the epidemic were estimated for different periods, and then used to calculate R, the reproduction number, for the disease in different periods. Results: After an initial stabilisation, the lockdown reduced R to around 0.81 (95% CI: 0.79, 0.82). This value increased to around 0.94 (95% CI 0.89, 0.996) for the fortnight from the 9th June 2020. Conclusions: Official UK data, presented as the easing of the lockdown was announced, shows that R was already more than half way back to 1 at that point. That suggests there was little scope for the announced changes to be implemented without restarting the spread of the disease.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mike Lonergan","author_inst":"University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Mario Frias","author_inst":"IMIBIC"},{"author_name":"Isabel Machuca","author_inst":"IMIBIC"},{"author_name":"Marina Gallo","author_inst":"IMIBIC"},{"author_name":"Pedro Lopez-Lopez","author_inst":"IMIBIC"},{"author_name":"Angela Camacho","author_inst":"IMIBIC"},{"author_name":"Antonio Rivero","author_inst":"IMIBIC"},{"author_name":"Guh Asthagiri Arunkumar","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Meagan McMahon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Jhang","author_inst":"Mount Sinai Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michael Nowak","author_inst":"Mount Sinai Hospital"},{"author_name":"Viviana Simon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Emilia Sordillo","author_inst":"Mount Sinai Hospital"},{"author_name":"Harm van Bakel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.28.20142174","rel_title":"COVID-19: Saving lives and livelihoods using population density driven testing","rel_date":"2020-06-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.28.20142174","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk generally increases with proximity of those shedding the virus to those susceptible to infection.

To understand which containment measures altered disease dynamics, we estimate change points in COVID-19 dynamics from official Italian data.

Surprisingly, we find a change point in mid April, which does not correspond to national measures, but may be explained by regional interventions. Change points in regional COVID-19 dynamics correlate well with local distribution of free face masks and regional orders requiring their mandatory use. Regions with no specific interventions showed no change point during April.

There is no specific antiviral therapy for COVID-19, and the use of Remdesivir for treating COVID-19 will likely continue before clinical trials are completed. Due to the lengthening pandemic and evolving nature of the virus, predicting potential residues prone to mutations is crucial for the management of Remdesivir resistance. We used a rational ligand-based interface design complemented with mutational mapping to generate a total of 100,000 mutations and provide insight into the functional outcome of mutations in the Remdesivir-binding site in nsp12. After designing 56 residues in the Remdesivir binding site of nsp12, the designs retained 96-98% sequence identity, which suggests that SARS-CoV-2 attains resistance and develops further infectivity with very few mutations in the nsp12. We also identified affinity-attenuating Remdesivir binding designs of nsp12. Several mutants acquired decreased binding affinity with Remdesivir, which suggested drug resistance. These hotspot residues had a higher probability of undergoing selective mutations in the future to develop Remdesivir and related drug-based resistance. A comparison of 21 nsp12 Remdesivir-bound designs to the 13 EIDD-2801-bound nsp12 designs suggested that EIDD-2801 would be more effective in preventing the emergence of resistant mutations and against Remdesivir-resistance strains due to the restricted mutational landscape. Combined with the availability of more genomic data, our information on mutation repertoires is critical to guide scientists to rational structure-based drug discovery. Knowledge of the potential residues prone to mutation improves our understanding and management of drug resistance and disease pathogenesis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aditya Padhi","author_inst":"RIKEN"},{"author_name":"Rohit Shukla","author_inst":"North-Eastern Hill University"},{"author_name":"Timir Tripathi","author_inst":"North-Eastern Hill University"},{"author_name":"Marina Gallo","author_inst":"IMIBIC"},{"author_name":"Pedro Lopez-Lopez","author_inst":"IMIBIC"},{"author_name":"Angela Camacho","author_inst":"IMIBIC"},{"author_name":"Antonio Rivero","author_inst":"IMIBIC"},{"author_name":"Guh Asthagiri Arunkumar","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Meagan McMahon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Jhang","author_inst":"Mount Sinai Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michael Nowak","author_inst":"Mount Sinai Hospital"},{"author_name":"Viviana Simon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Emilia Sordillo","author_inst":"Mount Sinai Hospital"},{"author_name":"Harm van Bakel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"biophysics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.26.174557","rel_title":"Stereotypic Neutralizing VH Clonotypes Against SARS-CoV-2 RBD in COVID-19 Patients and the Healthy Population","rel_date":"2020-06-29","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.26.174557","rel_abs":"In six of seven severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) patients, VH clonotypes, encoded by either immunoglobin heavy variable (IGHV)3-53 or IGHV3-66 and immunoglobin heavy joining (IGHJ)6, were identified in IgG1, IgA1, and IgA2 subtypes, with minimal mutations, and could be paired with diverse light chains, resulting in binding to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD).

Serum samples, along with nasopharyngeal specimens were collected from various cohorts and analyzed by ELISA and rRT-PCR, respectively. A total of 167 serum samples were tested for serum IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in outpatient cohorts, 15 (8.9%) were positive by rRT-PCR and the remaining 152 (91%) were negative. We used these data to generate two different assay cutoffs for serum IgG assay and investigated percent concordance with rRT-PCR test results. The emergency department data revealed, out of 151 nasopharyngeal swabs, 4 (2.6%) were positive by rRT-PCR and 18 (11.9%) were positive for serum IgG assay.

It is not known how phosphorylation controls N protein function. Here we show that the N protein of SARS-CoV-2, together with viral RNA, forms biomolecular condensates12\u201315. Unmodified N protein forms partially ordered gel-like structures that depend on multivalent RNA-protein and protein-protein interactions. Phosphorylation reduces a subset of these interactions, generating a more liquid-like droplet. We speculate that distinct oligomeric states support the two functions of the N protein: unmodified protein forms a structured oligomer that is suited for nucleocapsid assembly, and phosphorylated protein forms a liquid-like compartment for viral genome processing.

This study indicates that Renessans, containing iodine, may have potential activity against SARS-CoV-2 which needs to be further investigated in human clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Imran Altaf","author_inst":"Quality Operation Laboratory,  University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Faisal Nadeem","author_inst":"Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Nadir Hussain","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Nawaz","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Sohail Raza","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Asad Ali","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Sohail Hasan","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Nazish Matti","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Ashraf","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Ihsan Ullah","author_inst":"Institute of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Waqar Aziz","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Sehar Fazal","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Saira Rafique","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Adnan","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Nageen Sardar","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Tahir Khan","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Moavia","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore;"},{"author_name":"Sohaib Ashraf","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Sheikh Zaid Hospital Lahore"},{"author_name":"Zarfishan Tahir","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Nadia Mukhtar","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Tahir Yaqub","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.29.178293","rel_title":"Angiotensin-(3-4) modulates angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) downregulation in proximal tubule cells due to overweight and undernutrition: implications regarding the severity of renal lesions in Covid-19 infection","rel_date":"2020-06-29","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.29.178293","rel_abs":"The renal lesions \u2013 including severe acute kidney injury \u2013 are severe outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 infections.

In the present communication we compare the influence of overweight and undernutrition in the levels of renal angiotensin converting enzymes 1 and 2. Since the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has been implicated in the progress of kidney failure during Covid-19, we also investigated the influence of Angiotensin-(3\u20134) (Ang-(3\u20134)) the shortest angiotensin-derived peptide, which is considered the physiological antagonist of several angiotensin II effects. We found that both overweight and undernutrition downregulate the levels of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) without influence on the levels of ACE1 in kidney rats. Administration of Ang-(3\u20134) recovers the control levels of ACE2 in overweight but not in undernourished rats. We conclude that chronic and opposite nutritional conditions play a central role in the pathophysiology of renal Covid-19 lesions, and that the role of RAAS is also different in overweight and undernutrition.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rafael Luzes","author_inst":"Federal University of Rio de Janeiro"},{"author_name":"Humberto Muzi-Filho","author_inst":"Federal University of Rio de Janeiro"},{"author_name":"Amaury Pereira-Acacio","author_inst":"Graduate Program of Translational Biomedicine\/BIOTRANS UNIGRANRIO\/INMETRO\/UEZO"},{"author_name":"Thuany Crisostomo","author_inst":"Federal University of Rio de Janeiro"},{"author_name":"Adalberto Vieyra","author_inst":"Federal University of Rio de Janeiro"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Asad Ali","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Sohail Hasan","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Nazish Matti","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Ashraf","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Ihsan Ullah","author_inst":"Institute of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Waqar Aziz","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Sehar Fazal","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Saira Rafique","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Adnan","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Nageen Sardar","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Tahir Khan","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Moavia","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore;"},{"author_name":"Sohaib Ashraf","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Sheikh Zaid Hospital Lahore"},{"author_name":"Zarfishan Tahir","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Nadia Mukhtar","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Lahore"},{"author_name":"Tahir Yaqub","author_inst":"University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.29.177238","rel_title":"Comprehensive annotations of the mutational spectra of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein: a fast and accurate pipeline","rel_date":"2020-06-29","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.29.177238","rel_abs":"In order to explore nonsynonymous mutations and deletions in the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, we comprehensively analyzed 35,750 complete S protein gene sequences from across six continents and five climate zones around the world, as documented in the GISAID database as of June 24th, 2020. Through a custom Python-based pipeline for analyzing mutations, we identified 27,801 (77.77 % of spike sequences) mutated strains compared to Wuhan-Hu-1 strain. 84.40% of these strains had only single amino-acid (aa) substitution mutations, but an outlier strain from Bosnia and Herzegovina (EPI_ISL_463893) was found to possess six aa substitutions. The D614G variant of the major G clade was found to be predominant across circulating strains in all climates. We also identified 988 unique aa substitution mutations distributed across 660 positions within the spike protein, with eleven sites showing high variability - these sites had four types of aa variations at each position. Besides, 17 in-frame deletions at four major regions (three in N-terminal domain and one just downstream of the RBD) may have possible impact on attenuation. Moreover, the mutational frequency differed significantly (p= 0.003, Kruskal-Wallis test) among the SARS-CoV-2 strains worldwide. This study presents a fast and accurate pipeline for identifying nonsynonymous mutations and deletions from large dataset for any particular protein coding sequence and presents this S protein data as representative analysis. By using separate multi-sequence alignment with MAFFT, removing ambiguous sequences and in-frame stop codons, and utilizing pairwise alignment, this method can derive nonsynonymus mutations (Reference:Position:Strain). We believe this will aid in the surveillance of any proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2, and will prove to be crucial in tracking the ever-increasing variation of many other divergent RNA viruses in the future.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"M.

Owing to poor understanding of pathogenicity, the virus is eluding treatment and complicating recovery. Regulatory roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) during viral infection and associated antagonism of host antiviral immune responses has become more evident in last decade. To elucidate possible functions of lncRNAs in the COVID-19 pathobiology, we have utilized RNA-seq dataset of SARS-CoV-2 infected lung epithelial cells.\n\nResultsOur analyses uncover 21 differentially expressed lncRNAs whose functions are broadly involved in cell survival and regulation of gene expression. By network enrichment analysis we find that these lncRNAs can directly interact with differentially expressed protein-coding genes ADAR, EDN1, KYNU, MALL, TLR2 and YWHAG; and also AKAP8L, EXOSC5, GDF15, HECTD1, LARP4B, LARP7, MIPOL1, UPF1, MOV10 and PRKAR2A, host genes that interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins. These genes are involved in cellular signaling, metabolism, immune response and RNA homeostasis. Since lncRNAs have been known to sponge microRNAs and protect expression of upregulated genes, we also identified 9 microRNAs that are induced in viral infections; however, some lncRNAs are able to block their usual suppressive effect on overexpressed genes and consequently contribute to host defense and cell survival.\n\nConclusionsOur investigation determines that deregulated lncRNAs in SARS-CoV-2 infection are involved in viral proliferation, cellular survival, and immune response, ultimately determining disease outcome and this information could drive the search for novel RNA therapeutics as a treatment option.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rafeed Rahman Turjya","author_inst":"Department of Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology, University of Dhaka, Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Md.

However, lack of knowledge about the tissue-specific expression pattern of various proteins in these animals and the unavailability of reagents like antibodies against this species hampers optimal use of these models. The major objective of our current study was to analyze the tissue-specific expression pattern of angiotensin{square}converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a proven functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in different organs of the hamster. We have adapted immunoblot analysis, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence analysis techniques to evaluate the ACE2 expression pattern in different tissues of the Syrian golden hamster. We found that kidney, small intestine, esophagus, tongue, brain, and liver express ACE2. Epithelium of proximal tubules of kidney and surface epithelium of ileum expresses a very high amount of this protein. Surprisingly, analysis of stained tissue sections for ACE2 showed no detectable expression of ACE2 in the lung or tracheal epithelial cells. Similarly, all parts of the large intestine (caecum, colon, and rectum) were negative for ACE2 expression. Together, our findings corroborate some of the earlier reports related to ACE2 expression pattern in human tissues and also contradicts some others.

Intravenous administration of purified 2-E protein into mice caused ARDS-like pathological damage in lung and spleen.

Newly identified channel inhibitors exhibited potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and excellent protective effects against the 2-E-induced damage both in vitro and in vivo.

MS is a risk factor for developing severe COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Here we define an interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein and LPS and its link to aggravated inflammation in vitro and in vivo. Electrophoresis under native conditions demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to Escherichia coli LPS, forming high molecular weight aggregates. Microscale thermophoresis analysis further defined the interaction, having a KD of ~47 nM, similar to the observed affinity between LPS and the human receptor CD14. Moreover, S protein, when combined with low levels of LPS, boosted nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and cytokine responses in monocytic THP-1 cells and human blood, respectively. In an experimental model of localized inflammation, employing NF-\u03baB reporter mice and in vivo bioimaging, S protein in conjunction with LPS significantly increased the inflammatory response when compared with S protein and LPS alone. Apart from providing information on LPS as a ligand for S protein, our results are of relevance for studies on comorbidities involving bacterial endotoxins, such as the MS, or co-existing acute and chronic infections in COVID-19 patients.Competing Interest StatementA.S is a founder and shareholder of in2cure AB, a company developing therapies based on host defense peptides.

Importantly, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were detectable in antibody-seronegative family members and individuals with a history of asymptomatic or mild COVID-19. Our collective dataset shows that SARS-CoV-2 elicits robust memory T cell responses akin to those observed in the context of successful vaccines, suggesting that natural exposure or infection may prevent recurrent episodes of severe COVID-19 also in seronegative individuals.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":30,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Takuya Sekine","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"Andre Perez-Potti","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"Olga Rivera-Ballesteros","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"Kristoffer Straling","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Karolinska University Hospital and Department of Medicine Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"Jean-Baptiste Gorin","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"Annika Olsson","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Karolinska University Hospital and Department of Medicine Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"Sian Llewellyn-Lacey","author_inst":"Division of Infection and Immunity, Cardiff University School of Medicine, University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, UK."},{"author_name":"Habiba Kamal","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Karolinska University Hospital and Department of Medicine Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"Gordana Bogdanovic","author_inst":"Dept of Clinical Microbiology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"Sandra Muschiol","author_inst":"Dept of Clinical Microbiology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"David J Wulliman","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"Tobias Kammann","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"Johanna Emgard","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"Tiphaine Parrot","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"Elin Folkesson","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Karolinska University Hospital and Department of Medicine Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"author_name":"Olav Rooyackers","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Interventions and Technology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.

As a result, there has been a collective effort to monitor, predict, and control the spread of this disease. Among this effort is the development of mathematical models that could capture accurately the available data and simulate closely the futuristic scenarios. In this paper, a fractional-order memory-dependent model for simulating the spread of COVID-19 is proposed. In this model, the impact of governmental action and public perception are incorporated as part of the time-varying transmission rate. The model simulation is performed using the two-step generalized exponential time-differencing method and tested for data from Wuhan, China. The mean-square errors demonstrate the merit of the fractional-order model and provide a good estimate of the optimal order.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Khaled M Furati","author_inst":"King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals"},{"author_name":"Ibrahim O.

Here, we investigated whether increased engagement with digital social tools may help mitigate effects of enforced isolation on physical activity and mood, in a naturalistic study of at-risk individuals. Passively sensed smartphone app use and actigraphy data, collected from a sample of psychiatric outpatients both before and during imposition of strict lockdown conditions (N=163), were analysed using Gaussian graphical models: a form of network analysis which gives insight into the predictive relationships between measures across timepoints. Within-individuals, we found evidence of a positive predictive path between digital social engagement, general smartphone use, and physical activity - selectively under lockdown conditions. Further, we observed a positive relationship between social media use and total daily steps across individuals during (but not prior to) lockdown. We interpret these findings in terms of individuals using these digital tools to harness online social support structures, which may help guard against negative effects of in-person social deprivation and other pandemic-related stress. Monitoring of these measures is low burden and unintrusive and therefore, given appropriate consent, could potentially help identify individuals who are failing to engage this mechanism, providing a route to early intervention in this and other vulnerable populations.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Agnes Norbury","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Shelley H Liu","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Juan Jos\u00e9 Campa\u00f1a-Montes","author_inst":"Universidad Carlos III de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Lorena Romero-Medrano","author_inst":"Universidad Carlos III de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Maria L Barrigon","author_inst":"University Hospital Jimenez Diaz Foundation"},{"author_name":"Emma Smith","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"- MEmind Study Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Antonio Artes","author_inst":"Universidad Carlos III de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Enrique Baca-Garcia","author_inst":"University Hospital Jimenez Diaz Foundation"},{"author_name":"M.
