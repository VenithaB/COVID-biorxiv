Countless lives have been claimed due to the existing pandemic and the societal normalcy has been damaged permanently. As a result, it becomes crucial for academic researchers in the field of bioinformatics to combat the existing pandemic. The study involved collecting the virulent strain sequence of SARS-nCoV19 for the country USA against human host through publically available bioinformatics databases. Using in-silica analysis and reverse vaccinology, two leader proteins were identified to be potential vaccine candidates for development of a multi-epitope drug. The results of this study can provide further researchers better aspects and direction on developing vaccine and immune responses against COVID19. This work also aims at promoting the use of existing bioinformatics tools to faster streamline the pipeline of vaccine development.\n\nThe Situation of COVID19A new infection respiratory disease was first observed in the month of December 2019, in Wuhan, situated in the Hubei province, China. Studies have indicated that the reason of this disease was the emergence of a genetically-novel coronavirus closely related to SARS-CoV. This coronavirus, now named as nCoV-19, is the reason behind the spread of this fatal respiratory disease, now named as COVID-19. The initial group of infections is supposedly linked with the Huanan seafood market, most likely due to animal contact. Eventually, human-to-human interaction occurred and resulted in the transmission of the virus to humans. [13].\n\nSince then, nCoV-19 has been rapidly spreading within China and other parts of World. At the time of writing this article (mid-March 2020), COVID-19 has spread across 146 countries. A count of 164,837 cases have been confirmed of being diagnosed with COVID-19, and a total of 6470 deaths have occurred. The cumulative cases have been depicting a rising trend and the numbers are just increasing. WHO has declared COVID-19 to be a \"global health emergency\". [14].\n\nCurrent Scenario and ObjectivesCurrently, research is being conducted on a massive level to understand the immunology and genetic characteristics of the disease. However, no cure or vaccine of nCoV-19 has been developed at the time of writing this article.\n\nThough, nCoV-19 and SARS-CoV are almost genetically similar, the respiratory syndrome caused by both of them, COVID-19 and SARS respectively, are completely different. Studies have indicated that -\n\n\"SARS was more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19\".\n\n-World Health Organization","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ajay Agarwal","author_inst":"DIT University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.15.20130328","rel_title":"Can we trust the prediction model? Demonstrating the importance of external validation by investigating the COVID-19 Vulnerability (C-19) Index across an international network of observational healthcare datasets","rel_date":"2020-06-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.15.20130328","rel_abs":"Background: SARS-CoV-2 is straining healthcare systems globally. The burden on hospitals during the pandemic could be reduced by implementing prediction models that can discriminate between patients requiring hospitalization and those who do not. The COVID-19 vulnerability (C-19) index, a model that predicts which patients will be admitted to hospital for treatment of pneumonia or pneumonia proxies, has been developed and proposed as a valuable tool for decision making during the pandemic. However, the model is at high risk of bias according to the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool and has not been externally validated. Methods: We followed the OHDSI framework for external validation to assess the reliability of the C-19 model. We evaluated the model on two different target populations: i) 41,381 patients that have SARS-CoV-2 at an outpatient or emergency room visit and ii) 9,429,285 patients that have influenza or related symptoms during an outpatient or emergency room visit, to predict their risk of hospitalization with pneumonia during the following 0 to 30 days. In total we validated the model across a network of 14 databases spanning the US, Europe, Australia and Asia. Findings: The internal validation performance of the C-19 index was a c-statistic of 0.73 and calibration was not reported by the authors. When we externally validated it by transporting it to SARS-CoV-2 data the model obtained c-statistics of 0.36, 0.53 (0.473-0.584) and 0.56 (0.488-0.636) on Spanish, US and South Korean datasets respectively. The calibration was poor with the model under-estimating risk. When validated on 12 datasets containing influenza patients across the OHDSI network the c-statistics ranged between 0.40-0.68. Interpretation: The results show that the discriminative performance of the C-19 model is low for influenza cohorts, and even worse amongst COVID-19 patients in the US, Spain and South Korea. These results suggest that C-19 should not be used to aid decision making during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings highlight the importance of performing external validation across a range of settings, especially when a prediction model is being extrapolated to a different population. In the field of prediction, extensive validation is required to create appropriate trust in a model.","rel_num_authors":36,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jenna M Reps","author_inst":"Janssen R&D"},{"author_name":"Chungsoo Kim","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences, Ajou University Graduate School of Medicine, Suwon, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Ross D.

The test sensitivities were analyzed with a set of 34 sera obtained from 26 patients after PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and varied from 76.9% (Euroimmun) to 96.2% (Abbott). The majority of assay results were confirmed in a laboratory-developed plaque reduction neutralization test and by a SARS-CoV-2 IgG-specific line assay including measurement of generally low IgG avidities (Mikrogen recomLine Coronavirus IgG [Aviditaet], prototype). Moreover, 100 stored sera collected during summer 2018 (N = 50) and winter season 2018\/2019 (N = 50) were included to demonstrate test specificities. These varied from 96.0% (DiaSorin) to 100% (Epitope EDI). A subset of sera were retested with a lateral flow test (STANDARD Q COVID-19 IgM\/IgG Duo) and a considerably lower sensitivity was noted. Overall, the diagnostic accuracy of the six SARS-CoV-2 IgG\/total antibody assays was good and varied from 92.9% (Euroimmun) to 98.4% (Abbott). Due to the different specificities, results of commercially available SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests should be interpreted with caution. A high proportion of antibody-positive patient sera demonstrated neutralizing capacity against SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Annabelle Stroemer","author_inst":"Institut fuer Infektionsmedizin, CAU Kiel"},{"author_name":"Olaf Grobe","author_inst":"Labor Dr. Krause und Kollegen MVZ GmbH Kiel"},{"author_name":"Ruben Rose","author_inst":"Institut fuer Infektionsmedizin, CAU Kiel"},{"author_name":"Helmut Fickenscher","author_inst":"Institut fuer Infektionsmedizin, CAU Kiel"},{"author_name":"Thomas Lorentz","author_inst":"Labor Dr. Krause und Kollegen MVZ GmbH Kiel"},{"author_name":"Andi Krumbholz","author_inst":"Institut fuer Infektionsmedizin, CAU Kiel"},{"author_name":"Thomas Falconer","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Jitendra Jonnagaddala","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Community Medicine, UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Andrew Williams","author_inst":"Tufts Institute for Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies, Boston, MA, 02111, USA"},{"author_name":"Sergio Fernandez-Bertolin","author_inst":"Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol)"},{"author_name":"Scott L DuVall","author_inst":"Department of Veterans Affairs, USA;

Here, we report autopsy findings on causes of death and comorbidities of 26 decedents that had clinically presented with severe COVID-19. We found that septic shock and multi organ failure was the most common immediate cause of death, often due to suppurative pulmonary infection. Respiratory failure due to diffuse alveolar damage presented as the most immediate cause of death in fewer cases. Several comorbidities, such as hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and obesity were present in the vast majority of patients. Our findings reveal that causes of death were directly related to COVID-19 in the majority of decedents, while they appear not to be an immediate result of preexisting health conditions and comorbidities. We therefore suggest that the majority of patients had died of COVID-19 with only contributory implications of preexisting health conditions to the mechanism of death.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sefer Elezkurtaj","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Selina Greuel","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jana Ihlow","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Edward Michaelis","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Philip Bischoff","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Catarina Alisa Kunze","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Bruno Valentin Sinn","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Manuela Gerhold","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Kathrin Hauptmann","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Barbara Ingold-Heppner","author_inst":"DRK Kliniken Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Florian Miller","author_inst":"Vivantes GmbH, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Hermann Herbst","author_inst":"Vivantes GmbH, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Victor Max Corman","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Hubert Martin","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Frank L Heppner","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"David Horst","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Lin Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Paula Casajust","author_inst":"Department of Real-World Evidence, Trial Form Support, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ewout Steyerberg","author_inst":"Department of Public Health, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Fredrik Nyberg","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Community Medicine, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg Gothenburg, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Skov Kaas-Hansen","author_inst":"Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Young Hwa Choi","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Daniel Morales","author_inst":"ivision of Population Health and Genomics, University of Dundee, UK"},{"author_name":"Siaw-Teng Liaw","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Community Medicine, UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Maria Tereza Fernandes Abrahao","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Carlos Areia","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Michael E Matheny","author_inst":"Department of Veterans Affairs, USA; Vanderbilt University, USA"},{"author_name":"Maria Aragon","author_inst":"Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol)"},{"author_name":"Rae Woong Park","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"George Hripcsak","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Christian G Reich","author_inst":"Real World Solutions, IQVIA, Cambridge, MA, United States"},{"author_name":"Marc A Suchard","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Seng Chan You","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Patrick B Ryan","author_inst":"Janssen Research & Development, Titusville, NJ, USA"},{"author_name":"Daniel Prieto-Alhambra","author_inst":"Centre for Statistics in Medicine, NDORMS, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter R Rijnbeek","author_inst":"Department of Medical Informatics, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pathology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.15.20131532","rel_title":"Risk of Depression in Family Caregivers: Unintended Consequence of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-06-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.15.20131532","rel_abs":"Background: COVID-19 is likely to exacerbate the symptoms of poor mental health family caregivers. To investigate whether rates of depression increased in caregivers during COVID-19 and whether the unintended consequences of health protective measures, i.e., social isolation, exacerbated this risk. Another aim was to see if caregivers accessed any online\/phone psychological support during COVID. Method: Data (1349 caregivers; 7527 non-caregivers) was extracted from Understanding Society, UK population level dataset. The General Health Questionnaire cut-off scores identifying those with and without depression were our primary outcome. Results: After adjustment for confounding caregivers had a higher risk of having depression compared with non-caregivers, Odds ratio (OR) = 1.22 (95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.05-1.40)), p=.008 evidenced by higher levels of depression pre-COVID-19 (16.7% vs 12.1%) and during COVID-19 (21.6% vs 17.9%), respectively. Further, higher levels of loneliness increased the risk of depression almost 4-fold risk in caregivers, OR = 3.85 (95% confidence interval (95% CI), 3.08-4.85)), p<.001), while access to therapy attenuated the risk (47%. While 60% of caregivers with depression reported not accessing any therapeutic support (e.g., online or face to face) during COVID-19. Conclusion: COVID-19 has had a negative impact on family caregivers mental health with loneliness a significant contributor to caregivers depression. However, despite these detriments in mental health, the majority of caregivers do not access any online or phone psychiatric support. Reducing feelings of isolation therefore provides an opportunity for psychiatric services and health care professionals to support at-risk caregivers.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stephen Gallagher","author_inst":"University of Limerick"},{"author_name":"Mark Wetherell","author_inst":"University of Northumbria"},{"author_name":"Jana Ihlow","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Edward Michaelis","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Philip Bischoff","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Catarina Alisa Kunze","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Bruno Valentin Sinn","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Manuela Gerhold","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Kathrin Hauptmann","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Barbara Ingold-Heppner","author_inst":"DRK Kliniken Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Florian Miller","author_inst":"Vivantes GmbH, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Hermann Herbst","author_inst":"Vivantes GmbH, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Victor Max Corman","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Hubert Martin","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Frank L Heppner","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"David Horst","author_inst":"Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Lin Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Paula Casajust","author_inst":"Department of Real-World Evidence, Trial Form Support, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ewout Steyerberg","author_inst":"Department of Public Health, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Fredrik Nyberg","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Community Medicine, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg Gothenburg, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Skov Kaas-Hansen","author_inst":"Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Young Hwa Choi","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Daniel Morales","author_inst":"ivision of Population Health and Genomics, University of Dundee, UK"},{"author_name":"Siaw-Teng Liaw","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Community Medicine, UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Maria Tereza Fernandes Abrahao","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Carlos Areia","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Michael E Matheny","author_inst":"Department of Veterans Affairs, USA;

We aimed to map early impacts of the pandemic on people with pre-existing mental health conditions and services they use, and to identify individual and service-level strategies adopted to manage these. Methods We searched for relevant material in the public domain published before 30 April 2020, including papers in scientific and professional journals, published first person accounts, media articles, and publications by governments, charities and professional associations. Search languages were English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Mandarin Chinese. Relevant content was retrieved and summarised via a rapid qualitative framework synthesis approach. Results We found 872 eligible sources from 29 countries. Most documented observations and experiences rather than reporting research data. We found many reports of deteriorations in symptoms, and of impacts of loneliness and social isolation and of lack of access to services and resources, but sometimes also of resilience, effective self-management and peer support. Immediate service challenges related to controlling infection, especially in inpatient and residential settings, and establishing remote working, especially in the community. We summarise reports of swiftly implemented adaptations and innovations, but also of pressing ethical challenges and concerns for the future. Conclusion Our analysis captures the range of stakeholder perspectives and experiences publicly reported in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in several countries. We identify potential foci for service planning and research.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luke Sheridan Rains","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Sonia Johnson","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Phoebe Barnett","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Thomas Steare","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Justin J Needle","author_inst":"City University of London"},{"author_name":"Sarah Carr","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Billie Lever Taylor","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Francesca Bentivegna","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Julian Edbrooke-Childs","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Hannah Rachel Scott","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Jessica Rees","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Prisha Shah","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Jo Lomani","author_inst":"St George's, University of London"},{"author_name":"Beverley Chipp","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Nick Barber","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Zainab Dedat","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Sian Oram","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"Nicola Morant","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Alan Simpson","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"- COVID-19 Mental Health Policy Research Unit Group","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Skov Kaas-Hansen","author_inst":"Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Young Hwa Choi","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Daniel Morales","author_inst":"ivision of Population Health and Genomics, University of Dundee, UK"},{"author_name":"Siaw-Teng Liaw","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Community Medicine, UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Maria Tereza Fernandes Abrahao","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Carlos Areia","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Michael E Matheny","author_inst":"Department of Veterans Affairs, USA; Vanderbilt University, USA"},{"author_name":"Maria Aragon","author_inst":"Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol)"},{"author_name":"Rae Woong Park","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"George Hripcsak","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Christian G Reich","author_inst":"Real World Solutions, IQVIA, Cambridge, MA, United States"},{"author_name":"Marc A Suchard","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Seng Chan You","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Patrick B Ryan","author_inst":"Janssen Research & Development, Titusville, NJ, USA"},{"author_name":"Daniel Prieto-Alhambra","author_inst":"Centre for Statistics in Medicine, NDORMS, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter R Rijnbeek","author_inst":"Department of Medical Informatics, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.15.20131748","rel_title":"Clinical, immunological and virological characterization of COVID-19 patients that test re-positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR","rel_date":"2020-06-17","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.15.20131748","rel_abs":"Background COVID-19 pandemic is underway. Some COVID-19 cases re-tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA after discharge raising the public concern on their infectivity. Characterization of re-positive cases are urgently needed for designing intervention strategies. Methods Clinical data were obtained through Guangdong COVID-19 surveillance network. Neutralization antibody titre was determined using a microneutralization assay. Potential infectivity of clinical samples was evaluated after the cell inoculation. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected using three different RT-PCR kits and multiplex PCR with nanopore sequencing. Results Among 619 discharged COVID-19 cases, 87 were re-tested as SARS-CoV-2 positive in circumstance of social isolation. All re-positive cases had mild or moderate symptoms in initial diagnosis and a younger age distribution (mean, 30.4). Re-positive cases (n=59) exhibited similar neutralization antibodies (NAbs) titre distributions to other COVID-19 cases (n=150) parallel-tested in this study. No infective viral strain could be obtained by culture and none full-length viral genomes could be sequenced for all re-positive cases. Conclusions Re-positive SARS-CoV-2 was not caused by the secondary infection and was identified in around 14% of discharged cases. A robust Nabs response and a potential virus genome degradation were detected from nearly all re-positive cases suggesting a lower transmission risk, especially through a respiratory route.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jing Lu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institution of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China;School of Public Health, Sou"},{"author_name":"Jinju Peng","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institution of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China;School of Public Health, Sou"},{"author_name":"Qianling Xiong","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institution of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China;School of Public Health, Sou"},{"author_name":"Zhe Liu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institution of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Huifang Lin","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institution of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaohua Tan","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Min Kang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Runyu Yuan","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institution of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Lilian Zeng","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institution of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Pingping Zhou","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institution of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Chumin Liang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institution of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Lina Yi","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institution of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Louis du Plessis","author_inst":"University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Tie Song","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Wenjun Ma","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institution of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Jiufeng Sun","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institution of Public Health, Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Oliver Pybus","author_inst":"University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Changwen Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Alan Simpson","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"- COVID-19 Mental Health Policy Research Unit Group","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Skov Kaas-Hansen","author_inst":"Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Young Hwa Choi","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Daniel Morales","author_inst":"ivision of Population Health and Genomics, University of Dundee, UK"},{"author_name":"Siaw-Teng Liaw","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Community Medicine, UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Maria Tereza Fernandes Abrahao","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Carlos Areia","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Michael E Matheny","author_inst":"Department of Veterans Affairs, USA;

Therefore, our study aimed to investigate the changes in personal attitudes and behaviour before and after negative serological test results for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We conducted a survey questionnaire on 200 industry workers (69% males and 31% females) that have been previously tested negative. The survey examined participants' self-reported general attitudes towards COVID-19, sense of fear, as well as their behaviour related to protective measures before and after the testing. The participants perceived the disease as a severe health threat and acknowledged the protective measures as appropriate. They reported a high level of adherence to measures and low level of fear both before and after the testing. Although those indicators were statistically significantly reduced after the test (P < 0.004), they did not result in risk behaviour. Therefore, the serological tests are not an additional threat regarding the risk behaviour in an environment where protective measures are efficient. In contrast, they might contribute to reducing the fear in the society and working environment.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Toni Ljubic","author_inst":"University Department of Forensic Sciences, University of Split, Split, Croatia"},{"author_name":"Ana Banovac","author_inst":"University Department of Forensic Sciences, University of Split, Split, Croatia"},{"author_name":"Ivan Buljan","author_inst":"Department of Research in Biomedicine and Health, University of Split, School of Medicine, Split, Croatia"},{"author_name":"Ivan Jerkovic","author_inst":"University Department of Forensic Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zeljana Basic","author_inst":"University Department of Forensic Sciences, University of Split, Split, Croatia"},{"author_name":"Ivana Kruzic","author_inst":"University Department of Forensic Sciences, University of Split, Split, Croatia"},{"author_name":"Andrea Kolic","author_inst":"University Department of Forensic Sciences, University of Split, Split, Croatia"},{"author_name":"Rino Rivi Kolombatovic","author_inst":"University Department of Forensic Sciences, University of Split, Split, Croatia"},{"author_name":"Ana Marusic","author_inst":"Department of Research in Biomedicine and Health, University of Split, School of Medicine, Split, Croatia"},{"author_name":"Simun Andjelinovic","author_inst":"Clinical Department for Pathology, Forensic Medicine and Cytology, University Hospital Split;

Study design: Longitudinal ecological study. Setting: 460 Care home units using the same software package to collect data on residents, from 46 local authority areas in England. Participants: 6,464 care home residents with at least one NEWS recording. Exposure measure: 29,656 anonymised person-level NEWS from 29\/12\/2019 to 20\/05\/2020 with component physiological measures: systolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse rate, temperature, and oxygen saturation. Baseline values for each measure calculated using 80th and 20th centile scores before March 2020. Outcome measure: Time series comparison with Office for National Statistics (ONS) weekly reported registered deaths of care home residents where COVID-19 was the underlying cause of death, and all other deaths (excluding COVID-19) up to 10\/05\/2020. Results: Deaths due to COVID-19 were registered from 23\/03\/2020 in the study geographical areas. Between 23\/03\/2020 and 10\/05\/2020, there were 5,753 deaths (1,532 involving COVID-19 and 4,221 other causes). The proportion of above-baseline NEWS increased from 16\/03\/2020 and closely followed the rise and fall in COVID-19 deaths over the study period. The proportion of above-baseline oxygen saturation, respiratory rate and temperature measurements also increased approximately two weeks before peaks in care home deaths in corresponding geographical areas. Conclusions: NEWS may make a useful contribution to disease surveillance in care homes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Oxygen saturation, respiratory rate and temperature could be prioritised as they appear to signal rise in mortality almost as well as total NEWS. This study reinforces the need to collate data from care homes, to monitor and protect residents' health. Further work using individual level outcome data is needed to evaluate the role of NEWS in the early detection of resident illness.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel Stow","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Robert O Barker","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Fiona E Matthews","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Barbara Hanratty","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Zeljana Basic","author_inst":"University Department of Forensic Sciences, University of Split, Split, Croatia"},{"author_name":"Ivana Kruzic","author_inst":"University Department of Forensic Sciences, University of Split, Split, Croatia"},{"author_name":"Andrea Kolic","author_inst":"University Department of Forensic Sciences, University of Split, Split, Croatia"},{"author_name":"Rino Rivi Kolombatovic","author_inst":"University Department of Forensic Sciences, University of Split, Split, Croatia"},{"author_name":"Ana Marusic","author_inst":"Department of Research in Biomedicine and Health, University of Split, School of Medicine, Split, Croatia"},{"author_name":"Simun Andjelinovic","author_inst":"Clinical Department for Pathology, Forensic Medicine and Cytology, University Hospital Split;

While S and R are not homologous data of analysis, thus with improper topological metrics used in many researches, these terms leads to the asymptotic feature of I term as the most stable point of analysis to achieve proper predictive methods.

Methods: We used county-level data from United States population (March 2020) and HD patient data from a network of clinics (February-May 2020) to develop two ML models. First was a county-level model that used data from general and HD populations (21 variables); outcome of a COVID-19 outbreak in a dialysis service area was defined as a clinic being located in one of the national counties with the highest growth in COVID-19 positive cases (number and people per million (ppm)) in general population during 22-28 Mar 2020. Second was a patient-level model that used HD patient data (82 variables) to predict an individual having an undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection that is identified in subsequent [&ge;]3 days. Results: Among 1682 counties with dialysis clinics, 82 (4.9%) had a COVID-19 outbreak during 22-28 Mar 2020. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for the county-level model was 0.86 in testing dataset. Top predictor of a county experiencing an outbreak was the COVID-19 positive ppm in the general population in the prior week. In a select group (n=11,664) used to build the patient-level model, 28% of patients had COVID-19; prevalence was by design 10% in the testing dataset. AUROC for the patient-level model was 0.71 in the testing dataset. Top predictor of an HD patient having a SARS-CoV-2 infection was mean pre-HD body temperature in the prior week. Conclusions: Developed ML models appear suitable for predicting counties at risk of a COVID-19 outbreak and HD patients at risk of having an undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Caitlin Monaghan","author_inst":"Fresenius Medical Care, Global Medical Office"},{"author_name":"John W Larkin","author_inst":"Fresenius Medical Car, Global Medical Office"},{"author_name":"Sheetal Chaudhuri","author_inst":"Fresenius Medical Care, Global Medical Office"},{"author_name":"Hao Han","author_inst":"Fresenius Medical Care, Global Medical Office"},{"author_name":"Yue Jiao","author_inst":"Fresenius Medical Care, Global Medical Office"},{"author_name":"Kristine Marie Bermudez","author_inst":"Fresenius Medical Care North America, Medical Office"},{"author_name":"Eric D Weinhandl","author_inst":"Fresenius Medical Care North America, Medical Office"},{"author_name":"Ines A Dahne-Steuber","author_inst":"Fresenius Medical Care North America, Medical Office"},{"author_name":"Kathleen Belmonte","author_inst":"Fresenius Kidney Care"},{"author_name":"Luca Neri","author_inst":"Fresenius Medical Care Deutschland GmbH, EMEA Medical Office"},{"author_name":"Peter Kotanko","author_inst":"Renal Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jeroen P Kooman","author_inst":"Maastricht University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey L Hymes","author_inst":"Fresenius Medical Care North America, Medical Office"},{"author_name":"Robert J Kossmann","author_inst":"Fresenius Medical Care North America, Medical Office"},{"author_name":"Len A Usvyat","author_inst":"Fresenius Medical Care, Global Medical Office"},{"author_name":"Franklin W Maddux","author_inst":"Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co.

Few studies have examined how a population's food choices change during a country-wide stress-inducing event such as the beginning of the COVID-19 stay-at-home orders in the United States. Food data from a digital behavior change weight loss program, which includes an interface for logging meals, were analyzed to assess self-reported food choices from March 5-March 11 (\"pre-COVID\") and during the first week of the COVID-19 lockdown (March 12-March 18; \"during-COVID\"). The final sample consisted of 381,564 participants: 318,076 (83.4%) females, the majority who were aged 45-65 years (45.2%). Results indicate that self-reported servings of fresh fruit and vegetable intake decreased from pre- to during-COVID, while intake of red meat and starchy vegetables increased. More men than women increased their intake of red meat and processed meat. There was less overall change in fruit and vegetable consumption in participants aged 66 and older, compared to younger participants (aged 18-35). The percentage of older participants who reported lean meat and starchy vegetable intake increased, but these groups had a negligible change in younger subjects. More subjects aged 18-35 years reduced their intake of caffeine, desserts, lean meat and salads compared to older participants. No changes were observed in terms of snack or alcoholic beverage intake logged. In conclusion, this study of 381,564 US participants revealed that intake of particular food groups were altered during the first weeks of COVID lockdown.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ellen Siobhan Mitchell","author_inst":"Noom Inc."},{"author_name":"Qiuchen Yang","author_inst":"Noom Inc."},{"author_name":"Heather Behr","author_inst":"Noom Inc., Saybrook University"},{"author_name":"Laura Deluca","author_inst":"Noom Inc., Yeshiva University"},{"author_name":"Paul Schaffer","author_inst":"Noom Inc."},{"author_name":"Kristine Marie Bermudez","author_inst":"Fresenius Medical Care North America, Medical Office"},{"author_name":"Eric D Weinhandl","author_inst":"Fresenius Medical Care North America, Medical Office"},{"author_name":"Ines A Dahne-Steuber","author_inst":"Fresenius Medical Care North America, Medical Office"},{"author_name":"Kathleen Belmonte","author_inst":"Fresenius Kidney Care"},{"author_name":"Luca Neri","author_inst":"Fresenius Medical Care Deutschland GmbH, EMEA Medical Office"},{"author_name":"Peter Kotanko","author_inst":"Renal Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jeroen P Kooman","author_inst":"Maastricht University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey L Hymes","author_inst":"Fresenius Medical Care North America, Medical Office"},{"author_name":"Robert J Kossmann","author_inst":"Fresenius Medical Care North America, Medical Office"},{"author_name":"Len A Usvyat","author_inst":"Fresenius Medical Care, Global Medical Office"},{"author_name":"Franklin W Maddux","author_inst":"Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co.

COVID-19 exhibits a more severe disease course in older, co-morbid adults. Awareness of atypical presentations is critical to facilitate early identification. Objective: To assess how frailty affects presenting COVID-19 symptoms in older adults. Design: Observational cohort study of hospitalised older patients and self-report data for community-based older adults. Setting: Admissions to St Thomas' Hospital, London with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Community-based data for 535 older adults using the COVID Symptom Study mobile application. Subjects: Hospital cohort: patients aged 65 and over (n=322); unscheduled hospital admission between March 1st, 2020 - May 5th, 2020; COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal swab. Community-based cohort: participants aged 65 and over enrolled in the COVID Symptom Study (n=535); reported test-positive for COVID-19 from March 24th (application launch)- May 8th, 2020. Methods: Multivariate logistic regression analysis performed on age-matched samples from hospital and community-based cohorts to ascertain association of frailty with symptoms of confirmed COVID-19. Results: Hospital cohort: significantly higher prevalence of delirium in the frail sample, with no difference in fever or cough. Community-based cohort: significantly higher prevalence of probable delirium in frailer, older adults, and fatigue and shortness of breath. Conclusions: This is the first study demonstrating higher prevalence of delirium as a COVID-19 symptom in older adults with frailty compared to other older adults. This emphasises need for systematic frailty assessment and screening for delirium in acutely ill older patients in hospital and community settings. Clinicians should suspect COVID-19 in frail adults with delirium.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria Beatrice Zazzara","author_inst":"Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, King's College London, St Thomas' Hospital, London, SE1 7EH; Department of Gerontology, Neuroscience and O"},{"author_name":"Rose S.

Infected individuals exhibit variable severity, with no relation between the number of cases and mortality, suggesting the involvement of the populational genetic constitution and previous cross-reactive immune contacts in the individuals' disease outcome. Methods: A clustering approach was conducted to investigate the involvement of human MHC alleles with individuals' outcomes. HLA frequencies from affected countries were used to fuel the Hierarchical Clusterization Analysis. The formed groups were compared regarding their death rates. To prospect the T cell targets in SARS-CoV-2, and by consequence, the epitopes that are conferring cross-protection in the current pandemic, we modeled 3D structures of HLA-A*02:01 presenting immunogenic epitopes from SAR-CoV-1, recovered from Immune Epitope Database. These pMHC structures were also compared with models containing the corresponding SARS-CoV-2 epitope, with alphacoronavirus sequences, and with a panel of immunogenic pMHC structures contained in CrossTope. Findings: The combined use of HLA-B*07, HLA-B*44, HLA-DRB1*03, and HLADRB1*04 allowed the clustering of affected countries presenting similar death rates, based only on their allele frequencies. SARS-CoV HLA-A*02:01 epitopes were structurally investigated. It reveals molecular conservation between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 peptides, enabling the use of formerly SARS-CoV-1 experimental epitopes to inspect actual targets that are conferring cross-protection. Alpha-CoVs and, impressively, viruses involved in human infections share fingerprints of immunogenicity with SARS-CoV peptides. Interpretation: Wide-scale HLA genotyping in COVID-19 patients shall improve prognosis prediction. Structural identification of previous triggers paves the way for herd immunity examination and wide spectrum vaccine development.

Objective: To explore the implementation feasibility of Thai Airways International protocol from the perspectives of passengers and aircrews. Design: An online questionnaire survey of passengers and an in-depth interview with aircrews. Setting: Two randomly selected repatriation flights operated by Thai Airways International using Boeing 777 aircraft (TG476 from Sydney and TG492 from Auckland to Bangkok) Participants: 377 Thai passengers and 35 aircrews. Results: The mean age of passengers was 28.14 (95%CI 26.72 to 29.55) years old; 57.03% were female. TG492 passengers were mostly students and significantly younger than that of TG476 (p<0.0001) with comparable flying experience (p=0.1192). The average body temperature was 36.52 (95%CI 36.48 to 36.55) degrees Celsius. Passengers estimated average physical distances of 1.59 (95%CI 1.48 to 1.70), 1.41 (95%CI 1.29 to 1.53), and 1.26 (95%CI 1.12 to 1.41) meters at check-in, boarding, and in-flight, respectively. Passengers were checked for body temperature during the flight 1.97 (95%CI 1.77 to 2.18) times on average which is significantly more frequent in longer than shorter flight (p<0.0001). Passengers moved around or went to the toilet during the flight 2.00 (95%CI 1.63 to 2.37) and 2.08 (95%CI 1.73 to 2.43) times which are significantly more frequent in longer than shorter flight (p=0.0186 and 0.0049, respectively). The aircrews were satisfied with the protocol and provided several practical suggestions. Conclusion: The protocol was well received by the passengers and aircrews of the repatriation flights with some suggestions for improvement.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Krit Pongpirul","author_inst":"Chulalongkorn University Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kanitha Kaewpoungngam","author_inst":"Dhurakij Pundit University"},{"author_name":"Korn Chotirosniramit","author_inst":"Chulalongkorn University Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sinnop Theprugsa","author_inst":"Thai Airways International Public Company Limited"},{"author_name":"Hannah Dooley","author_inst":"Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, King's College London, St Thomas' Hospital, London, SE1 7EH"},{"author_name":"Carole H.

We need to understand the barriers and facilitators to receiving a future COVID-19 vaccine so that we can provide recommendations for the design of interventions aimed at maximising public acceptance. Design: Cross-sectional UK survey with older adults and patients with chronic respiratory disease. Methods: During the UK's early April 2020 'lockdown' period, 527 participants (311 older adults, mean age = 70.4 years; 216 chronic respiratory participants, mean age = 43.8 years) completed an online questionnaire assessing willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, perceptions of COVID-19, and intention to receive influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations. A free text response (n=502) examined barriers and facilitators to uptake. The Behaviour Change Wheel informed the analysis of these responses, which were coded to the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Behaviour change techniques (BCTs) were identified. Results: Eighty-six percent of respondents want to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. This was positively correlated with the perception that COVID-19 will persist over time, and negatively associated with perceiving the media to have over-exaggerated the risk. The majority of barriers and facilitators were mapped onto the 'beliefs about consequences' TDF domain, with themes relating to personal health, health consequences to others, concerns of vaccine safety, and severity of COVID-19. Conclusions: Willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccination is currently high among high-risk individuals. Mass media interventions aimed at maximising vaccine uptake should utilise the BCTs of information about health, emotional, social and environmental consequences, and salience of consequences.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lynn Williams","author_inst":"University of Strathclyde"},{"author_name":"Allyson J Gallant","author_inst":"University of Strathclyde"},{"author_name":"Susan Rasmussen","author_inst":"University of Strathclyde"},{"author_name":"Louise A Brown Nicholls","author_inst":"University of Strathclyde"},{"author_name":"Nicola Cogan","author_inst":"University of Strathclyde"},{"author_name":"Karen Deakin","author_inst":"University of Strathclyde"},{"author_name":"David Young","author_inst":"University of Strathclyde"},{"author_name":"Paul Flowers","author_inst":"University of Strathclyde"},{"author_name":"Alessia Visconti","author_inst":"Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, King's College London, St Thomas' Hospital, London, SE1 7EH"},{"author_name":"Massimo Mangino","author_inst":"Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, King's College London, St Thomas' Hospital, London, SE1 7EH; NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Guy's and "},{"author_name":"Maxim B.

Methods: We offered SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-PCR and antibody (Abbott ARCHITECT IgG) testing, regardless of symptoms, to all residents (>=4 years) and workers in a San Francisco census tract (population: 5,174) at outdoor, community-mobilized events over four days. We estimated SARS-CoV-2 point prevalence (PCR-positive) and cumulative incidence (antibody or PCR-positive) in the census tract and evaluated risk factors for recent (PCR-positive\/antibody-negative) versus prior infection (antibody-positive\/PCR-negative). SARS-CoV-2 genome recovery and phylogenetics were used to measure viral strain diversity, establish viral lineages present, and estimate number of introductions. Results: We tested 3,953 persons: 40% Latinx; 41% White; 9% Asian\/Pacific Islander; and 2% Black. Overall, 2.1% (83\/3,871) tested PCR-positive: 95% were Latinx and 52% asymptomatic when tested. 1.7% of residents and 6.0% of workers (non-census tract residents) were PCR-positive. Among 2,598 census tract residents, estimated point prevalence of PCR-positives was 2.3% (95%CI: 1.2-3.8%): 3.9% (95%CI: 2.0-6.4%) among Latinx vs. 0.2% (95%CI: 0.0-0.4%) among non-Latinx persons. Estimated cumulative incidence among residents was 6.1% (95%CI: 4.0-8.6%). Prior infections were 67% Latinx, 16% White, and 17% other ethnicities. Among recent infections, 96% were Latinx. Risk factors for recent infection were Latinx ethnicity, inability to shelter-in-place and maintain income, frontline service work, unemployment, and household income <$50,000\/year. Five SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic lineages were detected. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 infections from diverse lineages continued circulating among low-income, Latinx persons unable to work from home and maintain income during San Francisco's shelter-in-place ordinance.","rel_num_authors":30,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gabriel Chamie","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Carina Marquez","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Emily Crawford","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"James Peng","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Maya Petersen","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Daniel Schwab","author_inst":"College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, MA"},{"author_name":"Joshua Schwab","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Jackie Martinez","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Diane Jones","author_inst":"Unidos en Salud\/United in Health, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Douglas Black","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Monica Gandhi","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Andrew D.

It is vital to identify features of cases such as this so as to better understand the factors that promote superspreading events. Based on a conditional assumption that transmission during this outbreak was by inhalation of respiratory aerosol, we use the available evidence to infer the emission rate of airborne infectious quanta from the primary source. We also explore how the risk of infection would vary with several influential factors: the rates of removal of respiratory aerosol by ventilation; deposition onto surfaces; and viral decay. The results indicate an emission rate of the order of a thousand quanta per hour (mean [interquartile range] for this event = 970 [680-1190] quanta per hour) and demonstrate that the risk of infection is modulated by ventilation conditions, occupant density, and duration of shared presence with an infectious individual.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shelly L Miller","author_inst":"Mechanical Engineering, University of Colorado Boulder"},{"author_name":"William W Nazaroff","author_inst":"Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Jose L Jimenez","author_inst":"Dept. of Chemistry and CIRES, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Atze Boerstra","author_inst":"REHVA (Federation of European Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning Associations), BBA Binnenmilieu, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Buonanno","author_inst":"Department of Civil and Mechanical Engineering, University of Cassino and Southern Lazio, Cassino, Italy"},{"author_name":"Stephanie J Dancer","author_inst":"Edinburgh Napier University and NHS Lanarkshire, Scotland"},{"author_name":"Jarek Kurnitski","author_inst":"REHVA Technology and Research Committee, Tallinn University of Technology, Estonia"},{"author_name":"Linsey C Marr","author_inst":"Civil and Environmental Engineering, Virginia Tech, USA"},{"author_name":"Lidia Morawska","author_inst":"International Laboratory for Air Quality and Heath (ILAQH), WHO Collaborating Centre for Air Quality and Health, School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Queen"},{"author_name":"Catherine Noakes","author_inst":"School of Civil Engineering, University of Leeds, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Monica Gandhi","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Andrew D.

We report the clinical application of a machine learning-based digital protein microarray platform for rapid multiplex quantification of cytokines from critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at the University of Michigan Hospital. The platform comprises two low-cost modules: (i) a semi-automated fluidic dispensing\/mixing module that can be operated inside a biosafety cabinet to minimize the exposure of technician to the virus infection and (ii) a 12-12-15 inch compact fluorescence optical scanner for the potential near-bedside readout. The platform enabled daily cytokine analysis in clinical practice with high sensitivity (<0.4pg\/mL), inter-assay repeatability (~10% CV), and near-real-time operation with a 10 min assay incubation. A cytokine profiling test with the platform allowed us to observe clear interleukin-6 (IL-6) elevations after receiving tocilizumab (IL-6 inhibitor) while significant cytokine profile variability exists across all critically ill COVID-19 patients and to discover a weak correlation between IL-6 to clinical biomarkers, such as Ferritin and CRP. Our data revealed large subject-to-subject variability in a patient's response to anti-inflammatory treatment for COVID-19, reaffirming the need for a personalized strategy guided by rapid cytokine assays.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yujing Song","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Yuxuan Ye","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Shiuan-Haur Su","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Andrew Stephens","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Tao Cai","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Meng-Ting Chung","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Meilan Han","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Michael W.

At the same time, lung histopathology often reveals fibrin-based occlusion in the small vessels of patients who succumb to the disease. Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an acquired and potentially life-threatening thrombophilia in which patients develop pathogenic autoantibodies (aPL) targeting phospholipids and phospholipid-binding proteins. Case series have recently detected aPL in patients with COVID-19. Here, we measured eight types of aPL [anticardiolipin IgG\/IgM\/IgA, anti-beta-2 glycoprotein I IgG\/IgM\/IgA, and anti- phosphatidylserine\/prothrombin (aPS\/PT) IgG\/IgM] in the sera of 172 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We detected aPS\/PT IgG in 24%, anticardiolipin IgM in 23%, and aPS\/PT IgM in 18%. Any aPL was present in 52% of patients using the manufacturer's threshold and in 30% using a more stringent cutoff ([&ge;]40 units). Higher levels of aPL were associated with neutrophil hyperactivity (including the release of neutrophil extracellular traps\/NETs), higher platelet count, more severe respiratory disease, and lower glomerular filtration rate. Similar to patients with longstanding APS, IgG fractions isolated from patients with COVID-19 promoted NET release from control neutrophils. Furthermore, injection of these COVID-19 IgG fractions into mice accelerated venous thrombosis. Taken together, these studies suggest that a significant percentage of patients with COVID-19 become at least transiently positive for aPL and that these aPL are potentially pathogenic.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yu Zuo","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Shanea K.

We aimed to investigate which specific responses from either cellular or humoral immunity associate to severity and progression of COVID-19. Methods: A cohort of 276 patients classified in mild, moderate and severe, was studied. Peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulations were quantified by flow cytometry, and immunoglobulins and complement proteins by nephelometry. Results: At admission, dramatic lymphopenia of T, B and NK cells associated to severity. However, only the proportion of B cells increased, while T and NK cells appeared unaffected. Accordingly, the number of plasma cells and circulating follicular helper T cells (cTfh) increased, but levels of IgM, IgA and IgG were unaffected. When degrees of severity were considered, IgG was lower in severe patients, suggesting an IgG consumption by complement activation or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Activated CD56-CD16+ NK-cells, which mediate ADCC, were increased. Regarding complement, C3 and C4 protein levels were higher in mild and moderate, but not in severe patients, compared to healthy donors. Moreover, IgG and C4 decreased from day 0 to day 10 in patients who were hospitalized for more than two weeks, but not in patients who were discharged earlier. Conclusion: Our study provides important clues to understand the immune response observed in COVID-19 patients, which is probably related to viral clearance, but also underlies its pathogenesis and severity. This study associates for the first time COVID-19 severity with an imbalanced humoral immune response characterized by excessive consumption of IgG and C4, identifying new targets for therapeutic intervention.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ana Marcos-Jimenez","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Santiago Sanchez-Alonso","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Ana Alcaraz-Serna","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Laura Esparcia","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Celia Lopez-Sanz","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Miguel Sampedro-Nunez","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Tamara Mateu-Albero","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Ildefonso Sanchez-Cerrillo","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Pedro Martinez-Fleta","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Ligia Gabrie","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Luciana Del Campo","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Margarita Lopez-Trascasa","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Enrique Martin-Gayo","author_inst":"Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Maria Calzada","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Santos Castaneda","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Hortensia de la Fuente","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Isidoro Gonzalez-Alvaro","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Francisco Sanchez-Madrid","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Munoz-Calleja","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Arantzazu Alfranca","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Mary Rodgers","author_inst":"Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL"},{"author_name":"John Hackett Jr.","author_inst":"Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL"},{"author_name":"Amy Kistler","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Samantha Hao","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Jack Kamm","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"David Dynerman","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Joshua Batson","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Bryan Greenhouse","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Joe DeRisi","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Diane V.

However, other modes of transmission also need to be clarified in more depth, especially, the foodborne transmission. We assessed the effect of animal origin foods consumption on the pandemic of COVID-19. For this purpose, we studied the relationship among 20 food supply as independent variables, and the parameter of Total Cases as dependent variable. Here we show a relationship between a group of animal origin foods and total cases. Regression, Bayes, and Lasso results showed that eggs and fresh water fish have positive coefficient. So, among the transmission ways of COVID_19, the role of foodborne transmission should be more significant than previously thought. The possibility of animal origin foodborne transmission should be taken into more consideration. The perspective is to expand the surveillance of SARS-Cov-2 during the food production chain. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that one important vehicle for SARS-Cov2 may be some of animal origin foods. It is recommended that virologists examine the possibility of freshwater fish and chickens eggs being as excellent vehicles\/preservatives for SARS-Cov2.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nazli Saeedi","author_inst":"Research Center for Pharmaceutical Nanotechnology"},{"author_name":"seyed rafat","author_inst":"university of Tabriz"},{"author_name":"Ana Alcaraz-Serna","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Laura Esparcia","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Celia Lopez-Sanz","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Miguel Sampedro-Nunez","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Tamara Mateu-Albero","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Ildefonso Sanchez-Cerrillo","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Pedro Martinez-Fleta","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Ligia Gabrie","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Luciana Del Campo","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Margarita Lopez-Trascasa","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Enrique Martin-Gayo","author_inst":"Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Maria Calzada","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Santos Castaneda","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Hortensia de la Fuente","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Isidoro Gonzalez-Alvaro","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Francisco Sanchez-Madrid","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Munoz-Calleja","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Arantzazu Alfranca","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Mary Rodgers","author_inst":"Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL"},{"author_name":"John Hackett Jr.","author_inst":"Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL"},{"author_name":"Amy Kistler","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Samantha Hao","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Jack Kamm","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"David Dynerman","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Joshua Batson","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Bryan Greenhouse","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Joe DeRisi","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Diane V.

We present both the deterministic and stochastic version fo the model and derive the R0 and the probability of local extinction after relaxation (elimination of transmission) of containment, P0. We show that local extinctions are possible without further interventions, with reasonable probability, as long as the number of active cases is driven to single digits and strict control of case importation is maintained. The maintenance of defensive behaviors, such as using masks and avoiding agglomerations are also important factors. We also explore the importance of population immunity even when above the herd immunity threshold.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Flavio Codeco Coelho","author_inst":"Fundacao Getulio Vargas"},{"author_name":"Luiz Max Carvalho","author_inst":"Fundacao Getulio Vargas"},{"author_name":"Raquel M Lana","author_inst":"Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz"},{"author_name":"Oswaldo G Cruz","author_inst":"Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz"},{"author_name":"Leonardo S Bastos","author_inst":"Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz"},{"author_name":"Claudia T Codeco","author_inst":"Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz"},{"author_name":"Marcelo F C Gomes","author_inst":"Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz"},{"author_name":"Daniel Villela","author_inst":"Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz"},{"author_name":"Pedro Martinez-Fleta","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Ligia Gabrie","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Luciana Del Campo","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Margarita Lopez-Trascasa","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Enrique Martin-Gayo","author_inst":"Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Maria Calzada","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Santos Castaneda","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Hortensia de la Fuente","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Isidoro Gonzalez-Alvaro","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Francisco Sanchez-Madrid","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Munoz-Calleja","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Arantzazu Alfranca","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Mary Rodgers","author_inst":"Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL"},{"author_name":"John Hackett Jr.","author_inst":"Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL"},{"author_name":"Amy Kistler","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Samantha Hao","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Jack Kamm","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"David Dynerman","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Joshua Batson","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Bryan Greenhouse","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Joe DeRisi","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Diane V.

Here, we develop a metapopulation SEIR disease model that uses dynamic mobility networks, derived from US cell phone data, to capture the hourly movements of millions of people from local neighborhoods (census block groups, or CBGs) to points of interest (POIs) such as restaurants, grocery stores, or religious establishments. We simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 from March 1 - May 2, 2020 among a population of 98 million people in 10 of the largest US metropolitan statistical areas. We show that by integrating these mobility networks, which connect 57k CBGs to 553k POIs with a total of 5.4 billion hourly edges, even a relatively simple epidemiological model can accurately capture the case trajectory despite dramatic changes in population behavior due to the virus. Furthermore, by modeling detailed information about each POI, like visitor density and visit length, we can estimate the impacts of fine-grained reopening plans: we predict that a small minority of \"superspreader\" POIs account for a large majority of infections, that reopening some POI categories (like full-service restaurants) poses especially large risks, and that strategies restricting maximum occupancy at each POI are more effective than uniformly reducing mobility. Our models also predict higher infection rates among disadvantaged racial and socioeconomic groups solely from differences in mobility: disadvantaged groups have not been able to reduce mobility as sharply, and the POIs they visit (even within the same category) tend to be smaller, more crowded, and therefore more dangerous. By modeling who is infected at which locations, our model supports fine-grained analyses that can inform more effective and equitable policy responses to SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Serina Y Chang","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Emma Pierson","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Pang Wei Koh","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jaline Gerardin","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Beth Redbird","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"David Grusky","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jure Leskovec","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Daniel Villela","author_inst":"Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz"},{"author_name":"Pedro Martinez-Fleta","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Ligia Gabrie","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Luciana Del Campo","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Margarita Lopez-Trascasa","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Enrique Martin-Gayo","author_inst":"Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Maria Calzada","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Santos Castaneda","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Hortensia de la Fuente","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Isidoro Gonzalez-Alvaro","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Francisco Sanchez-Madrid","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Munoz-Calleja","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Arantzazu Alfranca","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Mary Rodgers","author_inst":"Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL"},{"author_name":"John Hackett Jr.","author_inst":"Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL"},{"author_name":"Amy Kistler","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Samantha Hao","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Jack Kamm","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"David Dynerman","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Joshua Batson","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Bryan Greenhouse","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Joe DeRisi","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Diane V.

We searched the COVID-19 portfolio of the National Institutes of Health for all studies that reported the prevalence of smell and\/or taste deficits in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Forty-two studies reporting on 23,353 patients qualified and were subjected to a systematic review and meta-analysis.

We examined the effects of age, disease severity, and ethnicity on chemosensory dysfunction. The effect of age did not reach significance, but anosmia\/hypogeusia decreased with disease severity, and ethnicity was highly significant: Caucasians had a 3-6 times higher prevalence of chemosensory deficits than East Asians. The finding of ethnic differences points to genetic, ethnicity-specific differences of the virus-binding entry proteins in the olfactory epithelium and taste buds as the most likely explanation, with major implications for infectivity, diagnosis and management of the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christopher S von Bartheld","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno"},{"author_name":"Molly M Hagen","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno"},{"author_name":"Rafal Butowt","author_inst":"Nicolaus Copernicus University, Bydgoszcz"},{"author_name":"Jaline Gerardin","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Beth Redbird","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"David Grusky","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jure Leskovec","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Daniel Villela","author_inst":"Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz"},{"author_name":"Pedro Martinez-Fleta","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Ligia Gabrie","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Luciana Del Campo","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Margarita Lopez-Trascasa","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Enrique Martin-Gayo","author_inst":"Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Maria Calzada","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Santos Castaneda","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Hortensia de la Fuente","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Isidoro Gonzalez-Alvaro","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Francisco Sanchez-Madrid","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Munoz-Calleja","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Arantzazu Alfranca","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Mary Rodgers","author_inst":"Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL"},{"author_name":"John Hackett Jr.","author_inst":"Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL"},{"author_name":"Amy Kistler","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Samantha Hao","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Jack Kamm","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"David Dynerman","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Joshua Batson","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Bryan Greenhouse","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Joe DeRisi","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Diane V.

Many countries around the world implemented their own policies and restrictions designed to limit the spread of Covid-19 in recent months. Businesses and schools transitioned into working and learning remotely. In the United States, many states were under strict orders to stay home at least in the month of April. In recent weeks, there are some significant changes related restrictions include social-distancing, reopening states, and staying-at-home orders. The United States surpassed 2 million coronavirus cases on Monday, June 15, 2020 less than five months after the first case was confirmed in the country. The virus has killed at least 115,000 people in the United States as of Monday, June 15, 2020, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. With the recent easing of coronavirus-related restrictions and changes on business and social activity such as stay-at-home, social distancing since late May 2020 hoping to restore economic and business activities, new Covid-19 outbreaks are on the rise in many states across the country. Some researchers expressed concern that the process of easing restrictions and relaxing stay-at-home orders too soon could quickly surge the number of infected Covid-19 cases as well as the death toll in the United States. Some of these increases, however, could be due to more testing sites in the communities while others may be are the results of easing restrictions due to recent reopening and changed policies, though the number of daily death toll does not appear to be going down in recent days due to Covid-19 in the U.S. This raises the challenging question: * How can policy decision-makers and community leaders make the decision to implement public policies and restrictions and keep or lift staying-at-home orders of ongoing Covid-19 pandemic for their communities in a scientific way? In this study, we aim to develop models addressing the effects of recent Covid-19 related changes in the communities such as reopening states, practicing social-distancing, and staying-at-home orders. Our models account for the fact that changes to these policies which can lead to a surge of coronavius cases and deaths, especially in the United States. Specifically, in this paper we develop a novel generalized mathematical model and several explicit models considering the effects of recent reopening states, staying-at-home orders and social-distancing practice of different communities along with a set of selected indicators such as the total number of coronavirus recovered and new cases that can estimate the daily death toll and total number of deaths in the United States related to Covid-19 virus. We compare the modeling results among the developed models based on several existing criteria. The model also can be used to predict the number of death toll in Italy and the United Kingdom (UK). The results show very encouraging predictability for the proposed models in this study. The model predicts that 128,500 to 140,100 people in the United States will have died of Covid-19 by July 4, 2020. The model also predicts that between 137,900 and 154,000 people will have died of Covid-19 by July 31, and 148,500 to 169,700 will have died by the end of August 2020, as a result of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that causes COVID-19 based on the Covid-19 death data available on June 13, 2020. The model also predicts that 34,900 to 37,200 people in Italy will have died of Covid-19 by July 4, and 36,900 to 40,400 people will have died by the end of August based on the data available on June 13, 2020. The model also predicts that between 43,500 and 46,700 people in the United Kingdom will have died of Covid-19 by July 4, and 48,700 to 51,900 people will have died by the end of August, as a result of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that causes COVID-19 based on the data available on June 13, 2020. The model can serve as a framework to help policy makers a scientific approach in quantifying decision-makings related to Covid-19 affairs.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hoang Pham","author_inst":"Rutgers University"},{"author_name":"Molly M Hagen","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno"},{"author_name":"Rafal Butowt","author_inst":"Nicolaus Copernicus University, Bydgoszcz"},{"author_name":"Jaline Gerardin","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Beth Redbird","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"David Grusky","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jure Leskovec","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Daniel Villela","author_inst":"Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz"},{"author_name":"Pedro Martinez-Fleta","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Ligia Gabrie","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Luciana Del Campo","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Margarita Lopez-Trascasa","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Enrique Martin-Gayo","author_inst":"Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Maria Calzada","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Santos Castaneda","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Hortensia de la Fuente","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Isidoro Gonzalez-Alvaro","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Francisco Sanchez-Madrid","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Munoz-Calleja","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Arantzazu Alfranca","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Mary Rodgers","author_inst":"Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL"},{"author_name":"John Hackett Jr.","author_inst":"Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL"},{"author_name":"Amy Kistler","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Samantha Hao","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Jack Kamm","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"David Dynerman","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Joshua Batson","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Bryan Greenhouse","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Joe DeRisi","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Diane V.

As of June 04, 2020, more than 2 lakh cases have been confirmed with a death rate of 2.81%. It has been noticed that, out of each 1000 tests, 53 result positively infected. In order to investigate the impact of weather conditions on daily transmission occurring in India, daily data of Maximum (TMax), Minimum (TMin), Mean (TMean) and Dew Point Temperature (TDew), Diurnal Temperature range (TRange), Average Relative Humidity, Range in Relative Humidity, and Wind Speed (WS) over 9 most affected cities are analysed in several time frames: weather of that day, 7, 10, 12, 14, 16 days before transmission. Spearman rank correlation (r) shows significant but low correlation with most of the weather parameters, however, comparatively better association exists on 14 days lag. Diurnal range in Temperature and Relative Humidity shows non-significant correlation. Analysis shows, COVID-19 cases likely to be increased with increasing air temperature, however role of humidity is not clear. Among weather parameters, Minimum Temperature was relatively better correlate than other. 80% of the total confirmed cases were registered when TMax, TMean, TMin, TRange, TDew, and WS on 12-16 days ago vary within a range of 33.6-41.3 deg C, 29.8-36.5 deg C, 24.8-30.4 deg C, 7.5-15.2 deg C, 18.7-23.6 deg C, and 4.2-5.75 m\/s respectively, hence, it gives an idea of susceptible weather conditions for such transmission in India. Using Support Vector Machine based regression, the daily cases are profoundly estimated with more than 80% accuracy, which indicate that coronavirus transmission cannot be well linearly correlated with any single weather parameters, rather multivariate non-linear approach must be employed. Accounting lag of 12-16 days, the association found to be excellent, thus depict that there is an incubation period of 12-16 days for coronavirus transmission in Indian scenario.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amitesh Gupta","author_inst":"JIS University"},{"author_name":"Biswajeet Pradhan","author_inst":"School of Information, Systems & Modelling Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Technology Sydney"},{"author_name":"Rafal Butowt","author_inst":"Nicolaus Copernicus University, Bydgoszcz"},{"author_name":"Jaline Gerardin","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Beth Redbird","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"David Grusky","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jure Leskovec","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Daniel Villela","author_inst":"Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz"},{"author_name":"Pedro Martinez-Fleta","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Ligia Gabrie","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Luciana Del Campo","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Margarita Lopez-Trascasa","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Enrique Martin-Gayo","author_inst":"Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Maria Calzada","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Santos Castaneda","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Hortensia de la Fuente","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Isidoro Gonzalez-Alvaro","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Francisco Sanchez-Madrid","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Munoz-Calleja","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Arantzazu Alfranca","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Mary Rodgers","author_inst":"Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL"},{"author_name":"John Hackett Jr.","author_inst":"Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL"},{"author_name":"Amy Kistler","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Samantha Hao","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Jack Kamm","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"David Dynerman","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Joshua Batson","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Bryan Greenhouse","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Joe DeRisi","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Diane V.

Serological survey for COVID-19 antibodies is crucial in area with low prevalence as well as epidemic area when addressing health and social issues caused by COVID-19. Rapid, accurate and easy-to-use antibody tests as well laboratory-based antibody tests are necessary for confirming immunity in a given community. Methods:Serum samples from healthcare workers (n = 1,000, mean 40 {+\/-} 11 years) of Iwate Prefectural Central Hospital, Iwate, Japan were tested for the prevalence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies. Two laboratory-based quantitative tests (Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG and Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assays) and one point-of-care (POC) qualitative test (Alfa Instant-view plus COVID-19 Test) were performed simultaneously. Sensitivity and specificity were 100%, 99.6% in Abbott assay; 100%, 99.8% in Roche assay; 97.8%, 94.6% in Alfa POC test, respectively. Results:The laboratory-based quantitative tests showed positive in 4 of 1,000 samples (0.4%) (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.79): 4\/1,000 (0.4%) (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.79) in Abbott; 0\/1,000 (0%) in Roche. Positive samples were not detected for both Abbott and Roche assays. The POC qualitative test showed positive in 33 of 1,000 samples (3.3%) (95% CI: 2.19 to 4.41), showing higher rates than those of the laboratory-based quantitative tests. There were no samples with simultaneous positive reaction for two quantitative tests and a POC test. Conclusions: Infected COVID-2 cases were not confirmed by a retrospective serological study in healthcare workers of our hospital. The POC qualitative tests with lower specificity have the potential for higher false positive reactions than the laboratory-based quantitative tests in areas with very low prevalence of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Akihiro Nakamura","author_inst":"Iwate Prefectural Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ryoichi Sato","author_inst":"Iwate Prefectural Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sanae Ando","author_inst":"Iwate Prefectural Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Natsuko Oana","author_inst":"Iwate Prefectural Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Eiji Nozaki","author_inst":"Iwate Prefectural Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hideaki Endo","author_inst":"Iwate Prefectural Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yoshiharu Miyate","author_inst":"Iwate Prefectural Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Soma","author_inst":"Iwate Prefectural Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Go Miyata","author_inst":"Iwate Prefectural Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ligia Gabrie","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Luciana Del Campo","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Margarita Lopez-Trascasa","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Enrique Martin-Gayo","author_inst":"Universidad Autonoma de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Maria Calzada","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Santos Castaneda","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Hortensia de la Fuente","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Isidoro Gonzalez-Alvaro","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Francisco Sanchez-Madrid","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Munoz-Calleja","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa; School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Arantzazu Alfranca","author_inst":"University Hospital La Princesa"},{"author_name":"Mary Rodgers","author_inst":"Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL"},{"author_name":"John Hackett Jr.","author_inst":"Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL"},{"author_name":"Amy Kistler","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Samantha Hao","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Jack Kamm","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"David Dynerman","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Joshua Batson","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Bryan Greenhouse","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Joe DeRisi","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Diane V.

For example, from knowledge of the infected population time series I(t) during the entire epidemic, the parameters can be successfully estimated. In this article we observe that estimation will fail in practice if only infected case data during the early part of the epidemic (pre-peak) is available. This fact can be explained using a long-known phenomenon called dynamical compensation. We use this concept to derive an unidentifiability manifold in the parameter space of SEIR that consists of parameters indistinguishable to I(t) early in the epidemic. Thus, identifiability depends on the extent of the system trajectory that is available for observation. Although the existence of the unidentifiability manifold obstructs the ability to exactly determine the parameters, we suggest that it may be useful for uncertainty quantification purposes. A variant of SEIR recently proposed for COVID-19 modeling is also analyzed, and an analogous unidentifiability surface is derived.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Timothy Sauer","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Tyrus Berry","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Donald Ebeigbe","author_inst":"Pennsylvania State University"},{"author_name":"Michael M.
