A key question is whether SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) - the causal agent in COVID-19 - affects olfaction directly by infecting olfactory sensory neurons or their targets in the olfactory bulb, or indirectly, through perturbation of supporting cells. Here we identify cell types in the olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb that express SARS-CoV-2 cell entry molecules. Bulk sequencing revealed that mouse, non-human primate and human olfactory mucosa expresses two key genes involved in CoV-2 entry, ACE2 and TMPRSS2. However, single cell sequencing and immunostaining demonstrated ACE2 expression in support cells, stem cells, and perivascular cells; in contrast, neurons in both the olfactory epithelium and bulb did not express ACE2 message or protein. These findings suggest that CoV-2 infection of non-neuronal cell types leads to anosmia and related disturbances in odor perception in COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Brann","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School Department of Neurobiology"},{"author_name":"Tatsuya Tsukahara","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School Department of Neurobiology"},{"author_name":"Caleb Weinreb","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Koen Van den Berge","author_inst":"Department of Statistics, University of California, Berkeley; Department of Applied Mathematics, Computer Science and Statistics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgi"},{"author_name":"Boying Gong","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Chance","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California,"},{"author_name":"Iain C Macaulay","author_inst":"Earlham Institute"},{"author_name":"Hsin-jung Chou","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Russell Fletcher","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California,"},{"author_name":"Diya Das","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Kelly Street","author_inst":"Department of Data Sciences, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute; Department of Biostatistics, Harvard T.H.

To predict the inflection points, i.e., inflection time (Tmax) & maximal infection number (Imax) of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), we adopted a trial and error strategy and explored a series of approaches from simple logistic modeling (that has an asymptomatic line) to sophisticated tipping point detection techniques for detecting phase transitions but failed to obtain satisfactory results. Method: Inspired by its success in diversity-time relationship (DTR), we apply the PLEC (power law with exponential cutoff) model for detecting the inflection points of COVID-19 outbreaks. The model was previously used to extend the classic species-time relationship (STR) for general DTR (Ma 2018), and it has two secondary parameters (computed from its 3 parameters including power law scaling parameter w, taper-off parameter d to overwhelm virtually exponential growth ultimately, and a parameter c related to initial infections): one that was originally used for estimating the potential or dark biodiversity is proposed to estimate the maximal infection number (Imax) and another is proposed to determine the corresponding inflection time point (Tmax). Results: We successfully estimated the inflection points [Imax, Tmax] for most provinces ({approx} 85%) in China with error rates <5% in both Imax and Tmax. We also discussed the constraints and limitations of the proposed approach, including (i) sensitive to disruptive jumps, (ii) requiring sufficiently long datasets, and (iii) limited to unimodal outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhanshan (Sam) Ma","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Tatsuya Tsukahara","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School Department of Neurobiology"},{"author_name":"Caleb Weinreb","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Koen Van den Berge","author_inst":"Department of Statistics, University of California, Berkeley; Department of Applied Mathematics, Computer Science and Statistics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgi"},{"author_name":"Boying Gong","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Chance","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California,"},{"author_name":"Iain C Macaulay","author_inst":"Earlham Institute"},{"author_name":"Hsin-jung Chou","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Russell Fletcher","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California,"},{"author_name":"Diya Das","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Kelly Street","author_inst":"Department of Data Sciences, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute; Department of Biostatistics, Harvard T.H.

Immune system dysregulation such as lymphopenia and inflammatory cytokine storm has been observed in COVID-19 patients, but it remains unclear for the change of key immune cell subsets and their states during COVID-19. Here, we applied single-cell technology to comprehensively characterize transcriptional changes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in ten patients recovered from COVID-19. Compared with healthy control, COVID-19 induced a unique signature of immune cells in humans, especially in the early recovery stage (ERS). In ERS patients, T cells were decreased remarkably, while monocytes were increased. A detailed analysis of monocytes showed that there was an increased ratio of classical CD14++ monocytes with highly inflammatory genes expression, as well as a greater abundance of CD14++IL1B+ monocytes. For nature killer (NK) cells and T cells, CD4+ T cells were significantly decreased and expressed high level of inflammatory markers, while NK cells were increased. In addition, T cells were highly expanded clone, especially in CD4+ T memory cells and CD8+ T cells. Among B cells, plasma cells were increased remarkably, and naive B cells were reduced. Our study also identified several novel B cell receptor (BCR) changes (such as IGHV1-8 and IGHV3-7), and confirmed isotypes (IGKV3-11 and IGHV3-21) previously used for virus vaccine development. The strongest pairing frequencies, IGHV3-23+IGHJ4, indicated a monoclonal state associated with SARS-CoV-2 specificity. Furthermore, integrated analysis predicated that IL-1B and M-CSF may be novel candidate target gene for inflammatory storm, and TNFSF13, IL-18 and IL-4 may be benefit for the recovery of COVID-19 patients. Our study provides the first evidence of inflammatory immune signature in early recovery stage, suggesting that the COVID-19 patients are still vulnerable after hospital discharge. Our identification of novel BCR signaling may lead to the development of vaccine and antibodies for the treatment of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wen Wen","author_inst":"National Center for Liver Cancer, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Wenru Su","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Hao Tang","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Wenqing Le","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care,Wuhan Hankou Hospital, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaopeng Zhang","author_inst":"Laboratory of Vaccine and Antibody Engineering, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Yingfeng Zheng","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"XiuXing Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Lihui Xie","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Jianmin Li","author_inst":"Laboratory of Vaccine and Antibody Engineering, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Jinguo Ye","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Xiuliang Cui","author_inst":"National Center for Liver Cancer Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Yushan Miao","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Depeng Wang","author_inst":"GrandOmics Diagnosis Co.

The outbreak has quickly spread to more than 100 countries reporting over 100,000 confirmed cases. Australia reported its first case of COVID-19 on 25th January 2020 and has since implemented travel restrictions to stop further introduction of the virus. Methods: We analysed daily global COVID-19 data published by the World Health Organisation to investigate the spread of the virus thus far. To assess the current risk of COVID-19 importation and local spread in Australia we predict international passenger flows into Australia during 2020. Findings: Our analysis of global data shows that Australia can expect a similar growth rate of reported cases as observed in France and the United States. We identify travel patterns of Australian citizens\/residents and foreign travellers that can inform the implementation of new and the alteration of existing travel restrictions related to COVID-19. Interpretation: Our findings identify the risk reduction potential of current travel bans, based on the proportion of returning travellers to Australia that are residents or visitors. The similarity of the exponential growth in the epidemic curve in Australia to other countries guides forecasts of COVID-19 growth in Australia, and opportunities for drawing lessons from other countries with more advanced outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jessica Liebig","author_inst":"CSIRO"},{"author_name":"Raja Jurdak","author_inst":"Queensland University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Ahmad El Shoghri","author_inst":"University of New South Wales"},{"author_name":"Dean Paini","author_inst":"CSIRO"},{"author_name":"Xiaopeng Zhang","author_inst":"Laboratory of Vaccine and Antibody Engineering, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Yingfeng Zheng","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"XiuXing Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Lihui Xie","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Jianmin Li","author_inst":"Laboratory of Vaccine and Antibody Engineering, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Jinguo Ye","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Xiuliang Cui","author_inst":"National Center for Liver Cancer Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Yushan Miao","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Depeng Wang","author_inst":"GrandOmics Diagnosis Co.

Furthermore, the infection curve, daily transmission replication curve, and the trend of cumulative confirmed cases were used to evaluate the effects of the public health interventions. Our results showed that the SEIRD curve model we established had a good fit and the basic reproductive number is 3.38 (95% CI, 3.25-3.48). The SEIRD curve show a small difference between the simulated number of cases and the actual number; the correlation index (H2) is 0.934, and the reproductive number (R) has been reduced from 3.38 to 0.5 under the current forty public health interventions policies of China.

We investigated a likely scenario of COVID-19 spreading in Brazil through the complex airport network of the country, for the 90 days after the first national occurrence of the disease. After the confirmation of the first imported cases, the lack of a proper airport entrance control resulted in the infection spreading in a manner directly proportional to the amount of flights reaching each city, following first occurrence of the virus coming from abroad. Methodology. We developed a SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model divided in a metapopulation structure, where cities with airports were demes connected by the number of flights. Subsequently, we further explored the role of Manaus airport for a rapid entrance of the pandemic into indigenous territories situated in remote places of the Amazon region. Results. The expansion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus between cities was fast, directly proportional to the airport closeness centrality within the Brazilian air transportation network. There was a clear pattern in the expansion of the pandemic, with a stiff exponential expansion of cases for all cities. The more an airport showed closeness centrality, the greater was its vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions. We discussed the weak pandemic control performance of Brazil in comparison with other tropical, developing countries, namely India and Nigeria. Finally, we proposed measures for containing virus spreading taking into consideration the scenario of high poverty.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Servio Pontes Ribeiro","author_inst":"UFOP, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Wesley Dattilo","author_inst":"Inecol, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Alcides Castro e Silva","author_inst":"Federal University of Ouro Preto"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Barbosa Reis","author_inst":"UFOP, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Aristoteles Goes-Neto","author_inst":"UFMG, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Luiz Alcantara","author_inst":"Fiocruz, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Marta Giovanetti","author_inst":"Fiocruz, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Wendel Coura-vital","author_inst":"UFOP, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Geraldo Wilson Fernandes","author_inst":"UFMG, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Vasco Ariston Azevedo","author_inst":"UFMG, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Xiuliang Cui","author_inst":"National Center for Liver Cancer Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Yushan Miao","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Depeng Wang","author_inst":"GrandOmics Diagnosis Co.

Patients who died from Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) often had comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, and chronic obstructive lung disease. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as a crucial factor that facilitates SARS-CoV2 to bind and enter host cells. To date, no study has assessed the ACE2 expression in the lungs of patients with these diseases. Here, we analyzed over 700 lung transcriptome samples of patients with comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19 and found that ACE2 was highly expressed in these patients, compared to control individuals. This finding suggests that patients with such comorbidities may have higher chances of developing severe COVID-19. We also found other genes, such as RAB1A, that can be important for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung. Correlation and network analyses revealed many potential regulators of ACE2 in the human lung, including genes related to histone modifications, such as HAT1, HDAC2, and KDM5B. In fact, epigenetic marks found in ACE2 locus were compatible to with those promoted by KDM5B.

It started in China at the end of 2019, and it is diffusing throughout Italy, one of the most affected countries, and it is currently spreading through European countries and USA. Patients affected by COVID-19 are identified employing medical swabs applied mainly to (i) citizens with COVID-19 symptoms such as flu or high temperature, or (ii) citizens that had contacts with COVID-19 patients. A percentage of COVID-19 affected patients needs hospitalisation, whereas a portion needs to be treated in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). Nevertheless, it is a matter of current intuition that COVID-19 infected citizens are more than those detected, and sometime the infection is detected too late. Thus there are many efforts in both tracking people activities as well as diffusing low cost reliable COVID-19 tests for early detection. Starting from mortality rates of diseases caused by viruses in the same family (e.g. MERS, SARS, H1N1), we study the relations between the number of COVID-19 infections and the number of deaths, through Italian regions. We thus assess several infections being higher than the ones currently measured. We thus focus on the characterisation of the pandemic diffusion by estimating the infected number of patients versus the number of death. We use such an estimated number of infections, to foresee the effects of restriction actions adopted by governments to constrain virus diffusion. We finally think that our model can support the healthcare system to react when COVID-19 is increasing.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giuseppe Tradigo","author_inst":"University of Catanzaro"},{"author_name":"Pietro Hiram Guzzi","author_inst":"University of Catanzaro"},{"author_name":"Pierangelo Veltri","author_inst":"University of Catanzaro"},{"author_name":"Leandro Jimenez","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Andre NA Goncalves","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo LT Ogava","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Rachel Creighton","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jean PS Peron","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Helder I Nakaya","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Vasco Ariston Azevedo","author_inst":"UFMG, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Xiuliang Cui","author_inst":"National Center for Liver Cancer Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Yushan Miao","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Depeng Wang","author_inst":"GrandOmics Diagnosis Co.

During the initial phase, the number of virus cases doubled every 2.7 (range 2.2 - 4.4) days. The rate of increase in the number of reported cases peaked approximately 10 days after suppression measures were started on 23-25 January 2020. The peak in the number of reported sick cases occurred on average 18 days after the start of measures. From the time of starting measures till the peak, the number of cases increased by a factor 39 in the province Hubei, and by a factor 9.5 for all of China (range: 6.2-20.4 in the other provinces). Complete suppression took up to 2 months (range: 23-57d.), during which period severe restrictions, social distancing measures, testing and isolation of cases were in place.

To enable the global understanding of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG\/ IgM responses, a SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray with 18 out of the 28 predicted proteins was constructed. The microarray was applied to profile the IgG\/ IgM responses with 29 convalescent sera. The results suggest that at the convalescent phase 100% of patients had IgG\/ IgM responses to SARS-CoV-2, especially to protein N, S1 but not S2. S1 purified from mammalian cell demonstrated the highest performance to differentiate COVID-19 patients from controls. Besides protein N and S1, significant antibody responses to ORF9b and NSP5 were also identified. In-depth analysis showed that the level of S1 IgG positively correlate to age and the level of LDH (lactate dehydrogenase), especially for women, while the level of S1 IgG negatively correlate to Ly% (Lymphocyte percentage). This study presents the first whole picture of the SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG\/ IgM responses, and provides insights to develop precise immuno-diagnostics, effective treatment and vaccine.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"He-wei Jiang","author_inst":"Shanghai Center for Systems Biomedicine, Key Laboratory of Systems Biomedicine (Ministry of Education), Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China"},{"author_name":"Yang Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Center for Systems Biomedicine, Key Laboratory of Systems Biomedicine (Ministry of Education), Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China"},{"author_name":"Hai-nan Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Center for Systems Biomedicine, Key Laboratory of Systems Biomedicine (Ministry of Education), Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Foshan Fourth People's Hospital, Foshan 528000, China"},{"author_name":"Dong Men","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, China"},{"author_name":"Xiao Yang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of RNA Biology, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China"},{"author_name":"Huan Qi","author_inst":"Shanghai Center for Systems Biomedicine, Key Laboratory of Systems Biomedicine (Ministry of Education), Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China"},{"author_name":"Jie Zhou","author_inst":"Foshan Fourth People's Hospital, Foshan 528000, China"},{"author_name":"Sheng-ce Tao","author_inst":"Shanghai Center for Systems Biomedicine, Key Laboratory of Systems Biomedicine (Ministry of Education), Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China"},{"author_name":"Vasco Ariston Azevedo","author_inst":"UFMG, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Xiuliang Cui","author_inst":"National Center for Liver Cancer Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Yushan Miao","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Depeng Wang","author_inst":"GrandOmics Diagnosis Co.

SARS-CoV-2 uses the membrane protein Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2(ACE2) as a cell entry receptor. Indeed, it was reported that the balance of Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS), regulated by both ACE and ACE2, was altered in COVID-19 patients. It is controversial, however, whether commonly used anti-hypertensive drugs Angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and Angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) shall be continued in the confirmed COVID-19 patients. This study was designed to investigate any difference in disease severity between COVID-19 patients with hypertension comorbidity. The included COVID-19 patients used ACEI, ARB, calcium channel blockers (CCB), beta blockers (BB), or thiazide to treat preexisting hypertension prior to the hospital were compared to patients who did not take any of those drugs. Methods In this multicentre retrospective study, clinical data of 511 COVID-19 patients were analyzed. Patients were categorized into six sub-groups of hypertension comorbidity based on treatment using one of anti-hypertension drugs (ACEI, ARB, CCB, BB, thiazide), or none. A meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the use of ACEI and ARB associated with pneumonia using published studies. Findings Among the elderly (age>65) COVID-19 patients with hypertension comorbidity, the risk of COVID-19-S (severe disease) was significantly decreased in patients who took ARB drugs prior to hospitalization compared to patients who took no drugs (OR=0.343, 95% CI 0.128-0.916, p=0.025). The meta-analysis showed that ARB use has positive effects associated with morbidity and mortality of pneumonia. Interpretation Elderly (age>65) COVID-19 patients with hypertension comorbidity who are taking ARB anti-hypertension drugs may be less likely to develop severe lung disease compared to patients who take no anti-hypertension drugs.

Updated analysis of cases might help identify the characteristic and risk factors of the illness severity. METHODS We extracted data regarding 47 patients with confirmed COVID-19 from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University between February 1 and February 18, 2020. The degree of severity of COVID-19 patients (severe vs. non-severe) was defined at the time of admission according to American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). RESULTS The median age was 64.91 years, 26 cases (55.31%) were male of which, and 70.83% were severe cases. Severe patients had higher APACHE II (9.92 vs 4.74) and SOFA (3.0 vs 1.0) scores on admission, as well as the higher PSI (86.13 vs 61.39), Curb-65 (1.14 vs 0.48) and CT semiquantitative scores (5.0 vs 2.0) when compared with non-severe patients. Among all univariable parameters, APACHE II, SOFA, lymphocytes, CRP, LDH, AST, cTnI, BNP, et al were significantly independent risk factors of COVID-19 severity. Among which, LDH was most positively related both with APACHE II (R = 0.682) and SOFA (R = 0.790) scores, as well as PSI (R = 0.465) and CT (R = 0.837) scores. To assess the diagnostic value of these selected parameters, LDH (0.9727) had maximum sensitivity (100.00%) and specificity (86.67%), with the cutoff value of 283. As a protective factor, lymphocyte counts less than 1.045 x 109 \/L showed a good accuracy for identification of severe patients with AUC = 0.9845 (95%CI 0.959-1.01), the maximum specificity (91.30%) and sensitivity (95.24%). In addition, LDH was positively correlated with CRP, AST, BNP and cTnI, while negatively correlated with lymphocyte cells and its subsets, including CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS This study showed that LDH coule be identified as a powerful predictive factor for early recognition of lung injury and severe COVID-19 cases. And importantly, lymphocyte counts, especially CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients, which was relevant with serum LDH, were also dynamically correlated with the severity of the disease.

Methods: In this clinical retrospective study, demographic data, laboratory parameters, AGI grades, clinical severity and outcomes were collected. The primary endpoints were AGI incidence and 28-day mortality, the secondary endpoints were organ dysfunction and septic shock incidence. Results: From February 10 to March 10 2020, 83 critically ill patients of 1314 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. Seventy-two (86.7%) patients had AGI during hospital stay, of them, 30 had AGI grade I, 35 had AGI grade II, 5 had AGI grade III, and 2 had AGI grade IV. The incidence of AGI grade II and above was 50.6%. As of March 16, 40 (48.2%) patients died within 28 days of admission, the median hospital stay was 12.0 days, ranging from 3 days to 27 days. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome developed in 58 (69.9%) patients, septic shock in 16 (19.3%) patients. Patients with worse AGI grades had worse clinical variables, higher septic shock incidence and 28-day mortality. Sequential organ failure assessment scores (SOFA) (95% CI, 1.374-2.860; P <0.001), white blood cell (WBC) counts (95% CI, 1.037-1.379; P =0.014), duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) (95% CI, 1.020-1.340; P =0.025) were risk factors for the development of AGI grade II and above. Non-survivors were accompanied by higher incidence of AGI grade III to IV than survivors (17.5% vs. 0.0%, P =0.004). Conclusions: The AGI incidence was 86.7%, and hospital mortality was 48.2% in critically ill patients with COVID-19. SOFA scores, WBC counts, and duration of MV were risk factors for the development of AGI grade II and above. Patients with worse AGI grades had worse clinical severity variables, higher septic shock incidence and 28-day mortality.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jia-Kui Sun","author_inst":"Nanjing First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Haidong Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Sucheng Mu","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Wei Wei","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Chaoyuan Jin","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yuan Xue","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Chaoyang Tong","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yunfei Zha","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhenju Song","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Zhongshan Hospital,Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Guorong Gu","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jingjun Lv","author_inst":"Emergency Departmen, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University 430060"},{"author_name":"Jie Wei","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University 430060"},{"author_name":"Tuxiu Xie","author_inst":"Department  of General Medicine , Guang-gu hospital affiliated Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University  430200"},{"author_name":"Hong Gao","author_inst":"Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Immunity, State Key Discipline of Infectious Disease, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Hospital Affiliated to So"},{"author_name":"Kai-Feng Xu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, 100730, China."},{"author_name":"Fusheng Wang","author_inst":"The Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Beijing 100039, P.

The model is then fitted to current data and implemented using Runge-Kutta methods. Our computation results predict that the number of new cases would peak around mid-April and begin to abate by July, and that the number of cases of COVID-19 might be significantly mitigated by having greater numbers of functional testing kits available for screening. The model also showed how small changes in variables can make large differences in outcomes and highlights the importance of healthcare preparedness during pandemics.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yao Yu Yeo","author_inst":"Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Yao-Rui Yeo","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Wan-Jin Yeo","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Wei Wei","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Chaoyuan Jin","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yuan Xue","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Chaoyang Tong","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yunfei Zha","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhenju Song","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Zhongshan Hospital,Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Guorong Gu","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jingjun Lv","author_inst":"Emergency Departmen, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University 430060"},{"author_name":"Jie Wei","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University 430060"},{"author_name":"Tuxiu Xie","author_inst":"Department  of General Medicine , Guang-gu hospital affiliated Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University  430200"},{"author_name":"Hong Gao","author_inst":"Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Immunity, State Key Discipline of Infectious Disease, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Hospital Affiliated to So"},{"author_name":"Kai-Feng Xu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, 100730, China."},{"author_name":"Fusheng Wang","author_inst":"The Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Beijing 100039, P.

However, there is a lack of epidemiological tools to guide effective public policy development. Here we present epidemiological evidence that SARS-CoV-2 S type exited Wuhan or other epicenters in China earlier than L type and conferred partial resistance to the virus on infected populations. Analysis of regional disparities in incidence has revealed that a sharp decline in influenza epidemics is a useful surrogate indicator for the undocumented spread of SARS-CoV-2. The biggest concern in the world is knowing when herd immunity has been achieved and scheduling a time to regain the living activities of each country. This study provides a useful tool to guide the development of local policies to contain the virus.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yasuhiko Kamikubo","author_inst":"Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University"},{"author_name":"Atsushi Takahashi","author_inst":"Kibi International University"},{"author_name":"Wan-Jin Yeo","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Wei Wei","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Chaoyuan Jin","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yuan Xue","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Chaoyang Tong","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yunfei Zha","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhenju Song","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Zhongshan Hospital,Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Guorong Gu","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jingjun Lv","author_inst":"Emergency Departmen, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University 430060"},{"author_name":"Jie Wei","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University 430060"},{"author_name":"Tuxiu Xie","author_inst":"Department  of General Medicine , Guang-gu hospital affiliated Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University  430200"},{"author_name":"Hong Gao","author_inst":"Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Immunity, State Key Discipline of Infectious Disease, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Hospital Affiliated to So"},{"author_name":"Kai-Feng Xu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, 100730, China."},{"author_name":"Fusheng Wang","author_inst":"The Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Beijing 100039, P.

This study aimed to assess the disease status of IBD patients in Hubei province by questionnaire online and guide to the self-management of IBD patients during this epidemic. Methods: A questionnaire was designed containing the Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI), the Partial Mayo Score (PMS), the short inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (SIBDQ) and distributed to Hubei IBD patients online within one month of traffic control after the outbreak of COVID-19. This questionnaire also included some questions about patients' self-report disease conditions and their epidemiological history of COVID-19. Results: A total of 102 eligible questionnaires were included in the analysis. No patient reported infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in our study. Our result showed that 69.64% of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 80.44% of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) were in remission. There was not a statistically significant difference in the proportion of the active disease stage between the two types of disease (p=0.103). The majority of patients (85.29%) had a good health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (SIBDQ[&ge;]50). The reduction in physical exercise is a risk factor for worsening in conditions (OR=17.593, 95%CI 2.035 to 152.097, p=0.009). Conclusions: The outbreak of COVID-19 might not have a significant impact on most Hubei IBD patients within one month after the traffic control. The patient's disease condition could be assessed by our questionnaires. Doctors utilized the information and advised for IBD patients about self-management during the period of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Meiping Yu","author_inst":"Department of Gastroenterology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, No. 1095 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430030, P"},{"author_name":"Zhenghao Ye","author_inst":"Department of Gastroenterology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, No. 1095 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430030, P"},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"Department of Gastroenterology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, No. 1095 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430030, P"},{"author_name":"Tingting Qin","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jiguang Kou","author_inst":"Department of Gastroenterology, Xiaogan Hospital Affiliated to Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Dean Tian","author_inst":"Department of Gastroenterology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Fang Xiao","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yunfei Zha","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhenju Song","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Zhongshan Hospital,Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Guorong Gu","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jingjun Lv","author_inst":"Emergency Departmen, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University 430060"},{"author_name":"Jie Wei","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University 430060"},{"author_name":"Tuxiu Xie","author_inst":"Department  of General Medicine , Guang-gu hospital affiliated Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University  430200"},{"author_name":"Hong Gao","author_inst":"Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Immunity, State Key Discipline of Infectious Disease, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Hospital Affiliated to So"},{"author_name":"Kai-Feng Xu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, 100730, China."},{"author_name":"Fusheng Wang","author_inst":"The Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Beijing 100039, P.

No studies have yet summarised the potential severity and mortality risks caused by COVID-19 in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and we update information in smokers. Methods: We systematically searched electronic databases from inception to March 24, 2020. Data were extracted by two independent authors in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. We synthesised a narrative from eligible studies and conducted a meta-analysis using a random-effects model to calculate pooled prevalence rates and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Results: In total, 123 abstracts were screened and 61 full-text manuscripts were reviewed. A total of 15 studies met the inclusion criteria, which included a total of 2473 confirmed COVID-19 patients. All studies were included in the meta-analysis. The crude case fatality rate of COVID-19 was 6.4%. The pooled prevalence rates of COPD patients and smokers in COVID-19 cases were 2% (95% CI, 1%-3%) and 9% (95% CI, 4%-14%) respectively. COPD patients were at a higher risk of more severe disease (risk of severity = 63%, (22\/35) compared to patients without COPD 33.4% (409\/1224) [calculated RR, 1.88 (95% CI, 1.4-2.4)]. This was associated with higher mortality (60%). Our results showed that 22% (31\/139) of current smokers and 46% (13\/28) of ex-smokers had severe complications. The calculated RR showed that current smokers were 1.45 times more likely [95% CI: 1.03-2.04] to have severe complications compared to former and never smokers. Current smokers also had a higher mortality rate of 38.5%. Conclusion: Although COPD prevalence in COVID-19 cases was low in current reports, COVID-19 infection was associated with substantial severity and mortality rates in COPD. Compared to former and never smokers, current smokers were at greater risk of severe complications and higher mortality rate. Effective preventive measures are required to reduce COVID-19 risk in COPD patients and current smokers.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jaber S Alqahtani","author_inst":"UCL Respiratory, University College London"},{"author_name":"Tope Oyelade","author_inst":"UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Abdulelah M Aldhahir","author_inst":"UCL Respiratory, University College London"},{"author_name":"Saeed M Alghamdi","author_inst":"National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Mater Almehmadi","author_inst":"UCL Institute for Risk and Disaster, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Abdullah S Alqahtani","author_inst":"Nottingham University"},{"author_name":"Shumonta Quaderi","author_inst":"UCL Respiratory, University College London"},{"author_name":"Swapna Mandal","author_inst":"Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"John Hurst","author_inst":"UCL Respiratory, University College London"},{"author_name":"Guorong Gu","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jingjun Lv","author_inst":"Emergency Departmen, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University 430060"},{"author_name":"Jie Wei","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University 430060"},{"author_name":"Tuxiu Xie","author_inst":"Department  of General Medicine , Guang-gu hospital affiliated Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University  430200"},{"author_name":"Hong Gao","author_inst":"Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Immunity, State Key Discipline of Infectious Disease, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Hospital Affiliated to So"},{"author_name":"Kai-Feng Xu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, 100730, China."},{"author_name":"Fusheng Wang","author_inst":"The Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Beijing 100039, P.

In the absence of wide-spread testing, we provide one approach to infer prevalence based on the assumption that the fraction of true infections needing hospitalization is fixed and that all hospitalized cases of COVID-19 in Santa Clara are identified. Our goal is to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections, i.e. the true number of people currently infected with the virus, divided by the total population size. Our analysis suggests that as of March 17, 2020, there are 6,500 infections (0.34% of the population) of SARS-CoV-2 in Santa Clara County. Based on adjusting the parameters of our model to be optimistic (respectively pessimistic), the number of infections would be 1,400 (resp. 26,000), corresponding to a prevalence of 0.08% (resp. 1.36%). If the shelter-in-place led to R0 < 1, we would expect the number of infections to remain about constant for the next few weeks. However, even if this were true, we expect to continue to see an increase in hospitalized cases of COVID-19 in the short term due to the fact that infection of SARS-CoV-2 on March 17th can lead to hospitalizations up to 14 days later.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Steve Yadlowsky","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Nigam Shah","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jacob Steinhardt","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Saeed M Alghamdi","author_inst":"National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Mater Almehmadi","author_inst":"UCL Institute for Risk and Disaster, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Abdullah S Alqahtani","author_inst":"Nottingham University"},{"author_name":"Shumonta Quaderi","author_inst":"UCL Respiratory, University College London"},{"author_name":"Swapna Mandal","author_inst":"Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"John Hurst","author_inst":"UCL Respiratory, University College London"},{"author_name":"Guorong Gu","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jingjun Lv","author_inst":"Emergency Departmen, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University 430060"},{"author_name":"Jie Wei","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University 430060"},{"author_name":"Tuxiu Xie","author_inst":"Department  of General Medicine , Guang-gu hospital affiliated Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University  430200"},{"author_name":"Hong Gao","author_inst":"Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Immunity, State Key Discipline of Infectious Disease, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Hospital Affiliated to So"},{"author_name":"Kai-Feng Xu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, 100730, China."},{"author_name":"Fusheng Wang","author_inst":"The Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Beijing 100039, P.

Age disparities in observed cases could be explained by children having lower susceptibility to infection, lower propensity to show clinical symptoms, or both. We evaluate these possibilities by fitting an age-structured mathematical model to epidemic data from six countries. We estimate that clinical symptoms occur in 25% (95% CrI: 19-32%) of infections in 10-19-year-olds, rising to 76% (68-82%) in over-70s, and that susceptibility to infection in under-20s is approximately half that of older adults. Accordingly, we find that interventions aimed at children may have a relatively small impact on total cases, particularly if the transmissibility of subclinical infections is low. The age-specific clinical fraction and susceptibility we have estimated has implications for the expected global burden of COVID-19 because of demographic differences across settings: in younger populations, the expected clinical attack rate would be lower, although it is likely that comorbidities in low-income countries will affect disease severity. Without effective control measures, regions with older populations may see disproportionally more clinical cases, particularly in the later stages of the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicholas G Davies","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Petra Klepac","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yang Liu","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kiesha Prem","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark Jit","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"CMMID COVID-19 working group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Swapna Mandal","author_inst":"Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"John Hurst","author_inst":"UCL Respiratory, University College London"},{"author_name":"Guorong Gu","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jingjun Lv","author_inst":"Emergency Departmen, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University 430060"},{"author_name":"Jie Wei","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University 430060"},{"author_name":"Tuxiu Xie","author_inst":"Department  of General Medicine , Guang-gu hospital affiliated Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University  430200"},{"author_name":"Hong Gao","author_inst":"Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Immunity, State Key Discipline of Infectious Disease, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Hospital Affiliated to So"},{"author_name":"Kai-Feng Xu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, 100730, China."},{"author_name":"Fusheng Wang","author_inst":"The Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Beijing 100039, P.

This study sought to elucidate a novel predictor of disease severity in patients with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) cased by SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Patients enrolled in this study were all hospitalized with COVID-19 in the Central Hospital of Wuhan, China. Clinical features, chronic comorbidities, demographic data, and laboratory and radiological data were reviewed. The outcomes of patients with severe pneumonia and those with non-severe pneumonia were compared using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) to explore clinical characteristics and risk factors. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to screen optimal predictors from the risk factors and the predictive power was verified by internal validation. Results: A total of 377 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were enrolled in this study, including 117 with severe pneumonia and 260 with non-severe pneumonia. The independent risk factors for severe pneumonia were age [odds ratio (OR): 1.059, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.036-1.082; p < 0.001], N\/L (OR: 1.322, 95% CI: 1.180-1.481; p < 0.001), CRP (OR: 1.231, 95% CI: 1.129-1.341; p = 0.002), and D-dimer (OR: 1.059, 95% CI: 1.013-1.107; p = 0.011). We identified a product of N\/L*CRP*D-dimer as having an important predictive value for the severity of COVID-19. The cutoff value was 5.32. The negative predictive value of less than 5.32 for the N\/L*CRP*D-dimer was 93.75%, while the positive predictive value was 46.03% in the test sets. The sensitivity and specificity were 89.47% and 67.42%. In the training sets, the negative and positive predictive values were 93.80% and 41.32%, respectively, with a specificity of 70.76% and a sensitivity of 89.87%. Conclusions: A product of N\/L*CRP*D-dimer may be an important predictor of disease severity in patients with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ying Zhou","author_inst":"The Central Hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Zhen Yang","author_inst":"The Central Hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Yanan Guo","author_inst":"The Central Hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Shuang Geng","author_inst":"The Central Hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Shan Gao","author_inst":"The Central Hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Shenglan Ye","author_inst":"The Central Hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Yi Hu","author_inst":"The Central Hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Yafei Wang","author_inst":"The Central Hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"John Hurst","author_inst":"UCL Respiratory, University College London"},{"author_name":"Guorong Gu","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jingjun Lv","author_inst":"Emergency Departmen, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University 430060"},{"author_name":"Jie Wei","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University 430060"},{"author_name":"Tuxiu Xie","author_inst":"Department  of General Medicine , Guang-gu hospital affiliated Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University  430200"},{"author_name":"Hong Gao","author_inst":"Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Immunity, State Key Discipline of Infectious Disease, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Hospital Affiliated to So"},{"author_name":"Kai-Feng Xu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, 100730, China."},{"author_name":"Fusheng Wang","author_inst":"The Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Beijing 100039, P.

Methods This is a cross-sectional study with an online checklist on voluntary cases in all provinces of Iran between the 12th and 17th March, 2020. Cases was defined as self-reported anosmia\/hyposmia in responders fewer than 4 weeks later (from start the of COVID-19 epidemic in Iran). Variables consist of clinical presentations, related past medical history, family history of recent respiratory tract infection and hospitalization. Results In this study 10069 participants aged 32.5 +\/- 8.6 (7-78) years, 71.13% female and 81.68% non-smoker completed online checklist. They reported 10.55% a history of a trip out of home town and 1.1% hospitalization due to respiratory problems recently. From family members 12.17% had a history of severe respiratory disease in recent days and 48.23% had anosmia\/hyposmia. Correlation between the number of olfactory disorder and reported COVID-19 patients in all 31 provinces till 16th March 2020 was highly significant (Spearman correlation coefficient=0.87, p-Value<0.001). The onset of anosmia was sudden in 76.24% and till the time of filling the questionnaire in 60.90% of patients decreased sense of smell was constant. Also 83.38 of this patients had decreased taste sensation in association with anosmia. Conclusions It seems that we have a surge in outbreak of olfactory dysfunction happened in Iran during the COVID-19 epidemic. The exact mechanism of anosmia\/hyposmia in COVID-19 patients needs further investigations.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Seyed Hamid Reza Bagheri","author_inst":"ENT and Head & Neck Research center and department, The five senses Institute, Iran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ali Mohammad Asghari","author_inst":"Skull base research center, The five senses institute, Iran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Farhadi","author_inst":"ENT and Head & Neck Research center and department, The five senses Institute, Iran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ahmad Reza Shamshiri","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ali Kabir","author_inst":"Minimally Invasive Surgery Research Center, Iran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Seyed Kamran Kamrava","author_inst":"ENT and Head & Neck Research center and department, The five senses Institute, Iran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Maryam Jalessi","author_inst":"Skull base research center, The five senses institute, Iran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Alireza Mohebbi","author_inst":"ENT and Head & Neck Research center and department, The five senses Institute, Iran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Rafieh Alizadeh","author_inst":"ENT and Head & Neck Research center and department, The five senses Institute, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran"},{"author_name":"Ali Asghar Honarmand","author_inst":"Electronic learning Committee, Iran Medical Council"},{"author_name":"Babak Ghalehbaghi","author_inst":"Iran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Alireza Salimi","author_inst":"Department of anesthesiology, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Tuxiu Xie","author_inst":"Department  of General Medicine , Guang-gu hospital affiliated Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University  430200"},{"author_name":"Hong Gao","author_inst":"Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Immunity, State Key Discipline of Infectious Disease, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Hospital Affiliated to So"},{"author_name":"Kai-Feng Xu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, 100730, China."},{"author_name":"Fusheng Wang","author_inst":"The Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Beijing 100039, P.

When researchers share data, code, and software and generally make their work as transparent as possible, it allows other researchers to verify and expand upon their work. Furthermore, it allows public officials to make informed decisions. In this study, we analyzed 535 preprint articles related to COVID-19 for eight transparency criteria and recorded study location and funding information. We found that individual researchers have lined up to help during this crisis, quickly tackling important public health questions, often without funding or support from outside organizations. However, most authors could improve their data sharing and scientific reporting practices. The contrast between the commitment of researchers to doing important research and their reporting practices reveals underlying weaknesses in reporting habits, but not necessarily their science.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Josh Q Sumner","author_inst":"Ripeta, LLC"},{"author_name":"Leah Haynes","author_inst":"Ripeta, LLC"},{"author_name":"Sarah Nathan","author_inst":"Ripeta, LLC"},{"author_name":"Cynthia Hudson-Vitale","author_inst":"Ripeta, LLC"},{"author_name":"Leslie D McIntosh","author_inst":"Ripeta"},{"author_name":"Seyed Kamran Kamrava","author_inst":"ENT and Head & Neck Research center and department, The five senses Institute, Iran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Maryam Jalessi","author_inst":"Skull base research center, The five senses institute, Iran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Alireza Mohebbi","author_inst":"ENT and Head & Neck Research center and department, The five senses Institute, Iran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Rafieh Alizadeh","author_inst":"ENT and Head & Neck Research center and department, The five senses Institute, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran"},{"author_name":"Ali Asghar Honarmand","author_inst":"Electronic learning Committee, Iran Medical Council"},{"author_name":"Babak Ghalehbaghi","author_inst":"Iran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Alireza Salimi","author_inst":"Department of anesthesiology, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Tuxiu Xie","author_inst":"Department  of General Medicine , Guang-gu hospital affiliated Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University  430200"},{"author_name":"Hong Gao","author_inst":"Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Immunity, State Key Discipline of Infectious Disease, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Hospital Affiliated to So"},{"author_name":"Kai-Feng Xu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, 100730, China."},{"author_name":"Fusheng Wang","author_inst":"The Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Beijing 100039, P.

Here we show that it is possible to predict when the intensive care units will saturate, within a few days from the first cases of COVID-19 intensive care patients. Using early counts of intensive care patients, we predict the saturation for Lombardy, Italy.

Methods: A preliminary list of outcomes were developed after a systematic review of protocols of clinical trials for COVID-19. Then, two rounds of the Delphi survey were conducted. Stakeholders were traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) experts, Western medicine (WM) experts, nurses and the public. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 were also invited to participate in a questionnaire written in understandable language. Frontline clinicians, as well as nurse, methodologist, evidence based-medicine researcher, and staff from the Chinese Clinical Trials Registry participated by video conference to vote. Results: Ninety-seven eligible study protocols were identified from 160 clinical trials. Seventy-six outcomes were identified from TCM clinical trials and 126 outcomes were identified from WM clinical trials. Finally, 145 outcomes were included in the first round of the Delphi survey. Then, a COS for clinical trials of TCM and WM was developed. The COS include clinical outcomes (recovery\/improvement\/progression\/death), etiology (SARS-CoV-2 nucleic-acid tests, viral load), inflammatory factor (C-reactive protein), vital signs (temperature, respiration), blood and lymphatic-system parameters (lymphocytes, virus antibody), respiratory outcomes (Pulmonary imaging, blood oxygen saturation, PaO2\/FiO2 ratio, arterial blood gas analysis, mechanical ventilation, oxygen intake, pneumonia severity index), clinical efficacy (prevalence of preventing patients with mild-to-moderate disease progressing to severe disease), symptoms (clinical symptom score). Outcomes were recommended according to different types of disease. Outcome measurement instrument\/definition were also recommended.

Though diagnostic tests are fundamental to the ability to detect and respond, many health systems are already experiencing shortages of reagents associated with this test. Here, testing a pooling approach for the standard RT-qPCR test, we find that a single positive sample can be detected even in pools of up to 32 samples, with an estimated false negative rate of 10%. Detection of positive samples diluted in even up to 64 samples may also be attainable, though may require additional amplification cycles. As it uses the standard protocols, reagents and equipment, this pooling method can be applied immediately in current clinical testing laboratories. We hope that such implementation of a pool test for COVID-19 would allow expanding current screening capacities thereby enabling the expansion of detection in the community, as well as in close integral groups, such as hospital departments, army units, or factory shifts.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Idan Yelin","author_inst":"Technion - Israel Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Noga Aharony","author_inst":"Technion - Israel Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Einat Shaer-Tamar","author_inst":"Technion - Israel Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Amir Argoetti","author_inst":"Technion - Israel Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Esther Messer","author_inst":"Technion - Israel Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Dina Berenbaum","author_inst":"Technion - Israel Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Einat Shafran","author_inst":"Rambam Health Care Campus"},{"author_name":"Areen Kuzli","author_inst":"Rambam Health Care Campus"},{"author_name":"Nagam Gandali","author_inst":"Rambam Health Care Campus"},{"author_name":"Tamar Hashimshony","author_inst":"Technion - Israel Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Yael Mandel-Gutfreund","author_inst":"Technion - Israel Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Michael Halberthal","author_inst":"Rambam Health Care Campus"},{"author_name":"Yuval Geffen","author_inst":"Rambam Health Care Campus"},{"author_name":"Moran Szwarcwort-Cohen","author_inst":"Rambam Health Care Campus"},{"author_name":"Roy Kishony","author_inst":"Technion - Israel Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Hongcai Shang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Chinese Internal Medicine of Ministry of Education and Beijing, Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine."},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Immunity, State Key Discipline of Infectious Disease, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Hospital Affiliated to So"},{"author_name":"Chengyu Jiang","author_inst":"Institute of Basic Medical Science Chinese Academy of Medical Science"},{"author_name":"Hiroaki Matsunami","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Darren W.

Up until March 23, 2020, the confirmed cases in 173 countries and regions of the globe had surpassed 354,000, and more than 15,300 deaths had resulted. The confirmed cases outside of China had also reached over 81,000, with over 3,200 deaths. In this study, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was proposed to analyze and predict the number of confirmed cases. Several cities with the most confirmed cases in China were the focus of this study, and a COVID-19 forecasting model, based on the CNN deep neural network method, was proposed. To compare the overall efficacies of different algorithms, the indicators of mean absolute error and root mean square error were applied in the experiment of this study. The experiment results indicated that compared with other deep learning methods, the CNN model proposed in this study has the greatest prediction efficacy. The feasibility and practicality of the model in predicting the cumulative number of COVID-19 confirmed cases were also verified in this study.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chiou-Jye Huang","author_inst":"Jiangxi University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yung-Hsiang Chen","author_inst":"National Pingtung University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yuxuan Ma","author_inst":"Jiangxi University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Ping-Huan Kuo","author_inst":"National Pingtung University"},{"author_name":"Esther Messer","author_inst":"Technion - Israel Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Dina Berenbaum","author_inst":"Technion - Israel Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Einat Shafran","author_inst":"Rambam Health Care Campus"},{"author_name":"Areen Kuzli","author_inst":"Rambam Health Care Campus"},{"author_name":"Nagam Gandali","author_inst":"Rambam Health Care Campus"},{"author_name":"Tamar Hashimshony","author_inst":"Technion - Israel Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Yael Mandel-Gutfreund","author_inst":"Technion - Israel Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Michael Halberthal","author_inst":"Rambam Health Care Campus"},{"author_name":"Yuval Geffen","author_inst":"Rambam Health Care Campus"},{"author_name":"Moran Szwarcwort-Cohen","author_inst":"Rambam Health Care Campus"},{"author_name":"Roy Kishony","author_inst":"Technion - Israel Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Hongcai Shang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Chinese Internal Medicine of Ministry of Education and Beijing, Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine."},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Immunity, State Key Discipline of Infectious Disease, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Hospital Affiliated to So"},{"author_name":"Chengyu Jiang","author_inst":"Institute of Basic Medical Science Chinese Academy of Medical Science"},{"author_name":"Hiroaki Matsunami","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Darren W.

There is limited evidence on the mortality risk effect of pre-existing comorbidities for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has important implications for early treatment. Objective: Evaluate the risk of pre-existing comorbidities on COVID-19 mortality, and provide clinical suggestions accordingly. Method: This study used a nested case-control design. A total of 94 publicly reported deaths in locations outside of Hubei Province, China, between December 18th, 2019 and March 8th, 2020 were included as cases. Each case was matched with up to three controls, based on gender and age (94 cases and 181 controls). The inverse-probability-weighted Cox proportional hazard model was performed. Results: History of comorbidities significantly increased the death risk of COVID-19: one additional pre-existing comorbidity led to an estimated 40% higher risk of death (p<0.001). The estimated mortality risk in patients with CHD was three times of those without CHD (p<0.001). The estimated 30-day survival probability for a profile patient with pre-existing CHD (65-year-old female with no other comorbidities) was 0.53 (95% CI [0.34-0.82]), while it was 0.85 (95% CI [0.79-0.91]) for those without CHD. Older age was also associated with increased death risk: every 5-year increase in age was associated with a 20% increased risk of mortality (p<0.001). Conclusion: Extra care and early medical intervention are needed for patients with pre-existing comorbidities, especially CHD.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tian Gu","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Qiao Chu","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Zhangsheng Yu","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Botao Fa","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Anqi Li","author_inst":"East China Normal University"},{"author_name":"Lei Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai Chest Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Ruijun Wu","author_inst":"East China Normal University"},{"author_name":"Yaping He","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nagam Gandali","author_inst":"Rambam Health Care Campus"},{"author_name":"Tamar Hashimshony","author_inst":"Technion - Israel Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Yael Mandel-Gutfreund","author_inst":"Technion - Israel Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Michael Halberthal","author_inst":"Rambam Health Care Campus"},{"author_name":"Yuval Geffen","author_inst":"Rambam Health Care Campus"},{"author_name":"Moran Szwarcwort-Cohen","author_inst":"Rambam Health Care Campus"},{"author_name":"Roy Kishony","author_inst":"Technion - Israel Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Hongcai Shang","author_inst":"Key Laboratory of Chinese Internal Medicine of Ministry of Education and Beijing, Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine."},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Immunity, State Key Discipline of Infectious Disease, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Hospital Affiliated to So"},{"author_name":"Chengyu Jiang","author_inst":"Institute of Basic Medical Science Chinese Academy of Medical Science"},{"author_name":"Hiroaki Matsunami","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Darren W.
