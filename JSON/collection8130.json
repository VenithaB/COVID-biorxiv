No specific treatment has been established against coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) so far. Therefore, it is urgently needed to identify effective antiviral agents for the treatment of this disease, and several approved drugs such as lopinavir have been evaluated. Here, we report that nelfinavir, an HIV-1 protease inhibitor, potently inhibits replication of SARS-CoV-2. The effective concentrations for 50% and 90% inhibition (EC50 and EC90) of nelfinavir were 1.13 {micro}M and 1.76 {micro}M respectively, the lowest of the nine HIV-1 protease inhibitors including lopinavir. The trough and peak serum concentrations of nelfinavir were three to six times higher than EC50 of this drug. These results suggest that nelfinavir is a potential candidate drug for the treatment of COVID-19 and should be assessed in patients with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Norio Yamamoto","author_inst":"Tokai University"},{"author_name":"Shutoku Matsuyama","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Tyuji Hoshino","author_inst":"Chiba University"},{"author_name":"Naoki Yamamoto","author_inst":"Tokyo Medical and Dental University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.06.20054320","rel_title":"Derivation of the effective reproduction number R for COVID-19 in relation to mobility restrictions and confinement","rel_date":"2020-04-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.06.20054320","rel_abs":"The spread of COVID-19 is posing an unprecedented threat to health systems worldwide[1]. The fast propagation of the disease combined with the existence of covert contagions by asymptomatic individuals make the controlling of this disease particularly challenging. The key parameter to track the progression of the epidemics is the effective reproduction number R, defined as the number of secondary infections generated by an infected individual[2]. The suppression of the epidemics is directly related to this value, and is attained when R<1.Here, we find an analytical expression for R as a function of mobility restrictions and confinement measures, using an epidemic model tailored for COVID-19. This expression for R is an extremely useful tool to design containment policies that are able to suppress the epidemics. We applied our epidemic model for the case of Spain, successfully forecasting both the observed incidence in each region and the overload of the health system. The expression for R allowed us to determine the precise reduction of mobility kappa_0 needed to bend the curve of epidemic incidence, which turned out to be kappa_0 {approx} 0.7. This value, for the case of Spain, translates to a total lockdown with the exception of the mobility associated to essential services, a policy that was finally enforced on March 28.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alex Arenas","author_inst":"Universitat Rovira i Virgili"},{"author_name":"Wesley Cota","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Vicosa"},{"author_name":"Jesus Gomez-Gardenes","author_inst":"Universidad de Zaragoza"},{"author_name":"Sergio Gomez","author_inst":"Universitat Rovira i Virgili"},{"author_name":"Clara Granell","author_inst":"Universidad de Zaragoza"},{"author_name":"Joan T.

Methods: By reinterpreting the data in the article \"Diagnostic Value of Combined Detection of Serum 2019 novel coronavirus IgM and IgG Antibodies in novel coronavirusin Infection\", the positive likelihood ratio of IgM and IgG antibody in diagnosis of COVID-19 (nucleic acid positive patients) was calculated, and the posterior probability of IgM and IgG antibodies and their tandem detection to diagnose was finally calculated. Results: The positive likelihood ratios of single IgM and IgG antibody were 18.50 and 12.65 respectively, and the posterior probabilities were 90.18% and 86.26% respectively. However, the posterior probability of the two antibodies tandem detection is 99.15%, which can give clinicians quantitative confidence in the diagnosis of COVID-19 from suspected cases. According to the results of this study, combining the advantages and disadvantages of nucleic acid detection and antibody detection, the clinical pathway for clinicians to diagnose COVID-19 is found. Conclusion: For suspected cases, IgM and IgG antibody tests should be firstly done at the same time. If the antibody tests are all positive, COVID-19 can be confirmed. If not, nucleic acid detection (one or more times) is performed, and in extreme cases, high-throughput viral genome sequencing is performed.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Feng Yangchun","author_inst":"Xinjiang Medical University"},{"author_name":"Catherine Dempsey","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Cork University Hospital, Wilton, Cork, Ireland"},{"author_name":"John MacSharry","author_inst":"Schools of Microbiology and Medicine, APC Microbiome Ireland , University College Cork"},{"author_name":"Conor P Hogan","author_inst":"Eli Lilly Kinsale Ltd, Kinsale, Co.

Exponential spread can be slowed by social distancing and population-wide isolation measures, but those place a tremendous burden on society, and, once lifted, exponential spread can re-emerge. Regular population-scale testing, combined with contact tracing and case isolation, should help break the cycle of transmission, but current detection strategies are not capable of such large-scale processing. Here we present a protocol for LAMP-Seq, a barcoded Reverse-Transcription Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) method that is highly scalable. Individual samples are stabilized, inactivated, and amplified in three isothermal heat steps, generating barcoded amplicons that can be pooled and analyzed en masse by sequencing. Using unique barcode combinations per sample from a compressed barcode space enables extensive pooling, potentially further reducing cost and simplifying logistics. We validated LAMP-Seq on 28 clinical samples, empirically optimized the protocol and barcode design, and performed initial safety evaluation. Relying on world-wide infrastructure for next-generation sequencing, and in the context of population-wide sample collection, LAMP-Seq could be scaled to analyze millions of samples per day.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jonathan L Schmid-Burgk","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard; Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ricarda Maria Schmithausen","author_inst":"University Hospital Bonn"},{"author_name":"David Li","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Ronja Hollstein","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Amir Ben-Shmuel","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Israel Institute for Biological Research, Ness Ziona, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ofir Israeli","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Israel Institute for Biological Research, Ness Ziona, Israel"},{"author_name":"Shay Weiss","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Israel Institute for Biological Research, Ness Ziona, Israel"},{"author_name":"Nir Paran","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Israel Institute for Biological Research, Ness Ziona, Israel"},{"author_name":"Gero Wilbring","author_inst":"Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jana Liebing","author_inst":"Institute for Experimental Oncology, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"David Feldman","author_inst":"Institute for Protein Design, University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Mikolaj Slabicki","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Baerbel Lippke","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Esther Sib","author_inst":"Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jacob Borrajo","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Strecker","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Julia Reinhardt","author_inst":"Institute for Experimental Oncology, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Per Hoffmann","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany and Genomics Research Group, Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel, Switzerl"},{"author_name":"Brian Cleary","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Michael Hoelzel","author_inst":"Institute for Experimental Oncology, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Markus M Noethen","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Martin Exner","author_inst":"Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Kerstin U Ludwig","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Aviv Regev","author_inst":"MIT and Broad Inst. of MIT &  Harvard"},{"author_name":"Feng Zhang","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard; McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"molecular biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.03.20052563","rel_title":"Interaction between malarial transmission and BCG vaccination with COVID-19 incidence in the world map: A changing landscape human immune system?","rel_date":"2020-04-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.03.20052563","rel_abs":"Background: COVID-19 (Corona virus Disease-2019) is a new public health emergency and is a pandemic currently. Incidence and mortality of COVID-19 vary in different geographical areas. In this study we aimed to analyse the relationship between malaria transmission and BCG vaccination with COVID-19 incidence in the world map. Materials and methods: We collected malaria cases data (World Health Organisation (WHO), 2018), worldwide COVID-19 cases and mortality data (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) and data on BCG vaccination. COVID-19 incidence and mortality was compared. Findings: Data on 5316978938 persons from 166 countries were analysed. Malaria incidence rate was negatively correlated with COVID-19 incidence rate (correlation coefficient = -0.513, p<0.001). Malaria free countries had significantly higher number of COVID-19 cases compared to malaria endemic countries. In Europe and Americas, countries, which have higher BCG vaccination coverage, had significantly less mortality per thousand population compared to those with low BCG coverage (median 0.0002 (0-0.0005) vs 0.0029 (0.0002-0.0177), p=0.017). The case fatality ratio of COVID-19 was related nonlinearly to the malaria incidence. Conclusions: The results suggest the changing human immune system as we progress to eliminate parasitic diseases with time. Chloroquine exposure in malaria endemic zones might have a protective effect.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rudra Prosad Goswami","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Dheeraj K Mittal","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Rama Prosad Goswami","author_inst":"School of Tropical Medicine, Kolkata, India"},{"author_name":"Ronja Hollstein","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Amir Ben-Shmuel","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Israel Institute for Biological Research, Ness Ziona, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ofir Israeli","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Israel Institute for Biological Research, Ness Ziona, Israel"},{"author_name":"Shay Weiss","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Israel Institute for Biological Research, Ness Ziona, Israel"},{"author_name":"Nir Paran","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Israel Institute for Biological Research, Ness Ziona, Israel"},{"author_name":"Gero Wilbring","author_inst":"Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jana Liebing","author_inst":"Institute for Experimental Oncology, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"David Feldman","author_inst":"Institute for Protein Design, University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Mikolaj Slabicki","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Baerbel Lippke","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Esther Sib","author_inst":"Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jacob Borrajo","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Strecker","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Julia Reinhardt","author_inst":"Institute for Experimental Oncology, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Per Hoffmann","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany and Genomics Research Group, Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel, Switzerl"},{"author_name":"Brian Cleary","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Michael Hoelzel","author_inst":"Institute for Experimental Oncology, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Markus M Noethen","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Martin Exner","author_inst":"Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Kerstin U Ludwig","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Aviv Regev","author_inst":"MIT and Broad Inst. of MIT &  Harvard"},{"author_name":"Feng Zhang","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard; McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.06.026765","rel_title":"Noisy Pooled PCR for Virus Testing","rel_date":"2020-04-08","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.06.026765","rel_abs":"Fast testing can help mitigate the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

We develop a scalable approach for determining the viral status of pooled patient samples. Our approach converts group testing to a linear inverse problem, where false positives and negatives are interpreted as generated by a noisy communication channel, and a message passing algorithm estimates the illness status of patients. Numerical results reveal that our approach estimates patient illness using fewer pooled measurements than existing noisy group testing algorithms. Our approach can easily be extended to various applications, including where false negatives must be minimized.

With many PCR-based molecular assays, an extraction step is routinely used as part of the protocol. This step can take up a significant amount of time and labor, especially if the extraction is performed manually. Long assay time, partly caused by slow sample preparation steps, has created a large backlog when testing patient samples suspected of COVID-19. Using flu and RSV clinical specimens, we have collected evidence that the RT-qPCR assay can be performed directly on patient sample material from a nasal swab immersed in virus transport medium (VTM) without an RNA extraction step. We have also used this approach to test for the direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 reference materials spiked in VTM. Our data, while preliminary, suggest that using a few microliters of these untreated samples still can lead to sensitive test results. If RNA extraction steps can be omitted without significantly affecting clinical sensitivity, the turn-around time of COVID-19 tests and the backlog we currently experience can be reduced drastically. Next, we will confirm our findings using patient samples.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arunkumar Arumugam","author_inst":"AI Biosciences, Inc."},{"author_name":"Season S Wong","author_inst":"AI Biosciences, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jindrich Cinati","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Virology, University Hospital Frankfurt, Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ellen Van Damme","author_inst":"Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, Beerse, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Christophe Buyck","author_inst":"Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, Beerse, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Marnix Van Loock","author_inst":"Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, Beerse, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Brian Woodfall","author_inst":"Janssen Biopharma Inc, South San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Sandra Ciesek","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Virology, University Hospital Frankfurt, Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany; German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), Frankf"},{"author_name":"Gero Wilbring","author_inst":"Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jana Liebing","author_inst":"Institute for Experimental Oncology, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"David Feldman","author_inst":"Institute for Protein Design, University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Mikolaj Slabicki","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Baerbel Lippke","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Esther Sib","author_inst":"Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jacob Borrajo","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Strecker","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Julia Reinhardt","author_inst":"Institute for Experimental Oncology, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Per Hoffmann","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany and Genomics Research Group, Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel, Switzerl"},{"author_name":"Brian Cleary","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Michael Hoelzel","author_inst":"Institute for Experimental Oncology, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Markus M Noethen","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Martin Exner","author_inst":"Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Kerstin U Ludwig","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Aviv Regev","author_inst":"MIT and Broad Inst. of MIT &  Harvard"},{"author_name":"Feng Zhang","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard; McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"molecular biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.03.20052530","rel_title":"Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19: A living systematic review protocol","rel_date":"2020-04-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.03.20052530","rel_abs":"OBJECTIVE: To determine the relative impact of the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine on outcomes important to patients with COVID 19. DESIGN: This is the protocol of a living systematic review. DATA SOURCES: We will conduct searches in PubMed\/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), trial registries, grey literature and in a centralised repository in L-OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence). L-OVE is a platform that maps PICO questions to evidence from Epistemonikos database. In response to the COVID-19 emergency, L-OVE was adapted to expand the range of evidence it covers and customised to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place. The search will cover the period until the day before submission to a journal. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES AND METHODS: We will follow a common protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews, already published and submitted to PROSPERO (awaiting ID allocation). We will include randomised controlled trials evaluating the effect of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine - as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs - versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. Randomised trials evaluating chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in infections caused by other coronaviruses, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and non-randomised studies in COVID-19 will be searched in case no direct evidence from randomised trials is found, or if the direct evidence provides low- or very low-certainty for critical outcomes. Two reviewers will independently screen each study for eligibility, extract data, and assess the risk of bias. We will perform random-effects meta-analyses and use GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will resubmit it if the conclusions change or there are substantial updates. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: No ethics approval is considered necessary. The results of this review will be widely disseminated via peer-reviewed publications, social networks and traditional media.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rocio Bravo Jeria","author_inst":"UC Evidence Center, Cochrane Chile Associated Center, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile"},{"author_name":"Maria X Rojas Reyes","author_inst":"Department of Research, Fundacion Cardioinfantil, Bogota, Colombia"},{"author_name":"Juan V Franco","author_inst":"Department of Research, Instituto Universitario Hospital Italiano, Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Maria P Acuna","author_inst":"Unidad de Infectologia, Hospital Dr Sotero del Rio, Santiago, Chile; Unidad de Infectologia, Hospital Clinico Dra Eloisa Diaz, La Florida, Santiago, Chile"},{"author_name":"Luz A Torres Lopez","author_inst":"Department of Research, Fundacion Cardioinfantil, Bogota, Colombia"},{"author_name":"Gabriel rada Rada","author_inst":"Fundacion Epistemonikos"},{"author_name":"COVID-19 L-OVE Working Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Sandra Ciesek","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Virology, University Hospital Frankfurt, Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany; German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), Frankf"},{"author_name":"Gero Wilbring","author_inst":"Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jana Liebing","author_inst":"Institute for Experimental Oncology, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"David Feldman","author_inst":"Institute for Protein Design, University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Mikolaj Slabicki","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Baerbel Lippke","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Esther Sib","author_inst":"Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jacob Borrajo","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Strecker","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Julia Reinhardt","author_inst":"Institute for Experimental Oncology, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Per Hoffmann","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany and Genomics Research Group, Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel, Switzerl"},{"author_name":"Brian Cleary","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Michael Hoelzel","author_inst":"Institute for Experimental Oncology, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Markus M Noethen","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Martin Exner","author_inst":"Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Kerstin U Ludwig","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Aviv Regev","author_inst":"MIT and Broad Inst. of MIT &  Harvard"},{"author_name":"Feng Zhang","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard; McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.05.026450","rel_title":"Genomic determinants of pathogenicity in SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronaviruses","rel_date":"2020-04-08","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.05.026450","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 poses an immediate, major threat to public health across the globe.

Notwithstanding, our model predicts that the current measures are not enough to avoid overloading the health system, since the demand for intensive care units will soon surpass the number available. We also show that an urgent intense quarantine might be the only solution to avoid this scenario and, consequently, minimize the number of severe cases and deaths. On the other hand, we demonstrate that the early relaxation of the undergoing isolation measures would lead to an increase of millions of infections in a short period of time and the consecutive collapse of the health system.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Askery Canabarro","author_inst":"International Institute of Physics-UFRN\/Federal University of Alagoas-UFAL"},{"author_name":"Elayne Tenorio","author_inst":"Hospital Santa Casa de Misericordia de Maceio"},{"author_name":"Renato Martins","author_inst":"HIV\/AIDS  Testing  and  Counseling  Center"},{"author_name":"Lais Martins","author_inst":"Superior School of Health Science"},{"author_name":"Samurai Brito","author_inst":"International Institute of Physics - UFRN"},{"author_name":"Rafael Chaves","author_inst":"International  Institute  of  Physics and School  of  Science  and  Technology - UFRN"},{"author_name":"COVID-19 L-OVE Working Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Sandra Ciesek","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Virology, University Hospital Frankfurt, Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany; German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), Frankf"},{"author_name":"Gero Wilbring","author_inst":"Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jana Liebing","author_inst":"Institute for Experimental Oncology, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"David Feldman","author_inst":"Institute for Protein Design, University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Mikolaj Slabicki","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Baerbel Lippke","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Esther Sib","author_inst":"Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jacob Borrajo","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Strecker","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Julia Reinhardt","author_inst":"Institute for Experimental Oncology, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Per Hoffmann","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany and Genomics Research Group, Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel, Switzerl"},{"author_name":"Brian Cleary","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Michael Hoelzel","author_inst":"Institute for Experimental Oncology, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Markus M Noethen","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Martin Exner","author_inst":"Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Kerstin U Ludwig","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Aviv Regev","author_inst":"MIT and Broad Inst. of MIT &  Harvard"},{"author_name":"Feng Zhang","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard; McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.06.028316","rel_title":"Extraction-free COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) diagnosis by RT-PCR to increase capacity for national testing programmes during a pandemic","rel_date":"2020-04-08","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.06.028316","rel_abs":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory tract infection.

Emerging evidence suggests that a subset of COVID-19 is characterized by the development of a cytokine storm syndrome (CSS), and interleukin (IL)-6 levels are predictors of COVID-19 severity and in-hospital mortality. Targeting hyper-inflammation in COVID-19 may be critical for reducing mortality. Catecholamines enhance inflammatory injury by augmenting the production of IL-6 and other cytokines through a self-amplifying feed-forward loop in immune cells that requires alpha-1 adrenergic receptor (1-AR) signaling. Prophylactic inhibition of catecholamine synthesis with the 1-AR antagonist prazosin reduced catecholamines and cytokine responses in mice, and resulted in markedly increased survival following various hyper-inflammatory stimuli. These findings offer a rationale for studying 1-AR antagonists in the prophylaxis of patients with COVID-19-CSS and ARDS. As high infection rates threaten to overwhelm hospital capacity during this pandemic, preventative approaches that ameliorate COVID-19 severity and reduce excessive mortality are desperately needed. We hypothesize that treatment with prazosin of individuals who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 could reduce catecholamine surges, secondary cytokine dysregulation, and mortality. To investigate a potential role for 1-AR antagonists in preventing poor outcomes in ARDS, we conducted a retrospective analysis of hospitalized patients diagnosed with ARDS. Using data from the Truven Health MarketScan Research Database (2010-2017), we identified 13,125 men (age 45-64) with ARDS, of whom 655 patients (5.0%) were prescribed 1-AR antagonists in the previous year. Applying logistic regression models, we found that patients with prior use of 1-AR antagonists had lower odds of invasive mechanical ventilation compared to non-users (adjusted OR=0.75, 95% CI 0.59-0.95, p=0.019). Perhaps more importantly, those patients had a ~36% lower incidence of both being ventilated and dying in the hospital (adjusted OR=0.59, 95% CI 0.34-0.95, p=0.042). By contrast, prior use of beta-adrenergic receptor ({beta}-AR) antagonists was not correlated with either outcome. We extended these analyses to patients admitted with pneumonia. Of 108,956 subjects in this cohort, 5,498 patients (5.0%) were taking 1-AR antagonist. Similar to ARDS, patients with pneumonia on 1-AR antagonists (but no {beta}-AR antagonists) had a lower odds of mechanical ventilation (adjusted OR=0.83, 95% CI 0.75-0.92, p<0.001) and of both being ventilated and dying in the hospital (adjusted OR=0.77, 95% CI 0.62-0.94, p=0.014) compared to non-users. Mirroring findings from pre-clinical models, these data support a clinical rationale to study 1-AR antagonists in the prevention of severe complications of pneumonia, ARDS, and COVID-19. Prospective, randomized clinical trials of alpha-1 receptor antagonists (e.g. prazosin) administered prior to the onset of severe symptoms are needed to assess their efficacy in preventing CSS and reducing mortality in COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maximilian F Konig","author_inst":"Ludwig Center, Lustgarten Laboratory, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at The Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD, USA; Division of Rheumat"},{"author_name":"Mike Powell","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Engineering, Institute of Computational Medicine, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Verena Staedtke","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Ren-Yuan Bai","author_inst":"Department of Neurosurgery, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"David L Thomas","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Nicole Fischer","author_inst":"The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Sakibul Huq","author_inst":"Department of Neurosurgery, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Adham M Khalafallah","author_inst":"Department of Neurosurgery, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Allison Koenecke","author_inst":"Institute for Computational & Mathematical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Ruoxuan Xiong","author_inst":"Institute for Computational & Mathematical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Brett Mensh","author_inst":"Janelia Research Campus, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Ashburn, VA, USA and Optimize Science"},{"author_name":"Nickolas Papadopoulos","author_inst":"Ludwig Center, Lustgarten Laboratory, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at The Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Kenneth W Kinzler","author_inst":"Ludwig Center, Lustgarten Laboratory, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at The Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Bert Vogelstein","author_inst":"Ludwig Center, Lustgarten Laboratory, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at The Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Joshua T Vogelstein","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Engineering, Institute of Computational Medicine, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Susan Athey","author_inst":"Stanford Graduate School of Business, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Shibin Zhou","author_inst":"Ludwig Center, Lustgarten Laboratory, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at The Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Chetan Bettegowda","author_inst":"Ludwig Center, Lustgarten Laboratory, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at The Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD, USA; Department of Neuro"},{"author_name":"Brian Cleary","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Michael Hoelzel","author_inst":"Institute for Experimental Oncology, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Markus M Noethen","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Martin Exner","author_inst":"Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Kerstin U Ludwig","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Aviv Regev","author_inst":"MIT and Broad Inst. of MIT &  Harvard"},{"author_name":"Feng Zhang","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard; McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.06.027805","rel_title":"Sequence-based prediction of vaccine targets for inducing T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 utilizing the bioinformatics predictor RECON","rel_date":"2020-04-08","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.06.027805","rel_abs":"BackgroundThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created an urgency to identify novel vaccine targets for protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Consistent with observations for SARS-CoV, a closely related coronavirus responsible for the 2003 SARS outbreak, early reports identify a protective role for both humoral and cell-mediated immunity for SARS CoV-2.\n\nMethodsIn this study, we leveraged HLA-I and HLA-II T cell epitope prediction tools from RECON(R) (Real-time Epitope Computation for ONcology), our bioinformatic pipeline that was developed using proteomic profiling of individual HLA-I and HLA-II alleles to predict rules for peptide binding to a diverse set of such alleles. We applied these binding predictors to viral genomes from the Coronaviridae family, and specifically to identify SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes.\n\nResultsTo test the suitability of these tools to identify viral T cell epitopes, we first validated HLA-I and HLA-II predictions on Coronaviridae family epitopes deposited in the Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR) database. We then use our HLA-I and HLA-II predictors to identify 11,776 HLA-I and 7,991 HLA-II candidate binding peptides across all 12 open reading frames (ORFs) of SARS-CoV-2. This extensive list of identified candidate peptides is driven by the length of the ORFs and the significant number of HLA-I and HLA-II alleles that we are able to predict (74 and 83, respectively), providing over 99% coverage for the US, European and Asian populations, for both HLA-I and HLA-II. From our SARS-CoV-2 predicted peptide-HLA-I allele pairs, 368 pairs identically matched previously reported pairs in the ViPR database, originating from other forms of coronaviruses. 320 of these pairs (89.1%) had a positive MHC-binding assay result.

We attempted to quantitatively evaluate the risk of COVID-19 infections on students caused by school reopening. Study design: We collected the data of the numbers of teachers, population size and newly confirmed COVID-19 cases in the past 14 days in typical provinces\/cities of China, and then analyzed the risk of COVID-19 infections in schools with respect to each province\/city. Methods: A step-by-step procedure was explored to calculate the probability of COVID-19 infections on students as transmitted from infected teachers. Two critical assumptions for analysis were proposed: (i) only locally generated cases were counted while imported cases were omitted; (ii) the secondary attack rate of the COVID-19 virus in schools is similar to that in households in China, ranging from 3-10%. Results: The probability of COVID-19 resurgence within one week on students of primary, middle and high schools in China (outside Hubei) is extremely low (<0.2%) in each province\/city, and such probability can be updated daily and weekly based on the newly confirmed cases in the past 14 days. In some areas without newly confirmed cases in the past 14 days, the risk is zero. Conclusions: Our work provides guidance for local governments to make risk level-based policies for school reopening. Currently, the risk of COVID-19 infections on students is extremely low in China (outside Hubei) and therefore school reopening can be initiated without the endanger of infections on students.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cheng Long","author_inst":"Sichuan University West China Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tieyong Zeng","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"XINMIAO FU","author_inst":"Fujian Normal University"},{"author_name":"Michael S.

In this study, we performed untargeted metabolomic and lipidomic analyses of plasma from a cohort of COVID-19 patients who had experienced different symptoms. We found the metabolite and lipid alterations exhibit apparent correlation with the course of disease in these COVID-19 patients, indicating that the development of COVID-19 affected patient metabolism. Moreover, many of the metabolite and lipid alterations, particularly ones associated with hepatic functions, have been found to align with the progress and severity of COVID-19.

Early evaluation of suspects, screening for Covid-19 and management posed challenge to health authorities especially in developing countries which were not ready to cope with it. Early mild symptoms appeared during course of disease provide a chance to early detect Covid-19. We use retrospective methodology to collect available data on early sign and symptoms of Covid-19 through accessing World Health Organization (WHO) webpages, New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), Nature Journal, Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA) network, British Medical Journal (BJM), Lancet and other world renowned journal publications to establish a relationship of early symptoms for detection of Covid-19. Data of 2707 Covid-19 laboratory confirmed cases was collected and analyzed for early signs. Available data was categorized into physical and blood biomarkers. This categorized data was assessed for scoring early detection of Covid-19 by scoring Hashmi-Asif Covid-19 formula. Each characteristic was given a score in Hashmi-Asif Covid-19 chart with maximum score of 28. Scoring 16 on chart means Covid-19 will fully develop in near future. Correlation of each sign and symptoms with development of Covid-19 in formula showed significant correlation assessed by Pearson correlation and Spearman Correlation coefficient (rho) showed significant correlation of development of Covid-19 with fever 64.11% (P=0.001), cough 65% and dry mucus 19.67% equally sensitive (P=0.000), leukopenia 19.06% (P=0.006), lymphopenia 52.93% (P=0.005), thrombopenia 19.1% (P=0.013), elevated Aspartate aminotransferase 12.79% (P=0.007) and elevated Alanine aminotransferase 11.34% (P=0.006).

Using the standard setup, we demonstrate that ventilating two patients with mismatched lung compliances from a single ventilator will lead to clinically-significant reductions in tidal volume in the patient with the lowest respiratory compliance. Using the modified setup, we demonstrate that it is possible to achieve the same tidal volumes in two patients with mismatched lung compliances, and we show that the tidal volume of one patient can be manipulated independently of the other. The results indicate that, with appropriate modifications, two patients could be supported from a single ventilator with independent control of tidal volumes.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jose A.

For controlling COVID-19 outbreaks, many countries have implemented two non-pharmaceutical interventions: suppression like immediate lockdowns in cities at epicentre of outbreak; or mitigation that slows down but not stopping epidemic for reducing peak healthcare demand. Both interventions have apparent pros and cons; the effectiveness of any one intervention in isolation is limited. We aimed to conduct a feasibility study for robustly estimating the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths, peaks and lengths of COVID-19 breakouts by taking multiple pharmaceutical interventions in London and the UK, accounting for reduction of healthcare demand. Methods: We developed a model to attempt to infer the impact of mitigation, suppression and multiple rolling interventions for controlling COVID-19 outbreaks in London and the UK. Our model assumed that each intervention has equivalent effect on the reproduction number R across countries and over time; where its intensity was presented by average-number contacts with susceptible individuals as infectious individuals; early immediate intensive intervention led to increased health need and social anxiety. We considered two important features: direct link between Exposed and Recovered population, and practical healthcare demand by separation of infections into mild and critical cases. Our model was fitted and calibrated with data on cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Hubei to estimate how suppression intervention impacted on the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths over time during January 2020, and April 2020. We combined the calibrated model with data on the cases of COVID-19 in London, the UK (non-London) and the UK during February 2020 and March 2020 to estimate the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths, and healthcare demand by using multiple interventions. Findings: We estimated given that multiple interventions with an intensity range from 3 to 15, one optimal strategy was to take suppression with intensity 3 in London from 23rd March for 100 days, and 3 weeks rolling intervention with intensity between 3 and 5 in non-London regions. In this scenario, the total infections and deaths in the UK were limited to 2.43 million and 33.8 thousand; the peak time of healthcare demand was due to the 65th day (April 11th), where it needs hospital beds for 25.3 thousand severe and critical cases. If we took a simultaneous 3 weeks rolling intervention with intensity between 3 and 5 in all regions of the UK, the total infections and deaths increased slightly to 2.69 million and 37 thousand; the peak time of healthcare kept the same at the 65th day, where it needs equivalent hospital beds for severe and critical cases of 25.3 thousand. But if we released high band of rolling intervention intensity to 6 or 8 and simultaneously implemented them in all regions of the UK, the COVID-19 outbreak would not end in 1 year and distribute a multi-modal mode, where the total infections and deaths in the UK possibly reached to 16.2 million and 257 thousand.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Po Yang","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Jun Qi","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Shuhao Zhang","author_inst":"Yunnan University"},{"author_name":"Gaoshan Bi","author_inst":"Yunnan University"},{"author_name":"Xulong Wang","author_inst":"Yunnan University"},{"author_name":"Yun Yang","author_inst":"Yunnan University"},{"author_name":"Bin Sheng","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Xuxin Mao","author_inst":"National Institute of Economic and Social Research"},{"author_name":"Steven E.

Early detection and effective treatment of severe patients remain major challenges. Here, we performed proteomic and metabolomic profiling of sera from 46 COVID-19 and 53 control individuals. We then trained a machine learning model using proteomic and metabolomic measurements from a training cohort of 18 non-severe and 13 severe patients. The model correctly classified severe patients with an accuracy of 93.5%, and was further validated using ten independent patients, seven of which were correctly classified. We identified molecular changes in the sera of COVID-19 patients implicating dysregulation of macrophage, platelet degranulation and complement system pathways, and massive metabolic suppression. This study shows that it is possible to predict progression to severe COVID-19 disease using serum protein and metabolite biomarkers. Our data also uncovered molecular pathophysiology of COVID-19 with potential for developing anti-viral therapies.","rel_num_authors":40,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bo Shen","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory, Taizhou Hospital,Wenzhou Medical Universtry, 150 Ximen Street,Linhai 317000,Zhejiang  Province,China."},{"author_name":"Xiao Yi","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Yaoting Sun","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Xiaojie Bi","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital,Wenzhou Medical Universtry ,150 Ximen Street,Linhai 317000,Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Juping Du","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital,Wenzhou Medical Universtry ,150 Ximen Street,Linhai 317000,Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Chao Zhang","author_inst":"Calibra Lab at DIAN Diagnostics, 329 Jinpeng Street, Hangzhou 310030, Zhejiang Province, China."},{"author_name":"Sheng Quan","author_inst":"Calibra Lab at DIAN Diagnostics, 329 Jinpeng Street, Hangzhou 310030, Zhejiang Province, China."},{"author_name":"Fangfei Zhang","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Rui Sun","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Liujia Qian","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Weigang Ge","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Wei Liu","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Shuang Liang","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Hao Chen","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Ying Zhang","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital,Wenzhou Medical Universtry ,150 Ximen Street,Linhai 317000,Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Jun Li","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital,Wenzhou Medical Universtry ,150 Ximen Street,Linhai 317000,Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Jiaqin Xu","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital,Wenzhou Medical Universtry ,150 Ximen Street,Linhai 317000,Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Zebao He","author_inst":"Taizhou Enze Medical Center (Group) Enze Hospital"},{"author_name":"Baofu Chen","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital,Wenzhou Medical Universtry ,150 Ximen Street,Linhai 317000, Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Jing Wang","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital,Wenzhou Medical Universtry ,150 Ximen Street,Linhai 317000,Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Haixi Yan","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital,Wenzhou Medical Universtry ,150 Ximen Street,Linhai 317000,Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Yufen Zheng","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital,Wenzhou Medical Universtry ,150 Ximen Street,Linhai 317000,Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Donglian Wang","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital,Wenzhou Medical Universtry ,150 Ximen Street,Linhai 317000,Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Jiansheng Zhu","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital,Wenzhou Medical Universtry ,150 Ximen Street,Linhai 317000,Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Ziqing Kong","author_inst":"Calibra Lab at DIAN Diagnostics, 329 Jinpeng Street, Hangzhou 310030, Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Zhouyang Kang","author_inst":"Calibra Lab at DIAN Diagnostics, 329 Jinpeng Street, Hangzhou 310030, Zhejiang Province, China."},{"author_name":"Xiao Liang","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Xuan Ding","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Guan Ruan","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Nan Xiang","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Xue Cai","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Huanhuan Gao","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Lu Li","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Sainan Li","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Qi Xiao","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Tian Lu","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Yi Judy Zhu","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Huafen Liu","author_inst":"Calibra Lab at DIAN Diagnostics, 329 Jinpeng Street, Hangzhou 310030, Zhejiang Province, China."},{"author_name":"Haixiao Chen","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital,Wenzhou Medical Universtry ,150 Ximen Street,Linhai 317000, Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Tiannan Guo","author_inst":"Westlake University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.03.20052787","rel_title":"Susceptible supply limits the role of climate in the COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-04-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.03.20052787","rel_abs":"Preliminary evidence suggests that climate may modulate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

We find that while variations in humidity may be important for endemic infections, during the pandemic stage of an emerging pathogen such as SARS-CoV-2 climate may drive only modest changes to pandemic size and duration. Our results suggest that, in the absence of effective control measures, significant cases in the coming months are likely to occur in more humid (warmer) climates, irrespective of the climate-dependence of transmission and that summer temperatures will not substantially limit pandemic growth.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rachel E.

To gauge the potential for widespread contagion, to cope with associated uncertainty and to inform its mitigation, more accurate and robust modelling is centrally important for policy making. We provide a flexible modelling approach that increases the accuracy with which insights can be made. We use this to analyse different scenarios relevant to the COVID-19 situation in the UK. We present a stochastic model that captures the inherently probabilistic nature of contagion between population members. The computational nature of our model means that spatial constraints (e.g., communities and regions), the susceptibility of different age groups and other factors such as medical pre-histories can be incorporated with ease. We analyse different possible scenarios of the COVID-19 situation in the UK. Our model is robust to small changes in the parameters and is flexible in being able to deal with different scenarios. This approach goes beyond the convention of representing the spread of an epidemic through a fixed cycle of susceptibility, infection and recovery (SIR). It is important to emphasise that standard SIR-type models, unlike our model, are not flexible enough and are also not stochastic and hence should be used with extreme caution. Our model allows both heterogeneity and inherent uncertainty to be incorporated. Due to the scarcity of verified data, we draw insights by calibrating our model using parameters from other relevant sources, including agreement on average (mean field) with parameters in SIR-based models. We use the model to assess parameter sensitivity for a number of key variables that characterise the COVID-19 epidemic. We also test several control parameters with respect to their influence on the severity of the outbreak. Our analysis shows that due to inclusion of spatial heterogeneity in the population and the asynchronous timing of the epidemic across different areas, the severity of the epidemic might be lower than expected from other models. We find that one of the most crucial control parameters that may significantly reduce the severity of the epidemic is the degree of separation of vulnerable people and people aged 70 years and over, but note also that isolation of other groups has an effect on the severity of the epidemic. It is important to remember that models are there to advise and not to replace reality, and that any action should be coordinated and approved by public health experts with experience in dealing with epidemics. The computational approach makes it possible for further extensive scenario-based analysis to be undertaken. This and a comprehensive study of sensitivity of the model to different parameters defining COVID-19 and its development will be the subject of our forthcoming paper. In that paper, we shall also extend the model where we will consider different probabilistic scenarios for infected people with mild and severe cases.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anatoly Zhigljavsky","author_inst":"Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"Jack Noonan","author_inst":"Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"Ekta N Jayswal","author_inst":"Gujarat University"},{"author_name":"C.

However, Malaysia and Singapore and the neighboring tropical countries of China got relatively low spread and fatality that created a research interest on whether there are potential impacts of weather condition on COVID-19 spread. Adopting the SIR (Susceptible Infected Removed) deviated model to predict potential cases and death in the coming days from COVID-19 was done using the secondary and official sources of data. This study shows that COVID-19 spread and fatality tend to be high across the world but compared to tropical countries, it is going to be incredibly high in the temperate countries having lower temperature (7-16{degrees}C) and humidity (80-90%) in last March. However, some literature predicted that this might not to be true, rather irrespective of weather conditions there might be a continuous spread and death. Moreover, a large number of asymptotic COVID-19 carrier in both temperate and tropical countries may re-outbreak in the coming winter. Therefore, a comprehensive global program with the leadership of WHO for testing of entire population of the world is required, which will be very useful for the individual states to take proper political action, social movement and medical services.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Neaz A.

On March 25-28, 2020, a dire time for Covid-19 in Iran, we surveyed 1058 adults from all 30 provinces in Iran using the Covid-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI). The distress level of Iranian adults (mean: 34.54; s.d.: 14.92) was significantly higher (mean difference: 10.9; t=22.7; p<0.0001; 95% CI: 10.0 to 11.8) than that of Chinese adults (mean: 23.65; s.d.: 5.45) as reported in a prior study with the same measure of Covid-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI). We also found the predictors of distress in Iran vary from those in China. Our findings that the predictors of distress in Iran vary from those in China suggest the need to study the predictors of mental health in individual countries during the Covid-19 pandemic to effectively identify and screen for those more susceptible to mental health issues.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Asghar Afshar Jahanshahi","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru"},{"author_name":"Maryam Mokhtari Dinani","author_inst":"Alzahra University"},{"author_name":"Abbas Nazarian Madavani","author_inst":"Shahid Rajaee University"},{"author_name":"Jizhen Li","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Stephen X Zhang","author_inst":"University of Adelaide"},{"author_name":"Edris Bazrafshan","author_inst":"Torbat Heydariyeh University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mahdi Gholian-Aval Jr.","author_inst":"Mashhad University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Fangfei Zhang","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Rui Sun","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Liujia Qian","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Weigang Ge","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Wei Liu","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Shuang Liang","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Hao Chen","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Ying Zhang","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital,Wenzhou Medical Universtry ,150 Ximen Street,Linhai 317000,Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Jun Li","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital,Wenzhou Medical Universtry ,150 Ximen Street,Linhai 317000,Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Jiaqin Xu","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital,Wenzhou Medical Universtry ,150 Ximen Street,Linhai 317000,Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Zebao He","author_inst":"Taizhou Enze Medical Center (Group) Enze Hospital"},{"author_name":"Baofu Chen","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital,Wenzhou Medical Universtry ,150 Ximen Street,Linhai 317000, Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Jing Wang","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital,Wenzhou Medical Universtry ,150 Ximen Street,Linhai 317000,Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Haixi Yan","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital,Wenzhou Medical Universtry ,150 Ximen Street,Linhai 317000,Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Yufen Zheng","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital,Wenzhou Medical Universtry ,150 Ximen Street,Linhai 317000,Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Donglian Wang","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital,Wenzhou Medical Universtry ,150 Ximen Street,Linhai 317000,Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Jiansheng Zhu","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital,Wenzhou Medical Universtry ,150 Ximen Street,Linhai 317000,Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Ziqing Kong","author_inst":"Calibra Lab at DIAN Diagnostics, 329 Jinpeng Street, Hangzhou 310030, Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Zhouyang Kang","author_inst":"Calibra Lab at DIAN Diagnostics, 329 Jinpeng Street, Hangzhou 310030, Zhejiang Province, China."},{"author_name":"Xiao Liang","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Xuan Ding","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Guan Ruan","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Nan Xiang","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Xue Cai","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Huanhuan Gao","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Lu Li","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Sainan Li","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Qi Xiao","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Tian Lu","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Yi Judy Zhu","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Huafen Liu","author_inst":"Calibra Lab at DIAN Diagnostics, 329 Jinpeng Street, Hangzhou 310030, Zhejiang Province, China."},{"author_name":"Haixiao Chen","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital,Wenzhou Medical Universtry ,150 Ximen Street,Linhai 317000, Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Tiannan Guo","author_inst":"Westlake University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.04.20052696","rel_title":"Face mask use in the general population and optimal resource allocation during the COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-04-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.04.20052696","rel_abs":"The ongoing novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has rapidly spread in early 2020, causing tens of thousands of deaths, over a million cases and widespread socioeconomic disruption. With no vaccine available and numerous national healthcare systems reaching or exceeding capacity, interventions to limit transmission are urgently needed. While there is broad agreement that travel restrictions and closure of non-essential businesses and schools are beneficial in limiting local and regional spread, and such measures have been adopted in countries around the world, recommendations around the use of face masks for the general population are less consistent internationally. In this study, we examined the role of face masks in mitigating the spread of COVID-19 in the general population, using epidemic models to estimate the total reduction of infections and deaths under various scenarios. In particular, we examined the optimal deployment of face masks when resources are limited. We found that face masks, even with a limited protective effect, can reduce infections and deaths, and can delay the peak time of the epidemic. We consistently found that a random distribution of masks in the population was a suboptimal strategy when resources were limited. Prioritizing coverage among the elderly was more beneficial, while allocating a proportion of available resources for diagnosed infected cases provided further mitigation under a range of scenarios. In summary, face mask use, particularly for a pathogen with relatively common asymptomatic carriage, can effectively provide some mitigation of transmission, while balancing provision between vulnerable healthy persons and symptomatic persons can optimize mitigation efforts when resources are limited.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Colin J Worby","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Hsiao-Han Chang","author_inst":"National Tsing Hua University"},{"author_name":"Abbas Nazarian Madavani","author_inst":"Shahid Rajaee University"},{"author_name":"Jizhen Li","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Stephen X Zhang","author_inst":"University of Adelaide"},{"author_name":"Edris Bazrafshan","author_inst":"Torbat Heydariyeh University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mahdi Gholian-Aval Jr.","author_inst":"Mashhad University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Fangfei Zhang","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Rui Sun","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Liujia Qian","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Weigang Ge","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Wei Liu","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Shuang Liang","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Hao Chen","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Ying Zhang","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital,Wenzhou Medical Universtry ,150 Ximen Street,Linhai 317000,Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Jun Li","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital,Wenzhou Medical Universtry ,150 Ximen Street,Linhai 317000,Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Jiaqin Xu","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital,Wenzhou Medical Universtry ,150 Ximen Street,Linhai 317000,Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Zebao He","author_inst":"Taizhou Enze Medical Center (Group) Enze Hospital"},{"author_name":"Baofu Chen","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital,Wenzhou Medical Universtry ,150 Ximen Street,Linhai 317000, Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Jing Wang","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital,Wenzhou Medical Universtry ,150 Ximen Street,Linhai 317000,Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Haixi Yan","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital,Wenzhou Medical Universtry ,150 Ximen Street,Linhai 317000,Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Yufen Zheng","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital,Wenzhou Medical Universtry ,150 Ximen Street,Linhai 317000,Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Donglian Wang","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital,Wenzhou Medical Universtry ,150 Ximen Street,Linhai 317000,Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Jiansheng Zhu","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital,Wenzhou Medical Universtry ,150 Ximen Street,Linhai 317000,Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Ziqing Kong","author_inst":"Calibra Lab at DIAN Diagnostics, 329 Jinpeng Street, Hangzhou 310030, Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Zhouyang Kang","author_inst":"Calibra Lab at DIAN Diagnostics, 329 Jinpeng Street, Hangzhou 310030, Zhejiang Province, China."},{"author_name":"Xiao Liang","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Xuan Ding","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Guan Ruan","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Nan Xiang","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Xue Cai","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Huanhuan Gao","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Lu Li","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Sainan Li","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Qi Xiao","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Tian Lu","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Yi Judy Zhu","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Huafen Liu","author_inst":"Calibra Lab at DIAN Diagnostics, 329 Jinpeng Street, Hangzhou 310030, Zhejiang Province, China."},{"author_name":"Haixiao Chen","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital,Wenzhou Medical Universtry ,150 Ximen Street,Linhai 317000, Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Tiannan Guo","author_inst":"Westlake University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.03.20052720","rel_title":"Mitigating COVID-19 outbreak via high testing capacity and strong transmission-intervention in the United States","rel_date":"2020-04-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.03.20052720","rel_abs":"Most models of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States do not consider geographic variation, and their relevance to public policies is not straightforward. We developed a mathematical model that characterizes infections by state and incorporates inflows and outflows of interstate travelers. Modeling reveals that curbing interstate travel when the disease is already widespread will make little difference. Meanwhile, increased testing capacity (facilitating early identification of infected people and quick isolation) and strict social-distancing and self-quarantine rules are effective in abating the outbreak. The modeling has also produced state-specific information. For example, for New York and Michigan, isolation of persons exposed to the virus needs to be imposed within 2 days to prevent a broad outbreak, whereas for other states this period can be 3.6 days. This model could be used to determine resources needed before safely lifting state policies on social distancing.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shi Chen","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Qin Li","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madisons"},{"author_name":"Song Gao","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Yuhao Kang","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Xun Shi","author_inst":"Dartmouth College"},{"author_name":"Edris Bazrafshan","author_inst":"Torbat Heydariyeh University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mahdi Gholian-Aval Jr.","author_inst":"Mashhad University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Fangfei Zhang","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Rui Sun","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Liujia Qian","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Weigang Ge","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Wei Liu","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Shuang Liang","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Hao Chen","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Ying Zhang","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital,Wenzhou Medical Universtry ,150 Ximen Street,Linhai 317000,Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Jun Li","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital,Wenzhou Medical Universtry ,150 Ximen Street,Linhai 317000,Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Jiaqin Xu","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital,Wenzhou Medical Universtry ,150 Ximen Street,Linhai 317000,Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Zebao He","author_inst":"Taizhou Enze Medical Center (Group) Enze Hospital"},{"author_name":"Baofu Chen","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital,Wenzhou Medical Universtry ,150 Ximen Street,Linhai 317000, Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Jing Wang","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital,Wenzhou Medical Universtry ,150 Ximen Street,Linhai 317000,Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Haixi Yan","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital,Wenzhou Medical Universtry ,150 Ximen Street,Linhai 317000,Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Yufen Zheng","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital,Wenzhou Medical Universtry ,150 Ximen Street,Linhai 317000,Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Donglian Wang","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital,Wenzhou Medical Universtry ,150 Ximen Street,Linhai 317000,Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Jiansheng Zhu","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital,Wenzhou Medical Universtry ,150 Ximen Street,Linhai 317000,Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Ziqing Kong","author_inst":"Calibra Lab at DIAN Diagnostics, 329 Jinpeng Street, Hangzhou 310030, Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Zhouyang Kang","author_inst":"Calibra Lab at DIAN Diagnostics, 329 Jinpeng Street, Hangzhou 310030, Zhejiang Province, China."},{"author_name":"Xiao Liang","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Xuan Ding","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Guan Ruan","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Nan Xiang","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Xue Cai","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Huanhuan Gao","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Lu Li","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Sainan Li","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Qi Xiao","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Tian Lu","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Yi Judy Zhu","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Huafen Liu","author_inst":"Calibra Lab at DIAN Diagnostics, 329 Jinpeng Street, Hangzhou 310030, Zhejiang Province, China."},{"author_name":"Haixiao Chen","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital,Wenzhou Medical Universtry ,150 Ximen Street,Linhai 317000, Zhejiang Province,China."},{"author_name":"Tiannan Guo","author_inst":"Westlake University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"}]}
