Investigations of these localized pathologies have been hindered by a lack of 3D in vitro human distal lung culture systems. Further, human distal lung stem cell identification has been impaired by quiescence, anatomic divergence from mouse and lack of lineage tracing and clonogenic culture. Here, we developed robust feeder-free, chemically-defined culture of distal human lung progenitors as organoids derived clonally from single adult human alveolar epithelial type II (AT2) or KRT5+ basal cells. AT2 organoids exhibited AT1 transdifferentiation potential, while basal cell organoids progressively developed lumens lined by differentiated club and ciliated cells. Organoids consisting solely of club cells were not observed. Upon single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), alveolar organoids were composed of proliferative AT2 cells; however, basal organoid KRT5+ cells contained a distinct ITGA6+ITGB4+ mitotic population whose proliferation segregated to a TNFRSF12Ahi subfraction. Clonogenic organoid growth was markedly enriched within the TNFRSF12Ahi subset of FACS-purified ITGA6+ITGB4+ basal cells from human lung or derivative organoids. In vivo, TNFRSF12A+ cells comprised ~10% of KRT5+ basal cells and resided in clusters within terminal bronchioles. To model COVID-19 distal lung disease, we everted the polarity of basal and alveolar organoids to rapidly relocate differentiated club and ciliated cells from the organoid lumen to the exterior surface, thus displaying the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 on the outwardly-facing apical aspect. Accordingly, basal and AT2 \"apical-out\" organoids were infected by SARS-CoV-2, identifying club cells as a novel target population. This long-term, feeder-free organoid culture of human distal lung alveolar and basal stem cells, coupled with single cell analysis, identifies unsuspected basal cell functional heterogeneity and exemplifies progenitor identification within a slowly proliferating human tissue. Further, our studies establish a facile in vitro organoid model for human distal lung infectious diseases including COVID-19-associated pneumonia.","rel_num_authors":34,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ameen A.

No treatment is available. Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) in mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are potential novel therapeutic agents because of their ability to regulate gene expression by inhibiting mRNA. Thus, they may degrade the RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2. EVs can transfer miRNAs to recipient cells and regulate conditions within them. MSC-EVs harbor major therapeutic miRNAs that play important roles in the biological functions of virus-infected host cells. Here, we examined their potential impact on viral and immune responses. MSC-EVs contained 18 miRNAs predicted to interact directly with the 3 UTR of SARS-CoV-2. These EVs suppressed SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells. In addition, five major miRNAs suppressed virus activity in a luciferase reporter assay by binding the 3 UTR. MSC-EVs showed strong regenerative effects and potent anti-inflammatory activity which may prevent lethal cytokine storms. We confirmed that EVs regulated inflammatory responses by several cell types, including human brain cells that express the viral receptor ACE2, suggesting that the brain may be targeted by SARS-CoV-2. miRNAs in MSC-EVs have several advantages as therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2: 1) they bind specifically to the viral 3 UTR, and are thus unlikely to have side effects; 2) because the 3 UTR is highly conserved and rarely mutates, MSC-EV miRNAs could be used against novel variants arising during viral replication; and 3) unique cargoes carried by MSC-EVs can have diverse effects, such as regenerating damaged tissue and regulating immunity.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jisook Moon","author_inst":"CHA University"},{"author_name":"Jae Hyun Park","author_inst":"CHA University"},{"author_name":"Yuri Choi","author_inst":"CHA University"},{"author_name":"Chul-Woo Lim","author_inst":"CHA University"},{"author_name":"Ji-Min Park","author_inst":"CHA University"},{"author_name":"Shin-Hye Yu","author_inst":"Paean Biotechnology, Inc."},{"author_name":"Yujin Kim","author_inst":"Paean Biotechnology, Inc."},{"author_name":"Hae Jung Han","author_inst":"Green Cross WellBeing Corporation"},{"author_name":"Chun-Hyung Kim","author_inst":"Paean Biotechnology, Inc."},{"author_name":"Young-Sook Song","author_inst":"CHA University"},{"author_name":"Chul Kim","author_inst":"CHA University"},{"author_name":"Tatsuya Usui","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology"},{"author_name":"Grace X.Y.

One of the typical features of COVID-19 is that both type I and III interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral immunity are suppressed. However, the molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 evades this antiviral immunity remains elusive. Here, we report that the SARS-CoV-2 membrane (M) protein inhibits the production of type I and III IFNs induced by the cytosolic dsRNA-sensing pathway of RIG-I\/MDA-5-MAVS signaling. The SARS-CoV2 M protein also dampens type I and III IFN induction stimulated by Sendai virus infection or poly (I:C) transfection. Mechanistically, the SARS-CoV-2 M protein interacts with RIG-I, MAVS, and TBK1 and prevents the formation of a multi-protein complex containing RIG-I, MAVS, TRAF3, and TBK1, thus impeding IRF3 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and activation. Consequently, the ectopic expression of the SARS-CoV2 M protein facilitates the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Taken together, the SARS-CoV-2 M protein antagonizes type I and III IFN production by targeting RIG-I\/MDA-5 signaling, which subsequently attenuates antiviral immunity and enhances viral replication. This study provides insight into the interpretation of the SARS-CoV-2-induced antiviral immune suppression and sheds light on the pathogenic mechanism of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pei-Hui Wang","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Yi Zheng","author_inst":"Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Meng-Wei Zhuang","author_inst":"Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Lulu Han","author_inst":"Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Jing Zhang","author_inst":"Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Mei-Ling Nan","author_inst":"Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Chengjiang Gao","author_inst":"Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Hae Jung Han","author_inst":"Green Cross WellBeing Corporation"},{"author_name":"Chun-Hyung Kim","author_inst":"Paean Biotechnology, Inc."},{"author_name":"Young-Sook Song","author_inst":"CHA University"},{"author_name":"Chul Kim","author_inst":"CHA University"},{"author_name":"Tatsuya Usui","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology"},{"author_name":"Grace X.Y.

For samples with higher viral loads (cycle threshold value under 33, based on the CDC qPCR assay) complete genomes were generated. Analysis of junction reads revealed regions of differential transcriptional activity and provided evidence of expression of ORF10. Heterogeneous allelic frequencies along the 20kb ORF1ab gene suggested the presence of a defective interfering viral RNA species subpopulation in one sample. The associated workflow is straightforward, and hybridization-based capture offers an effective and scalable approach for sequencing SARS-CoV-2 from patient samples.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Harsha Vardhan Doddapaneni","author_inst":"Human Genome Sequencing Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA, 77030"},{"author_name":"Sara Javornik Cregeen","author_inst":"Alkek Center for Metagenomics and Microbiome Research, Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA, 77030"},{"author_name":"Richard Sucgang","author_inst":"Alkek Center for Metagenomics and Microbiome Research, Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA, 77030"},{"author_name":"Qingchang Meng","author_inst":"Human Genome Sequencing Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA, 77030"},{"author_name":"Xiang Qing","author_inst":"Human Genome Sequencing Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA, 77030"},{"author_name":"Vasanthi Avadhanula","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA, 77030"},{"author_name":"Hsu Chao","author_inst":"Human Genome Sequencing Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA, 77030"},{"author_name":"Vipin Menon","author_inst":"Human Genome Sequencing Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA, 77030"},{"author_name":"Erin Nicholson","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, and Pediatrics , Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA, 77030"},{"author_name":"David Henke","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA, 77030"},{"author_name":"Felipe-Andres Piedra","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology , Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA, 77030"},{"author_name":"Anubama Rajan","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA, 77030"},{"author_name":"Zeineen Momin","author_inst":"Human Genome Sequencing Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA, 77030"},{"author_name":"Kavya Kottapalli","author_inst":"Human Genome Sequencing Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA, 77030"},{"author_name":"Kristi L.

As only very limited therapeutic options are clinically available, there is an urgent need for the rapid development of safe, effective, and globally available pharmaceuticals that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry and ameliorate COVID-19. In this study, we explored the use of small compounds acting on the homeostasis of the endolysosomal host-pathogen interface, to fight SARS-CoV-2 infection. We find that fluoxetine, a widely used antidepressant and a functional inhibitor of acid sphingomyelinase (FIASMA), efficiently inhibited the entry and propagation of SARS-CoV-2 in the cell culture model without cytotoxic effects and also exerted potent antiviral activity against two currently circulating influenza A virus subtypes, an effect which was also observed upon treatment with the FIASMAs amiodarone and imipramine. Mechanistically, fluoxetine induced both impaired endolysosomal acidification and the accumulation of cholesterol within the endosomes. As the FIASMA group consists of a large number of small compounds that are well-tolerated and widely used for a broad range of clinical applications, exploring these licensed pharmaceuticals may offer a variety of promising antivirals for host-directed therapy to counteract enveloped viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and COVID 19.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sebastian Schloer","author_inst":"University of Muenster, Center for Molecular Biology of Inflammation"},{"author_name":"Linda Brunotte","author_inst":"Universtity of Muenster, Center for Molecular Biology of Inflammation"},{"author_name":"Jonas Goretzko","author_inst":"University of Muenster, Center for Molecular Biology of Inflammation"},{"author_name":"Angeles Mecate-Zambrano","author_inst":"University of Muenster, Center for Molecular Biology of Inflammation"},{"author_name":"Nadja Korthals","author_inst":"University of Muenster, Center for Molecular Biology of Inflammation"},{"author_name":"Volker Gerke","author_inst":"University of Muenster, Center for Molecular Biology of Inflammation"},{"author_name":"Stephan Ludwig","author_inst":"University of Muenster, Center for Molecular Biology of Inflammation"},{"author_name":"Ursula Rescher","author_inst":"University of Muenster Centre for Molecular Biology of Inflammation"},{"author_name":"Erin Nicholson","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, and Pediatrics , Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA, 77030"},{"author_name":"David Henke","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA, 77030"},{"author_name":"Felipe-Andres Piedra","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology , Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA, 77030"},{"author_name":"Anubama Rajan","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA, 77030"},{"author_name":"Zeineen Momin","author_inst":"Human Genome Sequencing Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA, 77030"},{"author_name":"Kavya Kottapalli","author_inst":"Human Genome Sequencing Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA, 77030"},{"author_name":"Kristi L.

Developing cardiac injury is a common condition in COVID-19 patients, but the pathogenesis remains unclear.\n\nMethodsThe RNA-Seq dataset (GES150392) compared expression profiling of mock human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) and SARS-cov-2-infected hiPSC-CMs were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). We identified the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between those two groups. Through gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis, and CLINVAR human diseases analysis to identify the main effect of SARS-CoV-2 on cardiomyocytes. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed to visualize interactions and functions of the hub genes.\n\nResultsA total of 1554 DEGs were identified (726 upregulated genes and 828 downregulated genes). Gene enrichment analysis shown that SARS-CoV-2 activate immuno-inflammatory responses via multiple signal pathways, including TNF, IL6-JAK-STAT3, IL2-STAT5, NF-{kappa}B, IL17, and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway in hiPSC-CMs. Whereas, the muscle contraction, cellular respiration and cell cycle of hiPSC-CMs were inhibited by SARS-CoV-2. CLINVAR human diseases analysis shown SRAS-Cov-2 infection was associated with myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy and Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. 15 hub genes were identified based on PPI network. Function analysis revealed that 11 upregulated hub genes were mainly enriched in cytokine activity, chemokine activity, Inflammatory response, leukocyte chemotaxis, and lipopolysaccharide-mediated signaling pathway. Furthermore, 4 downregulated hub genes were related to cell cycle regulation.\n\nConclusionThe present study elucidates that the SARS-CoV-2 infection induced a strong defensive response in cardiomyocyte, leading to excessive immune inflammation, cell hypoxia, functional contractility reduction and apoptosis, ultimately result in myocardial injury.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"XianFang Liu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Longquan Lou","author_inst":"The Third Peoples Hospital of Hangzhou"},{"author_name":"Lei Zhou","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Angeles Mecate-Zambrano","author_inst":"University of Muenster, Center for Molecular Biology of Inflammation"},{"author_name":"Nadja Korthals","author_inst":"University of Muenster, Center for Molecular Biology of Inflammation"},{"author_name":"Volker Gerke","author_inst":"University of Muenster, Center for Molecular Biology of Inflammation"},{"author_name":"Stephan Ludwig","author_inst":"University of Muenster, Center for Molecular Biology of Inflammation"},{"author_name":"Ursula Rescher","author_inst":"University of Muenster Centre for Molecular Biology of Inflammation"},{"author_name":"Erin Nicholson","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, and Pediatrics , Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA, 77030"},{"author_name":"David Henke","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA, 77030"},{"author_name":"Felipe-Andres Piedra","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology , Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA, 77030"},{"author_name":"Anubama Rajan","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA, 77030"},{"author_name":"Zeineen Momin","author_inst":"Human Genome Sequencing Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA, 77030"},{"author_name":"Kavya Kottapalli","author_inst":"Human Genome Sequencing Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA, 77030"},{"author_name":"Kristi L.

To maximize delivery to the lungs, we formulated remdesivir as a dry powder for inhalation using thin film freezing (TFF). TFF produces brittle matrix nanostructured aggregates that are sheared into respirable low-density microparticles upon aerosolization from a passive dry powder inhaler. In vitro aerodynamic testing demonstrated that drug loading and excipient type affected the aerosol performance of remdesivir. Remdesivir combined with optimal excipients exhibited desirable aerosol performance (up to 93.0% FPF; 0.82m MMAD). Remdesivir was amorphous after the TFF process, which benefitted drug dissolution in simulated lung fluid. TFF remdesivir formulations are stable after one-month storage at 25 {degrees}C\/60%RH. In vivo pharmacokinetic evaluation showed that TFF-remdesivir-leucine was poorly absorbed into systemic circulation while TFF-remdesivir-Captisol(R) demonstrated increased systemic uptake compared to leucine. Remdesivir was hydrolyzed to the nucleoside analog GS-441524 in lung, and levels of GS-441524 were greater in lung with the leucine formulation compared to Captisol(R). In conclusion, TFF technology produces high potency remdesivir dry powder formulations for inhalation suitable to treat patients with COVID-19 on an outpatient basis and earlier in the disease course where effective antiviral therapy can reduce related morbidity and mortality.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sawittree Sahakijpijarn","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Chaeho Moon","author_inst":"The University of Austin"},{"author_name":"John J Koleng","author_inst":"TFF Pharmaceuticals, Inc."},{"author_name":"Dale J Christensen","author_inst":"TFF Pharmaceuticals, Inc."},{"author_name":"Robert O Williams III","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Volker Gerke","author_inst":"University of Muenster, Center for Molecular Biology of Inflammation"},{"author_name":"Stephan Ludwig","author_inst":"University of Muenster, Center for Molecular Biology of Inflammation"},{"author_name":"Ursula Rescher","author_inst":"University of Muenster Centre for Molecular Biology of Inflammation"},{"author_name":"Erin Nicholson","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, and Pediatrics , Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA, 77030"},{"author_name":"David Henke","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA, 77030"},{"author_name":"Felipe-Andres Piedra","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology , Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA, 77030"},{"author_name":"Anubama Rajan","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA, 77030"},{"author_name":"Zeineen Momin","author_inst":"Human Genome Sequencing Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA, 77030"},{"author_name":"Kavya Kottapalli","author_inst":"Human Genome Sequencing Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA, 77030"},{"author_name":"Kristi L.

As macrophages have unique effector functions as a first-line defense against invading pathogens, we genetically armed human macrophages with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) to reprogram their phagocytic activity against SARS-CoV-2. After investigation of CAR constructs with different intracellular receptor domains, we found that although cytosolic domains from MERTK (CARMERTK) did not trigger antigen-specific cellular phagocytosis or killing effects, unlike those from MEGF10, FcR{gamma} and CD3{zeta} did, these CARs all mediated similar SARS-CoV-2 clearance in vitro. Notably, we showed that CARMERTK macrophages reduced the virion load without upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine expression. These results suggest that CARMERTK drives an  immunologically silent scavenger effect in macrophages and pave the way for further investigation of CARs for the treatment of individuals with COVID-19, particularly those with severe cases at a high risk of hyperinflammation.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wenyan Fu","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Changhai Lei","author_inst":"Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Kewen Qian","author_inst":"Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zetong Ma","author_inst":"Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Tian Li","author_inst":"Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, First affiliated hospital, the Second Military Medical University; Guanggu District, the Maternal and Chil"},{"author_name":"Fangxing Lin","author_inst":"Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jian Zhao","author_inst":"KOCHKOR Biotech, Inc"},{"author_name":"Shi Hu","author_inst":"Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"David Henke","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA, 77030"},{"author_name":"Felipe-Andres Piedra","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology , Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA, 77030"},{"author_name":"Anubama Rajan","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA, 77030"},{"author_name":"Zeineen Momin","author_inst":"Human Genome Sequencing Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA, 77030"},{"author_name":"Kavya Kottapalli","author_inst":"Human Genome Sequencing Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA, 77030"},{"author_name":"Kristi L.

Here, we use a multiplexed peptide assay ( PepSeq) to generate an epitope-resolved view of reactivity across all human coronaviruses. PepSeq accurately detects SARS-CoV-2 exposure and resolves epitopes across the Spike and Nucleocapsid proteins. Two of these represent recurrent reactivities to conserved, functionally-important sites in the Spike S2 subunit, regions that we show are also targeted for the endemic coronaviruses in pre-pandemic controls. At one of these sites, we demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 response strongly and recurrently cross-reacts with the endemic virus hCoV-OC43. Our analyses reveal new diagnostic and therapeutic targets, including a site at which SARS-CoV-2 may recruit common pre-existing antibodies and with the potential for broadly-neutralizing responses.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jason T Ladner","author_inst":"The Pathogen and Microbiome Institute, Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, AZ, USA"},{"author_name":"Sierra N Henson","author_inst":"The Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen), Phoenix and Flagstaff, AZ, USA"},{"author_name":"Annalee S Boyle","author_inst":"The Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen), Phoenix and Flagstaff, AZ, USA"},{"author_name":"Anna L Engelbrektson","author_inst":"The Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen), Phoenix and Flagstaff, AZ, USA"},{"author_name":"Zane W Fink","author_inst":"The Pathogen and Microbiome Institute, Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, AZ, USA"},{"author_name":"Fatima Rahee","author_inst":"The Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen), Phoenix and Flagstaff, AZ, USA"},{"author_name":"Kurt E Schaecher","author_inst":"Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, MD, USA"},{"author_name":"Mars Stone","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Wenjuan Dong","author_inst":"Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Sanjeet Dadwal","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Jianhua Yu","author_inst":"Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Michael A Caligiuri","author_inst":"Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Piotr Cieplak","author_inst":"Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Magnar Bj\u00f8r\u00e5s","author_inst":"Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway"},{"author_name":"Mona H Fenstad","author_inst":"Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway"},{"author_name":"Svein A Nordb\u00f8","author_inst":"Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway"},{"author_name":"Denis E Kainov","author_inst":"Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway"},{"author_name":"Norihito Muranaka","author_inst":"Encodia Inc, San Diego, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Mark S Chee","author_inst":"Encodia Inc, San Diego, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Sergey A Shiryaev","author_inst":"Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"John A Altin","author_inst":"The Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen), Phoenix and Flagstaff, AZ, USA"},{"author_name":"Phillip Belgrader","author_inst":"10X Genomics, Inc"},{"author_name":"Solongo B.

While most SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors have a {gamma}-lactam glutamine surrogate at the P1 position, we recently discovered several Mpro inhibitors have hydrophobic moieties at the P1 site, including calpain inhibitors II\/XII, which are also active against human cathepsin L, a host-protease that is important for viral entry. To determine the binding mode of these calpain inhibitors and establish a structure-activity relationship, we solved X-ray crystal structures of Mpro in complex with calpain inhibitors II and XII, and three analogues of GC-376, one of the most potent Mpro inhibitors in vitro. The structure of Mpro with calpain inhibitor II confirmed the S1 pocket of Mpro can accommodate a hydrophobic methionine side chain, challenging the idea that a hydrophilic residue is necessary at this position. Interestingly, the structure of calpain inhibitor XII revealed an unexpected, inverted binding pose where the P1 pyridine inserts in the S1 pocket and the P1 norvaline is positioned in the S1 pocket. The overall conformation is semi-helical, wrapping around the catalytic core, in contrast to the extended conformation of other peptidomimetic inhibitors. Additionally, the structures of three GC-376 analogues UAWJ246, UAWJ247, and UAWJ248 provide insight to the sidechain preference of the S1, S2, S3 and S4 pockets, and the superior cell-based activity of the aldehyde warhead compared with the -ketoamide. Taken together, the biochemical, computational, structural, and cellular data presented herein provide new directions for the development of Mpro inhibitors as SARS-CoV-2 antivirals.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael Dominic Sacco","author_inst":"University of South Florida"},{"author_name":"Chunlong Ma","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Panagiotis Lagarias","author_inst":"National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"},{"author_name":"Ang Gao","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Julia Alma Townsend","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Xiangzhi Meng","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio"},{"author_name":"Peter Dube","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio"},{"author_name":"Xiujun Zhang","author_inst":"University of South Florida"},{"author_name":"Yanmei Hu","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Naoya Kitamura","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Brett Hurst","author_inst":"Utah State University"},{"author_name":"Bart Tarbet","author_inst":"Utah State University"},{"author_name":"Michael Thomas Marty","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Antonios Kolocouris","author_inst":"National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"},{"author_name":"Yan Xiang","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio"},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"University of South Florida"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Norihito Muranaka","author_inst":"Encodia Inc, San Diego, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Mark S Chee","author_inst":"Encodia Inc, San Diego, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Sergey A Shiryaev","author_inst":"Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"John A Altin","author_inst":"The Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen), Phoenix and Flagstaff, AZ, USA"},{"author_name":"Phillip Belgrader","author_inst":"10X Genomics, Inc"},{"author_name":"Solongo B.

Crosslinking of Fc with Fc{gamma}RIIB mediates antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) activity by MW05. This activity was eliminated by introducing the LALA mutation to the Fc region (MW05\/LALA). Most importantly, potent prophylactic and therapeutic effects against SARS-CoV-2 were observed in rhesus monkeys. A single dose of MW05\/LALA completely blocked the infection of SARS-CoV-2 in a study of its prophylactic effect and totally cleared SARS-CoV-2 in three days in a treatment setting. These results pave the way for the development of MW05\/LALA as an effective strategy for combating COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xun Gui","author_inst":"Mabwell (Shanghai) Bioscience Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Chunlong Ma","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Panagiotis Lagarias","author_inst":"National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"},{"author_name":"Ang Gao","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Julia Alma Townsend","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Xiangzhi Meng","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio"},{"author_name":"Peter Dube","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio"},{"author_name":"Xiujun Zhang","author_inst":"University of South Florida"},{"author_name":"Yanmei Hu","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Naoya Kitamura","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Brett Hurst","author_inst":"Utah State University"},{"author_name":"Bart Tarbet","author_inst":"Utah State University"},{"author_name":"Michael Thomas Marty","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Antonios Kolocouris","author_inst":"National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"},{"author_name":"Yan Xiang","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio"},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"University of South Florida"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Norihito Muranaka","author_inst":"Encodia Inc, San Diego, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Mark S Chee","author_inst":"Encodia Inc, San Diego, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Sergey A Shiryaev","author_inst":"Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"John A Altin","author_inst":"The Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen), Phoenix and Flagstaff, AZ, USA"},{"author_name":"Phillip Belgrader","author_inst":"10X Genomics, Inc"},{"author_name":"Solongo B.

Such IGHV3-53 antibodies generally have a short CDR H3 due to structural constraints in binding the RBD (mode A). However, a small subset of IGHV3-53 antibodies to the RBD contain a longer CDR H3. Crystal structures of two IGHV3-53 neutralizing antibodies here demonstrate that a longer CDR H3 can be accommodated in a different binding mode (mode B). These two classes of IGHV3-53 antibodies both target the ACE2 receptor binding site, but with very different angles of approach and molecular interactions. Overall, these findings emphasize the versatility of IGHV3-53 in this common antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, where conserved IGHV3-53 germline-encoded features can be combined with very different CDR H3 lengths and light chains for SARS-CoV-2 RBD recognition and virus neutralization.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicholas C.

Given that current phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 identifies new viral clades after they exhibit evolutionary selections, one wonders whether we can identify the viral selection and predict the emergence of new viral clades? Inspired by the Kolmogorov complexity concept, we propose a generative complexity (algorithmic) framework capable to analyze the viral RNA sequences by mapping the multiscale nucleotide dependencies onto a state machine, where states represent subsequences of nucleotides and state-transition probabilities encode the higher order interactions between these states. We apply computational learning and classification techniques to identify the active state-transitions and use those as features in clade classifiers to decipher the transient mutations (still evolving within a clade) and stable mutations (typical to a clade). As opposed to current analysis tools that rely on the edit distance between sequences and require sequence alignment, our method is computationally local, does not require sequence alignment and is robust to random errors (substitution, insertions and deletions). Relying on the GISAID viral sequence database, we demonstrate that our method can predict clade emergence, potentially aiding with the design of medications and vaccines.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Siddharth Jain","author_inst":"California Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Xiongye Xiao","author_inst":"University of Southern California"},{"author_name":"Paul Bogdan","author_inst":"University of Southern California"},{"author_name":"Jehoshua Bruck","author_inst":"Caltech"},{"author_name":"Olumide T Arege","author_inst":"University of Ibadan, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Adedayo O Faneye","author_inst":"University of Ibadan, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Jonathan L.

While the importance of traditional in silico approaches such as QSAR in such efforts in unquestionable, these models fundamentally rely on structural similarity to infer biological activity and are thus prone to becoming trapped in the very nearby chemical spaces of already known ligands. For novel and unprecedented threats such as COVID-19 much faster and efficient paradigms must be devised to accelerate the identification of new chemical classes for rapid drug development. Here we report the development of a new biological activity-based modeling (BABM) approach that builds on the hypothesis that compounds with similar activity patterns tend to share similar targets or mechanisms of action. In BABM, compound activity profiles established on massive scale across multiple assays are used as signatures to predict compound activity in a new assay or against a new target. We first trained and validated this approach by identifying new antiviral lead candidates for Zika and Ebola based on data from ~0.5 million compounds screened against ~2,000 assays. BABM models were then applied to predict ~300 compounds not previously reported to have activity for SARS-CoV-2, which were then tested in a live virus assay with high (>30%) hit rates. The most potent compounds showed antiviral activities in the nanomolar range. These potent confirmed compounds have the potential to be further developed in novel chemical space into new anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies. These results demonstrate unprecedented ability using BABM to predict novel structures as chemical leads significantly beyond traditional methods, and its application in rapid drug discovery response in a global public health crisis.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ruili Huang","author_inst":"NCATS"},{"author_name":"Miao Xu","author_inst":"NCATS"},{"author_name":"Hu Zhu","author_inst":"NCATS\/NIH"},{"author_name":"Catherine Z Chen","author_inst":"NCATS"},{"author_name":"Emily Lee","author_inst":"NCATS"},{"author_name":"Shihua He","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Canada"},{"author_name":"Khalida Shamim","author_inst":"NCATS"},{"author_name":"Danielle Bougie","author_inst":"NCATS"},{"author_name":"Wenwei Huang","author_inst":"NCATS"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hall","author_inst":"NCATS"},{"author_name":"Donald Lo","author_inst":"NCATS"},{"author_name":"Anton Simeonov","author_inst":"NCATS"},{"author_name":"Chris Austin","author_inst":"NHGRI\/NIH"},{"author_name":"Xiangguo Qiu","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Canada"},{"author_name":"Hengli Tang","author_inst":"Florida State University"},{"author_name":"Wei Zheng","author_inst":"NCATS"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Norihito Muranaka","author_inst":"Encodia Inc, San Diego, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Mark S Chee","author_inst":"Encodia Inc, San Diego, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Sergey A Shiryaev","author_inst":"Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"John A Altin","author_inst":"The Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen), Phoenix and Flagstaff, AZ, USA"},{"author_name":"Phillip Belgrader","author_inst":"10X Genomics, Inc"},{"author_name":"Solongo B.

Thus, a vaccine is urgently needed to contain the spread of the virus. Here, we describe Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vector vaccines expressing the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in its wild type or a pre-fusion membrane anchored format. All described NDV vector vaccines grow to high titers in embryonated chicken eggs. In a proof of principle mouse study, we report that the NDV vector vaccines elicit high levels of antibodies that are neutralizing when the vaccine is given intramuscularly. Importantly, these COVID-19 vaccine candidates protect mice from a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 challenge with no detectable viral titer and viral antigen in the lungs.\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe spike (S) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 is the major antigen that notably induces neutralizing antibodies to block viral entry. Many COVID-19 vaccines are under development, among them viral vectors expressing the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 exhibit many benefits. Viral vector vaccines have the potential of being used as both live or inactivated vaccines and they can induce Th1 and Th2-based immune responses following different immunization regimens. Additionally, viral vector vaccines can be handled under BSL-2 conditions and they grow to high titers in cell cultures or other species restricted-hosts. For a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, several viral vectors are being tested, such as adenovirus, measles virus and Modified vaccinia Ankara.\n\nAdded value of this studyThe NDV vector vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 described in this study has advantages similar to those of other viral vector vaccines. But the NDV vector can be amplified in embryonated chicken eggs, which allows for high yields and low costs per dose. Also, the NDV vector is not a human pathogen, therefore the delivery of the foreign antigen would not be compromised by any pre-existing immunity in humans. Finally, NDV has a very good safety record in humans, as it has been used in many oncolytic virus trials. This study provides an important option for a cost-effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceThis study informs of the value of a viral vector vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, for this NDV based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, the existing egg-based influenza virus vaccine manufactures in the U.S. and worldwide would have the capacity to rapidly produce hundreds of millions of doses to mitigate the consequences of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Weina Sun","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sarah R Leist","author_inst":"University of North Carolina"},{"author_name":"Stephen McCroskery","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Yonghong Liu","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Stefan Slamanig","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Justine Oliva","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Fatima Amanat","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Schaefer","author_inst":"University of North Carolina"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Dinnon III","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Garcia-Sastre","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Ralph S.

Whilst RA is not a viral respiratory syndrome, it represents a pro-inflammatory cytokine-driven chronic articular condition often accompanied by cardiovascular and lung pathologies. We hypothesised that functionally equivalent macrophage clusters in the lung might govern inflammation and resolution of COVID-19 pneumonitis.\n\nMethodsTo provide insight into the targetable functions of COVID-19 bronchoalveolar lavage (BALF) macrophage clusters, a comparative analysis of BALF macrophage single cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq) with synovial tissue (ST) macrophage scRNA-seq and functional biology was performed. The function of shared BALF and ST MerTK inflammation-resolving pathway was confirmed with inhibitor in primary macrophage-synovial fibroblast co-cultures. Results. Distinct BALF FCNpos and FCNposSPP1pos macrophage clusters emerging in severe COVID-19 patients were closely related to ST CD48highS100A12pos and CD48posSPP1pos clusters driving synovitis in active RA. They shared transcriptomic profile and pathogenic mechanisms. Healthy lung resident alveolar FABP4pos macrophages shared a regulatory transcriptomic profile, including TAM (Tyro, Axl, MerTK) receptors pathway with synovial tissue TREM2pos macrophages that govern RA remission. This pathway was substantially altered in BALF macrophages of severe COVID-19. In vitro dexamethasone inhibited tissue inflammation via macrophages MerTK function.\n\nConclusionPathogenesis and resolution of COVID-19 pneumonitis and RA synovitis might be driven by similar macrophage clusters and pathways. The MerTK-dependent anti-inflammatory mechanisms of dexamethasone, and the homeostatic function of TAM pathways that maintain RA in remission advocate the therapeutic MerTK agonism to ameliorate the cytokine storm and pneumonitis of severe COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lucy MacDonald","author_inst":"Research into Inflammatory Arthritis Centre Versus Arthritis (RACE), University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Thomas Dan Otto","author_inst":"Research into Inflammatory Arthritis Centre Versus Arthritis (RACE), University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Aziza Elmesmari","author_inst":"Research into Inflammatory Arthritis Centre Versus Arthritis (RACE) ,University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Barbara Tolusso","author_inst":"Division of Rheumatology, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Domenico Somma","author_inst":"Institute of Infection, Immunity, and Inflammation, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom."},{"author_name":"Charles McSharry","author_inst":"Institute of Infection, Immunity, and Inflammation, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom."},{"author_name":"Elisa Gremese","author_inst":"Division of Rheumatology, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

The highly contagious nature of this respiratory virus has spurred massive global efforts to develop vaccines at record speeds. In addition to enhanced immunogen delivery, adjuvants may greatly impact protective efficacy of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. To investigate adjuvant suitability, we formulated protein subunit vaccines consisting of the recombinant S1 domain of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein alone or in combination with either CoVaccine HT or Alhydrogel. CoVaccine HT induced high titres of antigen-binding IgG after a single dose, facilitated affinity maturation and class switching to a greater extent than Alhydrogel and elicited potent cell-mediated immunity as well as virus neutralising antibody titres. Data presented here suggests that adjuvantation with CoVaccine HT can rapidly induce a comprehensive and protective immune response to SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brien K Haun","author_inst":"University of Hawaii at Manoa \/ John A.

Worldwide circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in humans raises the theoretical risk of reverse zoonosis events with wildlife, reintroductions of SARS-CoV-2 into permissive non-domesticated animals, potentially seeding new host reservoir species and geographic regions in which bat SARS-like coronaviruses have not historically been endemic. Here we report that North American deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) and some closely related members of the Cricetidae family of rodents possess key amino acid residues within the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor known to confer SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding. Peromyscus rodent species are widely distributed across North America and are the primary host reservoirs of several emerging pathogens that repeatedly spill over into humans including Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, deer tick virus, and Sin Nombre orthohantavirus, the causative agent of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). We demonstrate that adult deer mice are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection following intranasal exposure to a human isolate, resulting in viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract with little or no signs of disease. Further, shed infectious virus is detectable in nasal washes, oropharyngeal and rectal swabs, and viral RNA is detectable in feces and occasionally urine. We further show that deer mice are capable of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to naive deer mice through direct contact. The extent to which these observations may translate to wild deer mouse populations remains unclear, and the risk of reverse zoonosis and\/or the potential for the establishment of Peromyscus rodents as a North American reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 is unknown. Nevertheless, efforts to monitor wild, peri-domestic Peromyscus rodent populations are likely warranted as the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic progresses.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bryan D Griffin","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Canada"},{"author_name":"Mable Chan","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Canada"},{"author_name":"Nikesh Tailor","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Canada"},{"author_name":"Emelissa J Mendoza","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Canada"},{"author_name":"Anders Leung","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Canada"},{"author_name":"Bryce M Warner","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Canada"},{"author_name":"Ana T Duggan","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Canada"},{"author_name":"Estella Moffat","author_inst":"Canadian Food Inspection Agency"},{"author_name":"Shihua He","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Canada"},{"author_name":"Lauren Garnett","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Canada"},{"author_name":"Kaylie N Tran","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Canada"},{"author_name":"Logan Banadyga","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Canada"},{"author_name":"Alixandra Albietz","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Canada"},{"author_name":"Kevin Tierney","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Canada"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Audet","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Canada"},{"author_name":"Alexander Bello","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Canada"},{"author_name":"Robert Vendramelli","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Canada"},{"author_name":"Amrit S Boese","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Canada"},{"author_name":"Lisa Fernando","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Canada"},{"author_name":"L Robbin Lindsay","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Canada"},{"author_name":"Claire M Jardine","author_inst":"University of Guelph"},{"author_name":"Heidi Wood","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Canada"},{"author_name":"Guillaume Poliquin","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Canada"},{"author_name":"James E Strong","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Canada"},{"author_name":"Michael Drebot","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Canada"},{"author_name":"David Safronetz","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Canada"},{"author_name":"Carissa Embury-Hyatt","author_inst":"Canadian Food Inspection Agency"},{"author_name":"Darwyn Kobasa","author_inst":"Public Health Agency of Canada"},{"author_name":"Ralph S.

Thus, it is critical to identify compounds able to inhibit virus replication and thwart the excessive inflammatory reaction and tissue lesions secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we show that the neuropeptides VIP and PACAP, molecules endowed with immunoregulatory properties, were able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis\/replication in human monocytes and viral production in lung epithelial cells. VIP and PACAP protected these cells from virus-induced cytopathicity, reduced the production of proinflammmatory mediators, and prevented the SARS-CoV-2-induced NF-kB activation, which is critically involved in the production of inflammatory mediators. Both neuropeptides promoted CREB activation in infected monocytes, a transcription factor with antiapoptotic activity and also a negative regulator of NF-kB. As a possible host response to control patient inflammation, we identified that VIP levels were elevated in plasma from patients with severe forms of COVID-19, correlating with the inflammatory marker CRP and survival on those patients. Since a synthetic form of VIP is clinically approved in Europe and under two clinical trials for patients with COVID-19, our results provide the scientific evidence to further support clinical investigation of these neuropeptides against COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jairo R.

Here, we aim to describe the characteristics of COVID-19 patients at disease onset, with special focus on the diagnosis and management of female patients with COVID-19. Methods: We explored the unstructured free text in the electronic health records (EHRs) within the SESCAM Healthcare Network (Castilla La-Mancha, Spain). The study sample comprised the entire population with available EHRs (1,446,452 patients) from January 1st to May 1st, 2020. We extracted patients' clinical information upon diagnosis, progression, and outcome for all COVID-19 cases. Results: A total of 4,780 patients with a test-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were identified. Of these, 2,443 (51%) were female, who were on average 1.5 years younger than males (61.7{+\/-}19.4 vs. 63.3{+\/-}18.3, p=0.0025). There were more female COVID-19 cases in the 15-59 yr.-old interval, with the greatest sex ratio (SR; 95% CI) observed in the 30-39 yr.-old interval (1.69; 1.35-2.11). Upon diagnosis, headache, anosmia, and ageusia were significantly more frequent in females than males. Imaging by chest X-ray or blood tests were performed less frequently in females (65.5% vs. 78.3% and 49.5% vs. 63.7%, respectively), all p<0.001. Regarding hospital resource use, females showed less frequency of hospitalization (44.3% vs. 62.0%) and ICU admission (2.8% vs. 6.3%) than males, all p<0.001. Conclusion: Our results indicate important sex-dependent differences in the diagnosis, clinical manifestation, and treatment of patients with COVID-19. These results warrant further research to identify and close the gender gap in the ongoing pandemic.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julio Ancochea","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario de La Princesa (Madrid, Spain), Universidad Autonoma (Madrid, Spain), & Centro de Investigacion en Red de Enfermedades Respiratorias (CIB"},{"author_name":"Jose L.

We utilized multiple antibody testing platforms, including lateral flow immunoassays (LFAs), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and high throughput serological assays (HTSAs). We report than an estimated seropositive rate of RI blood donors of approximately 0.6% existed in April-May of 2020. These data imply that seroconversion, and thus infection, is likely not widespread within this population. Daily new case rates peaked in RI in late April 2020.

Its findings provide insight to clinicians regarding the management of COVID-19, particularly with the known prothrombotic state. Research Question: To determine the impact of anticoagulation on in-hospital mortality among COVID-19 positive patients with the a priori hypothesis that there would be a lower risk of in-hospital mortality with use of preemptive therapeutic over prophylactic dose enoxaparin or heparin. Study Design and Methods: Study Design: Retrospective cohort study from April 1 - April 25, 2020. The date of final follow-up was June 12, 2020. Setting: Two large, acute care hospitals in Western Connecticut. Participants: Five hundred and one inpatients were identified after discharge as 18 years or older and positive for SARS-CoV-2. The final sample size included 374 patients after applying exclusion criteria. Demographic variables were collected via hospital billing inquiries, while the clinical variables were abstracted from patients medical records. Exposure: Preemptive enoxaparin or heparin at a therapeutic or prophylactic dose. Main Outcome: In-hospital mortality. Results: When comparing preemptive therapeutic to prophylactic anticoagulation through multi-variable analysis, risk of in-hospital mortality was 2.3 times greater in patients receiving preemptive therapeutic anticoagulation (95% CI = 1.0, 4.9; p = 0.04). Interpretation: An increase in in-hospital mortality was observed with preemptive therapeutic anticoagulation. Thus, in the management of COVID-19 and its complications, we recommend further research and cautious use of preemptive therapeutic over prophylactic anticoagulation.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jishu K Motta","author_inst":"Danbury Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rahila O Ogunnaike","author_inst":"Danbury Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rutvik Shah","author_inst":"Danbury Hospital"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Stroever","author_inst":"Danbury Hospital"},{"author_name":"Harold V Cedeno","author_inst":"Danbury Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shyam K Thapa","author_inst":"Danbury Hospital"},{"author_name":"John J Chronakos","author_inst":"Danbury Hospital"},{"author_name":"Eric J Jimenez","author_inst":"Danbury Hospital"},{"author_name":"Joann Petrini","author_inst":"Danbury Hospital"},{"author_name":"Abhijith Hegde","author_inst":"Danbury Hospital"},{"author_name":"Larry L Luchsinger","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Fernando A.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been proposed as a postexposure therapy to prevent Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) but definitive evidence is lacking. Methods We conducted an open-label, cluster-randomized trial including asymptomatic contacts exposed to a PCR-positive Covid-19 case in Catalonia, Spain. Clusters were randomized to receive no specific therapy (control arm) or HCQ 800mg once, followed by 400mg daily for 6 days (intervention arm). The primary outcome was PCR-confirmed symptomatic Covid-19 within 14 days. The secondary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection, either symptomatically compatible or a PCR-positive result regardless of symptoms. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed up to 28 days. Results The analysis included 2,314 healthy contacts of 672 Covid-19 index cases identified between Mar 17 and Apr 28, 2020. A total of 1,198 were randomly allocated to usual care and 1,116 to HCQ therapy. There was no significant difference in the primary outcome of PCR-confirmed, symptomatic Covid-19 disease (6.2% usual care vs. 5.7% HCQ; risk ratio 0.89 [95% confidence interval 0.54-1.46]), nor evidence of beneficial effects on prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission (17.8% usual care vs. 18.7% HCQ). The incidence of AEs was higher in the intervention arm than in the control arm (5.9% usual care vs 51.6% HCQ), but no treatment-related serious AEs were reported. Conclusions Postexposure therapy with HCQ did not prevent SARS-CoV-2 disease and infection in healthy individuals exposed to a PCR-positive case. Our findings do not support HCQ as postexposure prophylaxis for Covid-19.","rel_num_authors":49,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Oriol Mitja","author_inst":"1.

The early epidemic \"wave\" affected countries which now report a few sporadic cases, achieving a stable late phase of the epidemic. Other countries are beginning their epidemic expansion phase. The objective of our study is to characterize the dynamics of the COVID-19 spread. Data science methods were applied to pandemic, focusing on the daily fatality in 24 countries with more than 2,000 deaths, our analysis kin the end retaining 14 countries that have completed a full cycle. The analysis demonstrates a COVID-19 dynamic similar in these studied countries. This 3-phase dynamic is like that of common viral respiratory infections. This pattern, however, shows variability and therefore specificity which the method categorizes into clusters of \"differentiated epidemic patterns\". Among the 5 detected clusters, 2 main ones regroup 11 of these countries, representing 65% of the world deaths (as of June 24, 2020). The pattern seems common to a very large number of countries, and congruent with that of epidemics of other respiratory syndromes, opens the hypothesis that the COVID-19 pandemic would have developed its \"natural history\" by spreading spontaneously despite the measures taken to contain it. The diversity highlighted by the classification into \"formal clusters\" suggests explanations involving the notion of demographic and geographic epicenters.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julien Krywyk","author_inst":"Well&Wiz, Paris, F-75001, France"},{"author_name":"Walther Oettgen","author_inst":"Well&Wiz, Paris, F-75001, France"},{"author_name":"Marc Messier","author_inst":"GMAP SAS (Global Medical Affairs &Partners), Mulhouse, F-68100, France"},{"author_name":"Matthieu Mulot","author_inst":"Laboratory of Soil Biodiversity, University of Neuchatel, 2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Laurent Toubiana","author_inst":"INSERM, UMR_S1142, LIMICS, F-75006, France"},{"author_name":"Cristian Tebe","author_inst":"Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Spain"},{"author_name":"Aurelio Tobias","author_inst":"Institute of Environmental Assessment and Water Research (IDAEA), Spanish Council for Scientific Research (CSIC), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Judith Penafiel","author_inst":"Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ester Ballana","author_inst":"IrsiCaixa AIDS Research Institute, Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute (IGTP), Badalona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Carla A Perez","author_inst":"Fight AIDS and Infectious Diseases Foundation, Badalona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Pol Admella","author_inst":"Fight AIDS and Infectious Diseases Foundation, Badalona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Nuria Riera-Marti","author_inst":"Fight AIDS and Infectious Diseases Foundation, Badalona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Pep Laporte","author_inst":"Fight AIDS and Infectious Diseases Foundation, Badalona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Jordi Mitja","author_inst":"Fight AIDS and Infectious Diseases Foundation, Badalona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Mireia Clua","author_inst":"Fight AIDS and Infectious Diseases Foundation, Badalona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Laia Bertran","author_inst":"Fight AIDS and Infectious Diseases Foundation, Badalona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Sergi Gavilan","author_inst":"Fight AIDS and Infectious Diseases Foundation, Badalona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Jordi Ara","author_inst":"Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona Spain"},{"author_name":"Maria Sarquella","author_inst":"Fight AIDS and Infectious Diseases Foundation, Badalona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Josep M Argimon","author_inst":"Direccio-gerencia, Institut Catala de la Salut, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Cuatrecasas","author_inst":"Equip atencio primaria de Sarria, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Paz Canadas","author_inst":"SYNLAB, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Aleix Elizalde-Torrent","author_inst":"IrsiCaixa AIDS Research Institute, Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute (IGTP), Badalona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Robert Fabregat","author_inst":"Direccio General de Recerca i Innovacio en Salut, Generalitat de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Magi Farre","author_inst":"Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona Spain"},{"author_name":"Anna Forcada","author_inst":"Gerencia territorial de Catalunya Central, Institut Catala de la Salut, St. Fruitos de Bages, Spain"},{"author_name":"Gemma Flores-Mateo","author_inst":"Xarxa Santa Tecla Sanitaria i Social.

It is applicable at the onset and spreading of the epidemic and can forewarn for a possible recurrence of the disease after relaxation of interventions. We examine its application in Switzerland and show that it can provide timely and systematic guidance for the effective identification of infectious individuals with finite testing resources.

We used publicly available datasets on daily COVID-19 case counts (total n = 108,308), three-hourly meteorological data and community mobility data over a three-month period. Estimated R0 varied between 1.15-1.28. Mean daily air temperature (inversely) and wind speed (positively) were significantly associated with time dependent R0, but the contribution of countrywide lockdown to variability in R0 was over three times stronger as compared to that of temperature and wind speed combined.

The distribution of viral loads in individuals with and without symptoms remains uncertain. Comprehensive cross-sectional screening of all individuals in a given setting provides an unbiased way to assess viral loads independent of symptoms, which informs transmission risks. COVID-19 cases initially peaked in Massachusetts in mid-April 2020 before declining through June, and congregate living facilities were particularly affected during this early surge. We performed a retrospective analysis of data from a large public health-directed outbreak response initiative that involved comprehensive screening within nursing homes and assisted living facilities in Massachusetts to compare nasopharyngeal (NP) viral loads (as measured by RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) levels) in residents and staff to inform our ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 in individuals with or without symptoms in the population. Methods Between April 9 and June 9, 2020, we tested NP swabs from 32,480 unique individuals comprising staff and residents of the majority of nursing homes and assisted living facilities in Massachusetts. Under the direction of the MA Department of Public Health (MDPH), symptomatology at the time of sampling and demographic information was provided by each facility for each individual to facilitate reporting to health officials. NP swabs were collected, RNA extracted, and SARS-CoV-2 testing performed using quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results The nursing home and assisted living facilities resident cohort (N =16,966) was 65% female with a mean age of 82 years (SD 13 yrs). The staff cohort (N = 15,514) was 76% female with a median age of 45 (SD 15 yrs). A total 2654 residents (15.5%) and 624 staff (4.1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. 12.7% of residents and 3.7% of staff without symptoms tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, compared to 53.1% of residents and 18.2% of staff with symptoms. Of the individuals who tested positive, 70.8% of residents and 92.4% of staff lacked symptoms at the time of testing. In aggregate, the distributions of Cts for viral probes used in the qRT-PCR assay were very similar, with a statistically but not meaningfully different mean ({triangleup}Ct 0.71 cycles, p = 0.006) and a similar range (12-38 cycles), between populations with and without symptoms over the entire time period, across all sub-categories examined (age, race, ethnicity, sex, resident\/staff). Importantly, the Ct mean values and range were indistinguishable between the populations by symptom class during the peak of the outbreak in Massachusetts, with a Ct gap appearing only later in the survey period, reaching >3 cycles (p [&le;] 0.001) for facilities sampled during the last two weeks of the study. Conclusions In a large cohort of individuals screened for SARS-CoV-2 by qRT-PCR, we found strikingly similar distributions of viral load in patients with or without symptoms at the time of testing during the local peak of the epidemic; as the epidemic waned, individuals without symptoms at the time of testing had lower viral loads. The size of the study population, including both staff and residents spanning a wide range of ages, provides a comprehensive cross-sectional point prevalence measurement of viral burden in a study spanning 2 months. Because the distributions of viral loads in infected individuals irrespective of symptomatology are very similar, existing testing modalities that have been validated for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in symptomatic patients should perform similarly in individuals without symptoms at the time of testing.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Niall J Lennon","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Roby P Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Michael J Mina","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Heidi L Rehm","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Deborah T Hung","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Sandra Smole","author_inst":"State Public Health Laboratory, Massachusetts Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Ann Woolley","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Eric S Lander","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Stacey B Gabriel","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Carla A Perez","author_inst":"Fight AIDS and Infectious Diseases Foundation, Badalona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Pol Admella","author_inst":"Fight AIDS and Infectious Diseases Foundation, Badalona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Nuria Riera-Marti","author_inst":"Fight AIDS and Infectious Diseases Foundation, Badalona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Pep Laporte","author_inst":"Fight AIDS and Infectious Diseases Foundation, Badalona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Jordi Mitja","author_inst":"Fight AIDS and Infectious Diseases Foundation, Badalona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Mireia Clua","author_inst":"Fight AIDS and Infectious Diseases Foundation, Badalona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Laia Bertran","author_inst":"Fight AIDS and Infectious Diseases Foundation, Badalona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Sergi Gavilan","author_inst":"Fight AIDS and Infectious Diseases Foundation, Badalona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Jordi Ara","author_inst":"Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona Spain"},{"author_name":"Maria Sarquella","author_inst":"Fight AIDS and Infectious Diseases Foundation, Badalona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Josep M Argimon","author_inst":"Direccio-gerencia, Institut Catala de la Salut, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Cuatrecasas","author_inst":"Equip atencio primaria de Sarria, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Paz Canadas","author_inst":"SYNLAB, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Aleix Elizalde-Torrent","author_inst":"IrsiCaixa AIDS Research Institute, Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute (IGTP), Badalona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Robert Fabregat","author_inst":"Direccio General de Recerca i Innovacio en Salut, Generalitat de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Magi Farre","author_inst":"Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona Spain"},{"author_name":"Anna Forcada","author_inst":"Gerencia territorial de Catalunya Central, Institut Catala de la Salut, St. Fruitos de Bages, Spain"},{"author_name":"Gemma Flores-Mateo","author_inst":"Xarxa Santa Tecla Sanitaria i Social.
