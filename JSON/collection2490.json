We exploited the availability of a large number of high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes, as well as of validated epitope predictions, to show that B cell epitopes in the spike glycoprotein (S) and in the nucleocapsid protein (N) have higher diversity than non-epitope positions. Similar results were obtained for other human coronaviruses. Conversely, in the SARS-CoV-2 population, epitopes for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were not more variable than non-epitope positions. A significant reduction in epitope variability was instead observed for some of the most immunogenic proteins (S, N, ORF8, and ORF3a). Analysis over longer evolutionary time-frames indicated that this effect is not due to differential constraints. These data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is evolving to elude the host humoral immune response, whereas recognition by T cells might benefit the virus.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Diego Forni","author_inst":"Scientific Institute IRCCS E.

Catalase assists to regulate production of cytokines, protect oxidative injury, and repress replication of SARS-CoV-2, as demonstrated in human leukocytes and alveolar epithelial cells, and rhesus macaques, without noticeable toxicity.

Herein, we compare the performance of four NGS-based approaches for SARS-CoV-2 WGS. Twenty four clinical respiratory samples with a large scale of Ct values (from 10.7 to 33.9) were sequenced with four methods. Three used Illumina sequencing: an in-house metagenomic NGS (mNGS) protocol and two newly commercialized kits including a hybridization capture method developed by Illumina (DNA Prep with Enrichment kit and Respiratory Virus Oligo Panel, RVOP) and an amplicon sequencing method developed by Paragon Genomics (CleanPlex SARS-CoV-2 kit). We also evaluated the widely used amplicon sequencing protocol developed by ARTIC Network and combined with Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing. All four methods yielded near-complete genomes (>99%) for high viral loads samples, with mNGS and RVOP producing the most complete genomes. For mid viral loads, 2\/8 and 1\/8 genomes were incomplete (<99%) with mNGS and both CleanPlex and RVOP, respectively. For low viral loads (Ct [&ge;]25), amplicon-based enrichment methods were the most sensitive techniques yielding complete genomes for 7\/8 samples. All methods were highly concordant in terms of identity in complete consensus sequence. Just one mismatch in two samples was observed in CleanPlex vs the other methods, due to the dedicated bioinformatics pipeline setting a high threshold to call SNP compared to reference sequence. Importantly, all methods correctly identified a newly observed 34-nt deletion in ORF6 but required specific bioinformatic validation for RVOP. Finally, as a major warning for targeted techniques, a default of coverage in any given region of the genome should alert to a potential rearrangement or a SNP in primer annealing or probe-hybridizing regions and would require regular updates of the technique according to SARS-CoV-2 evolution.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Caroline Charre","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Christophe Ginevra","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Marina Sabatier","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Hadrien Regue","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Solenne Brun","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Gwendolyne Burfin","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Caroline Scholtes","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Florence Morfin","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Martine Valette","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Bruno Lina","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Antonin Bal","author_inst":"Hospices civils de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Laurence Josset","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Zhenbo Ning","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Kaili Nie","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Ni Jiang","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhen Liu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Jun Wu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Yanting Yu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Heng Li","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Huiwen Zheng","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Weihua Jin","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sheng Pan","author_inst":"Vivibaba, Inc."},{"author_name":"Shuai Wang","author_inst":"Vivibaba Inc."},{"author_name":"Jianfeng Chen","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhihua Gan","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhanlong He","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences,"},{"author_name":"Yunfeng Lu","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.15.204602","rel_title":"Evidence of SARS-CoV2 entry protein ACE2 in the human nose and olfactory bulb","rel_date":"2020-07-15","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.15.204602","rel_abs":"Usually, pandemic COVID-19 disease, caused by SARS-CoV2, presents with mild respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough but frequently also with anosmia and neurological symptom. Virus-cell fusion is mediated by Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) with their organ expression pattern determining viral tropism. Clinical presentation suggests rapid viral dissemination to central nervous system leading frequently to severe symptoms including viral meningitis. Here, we provide a comprehensive expression landscape of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins across human, post-mortem nasal and olfactory tissue. Sagittal sections through the human nose complemented with immunolabelling of respective cell types represent different anatomically defined regions including olfactory epithelium, respiratory epithelium of the nasal conchae and the paranasal sinuses along with the hardly accessible human olfactory bulb. ACE2 can be detected in the olfactory epithelium, as well as in the respiratory epithelium of the nasal septum, the nasal conchae and the paranasal sinuses. ACE2 is located in the sustentacular cells and in the glandular cells in the olfactory epithelium, as well as in the basal cells, glandular cells and epithelial cells of the respiratory epithelium. Intriguingly, ACE2 is not expressed in mature or immature olfactory receptor neurons and basal cells in the olfactory epithelium. Similarly ACE2 is not localized in the olfactory receptor neurons albeit the olfactory bulb is positive. Vice versa, TMPRSS2 can also be detected in the sustentacular cells and the glandular cells of the olfactory epithelium.\n\nOur findings provide the basic anatomical evidence for the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the human nose, olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb. Thus, they are substantial for future studies that aim to elucidate the symptom of SARS-CoV2 induced anosmia of via the olfactory pathway.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Moritz Klingenstein","author_inst":"Institute of Neuroanatomy and Developmental Biology, Eberhard Karls University Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Stefanie Klingenstein","author_inst":"Institute of Neuroanatomy and Developmental Biology, Eberhard Karls University Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Peter Helmut Neckel","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Anatomy and Cell Analysis, Eberhard Karls University Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas F Mack","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Anatomy and Cell Analysis, Eberhard Karls University Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Peter Wagner","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Anatomy and Cell Analysis, Eberhard Karls University Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Alexander Kleger","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine I, University Medical Center Ulm, Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Stefan Liebau","author_inst":"Institute of Neuroanatomy and Developmental Biology, Eberhard Karls University Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Alfio Milazzo","author_inst":"Institute of Neuroanatomy and Developmental Biology, Eberhard Karls University Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Martine Valette","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Bruno Lina","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Antonin Bal","author_inst":"Hospices civils de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Laurence Josset","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Zhenbo Ning","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Kaili Nie","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Ni Jiang","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhen Liu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Jun Wu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Yanting Yu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Heng Li","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Huiwen Zheng","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Weihua Jin","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sheng Pan","author_inst":"Vivibaba, Inc."},{"author_name":"Shuai Wang","author_inst":"Vivibaba Inc."},{"author_name":"Jianfeng Chen","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhihua Gan","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhanlong He","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences,"},{"author_name":"Yunfeng Lu","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"cell biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.15.203059","rel_title":"The Effect Of Famotidine On SARS-CoV-2 Proteases And Virus Replication","rel_date":"2020-07-15","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.15.203059","rel_abs":"The lack of coronavirus-specific antiviral drugs has instigated multiple drug repurposing studies to redirect previously approved medicines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus behind the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. A recent, large-scale, retrospective clinical study showed that famotidine, when administered at a high dose to hospitalized COVID-19 patients, reduced the rates of intubation and mortality. A separate, patient-reported study associated famotidine use with improvements in mild to moderate symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath. While a prospective, multi-center clinical study is ongoing, two parallel in silico studies have proposed one of the two SARS-CoV-2 proteases, 3CLpro or PLpro, as potential molecular targets of famotidine activity; however, this remains to be experimentally validated. In this report, we systematically analyzed the effect of famotidine on viral proteases and virus replication. Leveraging a series of biophysical and enzymatic assays, we show that famotidine neither binds with nor inhibits the functions of 3CLpro and PLpro. Similarly, no direct antiviral activity of famotidine was observed at concentrations of up to 200 M, when tested against SARS-CoV-2 in two different cell lines, including a human cell line originating from lungs, a primary target of COVID-19. These results rule out famotidine as a direct-acting inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 replication and warrant further investigation of its molecular mechanism of action in the context of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Madeline Loffredo","author_inst":"Bisect Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Hector Lucero","author_inst":"Bisect Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Da-Yuan Chen","author_inst":"Boston University"},{"author_name":"Simon Bergqvist","author_inst":"Biofizik, Inc."},{"author_name":"Ahmad Munawar","author_inst":"Bisect Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Asanga Bandara","author_inst":"Bisect Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Steff DeGraef","author_inst":"Bisect Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Stephen D.

Typically, the fastest route to identifying and licensing a safe and effective antiviral drug is to test those already shown safe in early clinical trials for other infections or diseases. Here, we tested in vitro oleandrin, derived from the Nerium oleander plant and shown previously to have inhibitory activity against several viruses. Using Vero cells, we found that prophylactic oleandrin administration at concentrations down to 0.05 g\/ml exhibited potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, with an 800-fold reduction in virus production, and a 0.1 g\/ml dose resulted in a greater than 3,000-fold reduction in infectious virus production. The EC50 values were 11.98ng\/ml when virus output was measured at 24 hours post-infection, and 7.07ng\/ml measured at 48 hours post-infection. Therapeutic (post-infection) treatment up to 24 hours after infection of Vero cells also reduced viral titers, with the 0.1 g\/ml dose causing greater than 100-fold reductions as measured at 48 hours, and the 0.05 g\/ml dose resulting in a 78-fold reduction. The potent prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral activities demonstrated here strongly support the further development of oleandrin to reduce the severity of COVID-19 and potentially also to reduce spread by persons diagnosed early after infection.\n\nIMPORTANCECOVID-19, a pandemic disease caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, has swept around the world to cause millions of infections and hundreds-of-thousands of deaths due to the lack of vaccines and effective therapeutics. We tested oleandrin, derived from the Nerium oleander plant and shown previously to reduce the replication of several viruses, against SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero cells. When administered both before and after virus infection, nanogram doses of oleandrin significantly inhibited replication by up to 3,000-fold, indicating the potential to prevent disease and virus spread in persons recently exposed to SARS-CoV-2, as well as to prevent severe disease in persons at high risk. These results indicate that oleandrin should be tested in animal models and in humans exposed to infection to determine its medical usefulness in controlling the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kenneth S Plante","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Jessica A Plante","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Diana Fernandez","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Divya Mirchandani","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Nathen E Bopp","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston"},{"author_name":"Patricia V Aguilar","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"K Jagannadha Sastry","author_inst":"University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Robert A Newman","author_inst":"University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Phoenix Biotechnology, Inc."},{"author_name":"Scott C Weaver","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Mohsan Saeed","author_inst":"Boston University"},{"author_name":"Ali H Munawar","author_inst":"Bisect Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Laurence Josset","author_inst":"HCL"},{"author_name":"Zhenbo Ning","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Kaili Nie","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Ni Jiang","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhen Liu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Jun Wu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Yanting Yu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Heng Li","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Huiwen Zheng","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Weihua Jin","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sheng Pan","author_inst":"Vivibaba, Inc."},{"author_name":"Shuai Wang","author_inst":"Vivibaba Inc."},{"author_name":"Jianfeng Chen","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhihua Gan","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhanlong He","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences,"},{"author_name":"Yunfeng Lu","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.15.204404","rel_title":"A direct RNA-protein interaction atlas of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in infected human cells","rel_date":"2020-07-15","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.15.204404","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 infections pose a global threat to human health and an unprecedented research challenge. Among the most urgent tasks is obtaining a detailed understanding of the molecular interactions that facilitate viral replication or contribute to host defense mechanisms in infected cells. While SARS-CoV-2 co-opts cellular factors for viral translation and genome replication, a comprehensive map of the host cell proteome in direct contact with viral RNA has not been elucidated. Here, we use RNA antisense purification and mass spectrometry (RAP-MS) to obtain an unbiased and quantitative picture of the human proteome that directly binds the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in infected human cells. We discover known host factors required for coronavirus replication, regulators of RNA metabolism and host defense pathways, along with dozens of potential drug targets among direct SARS-CoV-2 binders. We further integrate the SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome with proteome dynamics induced by viral infection, linking interactome proteins to the emerging biology of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Validating RAP-MS, we show that CNBP, a regulator of proinflammatory cytokines, directly engages the SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Supporting the functional relevance of identified interactors, we show that the interferon-induced protein RYDEN suppresses SARS-CoV-2 ribosomal frameshifting and demonstrate that inhibition of SARS-CoV-2-bound proteins is sufficient to manipulate viral replication. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome provides an unprecedented molecular perspective on SARS-CoV-2 infections and enables the systematic dissection of host dependency factors and host defense strategies, a crucial prerequisite for designing novel therapeutic strategies.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nora Schmidt","author_inst":"Helmholtz Institute for RNA-based Infection Research (HIRI), Helmholtz-Center for Infection Research (HZI), Wuerzburg"},{"author_name":"Caleb A Lareau","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Hasmik Keshishian","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Randy Melanson","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Matthias Zimmer","author_inst":"Helmholtz Institute for RNA-based Infection Research (HIRI), Helmholtz-Center for Infection Research (HZI), Wuerzburg"},{"author_name":"Luisa Kirschner","author_inst":"Institute for Virology and Immunobiology, Julius-Maximilians-University Wuerzburg"},{"author_name":"Jens Ade","author_inst":"Helmholtz Institute for RNA-based Infection Research (HIRI), Helmholtz-Center for Infection Research (HZI), Wuerzburg"},{"author_name":"Simone Werner","author_inst":"Helmholtz Institute for RNA-based Infection Research (HIRI), Helmholtz-Center for Infection Research (HZI), Wuerzburg"},{"author_name":"Neva Caliskan","author_inst":"Helmholtz Institute for RNA-based Infection Research (HIRI), Helmholtz-Center for Infection Research (HZI), Wuerzburg"},{"author_name":"Eric S Lander","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Joerg Vogel","author_inst":"Helmholtz Institute for RNA-based Infection Research (HIRI), Helmholtz-Center for Infection Research (HZI), Wuerzburg"},{"author_name":"Steven A Carr","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Jochen Bodem","author_inst":"Institute for Virology and Immunobiology, Julius-Maximilians-University Wuerzburg"},{"author_name":"Mathias Munschauer","author_inst":"Helmholtz Institute for RNA-based Infection Research (HIRI), Helmholtz-Center for Infection Research (HZI), Wuerzburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ni Jiang","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhen Liu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Jun Wu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Yanting Yu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Heng Li","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Huiwen Zheng","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Weihua Jin","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sheng Pan","author_inst":"Vivibaba, Inc."},{"author_name":"Shuai Wang","author_inst":"Vivibaba Inc."},{"author_name":"Jianfeng Chen","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhihua Gan","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhanlong He","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences,"},{"author_name":"Yunfeng Lu","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.15.205229","rel_title":"The S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 crosses the blood-brain barrier: Kinetics, distribution, mechanisms, and influence of ApoE genotype, sex, and inflammation","rel_date":"2020-07-15","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.15.205229","rel_abs":"Evidence strongly suggests that SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, can enter the brain. SARS-CoV-2 enters cells via the S1 subunit of its spike protein, and S1 can be used as a proxy for the uptake patterns and mechanisms used by the whole virus; unlike studies based on productive infection, viral proteins can be used to precisely determine pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. Here, we found that radioiodinated S1 (I-S1) readily crossed the murine blood-brain barrier (BBB). I-S1 from two commercial sources crossed the BBB with unidirectional influx constants of 0.287 {+\/-} 0.024 L\/g-min and 0.294 {+\/-} 0.032 L\/g-min and was also taken up by lung, spleen, kidney, and liver. I-S1 was uniformly taken up by all regions of the brain and inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide reduced uptake in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb. I-S1 crossed the BBB completely to enter the parenchymal brain space, with smaller amounts retained by brain endothelial cells and the luminal surface. Studies on the mechanisms of transport indicated that I-S1 crosses the BBB by the mechanism of adsorptive transcytosis and that the murine ACE2 receptor is involved in brain and lung uptake, but not that by kidney, liver, or spleen. I-S1 entered brain after intranasal administration at about 1\/10th the amount found after intravenous administration and about 0.66% of the intranasal dose entered blood.

In summary, I-S1 readily crosses the murine BBB, entering all brain regions and the peripheral tissues studied, likely by the mechanism of adsorptive transcytosis.\n\nGraphical Abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elizabeth M Rhea","author_inst":"VA\/UW"},{"author_name":"Aric F Logsdon","author_inst":"VA\/UW"},{"author_name":"Kim M Hansen","author_inst":"VA"},{"author_name":"Lindsey Williams","author_inst":"VA"},{"author_name":"May Reed","author_inst":"VA\/UW"},{"author_name":"Kristen Baumann","author_inst":"VA"},{"author_name":"Sarah Holden","author_inst":"OHSU"},{"author_name":"Jacob Raber","author_inst":"OHSU"},{"author_name":"William A Banks","author_inst":"VA\/UW"},{"author_name":"Michelle A Erickson","author_inst":"VA\/UW"},{"author_name":"Joerg Vogel","author_inst":"Helmholtz Institute for RNA-based Infection Research (HIRI), Helmholtz-Center for Infection Research (HZI), Wuerzburg"},{"author_name":"Steven A Carr","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Jochen Bodem","author_inst":"Institute for Virology and Immunobiology, Julius-Maximilians-University Wuerzburg"},{"author_name":"Mathias Munschauer","author_inst":"Helmholtz Institute for RNA-based Infection Research (HIRI), Helmholtz-Center for Infection Research (HZI), Wuerzburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ni Jiang","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhen Liu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Jun Wu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Yanting Yu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Heng Li","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Huiwen Zheng","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Weihua Jin","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sheng Pan","author_inst":"Vivibaba, Inc."},{"author_name":"Shuai Wang","author_inst":"Vivibaba Inc."},{"author_name":"Jianfeng Chen","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhihua Gan","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhanlong He","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences,"},{"author_name":"Yunfeng Lu","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"}],"version":"1","license":"cc0","type":"new results","category":"neuroscience"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.12.20148387","rel_title":"Impact of COVID-19 on 2020 US life expectancy for the Black and Latino populations","rel_date":"2020-07-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.12.20148387","rel_abs":"COVID-19 has resulted in a staggering death toll in the US: over 180,000 by the end of August 2020, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. Black and Latino Americans have experienced a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, reflecting persistent structural inequalities that increase risk of exposure to COVID-19 and mortality risk for those infected. We estimate life expectancy at birth and at age 65 for 2020, for the total US population and by race and ethnicity, using four scenarios of deaths - one in which the COVID-19 pandemic had not occurred and three including COVID-19 mortality projections produced by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. Our most likely estimate indicates a reduction in US life expectancy at birth of 1.41 years. This decline results in a life expectancy of 77.2 years, a value last observed in 2003. We also project a 1.08-year reduction in life expectancy at age 65. The Black and Latino populations are estimated to experience declines in life expectancy at birth of 2.69 and 3.66 years, respectively, both of which are several times the 0.84-year reduction for whites. These projections imply an increase of over 50% in the Black-white life expectancy gap, from 3.6 to 5.5 years, thereby eliminating twenty years of progress made in reducing this differential. Latinos, who have consistently experienced lower mortality than whites (a phenomenon known as the Latino or Hispanic paradox), would see their more than three-year survival advantage almost eliminated.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Theresa Andrasfay","author_inst":"University of Southern California"},{"author_name":"Noreen Goldman","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Kim M Hansen","author_inst":"VA"},{"author_name":"Lindsey Williams","author_inst":"VA"},{"author_name":"May Reed","author_inst":"VA\/UW"},{"author_name":"Kristen Baumann","author_inst":"VA"},{"author_name":"Sarah Holden","author_inst":"OHSU"},{"author_name":"Jacob Raber","author_inst":"OHSU"},{"author_name":"William A Banks","author_inst":"VA\/UW"},{"author_name":"Michelle A Erickson","author_inst":"VA\/UW"},{"author_name":"Joerg Vogel","author_inst":"Helmholtz Institute for RNA-based Infection Research (HIRI), Helmholtz-Center for Infection Research (HZI), Wuerzburg"},{"author_name":"Steven A Carr","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Jochen Bodem","author_inst":"Institute for Virology and Immunobiology, Julius-Maximilians-University Wuerzburg"},{"author_name":"Mathias Munschauer","author_inst":"Helmholtz Institute for RNA-based Infection Research (HIRI), Helmholtz-Center for Infection Research (HZI), Wuerzburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ni Jiang","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhen Liu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Jun Wu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Yanting Yu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Heng Li","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Huiwen Zheng","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Weihua Jin","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sheng Pan","author_inst":"Vivibaba, Inc."},{"author_name":"Shuai Wang","author_inst":"Vivibaba Inc."},{"author_name":"Jianfeng Chen","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhihua Gan","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhanlong He","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences,"},{"author_name":"Yunfeng Lu","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.13.20152660","rel_title":"Evaluation of the Practicability of a Finger-Stick Whole-Blood SARS-Cov-2 Self-Test Adapted for the General Population.","rel_date":"2020-07-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.13.20152660","rel_abs":"Background COVID-19 (COronaVIrus Disease 2019) is an infectious respiratory disease caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus. Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) have been developed to detect specific antibodies, IgG and IgM, to SARS-CoV-2 virus in human whole blood and easily usable by the general population are needed in order to alleviate the lockdown that many countries have initiated in response to the growing COVID-19 pandemic. A real-life study has been conducted in order to evaluate the performance of the COVID-PRESTO RDT and the results have been submitted for publication and are currently under review. Even if this test showed very high sensitivity and specificity in a laboratory setting when used by trained professionals, it needs to be further evaluated for practicability when used by common folk in order to be approved by health authorities for in-home use Methods 142 participants were recruited between March 2020 and April 2020 among non-medical populations in central France (nuclear plants workers, individuals attending the Orleans University Hospital vaccination clinic and Orleans University Hospital non-medical staff). Instructions for use with or without a tutorial video was made available to the volunteers. Two separate objectives were pursued: evaluation of the capability of participants to obtain an interpretable result, and evaluation of the users ability to read the results. Results 88.4 % of the test users judged the instruction for use leaflet to be clear and understandable. 99.3 % of the users obtained a valid results and according to the supervisors 92.7% of the tests were properly performed by the user. Overall, 95% of the users gave positive feedback toward the COVID PRESTO as a potential self-test. No influence of age and education was observed. Conclusion COVID-PRESTO was successfully used by an overwhelming majority of participants and its utilization was judged very satisfactory, therefore showing a promising potential as a self-test to be used by the general population. This RDT can become an easy-to-use tool to help know whether individuals are protected or not, particularly in the perspective of a second wave or a mass vaccination program.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"thierry prazuck","author_inst":"CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Jean Phan Van","author_inst":"EDF, France"},{"author_name":"Florence sinturel","author_inst":"EDF, France"},{"author_name":"frederique levray","author_inst":"EDF, France"},{"author_name":"Allan Elie","author_inst":"EDF, France"},{"author_name":"Denise Camera","author_inst":"EDF, France"},{"author_name":"gilles Pialloux","author_inst":"Sorbonne university, hopital Tenon, Paris, france"},{"author_name":"Jacob Raber","author_inst":"OHSU"},{"author_name":"William A Banks","author_inst":"VA\/UW"},{"author_name":"Michelle A Erickson","author_inst":"VA\/UW"},{"author_name":"Joerg Vogel","author_inst":"Helmholtz Institute for RNA-based Infection Research (HIRI), Helmholtz-Center for Infection Research (HZI), Wuerzburg"},{"author_name":"Steven A Carr","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Jochen Bodem","author_inst":"Institute for Virology and Immunobiology, Julius-Maximilians-University Wuerzburg"},{"author_name":"Mathias Munschauer","author_inst":"Helmholtz Institute for RNA-based Infection Research (HIRI), Helmholtz-Center for Infection Research (HZI), Wuerzburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ni Jiang","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhen Liu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Jun Wu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Yanting Yu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Heng Li","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Huiwen Zheng","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Weihua Jin","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sheng Pan","author_inst":"Vivibaba, Inc."},{"author_name":"Shuai Wang","author_inst":"Vivibaba Inc."},{"author_name":"Jianfeng Chen","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhihua Gan","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhanlong He","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences,"},{"author_name":"Yunfeng Lu","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.12.20152140","rel_title":"Complexity signatures in the COVID-19 epidemic: power law behaviour in the saturation regime of fatality curves","rel_date":"2020-07-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.12.20152140","rel_abs":"We apply a versatile growth model, whose rate of change is given by a generalised beta distribution, to describe the complex behaviour of the fatality curves of the COVID-19 disease for several countries in Europe and Asia. We show that the COVID-19 epidemic curves not only may present a subexponential early growth but can also exhibit a similar subexponential (power-law) behaviour in the saturation regime. We argue that the power-law exponent of the latter regime, which measures how quickly the curve approaches the plateau, is directly related to control measures, in the sense that the less strict the control, the smaller the exponent and hence the slower the diseases progresses to its end. The power-law saturation uncovered here is an important result, because it signals to health authorities that it is important to keep control measures for as long as possible, so as to avoid a slow, power-law ending of the disease. The slower the approach to the plateau, the longer the virus lingers on in the population, and the greater not only the death toll but also the risk of resurgence.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giovani L.

Social media becomes a reliable source for understanding public opinions toward this virus outbreak. Objective: This study aims to explore public opinions toward COVID-19 on social media by comparing the differences in sentiment changes and discussed topics between California and New York in the United States. Methods: A dataset with COVID-19-related Twitter posts was collected from March 5, 2020 to April 2, 2020 using Twitter streaming API. After removing any posts unrelated to COVID-19, as well as posts that contain promotion and commercial information, two individual datasets were created based on the geolocation tags with tweets, one containing tweets from California state and the other from New York state. Sentiment analysis was conducted to obtain the sentiment score for each COVID-19 tweet. Topic modeling was applied to identify top topics related to COVID-19. Results: While the number of COVID-19 cases increased more rapidly in New York than in California in March 2020, the number of tweets posted has a similar trend over time in both states. COVID-19 tweets from California had more negative sentiment scores than New York. There were some fluctuations in sentiment scores in both states over time, which might correlate with the policy changes and the severity of COVID-19 pandemic. The topic modeling results showed that the popular topics in both California and New York states are similar, with \"protective measures\" as the most prevalent topic associated with COVID-19 in both states. Conclusions: Twitter users from California had more negative sentiment scores towards COVID-19 than Twitter users from New York. The prevalent topics about COVID-19 discussed in both states were similar with some slight differences.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xueting Wang","author_inst":"Goergen Institute for Data Science, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Canruo Zou","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Zidian Xie","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Dongmei Li","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Raydonal Ospina","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Francisco A.

COVID-19, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continues to cause death and disease in all 50 states, as well as significant economic damage wrought by the non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) adopted in attempts to control transmission. We use a deterministic, Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered (SEIR) compartmental framework to model possible trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 infections and the impact of NPI at the state level. Model performance was tested against reported deaths from 01 February to 04 July 2020. Using this SEIR model and projections of critical driving covariates (pneumonia seasonality, mobility, testing rates, and mask use per capita), we assessed some possible futures of the COVID-19 pandemic from 05 July through 31 December 2020. We explored future scenarios that included feasible assumptions about NPIs including social distancing mandates (SDMs) and levels of mask use. The range of infection, death, and hospital demand outcomes revealed by these scenarios show that action taken during the summer of 2020 will have profound public health impacts through to the year end. Encouragingly, we find that an emphasis on universal mask use may be sufficient to ameliorate the worst effects of epidemic resurgences in many states. Masks may save as many as 102,795 (55,898-183,374) lives, when compared to a plausible reference scenario in December. In addition, widespread mask use may markedly reduce the need for more socially and economically deleterious SDMs.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"- I IHME COVID-19 Forecasting Team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Simon I Hay","author_inst":"Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Zidian Xie","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Dongmei Li","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Raydonal Ospina","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pernambuco"},{"author_name":"Francisco A.

METHODS: We trained, validated, and externally tested a machine-learning model to early identify patients who will die or require mechanical ventilation during hospitalization from clinical and laboratory features obtained at admission. A development cohort with 918 Covid-19 patients was used for training and internal validation, and 352 patients from another hospital were used for external testing. Performance of the model was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: A total of 363 of 918 (39.5%) and 128 of 352 (36.4%) Covid-19 patients from the development and external testing cohort, respectively, required mechanical ventilation or died during hospitalization. In the development cohort, the model obtained an AUC of 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 0.87) for predicting severity of disease progression. Variables ranked according to their contribution to the model were the peripheral blood oxygen saturation (SpO2)\/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio, age, estimated glomerular filtration rate, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, updated Charlson comorbidity index and lymphocytes. In the external testing cohort, the model performed an AUC of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.81 to 0.85). This model is deployed in an open source calculator, in which Covid-19 patients at admission are individually stratified as being at high or non-high risk for severe disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: This machine-learning model, applied at hospital admission, predicts risk of severe disease progression in Covid-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":30,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Miguel Marcos","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca-IBSAL, University of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Moncef Belhassen-Garcia","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Antonio Sanchez- Puente","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Jesus Sampedro-Gomez","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Raul Azibeiro","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Pedro Ignacio Dorado-Diaz","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Edgar Marcano-Millan","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Carol Garcia-Vidal","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic-University of Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Maria Teresa Moreiro-Barroso","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Noelia Cubino-Boveda","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Maria Luisa Perez-Garcia","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Beatriz Rodriguez-Alonso","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Daniel Encinas-Sanchez","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Sonia Pena-Balbuena","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Sobejano","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Maria Diez-Campelo","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Sandra Ines","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Cristina Carbonell","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Miriam Lopez-Parra","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Fernanda Andrade-Meira","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic-University of Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Amparo Lopez-Bernus","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Catalina Lorenzo","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Adela Carpio","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"David Polo-San-Ricardo","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Miguel Vicente Sanchez-Hernandez","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Rafael Borras","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Victor Sagredo-Meneses","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Pedro Luis Sanchez","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Alex Soriano","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic-University of Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Jose Angel Martin-Oterino","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.12.20148494","rel_title":"Outbreak of COVID-19 and Interventions in One of the Largest Jails in the United States: Cook County, IL, 2020","rel_date":"2020-07-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.12.20148494","rel_abs":"Background: Correctional and detention facilities are disproportionately affected by COVID-19 due to shared space, contact between staff and detained persons, and movement within facilities of detained persons, many with pre-existing medical conditions. On March 18, 2020, Cook County Jail, one of the United States' largest, identified its first suspected case of COVID-19 in a detained person. Methods: This analysis includes SARS-CoV-2 cases confirmed by molecular detection among detained persons and Cook County Sheriff's Office staff. We examined occurrence of symptomatic cases in each building and proportions of asymptomatic detained persons testing positive. We describe timing of interventions including social distancing, mask use, and expanded testing and show outbreak trajectory in the jail versus contemporaneous case counts in Chicago. Results: During March 1-April 30, 907 symptomatic and asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were detected among detained persons (n = 628) and staff (n = 279), with nine deaths. Symptomatic cases occurred in all housing divisions; in 9\/13 buildings, staff cases occurred first. Among asymptomatic detained persons in quarantine, 23.6% tested positive. Programmatic activity and visitation stopped March 9, cells were converted into single occupancy beginning March 26, and universal masking was implemented for staff (April 2) and detained persons (April 13). Cases at the jail declined while cases in Chicago increased. Conclusion: Aggressive intervention strategies coupled with widespread diagnostic testing of detained and staff populations can limit introduction and mitigate transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection in correctional and detention facilities.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chad Zawitz","author_inst":"Cermak Health Services"},{"author_name":"Sharon Welbel","author_inst":"Cook County Health"},{"author_name":"Isaac Ghinai","author_inst":"Chicago Department of Public Health; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Connie Mennella","author_inst":"Cermak Health Services"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Levin","author_inst":"Cook County Sheriff's Office"},{"author_name":"Usha Samala","author_inst":"Chicago Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Michelle Bryant Smith","author_inst":"Cook County Sheriff's Office"},{"author_name":"Jane Gubser","author_inst":"Cook County Sheriff's Office"},{"author_name":"Bridgette Jones","author_inst":"Cermak Health Services"},{"author_name":"Kate Varela","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Uzay Kirbiyik","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Josh Rafinski","author_inst":"Cermak Health Services"},{"author_name":"Anne Fitzgerald","author_inst":"Cook County Sheriff's Office"},{"author_name":"Peter Orris","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Chicago; Cook County Sheriff's Office"},{"author_name":"Alex Bahls","author_inst":"Cook County Sheriff's Office"},{"author_name":"Stephanie R Black","author_inst":"Chicago Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Alison M Binder","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Paige A Armstrong","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Miriam Lopez-Parra","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Fernanda Andrade-Meira","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic-University of Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Amparo Lopez-Bernus","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Catalina Lorenzo","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Adela Carpio","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"David Polo-San-Ricardo","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Miguel Vicente Sanchez-Hernandez","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Rafael Borras","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Victor Sagredo-Meneses","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Pedro Luis Sanchez","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Alex Soriano","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic-University of Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Jose Angel Martin-Oterino","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.10.20150938","rel_title":"The Efficacy of IL-6 Inhibitor Tocilizumab in Reducing Severe COVID-19 Mortality: A Systematic Review","rel_date":"2020-07-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.10.20150938","rel_abs":"In the absence of highly effective antiviral therapies against SARS-CoV-2, it is crucial to counter the known pathophysiological causes of severe COVID-19. Evaluating the efficacy existing drugs may expedite the development of such therapeutics. Severe COVID-19 is largely the result of a dysregulated immune response characterized by lymphocytopenia, neutrophilia and critical hypercytokinemia, or cytokine storm, which is largely mediated by the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6). The IL-6 inhibitor tocilizumab (TCZ) could potentially suppress the effects of the pro-inflammatory cytokine and thereby lower mortality from the disease. This systematic analysis aimed to investigate and synthesize existing evidence for the efficacy of TCZ in reducing COVID-19 mortality. PubMed and SearchWorks searches were performed to locate clinical studies with primary data on TCZ treatment for severe COVID-19. Sixteen case-control studies comparing mortality between TCZ and standard of care (SOC) were identified for quantitative synthesis. Combined mortality for the TCZ-treated and SOC groups were 26.0% and 43.4% respectively. In all but one of the studies, the odds ratio of mortality from COVID-19 pointed towards lower fatality with TCZ versus the SOC. A combined random effects odds ratio calculation yielded an odds ratio of 0.453 (95% CI 0.376-0.547, p<0.001). Additionally, eighteen uncontrolled trials were identified for qualitative analysis producing a raw combined mortality rate of 16.0%. Important caveats to this research include the lack of prospective randomized control trials (RCTs) and the absence of data from the large COVATA study from the published literature. However, results from this systematic analysis of published research provide positive evidence for the potential efficacy of TCZ to treat severe COVID-19, validating the ethical basis and merit of ongoing randomized controlled clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Avi Gurion Kaye","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Robert Siegel","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Isaac Ghinai","author_inst":"Chicago Department of Public Health; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Connie Mennella","author_inst":"Cermak Health Services"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Levin","author_inst":"Cook County Sheriff's Office"},{"author_name":"Usha Samala","author_inst":"Chicago Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Michelle Bryant Smith","author_inst":"Cook County Sheriff's Office"},{"author_name":"Jane Gubser","author_inst":"Cook County Sheriff's Office"},{"author_name":"Bridgette Jones","author_inst":"Cermak Health Services"},{"author_name":"Kate Varela","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Uzay Kirbiyik","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Josh Rafinski","author_inst":"Cermak Health Services"},{"author_name":"Anne Fitzgerald","author_inst":"Cook County Sheriff's Office"},{"author_name":"Peter Orris","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Chicago; Cook County Sheriff's Office"},{"author_name":"Alex Bahls","author_inst":"Cook County Sheriff's Office"},{"author_name":"Stephanie R Black","author_inst":"Chicago Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Alison M Binder","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Paige A Armstrong","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Miriam Lopez-Parra","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Fernanda Andrade-Meira","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic-University of Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Amparo Lopez-Bernus","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Catalina Lorenzo","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Adela Carpio","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"David Polo-San-Ricardo","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Miguel Vicente Sanchez-Hernandez","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Rafael Borras","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Victor Sagredo-Meneses","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Pedro Luis Sanchez","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Alex Soriano","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic-University of Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Jose Angel Martin-Oterino","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.11.20147793","rel_title":"Low-Dose Whole-Lung Radiation for COVID-19 Pneumonia","rel_date":"2020-07-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.11.20147793","rel_abs":"Background: Safety of whole-lung low-dose radiation therapy (LD-RT) for COVID-19 pneumonia has been established in two phase I trials. By focally dampening pulmonary cytokine hyperactivation, LD-RT may improve outcomes in hospitalized and oxygen-dependent COVID-19 patients. Methods: Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were treated with 1.5 Gy whole-lung LD-RT, followed for 28 days or at least until hospital discharge, and compared to an age- and comorbidity-matched control cohort. COVID-19-positive patients eligible for this protocol were hospitalized, had radiographic consolidations, and required supplemental oxygen. Efficacy endpoints were time to clinical recovery, radiographic improvement, and serologic responses. Results: Ten patients received whole-lung LD-RT between April 24 and May 24, 2020 and were compared to ten matched control patients, of whom six received COVID-directed therapy. Median time to clinical recovery was 12 days for the control cohort vs 3 days for LD-RT (HR 2.9, p=0.05). Median time to hospital discharge (20 and 12 days, p=0.19), and intubation rates (40% and 10%, p=0.12) were shorter for the LD-RT cohort. The LD-RT cohort had faster radiographic improvement (p=0.03), even among patients with high COVID burden. Serologic recovery in specific hematologic, cardiac, hepatic, clotting, and inflammatory markers occurred more rapidly following LD-RT than among matched controls. Conclusions: Strong efficacy signals, including a 3-fold risk reduction in time to clinical improvement, were observed following LD-RT compared to matched patients receiving COVID-directed therapy for COVID-19 pneumonia. Given the global availability of radiation accelerators, ongoing international efforts to investigate the optimal role of LD-RT in COVID-19 pneumonia are justified.

We sought to systematically evaluate the effect of CQ and HCQ with or without azithromycin (AZ) on outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Methods We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies published through July 7, 2020. We searched Medline, Embase, EBM Reviews, Scopus, Web of Science, preprints and grey literature. We included studies that assessed COVID-19 patients treated with CQ or HCQ, with or without AZ. We pooled only adjusted effect estimates of mortality using a random effect model and estimated between studies heterogeneity using I2 statistic. We summarized the effect of CQ or HCQ on viral clearance and ICU admission\/ mechanical ventilation. Results Out of 1463 citations screened for eligibility, five RCTs and 14 cohort studies were included (20,263 patients, all hospitalized but with a variable disease severity spectrum). Thirteen studies (1 RCT and 12 cohorts) with 19,573 patients examined the effect of HCQ on short term mortality. The pooled adjusted OR was 1.05 (95% CI 0.96-1.15, I2=0 %, p=0.647). Six cohort studies examined the effect of HCQ and AZ combination among 3430 patients. After excluding a study that examined only patients with cancers, the pooled adjusted OR was (1.15, 95% CI 0.99-1.34, I2=0.0%). Two cohort studies and three RCTs found no significant effect of HCQ on viral clearance. One RCT with 48 patients demonstrated improved viral clearance in patients treated with CQ and HCQ. Three cohort studies found that HCQ with or without AZ had no significant effect on mechanical ventilation\/ ICU admission. Conclusion Moderate certainty evidence suggests that HCQ, with or without AZ, lacks efficacy in reducing short-term mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Our findings are consistent with the recommendations from medical societies that HCQ should only be used to treat COVID-19 patients in the context of clinical trials. Trials of HCQ as pre-exposure prophylaxis are ongoing.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zakariya Tarek Kashour","author_inst":"University of Alberta"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Riaz","author_inst":"Quaid Azam University Islamabad"},{"author_name":"Musa garbati","author_inst":"University of Maiduguri"},{"author_name":"Oweida Aldosary","author_inst":"King Fahad Medical City"},{"author_name":"Haytham Tlayjeh","author_inst":"King Abdulaziz Medical City"},{"author_name":"Dana Gerberi","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"M.Hassan Murad","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"M.Rizwan Sohail","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Tarek Kashour","author_inst":"King Saud University"},{"author_name":"Imad M Tleyjeh","author_inst":"King Fahad Medical City"},{"author_name":"Rafi Ahmed","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Walter J Curran","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Mohammad K Khan","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Peter Orris","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Chicago; Cook County Sheriff's Office"},{"author_name":"Alex Bahls","author_inst":"Cook County Sheriff's Office"},{"author_name":"Stephanie R Black","author_inst":"Chicago Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Alison M Binder","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Paige A Armstrong","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Miriam Lopez-Parra","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Fernanda Andrade-Meira","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic-University of Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Amparo Lopez-Bernus","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Catalina Lorenzo","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Adela Carpio","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"David Polo-San-Ricardo","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Miguel Vicente Sanchez-Hernandez","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Rafael Borras","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Victor Sagredo-Meneses","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Pedro Luis Sanchez","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Alex Soriano","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic-University of Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Jose Angel Martin-Oterino","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.12.20151084","rel_title":"Prehospitalization Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) use and Clinical Outcomes in COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-07-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.12.20151084","rel_abs":"Introduction There is a concern that proton pump inhibitors (PPI) induced hypochlorhydria could potentially predispose to severe COVID-19.

In Spring of 2020, private laboratories and some hospitals began antibody testing despite lacking evidence-based guidance. Objective: To describe clinician-described indications for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing, including cost implications, immediately following testing availability. Design: Retrospective chart review of patients who received antibody testing from May 14, 2020 to June 15, 2020. Setting: A large academic medical center, one of the first in the US to provide antibody testing capability to individual clinicians. Patients: 447 consecutive patients who received SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. Measurements: Clinician-described indications for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing, cost implications, and comparison with current expert-based guidance from the IDSA and CDC. Results: Of 444 individual antibody test results meeting inclusion criteria, the two most commonly described indications for ordering the antibody test, apart from public health epidemiology studies (n=223), were for patients with a now resolved COVID-19 compatible illness (n=105) with no previous molecular testing and in asymptomatic patients believed to have had a past exposure or contact with a person with COVID-19 compatible illness (n=60). The rate of positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing among those indications consistent with current IDSA and CDC guidance was 17% compared with 5% (p<0.0001) among those indications inconsistent with current IDSA and CDC guidance. Total cost estimates ranged from $57,720 to $97,680, of which 42% was for testing inconsistent with current expert-based guidance. Limitations: The duration of antibody response following infection is unclear and asymptomatic individuals may not develop a positive antibody response. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate a dissociation between clinician described indications for testing and expert-based guidance and a significantly different rate of positive testing between these two groups. Clinical curiosity and patient preference appear to have played a significant role in testing decisions and substantially contributed to testing costs.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joesph R Wiencek","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Carter L Head","author_inst":"University of Virginia School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Costi D Sifri","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Andrew S Parsons","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Alok Kumar Dwivedi","author_inst":"Texas Tech University, Paul L Foster School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hemant Goyal","author_inst":"Wright Center for Graduate Medical Education"},{"author_name":"M.Hassan Murad","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"M.Rizwan Sohail","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Tarek Kashour","author_inst":"King Saud University"},{"author_name":"Imad M Tleyjeh","author_inst":"King Fahad Medical City"},{"author_name":"Rafi Ahmed","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Walter J Curran","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Mohammad K Khan","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Peter Orris","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Chicago; Cook County Sheriff's Office"},{"author_name":"Alex Bahls","author_inst":"Cook County Sheriff's Office"},{"author_name":"Stephanie R Black","author_inst":"Chicago Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Alison M Binder","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Paige A Armstrong","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Miriam Lopez-Parra","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Fernanda Andrade-Meira","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic-University of Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Amparo Lopez-Bernus","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Catalina Lorenzo","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Adela Carpio","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"David Polo-San-Ricardo","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Miguel Vicente Sanchez-Hernandez","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Rafael Borras","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Victor Sagredo-Meneses","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Pedro Luis Sanchez","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Alex Soriano","author_inst":"Hospital Clinic-University of Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Jose Angel Martin-Oterino","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.13.20153106","rel_title":"The prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors in China","rel_date":"2020-07-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.13.20153106","rel_abs":"Objectives The prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors in China remains unknown. To reveal the missing information, we investigated the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among blood donors in the cities of Wuhan, Shenzhen, and Shijiazhuang of China. Design Cross-sectional study Setting Three blood centers, located in the central, south and north China, respectively, recruiting from January to April 2020. Participants 38,144 healthy blood donors donated in Wuhan, Shenzhen and Shijiazhuang were enrolled, who were all met the criteria for blood donation during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Main outcome measures Specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 including total antibody (TAb), IgG antibody against receptor-binding domain of spike protein (IgG-RBD) and nucleoprotein (IgG-N), and IgM. Pseudotype lentivirus-based neutralization test was performed on all TAb-positive samples. In addition, anonymous personal demographic information, including gender, age, ethnicity, occupation and educational level, and blood type were collected. Results A total of 519 samples from 410 donors were confirmed by neutralization tests. The SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among blood donors was 2.29% (407\/17,794, 95%CI: 2.08% to 2.52%) in Wuhan, 0.029% (2\/6,810, 95%CI: 0.0081% to 0.11%) in Shenzhen, and 0.0074% (1\/13,540, 95%CI: 0.0013% to 0.042%) in Shijiazhuang, respectively. The earliest emergence of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in blood donors was identified on January 20, 2020 in Wuhan. The weekly prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Wuhan's blood donors changed dynamically and were 0.08% (95%CI: 0.02% to 0.28%) during January 15 to 22 (before city lockdown), 3.08% (95%CI: 2.67% to 3.55%) during January 23 to April 7 (city quarantine period) and 2.33% (95%CI: 2.06% to 2.63%) during April 8 to 30 (after lockdown easing). Female and older-age were identified to be independent risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among donors in Wuhan. Conclusions The prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors in China was low, even in Wuhan city.

In vitro, binding of ACE2 and heparin to spike protein ectodomains occurs independently and a ternary complex can be generated using heparin as a template. Contrary to studies with purified components, spike protein binding to heparan sulfate and ACE2 on cells occurs codependently. Unfractionated heparin, non-anticoagulant heparin, treatment with heparin lyases, and purified lung heparan sulfate potently block spike protein binding and infection by spike protein-pseudotyped virus and SARS-CoV-2 virus. These findings support a model for SARS-CoV-2 infection in which viral attachment and infection involves formation of a complex between heparan sulfate and ACE2.

It is thus vital to fully understand the biology of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 uses the spike glycoprotein to interact with the cell surface and to drive fusion of the viral membrane with cellular membranes, thus allowing transfer of viral RNA to the cytosol. Here we use purified spike glycoprotein protein and lentivirus pseudotyped with spike glycoprotein to determine that SARS-CoV-2 undergoes rapid endocytosis following binding to the plasma membrane. Using chemical inhibitors and loss of function approaches, we demonstrate that this cellular entry is through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Thus, it appears that SARS-CoV-2 first engages the plasma membrane, then rapidly enters the lumen of the endosomal system, strongly suggesting that fusion of the viral membrane occurs with the lumenal membrane of endosomes. This discovery has important implications for the development of chemical probes to reduce or block infection.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Armin Bayati","author_inst":"Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University"},{"author_name":"Rahul Kumar","author_inst":"Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University"},{"author_name":"Vincent Francis","author_inst":"Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University"},{"author_name":"Peter S McPherson","author_inst":"Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University"},{"author_name":"Chelsea D Painter","author_inst":"Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA."},{"author_name":"Bryan E Thacker","author_inst":"TEGA Therapeutics, Inc., 3550 General Atomics Court, G02-102, San Diego, CA 92121, USA."},{"author_name":"Charles A Glass","author_inst":"TEGA Therapeutics, Inc., 3550 General Atomics Court, G02-102, San Diego, CA 92121, USA."},{"author_name":"Anoop Narayanan","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, 16802, USA."},{"author_name":"Sydney A Majowicz","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, 16802, USA."},{"author_name":"Yang Zhang","author_inst":"Copenhagen Center for Glycomics, Department of Molecular and Cellular Medicine, University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark."},{"author_name":"Jonathan L Torres","author_inst":"Department of Integrative Structural and Computational Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA."},{"author_name":"Gregory J Golden","author_inst":"Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA."},{"author_name":"Ryan Porell","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA."},{"author_name":"Aaron F Garretson","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA."},{"author_name":"Logan Laubach","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA."},{"author_name":"Xin Yin","author_inst":"Immunity and Pathogenesis Program, Infectious and Inflammatory Disease Center, Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute 10901 North Torrey Pines Road,"},{"author_name":"Yuan Pu","author_inst":"Immunity and Pathogenesis Program, Infectious and Inflammatory Disease Center, Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute 10901 North Torrey Pines Road,"},{"author_name":"Blake Hauser","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge MA 02139, USA."},{"author_name":"Timothy M Caradonna","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge MA 02139, USA."},{"author_name":"Benjamin P Kellman","author_inst":"Department of Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego."},{"author_name":"Cameron Martino","author_inst":"Department of Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego."},{"author_name":"Philip L.S.M.

Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 infected cells express the viral Spike protein (S) at their surface and fuse with ACE2-positive neighbouring cells. Expression of S without any other viral proteins triggers syncytia formation. Type-I interferon (IFN)-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs), a family of restriction factors that block the entry of many viruses, inhibit S-mediated fusion, with IFITM1 being more active than IFITM2 and IFITM3. On the contrary, the TMPRSS2 serine protease, which is known to enhance infectivity of cell-free virions, processes both S and ACE2 and increases syncytia formation by accelerating the fusion process. TMPRSS2 thwarts the antiviral effect of IFITMs. Our results show that the pathological effects of SARS-CoV-2 are modulated by cellular proteins that either inhibit or facilitate syncytia formation.\n\nOne Sentence SummarySyncytia produced by SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and regulation of their formation by IFITMs and TMPRSS2.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julian Buchrieser","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Dufloo","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Mathieu Hubert","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Blandine Monel","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Delphine Planas","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Maaran Michael Rajah","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Cyril Planchais","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Francoise Porrot","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Florence Guivel-Benhassine","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Sylvie van der Werf","author_inst":"institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Nicoletta Casartelli","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Hugo Mouquet","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Timothee Bruel","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Olivier Schwartz","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Logan Laubach","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA."},{"author_name":"Xin Yin","author_inst":"Immunity and Pathogenesis Program, Infectious and Inflammatory Disease Center, Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute 10901 North Torrey Pines Road,"},{"author_name":"Yuan Pu","author_inst":"Immunity and Pathogenesis Program, Infectious and Inflammatory Disease Center, Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute 10901 North Torrey Pines Road,"},{"author_name":"Blake Hauser","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge MA 02139, USA."},{"author_name":"Timothy M Caradonna","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge MA 02139, USA."},{"author_name":"Benjamin P Kellman","author_inst":"Department of Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego."},{"author_name":"Cameron Martino","author_inst":"Department of Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego."},{"author_name":"Philip L.S.M.

The characterization of the immunological mechanisms involved in disease symptomatology and protective response is important to advance in disease control and prevention. Humans evolved by losing the capacity to synthesize the glycan Gal1-3Gal{beta}1-(3)4GlcNAc-R (-Gal), which resulted in the development of a protective response against pathogenic viruses and other microorganisms containing this modification on membrane proteins mediated by anti--Gal IgM\/IgG antibodies produced in response to bacterial microbiota. In addition to anti--Gal antibody-mediated pathogen opsonization, this glycan induces various immune mechanisms that have shown protection in animal models against infectious diseases without inflammatory responses. In this study, we hypothesized that the immune response to -Gal may contribute to the control of COVID-19. To address this hypothesis, we characterized the antibody response to -Gal in patients at different stages of COVID-19 and in comparison with healthy control individuals. The results showed that while the inflammatory response and the anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Spike) IgG antibody titers increased, reduction in anti--Gal IgE, IgM and IgG antibody titers and alteration of anti--Gal antibody isotype composition correlated with COVID-19 severity. The results suggested that the inhibition of the -Gal-induced immune response may translate into more aggressive viremia and severe disease inflammatory symptoms. These results support the proposal of developing interventions such as probiotics based on commensal bacteria with -Gal epitopes to modify the microbiota and increase the -Gal-induced protective immune response and reduce the severity of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jose Miguel Urra","author_inst":"Immunology, Hospital General Universitario de Ciudad Real, 13005 Ciudad Real, Spain.

We apply a comparative genomics method, ConsHMM, to the multi-strain alignments of CoV to annotate every base of the SARS-CoV-2 genome with conservation states based on sequence alignment patterns among CoV. The learned conservation states show distinct enrichment patterns for genes, protein domains, and other regions of interest. Certain states are strongly enriched or depleted of SARS-CoV-2 mutations, which can be used to predict more likely consequential mutations. We expect the conservation states to be a resource for interpreting the SARS-CoV-2 genome and mutations.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Soo Bin Kwon","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Jason Ernst","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Marinela Contreras","author_inst":"Interdisciplinary Laboratory of Clinical Analysis, Interlab-UMU, Regional Campus of International Excellence Campus Mare Nostrum, University of Murcia, Espinard"},{"author_name":"Carmen M Cabrera","author_inst":"Immunology, Hospital General Universitario de Ciudad Real, 13005 Ciudad Real, Spain.

While doing so, some variants with evolutionary advantages such as better human to human transmissibility potential should get naturally selected. This short communication demonstrates how the mutation probability patterns are evolving in 864 SAR-CoV-2 strains isolated from COVID-19 patients across diverse Indian states. We have identified 30 such variants showing contrasting mutational probabilities in the span of four months. Out of these, the mutational probabilities of 25 variants including C14408T (in RdRp gene), A23403G (in spike gene), C6312A (nsp3 gene) are continuously increasing suggesting that these mutations are being propagated with time due to their unexplored evolutionary advantages. In contrast, the mutational probabilities of five variants including C6312A (nsp3 gene), G11083T (nsp6 gene), C28311T (N gene) have significantly decreased in May-June as compared to March-April, suggesting these mutations are being terminated with time. Further in-depth investigation of these identified variants will provide valuable knowledge about the evolution, infection strategies, transmission rates, and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in India.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gaurav Sharma","author_inst":"Institute of Bioinformatics and Applied Biotechnology (IBAB), Bengaluru"},{"author_name":"Vaishnavi Kolte","author_inst":"Institute of Bioinformatics and Applied Biotechnology (IBAB), Bengaluru"},{"author_name":"Shenu Hudson B.","author_inst":"Institute of Bioinformatics and Applied Biotechnology (IBAB), Bengaluru"},{"author_name":"Azra Khan","author_inst":"Institute of Bioinformatics and Applied Biotechnology (IBAB), Bengaluru"},{"author_name":"Isabel G Fernandez de Mera","author_inst":"Instituto de Investigacion en Recursos Cinegeticos IREC-CSIC-UCLM-JCCM, Ronda de Toledo s\/n, 13005 Ciudad Real, Spain"},{"author_name":"Margarita Villar","author_inst":"SaBio, Instituto de Investigacion en Recursos Cinegeticos IREC-CSIC-UCLM-JCCM, Ronda de Toledo s\/n, 13005 Ciudad Real, Spain.

Here we combine genetics and chemical perturbation to demonstrate that ACE2-mediated entry of SARS-CoV and CoV-2 requires the cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) as an assisting cofactor: ablation of genes involved in HS biosynthesis or incubating cells with a HS mimetic both inhibit Spike-mediated viral entry. We show that heparin\/HS binds to Spike directly, facilitates the attachment of viral particles to the cell surface to promote cell entry. We screened approved drugs and identified two classes of inhibitors that act via distinct mechanisms to target this entry pathway. Among the drugs characterized, Mitoxantrone is a potent HS inhibitor, while Sunitinib and BNTX disrupt the actin network to indirectly abrogate HS-assisted viral entry. We further show that drugs of the two classes can be combined to generate a synergized activity against SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathic effect. Altogether, our study establishes HS as an attachment factor that assists SARS coronavirus cell entry, and reveals drugs capable of targeting this important step in the viral life cycle.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qi Zhang","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Catherine Chen","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Manju Swaroop","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Miao Xu","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Lihui Wang","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Juhyung Lee","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Manisha Pradhan","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Min Shen","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Zhiji Luo","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Yue Xu","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Wenwei Huang","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Wei Zheng","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Yihong Ye","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Olivier Schwartz","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Logan Laubach","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA."},{"author_name":"Xin Yin","author_inst":"Immunity and Pathogenesis Program, Infectious and Inflammatory Disease Center, Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute 10901 North Torrey Pines Road,"},{"author_name":"Yuan Pu","author_inst":"Immunity and Pathogenesis Program, Infectious and Inflammatory Disease Center, Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute 10901 North Torrey Pines Road,"},{"author_name":"Blake Hauser","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge MA 02139, USA."},{"author_name":"Timothy M Caradonna","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard, Cambridge MA 02139, USA."},{"author_name":"Benjamin P Kellman","author_inst":"Department of Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego."},{"author_name":"Cameron Martino","author_inst":"Department of Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego."},{"author_name":"Philip L.S.M.

Methods We conducted an individual participant data (IPD) systematic review of longitudinal studies of RT-PCR test results in symptomatic SARS-CoV-2. We searched PubMed, LitCOVID, medRxiv and COVID-19 Living Evidence databases. We assessed risk of bias using a QUADAS-2 adaptation. Outcomes were the percentage of positive test results by time and the duration of detectable virus, by anatomical sampling sites. Findings Of 5078 studies screened, we included 32 studies with 1023 SARS-CoV-2 infected participants and 1619 test results, from -6 to 66 days post-symptom onset and hospitalisation. The highest percentage virus detection was from nasopharyngeal sampling between 0 to 4 days post-symptom onset at 89% (95% confidence interval (CI) 83 to 93) dropping to 54% (95% CI 47 to 61) after 10 to 14 days. On average, duration of detectable virus was longer with lower respiratory tract (LRT) sampling than upper respiratory tract (URT). Duration of faecal and respiratory tract virus detection varied greatly within individual participants. In some participants, virus was still detectable at 46 days post-symptom onset. Interpretation RT-PCR misses detection of people with SARS-CoV-2 infection; early sampling minimises false negative diagnoses. Beyond ten days post-symptom onset, lower RT or faecal testing may be preferred sampling sites. The included studies are open to substantial risk of bias so the positivity rates are probably overestimated.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sue Mallett","author_inst":"University College London, UK"},{"author_name":"Joy Allen","author_inst":"Newcastle University, UK"},{"author_name":"Sara Graziadio","author_inst":"Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, UK"},{"author_name":"Stuart A Taylor","author_inst":"University College London, UK"},{"author_name":"Naomi S Sakai","author_inst":"University College London, UK"},{"author_name":"Kile Green","author_inst":"Newcastle University, UK"},{"author_name":"Jana Suklan","author_inst":"Newcastle University, UK"},{"author_name":"Chris Hyde","author_inst":"University of Exeter, UK"},{"author_name":"Bethany Shinkins","author_inst":"University of Leeds, UK"},{"author_name":"Zhivko Zhelev","author_inst":"University of Exeter, UK"},{"author_name":"Jaime Peters","author_inst":"University of Exeter, UK"},{"author_name":"Philip Turner","author_inst":"University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Nia W Roberts","author_inst":"University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Lavinia Ferrante di Ruffano","author_inst":"University of Birmingham, UK"},{"author_name":"Robert Wolff","author_inst":"Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd, UK"},{"author_name":"Penny Whiting","author_inst":"University of Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Amanda Winter","author_inst":"Newcastle University, UK"},{"author_name":"Gauraang Bhatnagar","author_inst":"Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust, UK"},{"author_name":"Brian D Nicholson","author_inst":"University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Steve Halligan","author_inst":"University College London, UK"},{"author_name":"Cameron Martino","author_inst":"Department of Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego."},{"author_name":"Philip L.S.M.
