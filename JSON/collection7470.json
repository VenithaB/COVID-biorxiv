Patients with previous diabetes are more vulnerable to COVID-19. However, new-onset COVID-19-related diabetes (CRD) and its relevance have scarcely been reported. This study investigates new-onset CRD and its correlation with poor outcomes or death in patients with COVID-19. Methods We performed a single center, retrospective case series study in 120 patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 at a university hospital. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) [&ge;]7.0 mmol\/L for two times during hospitalization and without a history of diabetes were defined as CRD. The Critical status was defined as admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) or death. Results After excluding patients with a history of diabetes, chronic heart, kidney, and liver disease, 69 patients with COVID-19 were included in the final analysis. Of the 69 patients, 23 were Moderate, 20 were Severe, and 26 were Critical (including 16 deceased patients). The prevalence of CRD in Critical and Moderate+Severe patients was 53.85% and 13.95%, respectively. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed a significantly higher mortality rate in patients with CRD (P=0.0019). Multivariable analysis indicated that CRD was an independent predictor for death (HR = 3.75, 95% CI 1.26-11.15). Cluster analysis suggested that indicators for multi-organ injury were interdependent, and more proximities of FBG with indicators for multi-organ injury was present. Conclusion Our results suggest that new onset COVID-19-related diabetes is an indicator of multi-organ injury and predictor for poor outcomes and death in COVID-19 patients. As it is easy to perform for clinical practices and even self-monitoring, glucose testing will be much helpful for predicting poor outcomes to facilitate appropriate intensive care in patients with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jin-Kui Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jian-Min Jin","author_inst":"Beijing Tongren Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shi Liu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Peng Bai","author_inst":"Beijing Tongren Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wei He","author_inst":"Beijing Tongren Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fei Wu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Fang Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Tongren Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhong-Lin Chai","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"De-Min Han","author_inst":"Beijing Tongren Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.09.034967","rel_title":"Comparative ACE2 variation and primate COVID-19 risk","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.09.034967","rel_abs":"The emergence of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which in humans is highly infectious and leads to the potentially fatal disease COVID-19, has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths and huge global disruption. The viral infection may also represent an existential threat to our closest living relatives, the nonhuman primates, many of which are endangered and often reduced to small populations. The virus engages the host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), through the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the spike protein. The contact surface of ACE2 displays amino acid residues that are critical for virus recognition, and variations at these critical residues are likely to modulate infection susceptibility across species. While infection studies are emerging and have shown that some primates, such as rhesus macaques and vervet monkeys, develop COVID-19-like symptoms when exposed to the virus, the susceptibility of many other nonhuman primates is unknown. Here, we show that all apes, including chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans, and all African and Asian monkeys (catarrhines), exhibit the same set of twelve key amino acid residues as human ACE2. Monkeys in the Americas, and some tarsiers, lemurs and lorisoids, differ at significant contact residues, and protein modeling predicts that these differences should greatly reduce the binding affinity of the ACE2 for the virus, hence moderating their susceptibility for infection. Other lemurs are predicted to be closer to catarrhines in their susceptibility. Our study suggests that apes and African and Asian monkeys, as well as some lemurs are all likely to be highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, representing a critical threat to their survival. Urgent actions have been undertaken to limit the exposure of Great Apes to humans, and similar efforts may be necessary for many other primate species.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mareike C Janiak","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Frank Marrone","author_inst":"New York University"},{"author_name":"Paramjit S Arora","author_inst":"New York University"},{"author_name":"James Paul Higham","author_inst":"New York University"},{"author_name":"Wei He","author_inst":"Beijing Tongren Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fei Wu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Fang Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Tongren Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhong-Lin Chai","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"De-Min Han","author_inst":"Beijing Tongren Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"genetics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.08.20058495","rel_title":"Fast SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-qPCR in preheated nasopharyngeal swab samples","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.08.20058495","rel_abs":"The current reference for COVID-19 diagnosis is based on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 on RNA extracts using one-step retrotranscription and quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR).

Both vaccines and targeted therapeutics for treatment of this disease are currently lacking. Viral entry requires binding of the viral spike receptor binding domain (RBD) with the human angiotensin converting enzyme (hACE2). In an earlier paper1, we report on the specific residue interactions underpinning this event. Here we report on the de novo computational design of high affinity antibody variable regions through the recombination of VDJ genes targeting the most solvent-exposed hACE2-binding residues of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using the software tool OptMAVEn-2.02. Subsequently, we carry out computational affinity maturation of the designed prototype variable regions through point mutations for improved binding with the target epitope. Immunogenicity was restricted by preferring designs that match sequences from a 9-mer library of \"human antibodies\" based on H-score (human string content, HSC)3. We generated 106 different designs and report in detail on the top five that trade-off the greatest affinity for the spike RBD epitope (quantified using the Rosetta binding energies) with low H-scores. By grafting the designed Heavy (VH) and Light (VL) chain variable regions onto a human framework (Fc), high-affinity and potentially neutralizing full-length monoclonal antibodies (mAb) can be constructed. Having a potent antibody that can recognize the viral spike protein with high affinity would be enabling for both the design of sensitive SARS-CoV-2 detection devices and for their deployment as therapeutic antibodies.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Veda Sheersh Boorla","author_inst":"The Pennsylvania State University"},{"author_name":"Ratul Chowdhury","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Costas D Maranas","author_inst":"The Pennsylvania State University"},{"author_name":"Jiao Fan","author_inst":"Wuhan University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hsing-Ying Ho","author_inst":"Guo-Yuan Clinic, Taichung, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Wei-Shio Hor","author_inst":"TOPO Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, Taichung, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Chih-Hui Yang","author_inst":"I-Shou University"},{"author_name":"Chengdao Li","author_inst":"Murdoch University; Department of Primary Industry and Regional Development, Government of Western Australia, South Perth, WA, 6155, Australia"},{"author_name":"Wei-Lung Wang","author_inst":"National Changhua University of Education"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.09.20058909","rel_title":"Classification of COVID-19 in intensive care patients: towards rational and effective clinical triage","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.09.20058909","rel_abs":"The number of pertinent researches of COVID-19 has increased rapidly but they mainly focused on the description of general information of patients with confirmed infection.

In addition, insight into the ability of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-like viruses to utilize animal orthologs of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 might provide structural insight into improving ACE2-based viral entry inhibitors. Here we show that ACE2 orthologs of a wide range of domestic and wild animals support entry of SARS-CoV-2, as well as that of SARS-CoV-1, bat coronavirus RaTG13, and a coronavirus isolated from pangolins. Some of these species, including camels, cattle, horses, goats, sheep, pigs, cats, and rabbits may serve as potential intermediate hosts for new human transmission, and rabbits in particular may serve as a useful experimental model of COVID-19. We show that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 entry could be potently blocked by recombinant IgG Fc-fusion proteins of viral spike protein receptor-binding domains (RBD-Fc) and soluble ACE2 (ACE2-Fc). Moreover, an ACE2-Fc variant, which carries a D30E mutation and has ACE2 truncated at its residue 740 but not 615, outperforms all the other ACE2-Fc variants on blocking entry of both viruses.

Design: Cross sectional study Setting: Sweden Participants: 9,624,428 individuals living in Sweden on 31st December 2014 and alive on 1st January 2016 Main outcome measures: Burden and prevalence of prognostic factors for severe COVID-19 based on the guidelines from the World Health Organization and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, which are age 70 years and older, cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe asthma, and diabetes. Prognostic factors were identified based on records for three years before 1st January 2016 from the Swedish National Inpatient and Outpatient Specialist Care Register, Prescribed Drug Register, and Cancer Register. Results: 22.1% of the study population had at least one prognostic factor for severe COVID-19 (2,131,319 individuals), and 1.6% had at least three factors (154,746 individuals). The prevalence of underlying medical conditions in the whole study population ranged from 0.8% with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (78,516 individuals) to 7.4% with cardiovascular disease (708,090 individuals), and the county specific prevalence of at least one prognostic factor ranged from 19.2% in Stockholm (416,988 individuals) to 25.9% in Kalmar (60,005 individuals). Conclusions: The prevalence of prognostic factors for severe COVID-19 disease will aid authorities in optimally planning healthcare resources during the ongoing pandemic. Results can also be applied to underlying assumptions of disease burden in modelling efforts to support COVID-19 planning. This information is crucial when deciding appropriate strategies to mitigate the pandemic and reduce both the direct mortality burden from the disease itself, and the indirect mortality burden from potentially overwhelmed health systems.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Katalin Gemes","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Mats Talback","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Karin Modig","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Anders Ahlbom","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Anita Berglund","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Maria Feychting","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Anthony Matthews","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Qing Zou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Bay Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Jie Zheng","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Liangde Xu","author_inst":"School of Biomedical Engineering and Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Michael Farzan","author_inst":"Department of Immunology and Microbiology, The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Guocai Zhong","author_inst":"Shenzhen Bay Laboratory"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.09.033910","rel_title":"Integrative Network Biology Framework Elucidates Molecular Mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 Pathogenesis","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.09.033910","rel_abs":"COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) is a respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Overall, our network centric analyses reveal novel molecular components, uncover structural and functional modules, and provide molecular insights into SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nilesh Kumar","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Bharat Mishra","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Adeel Mehmood","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Athar","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"M Shahid Mukhtar","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Maria Feychting","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Anthony Matthews","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Qing Zou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Bay Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Jie Zheng","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Liangde Xu","author_inst":"School of Biomedical Engineering and Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Michael Farzan","author_inst":"Department of Immunology and Microbiology, The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Guocai Zhong","author_inst":"Shenzhen Bay Laboratory"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"systems biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.08.20057661","rel_title":"Towards reduction in bias in epidemic curves due to outcome misclassification through Bayesian analysis of time-series of laboratory test results: Case study of COVID-19 in Alberta, Canada and Philadelphia, USA","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.08.20057661","rel_abs":"The aim of our work was to better understand misclassification errors in identification of true cases of COVID-19 and to study the impact of these errors in epidemic curves. We examined publically available time-series data of laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, the causal agent for COVID-19, to try to explore, using a Bayesian approach, about the sensitivity and specificity of the PCR-based diagnostic test. Data originated from Alberta, Canada (available on 3\/28\/2020) and city of Philadelphia, USA (available on 3\/31\/2020). Our analysis revealed that the data were compatible with near-perfect specificity but it was challenging to gain information about sensitivity (prior and posterior largely overlapped). We applied these insights to uncertainty\/bias analysis of epidemic curves into jurisdictions under the assumptions of both improving and degrading sensitivity. If the sensitivity improved from 60 to 95%, the observed and adjusted epidemic curves likely fall within the 95% confidence intervals of the observed counts. However, bias in the shape and peak of the epidemic curves can be pronounced, if sensitivity either degrades or remains poor in the 60-70% range. In the extreme scenario, hundreds of undiagnosed cases, even among tested, are possible, potentially leading to further unchecked contagion should these cases not self-isolate. The best way to better understand bias in the epidemic curves of COVID-19 due to errors in testing is to empirically evaluate misclassification of diagnosis in clinical settings and apply this knowledge to adjustment of epidemic curves, a task for which the Bayesian method we presented is well-suited.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Igor Burstyn","author_inst":"Drexel University"},{"author_name":"Neal D.

The genomes of SARS-COV-2 strains isolated from different parts of the world are now available and the unique features of constituent genes and proteins have gotten substantial attention recently. Spike glycoprotein is widely considered as a possible target to be explored because of its role during the entry of coronaviruses into host cells. We analyzed 320 whole-genome sequences and 320 spike protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 using multiple sequence alignment tools. In this study, 483 unique variations have been identified among the genomes including 25 non-synonymous mutations and one deletion in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Among the 26 variations detected, 12 variations were located at the N-terminal domain and 6 variations at the receptor-binding domain (RBD) which might alter the interaction with receptor molecules. In addition, 22 amino acid insertions were identified in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with that of SARS-CoV. Phylogenetic analyses of spike protein revealed that Bat coronavirus have a close evolutionary relationship with circulating SARS-CoV-2. The genetic variation analysis data presented in this study can help a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Based on our findings, potential inhibitors can be designed and tested targeting these proposed sites of variation.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Syed Mohammad Lokman","author_inst":"University of Chittagong"},{"author_name":"Md.

The resulting disease, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-2019), soon became a pandemic. This study aims to characterize key attributes of the epidemiology of this infection in China. Methods: An age-stratified mathematical model was constructed to describe the transmission dynamics and estimate the age-specific differences in the biological susceptibility to the infection, age-assortativeness in transmission mixing, case fatality rate (CFR), and transition in rate of infectious contacts (and reproduction number R0) following introduction of mass interventions. Results: The model estimated the infectious contact rate in early epidemic at 0.59 contacts per day (95% uncertainty interval (UI)=0.48-0.71). Relative to those 60-69 years of age, susceptibility to the infection was only 0.06 in those [&le;]19 years, 0.34 in 20-29 years, 0.57 in 30-39 years, 0.69 in 40-49 years, 0.79 in 50-59 years, 0.94 in 70-79 years, and 0.88 in [&ge;]80 years. The assortativeness in transmission mixing by age was very limited at 0.004 (95% UI=0.002-0.008). Final CFR was 5.1% (95% UI=4.8-5.4%). R0 rapidly declined from 2.1 (95% UI=1.8-2.4) to 0.06 (95% UI=0.05-0.07) following onset of interventions. Conclusion: Age appears to be a principal factor in explaining the patterns of COVID-19 transmission dynamics in China. The biological susceptibility to the infection seems limited among children, intermediate among young to mid-age adults, but high among those >50 years of age. There was no evidence for differential contact mixing by age, consistent with most transmission occurring in households rather than in schools or workplaces.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Houssein H Ayoub","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Physics, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Hiam Chemaitelly","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Epidemiology Group, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, Cornell University, Qatar Foundation - Education City, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Ghina R Mumtaz","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and population Health, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon"},{"author_name":"Shaheen Seedat","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Epidemiology Group, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, Cornell University, Qatar Foundation - Education City, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Susanne F Awad","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Epidemiology Group, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, Cornell University, Qatar Foundation - Education City, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Monia Makhoul","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Epidemiology Group, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, Cornell University, Qatar Foundation - Education City, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Laith J Abu-Raddad","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Epidemiology Group, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, Cornell University, Qatar Foundation - Education City, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Amam Zonaed Siddiki","author_inst":"University of Chittagong"},{"author_name":"Adnan Mannan","author_inst":"University of Chittagong"},{"author_name":"Md.

We discovered much evidence of putative G-quadruplex sites and even much more of inverted repeats (IRs) loci, which in fact are ubiquitous along the whole genomic sequence and indicate a possible mechanism for genomic RNA packaging. The most notable enrichment of IRs was found inside 5'UTR for IRs of size 12+ nucleotides, and the most notable enrichment of putative quadruplex sites (PQSs) was located before 3'UTR, inside 5'UTR, and before mRNA. This indicates crucial regulatory roles for both IRs and PQSs. Moreover, we found multiple G-quadruplex binding motifs in human proteins having potential for binding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Noncanonical nucleic acids structures in Nidovirales and in novel SARS-CoV-2 are therefore promising druggable structures that can be targeted and utilized in the future.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Martin Bartas","author_inst":"University of Ostrava"},{"author_name":"Vaclav Brazda","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic"},{"author_name":"Natalia Bohalova","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic"},{"author_name":"Alessio Cantara","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic"},{"author_name":"Adriana Volna","author_inst":"University of Ostrava"},{"author_name":"Tereza Stachurova","author_inst":"University of Ostrava"},{"author_name":"Katerina Malachova","author_inst":"University of Ostrava"},{"author_name":"Eva B Jagelska","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic"},{"author_name":"Otilia Porubiakova","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic"},{"author_name":"Jiri Cerven","author_inst":"University of Ostrava"},{"author_name":"Petr Pecinka","author_inst":"University of Ostrava"},{"author_name":"Guocai Zhong","author_inst":"Shenzhen Bay Laboratory"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.08.20058123","rel_title":"Long-term predictions for COVID-19 pandemic dynamics in Ukraine, Austria and Italy","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.08.20058123","rel_abs":"The SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) model, statistical approach to the parameter identification and the official WHO daily data about the confirmed cumulative number of cases were used to make some estimations for the dynamics of the coronavirus pandemic dynamics in Ukraine, Italy and Austria.

Spike(S) protein, one of the structural proteins of this virus plays key role in receptor (ACE2) binding and thus virus entry. Thus, this protein has attracted scientists for detailed study and therapeutic targeting. As the 2019 novel coronavirus takes its course throughout the world, more and more sequence analyses are been done and genome sequences getting deposited in various databases. From India two clinical isolates have been sequenced and the full genome deposited in GenBank. We have performed sequence analyses of the spike protein of the Indian isolates and compared with that of the Wuhan, China (where the outbreak was first reported). While all the sequences of Wuhan isolates are identical, we found point mutations in the Indian isolates. Out of the two isolates one was found to harbour a mutation in its Receptor binding domain (RBD) at position 407. At this site arginine (a positively charged amino acid) was replaced by isoleucine (a hydrophobic amino acid that is also a C-beta branched amino acid). This mutation has been seen to change the secondary structure of the protein at that region and this can potentially alter receptor ding of the virus. Although this finding needs further validation and more sequencing, the information might be useful in rational drug designing and vaccine engineering.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Priyanka Saha","author_inst":"CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology"},{"author_name":"Arup Kumar Banerjee","author_inst":"North Bengal Medical College and Hospital"},{"author_name":"Prem Prakash Tripathi","author_inst":"CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology"},{"author_name":"Amit Kumar Srivastava","author_inst":"CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology"},{"author_name":"Upasana Ray","author_inst":"CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology"},{"author_name":"Tereza Stachurova","author_inst":"University of Ostrava"},{"author_name":"Katerina Malachova","author_inst":"University of Ostrava"},{"author_name":"Eva B Jagelska","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic"},{"author_name":"Otilia Porubiakova","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic"},{"author_name":"Jiri Cerven","author_inst":"University of Ostrava"},{"author_name":"Petr Pecinka","author_inst":"University of Ostrava"},{"author_name":"Guocai Zhong","author_inst":"Shenzhen Bay Laboratory"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.08.20058487","rel_title":"Modeling layered non-pharmaceutical interventions against SARS-CoV-2 in the United States with Corvid","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.08.20058487","rel_abs":"Background: The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread across the globe and is poised to cause millions of deaths worldwide. There are currently no proven pharmaceutical treatments, and vaccines are likely over a year away. At present, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are the only effective option to reduce transmission of the virus, but it is not clear how to deploy these potentially expensive and disruptive measures. Modeling can be used to understand the potential effectiveness of NPIs for both suppression and mitigation efforts. Methods and Findings: We developed Corvid, an adaptation of the agent-based influenza model called FluTE to SARS-CoV-2 transmission. To demonstrate features of the model relevant for studying the effects of NPIs, we simulated transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a synthetic population representing a metropolitan area in the United States. Transmission in the model occurs in several settings, including at home, at work, and in schools. We simulated several combinations of NPIs that targeted transmission in these settings, such as school closures and work-from-home policies. We also simulated three strategies for testing and isolating symptomatic cases. For our demonstration parameters, we show that testing followed by home isolation of ascertained cases reduced transmission by a modest amount. We also show how further reductions may follow by isolating cases in safe facilities away from susceptible family members or by quarantining all family members to prevent transmission from likely infections that have yet to manifest. Conclusions: Models that explicitly include settings where individuals interact such as the home, work, and school are useful for studying the effectiveness of NPIs, as these are more dependent on community structure than pharmaceutical interventions such as vaccination. Corvid can be used to help evaluate complex combinations of interventions, although there is no substitute for real-world observations. Our results on NPI effectiveness summarize the behavior of the model for an assumed set of parameters for demonstration purposes. Model results can be sensitive to the assumptions made about disease transmission and the natural history of the disease, both of which are not yet sufficiently characterized for SARS-CoV-2 for quantitative modeling. Models of SARS-CoV-2 transmission will need to be updated as the pathogen becomes better-understood.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dennis L Chao","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Assaf P Oron","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Devabhaktuni Srikrishna","author_inst":"Patient Knowhow, Inc."},{"author_name":"Michael Famulare","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Upasana Ray","author_inst":"CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology"},{"author_name":"Tereza Stachurova","author_inst":"University of Ostrava"},{"author_name":"Katerina Malachova","author_inst":"University of Ostrava"},{"author_name":"Eva B Jagelska","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic"},{"author_name":"Otilia Porubiakova","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic"},{"author_name":"Jiri Cerven","author_inst":"University of Ostrava"},{"author_name":"Petr Pecinka","author_inst":"University of Ostrava"},{"author_name":"Guocai Zhong","author_inst":"Shenzhen Bay Laboratory"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.09.034983","rel_title":"Classical drug digitoxin inhibits influenza cytokine storm, with implications for COVID-19 therapy.","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.09.034983","rel_abs":"Influenza viruses, corona viruses and related pneumotropic viruses cause sickness and death partly by inducing a hyper-proinflammatory response by immune cells and cytokines in the host airway.

Methods: We used the Robert Koch Institute data on weekly COVID-19 cases in different age groups in Germany. To minimize the effect of changes in healthcare seeking behavior (e.g. for older adults) and testing practices, we included the following eight 5-year age groups in the analyses: 10-14y through 45-49y. For each age group g, we considered the proportion PL(g) of individuals in age group g among all detected cases aged 10-49y during weeks 13-14, 2020 (later period), as well as corresponding proportion PE(g) for weeks 10-11, 2020 (early period), and defined the relative risk RR(g) for the age group g to be the ratio RR(g)=PL(g)\/PE(g). For each pair of age groups g1,g2, a higher value of RR(g1) compared to RR(g2), or, alternatively, a value above 1 for the odds ratio OR(g1,g2)=RR(g1)\/RR(g2) for a COVID-19 case to be in group g1 vs. g2 for the later vs. early periods is interpreted as the relative increase in the population incidence of SARS-Cov-2 in the age group g1 compared to g2 for the later vs. early period. Results: The relative risk RR(g) was highest for individuals aged 20-24y (RR=1.4(95% CI (1.27,1.55))), followed by individuals aged 15-19y (RR=1.14(0.99,1.32)), aged 30-34y (RR= 1.07(0.99,1.16)), aged 25-29y (RR= 1.06(0.98,1.15)), aged 35-39y (RR=0.95(0.87,1.03)), aged 40-44y (RR=0.9(0.83,0.98)), aged 45-49y (RR=0.83(0.77,0.89)) and aged 10-14y (RR=0.78(0.64,0.95)). For the age group 20-24y, the odds ratio relative to any other age group for a case to be during the later vs. early period was significantly above 1. For the age group 15-19y, the odds ratio relative to any other age group either above 35y or 10-14y for a case to be during the later vs. early period was significantly above 1. Conclusions: The observed relative increase with time in the prevalence of individuals aged 15-34y (particularly those aged 20-24y) among detected COVID-19 cases in Germany is unlikely to be explained by increases in the likelihood of seeking medical care or the likelihood of being tested for individuals in those age groups compared to individuals aged 35-49y or 10-14y, and should be indicative of the actual increase in the prevalence of individuals aged 15-34y among SARS-CoV-2 infections in the German population. That increase likely reflects elevated mixing among individuals aged 15-34y (particularly those aged 20-24y) compared to other age groups, possibly due to lesser adherence to social distancing practices.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Edward Goldstein","author_inst":"Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Marc Lipsitch","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

There is evidence that homologous recombination contributed to this cross-species transmission. Since that time the virus has demonstrated a high propensity for human-to-human transmission. Here we report two newly identified adjacent amino acid polymorphisms in the nucleocapsid at positions 203 and 204 (R203K\/G204R) due to three adjacent nucleotide changes across the two codons (i.e. AGG GGA to AAA CGA). This new strain within the LGG clade may have arisen by a form of homologous recombination from the core sequence (CS-B) of the transcription-regulating sequences of SAS-CoV-2 itself and has rapidly increased to approximately one third of reported sequences from Europe during the month of March 2020. We note that these polymorphisms are predicted to reduce the binding of an overlying putative HLA-C*07-restricted epitope and that HLA-C*07 is prevalent in Caucasians being carried by >40% of the population. The findings suggest that homologous recombination may have occurred since its introduction into humans and be a mechanism for increased viral fitness and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to human populations.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shay Leary","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Murdoch University"},{"author_name":"Silvana Gaudieri","author_inst":"University of Western Australia"},{"author_name":"Abha Chopra","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Murdoch University"},{"author_name":"Suman Pakala","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Eric Alves","author_inst":"University of Western Australia"},{"author_name":"Mina John","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Murdoch University"},{"author_name":"Suman Das","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Simon Mallal","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Phillips Jane Phillips","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jiri Cerven","author_inst":"University of Ostrava"},{"author_name":"Petr Pecinka","author_inst":"University of Ostrava"},{"author_name":"Guocai Zhong","author_inst":"Shenzhen Bay Laboratory"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.09.20057257","rel_title":"Assessing the risk of spread of COVID-19 to the Asia Pacificregion","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.09.20057257","rel_abs":"During the early stages of an emerging disease outbreak, governments are required to make critical decisions on how to respond appropriately, despite limited data being available to inform these decisions. Analytical risk assessment is a valuable approach to guide decision-making on travel restrictions and border measures during the early phase of an outbreak, when transmission is primarily contained within a source country. Here we introduce a modular framework for estimating the importation risk of an emerging disease when the direct travel route is restricted and the risk stems from indirect importation via intermediary countries. This was the situation for Australia in February 2020. The framework was specifically developed to assess the importation risk of COVID-19 into Australia during the early stages of the outbreak from late January to mid-February 2020. The dominant importation risk to Australia at the time of analysis was directly from China, as the only country reporting uncontained transmission. However, with travel restrictions from mainland China to Australia imposed from February 1, our framework was designed to consider the importation risk from China into Australia via potential intermediary countries in the Asia Pacific region. The framework was successfully used to contribute to the evidence base for decisions on border measures and case definitions in the Australian context during the early phase of COVID-19 emergence and is adaptable to other contexts for future outbreak response.","rel_num_authors":0,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shay Leary","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Murdoch University"},{"author_name":"Silvana Gaudieri","author_inst":"University of Western Australia"},{"author_name":"Abha Chopra","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Murdoch University"},{"author_name":"Suman Pakala","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Eric Alves","author_inst":"University of Western Australia"},{"author_name":"Mina John","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Murdoch University"},{"author_name":"Suman Das","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Simon Mallal","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Phillips Jane Phillips","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jiri Cerven","author_inst":"University of Ostrava"},{"author_name":"Petr Pecinka","author_inst":"University of Ostrava"},{"author_name":"Guocai Zhong","author_inst":"Shenzhen Bay Laboratory"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.11.036855","rel_title":"Evaluation of heating and chemical protocols for inactivating SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.11.036855","rel_abs":"Clinical samples collected in COVID-19 patients are commonly manipulated in BSL-2 laboratories for diagnostic purpose.

While some economies are actively recovering from this pestilence, others are experiencing fast and consistent disease spread, compelling governments to impose social distancing measures that have put a halt on routines, especially in densely populated areas. Objective: Aiming at bringing more light on key economic and population health factors affecting the disease spread, this initial study utilizes a quantitative statistical analysis based on the most recent publicly available COVID-19 datasets. Methods: We have applied Pearson Correlation Analysis and Clustering Analysis (X-Means Clustering) techniques on the data obtained by combining multiple datasets related to country economics, medical system & health, and COVID-19 - related statistics. The resulting dataset consisted of COVID-19 Case and Mortality Rates, Economic Statistics, and Population Public Health Statistics for 165 countries reported between 22 January 2020 and 28 March 2020. The correlation analysis was conducted with the significance level  of 0.05. The clustering analysis was guided by the value of Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) with the bin value b = 1.0 and the cutoff factor c = 0.5, and have provided a stable split into four country-level clusters. Results: The study showed and explained multiple significant relationships between the COVID-19 data and other country-level statistics. We also identified and statistically profiled four major country-level clusters with relation to different aspects of COVID-19 development and country-level economic and health indicators. Specifically, this study identified potential COVID-19 under-reporting traits, as well as various economic factors that impact COVID-19 Diagnosis, Reporting, and Treatment. Based on the country clusters, we also described the four disease development scenarios, which are tightly knit to country-level economic and population health factors. Finally, we highlighted the potential limitation of reporting and measuring COVID-19 and provided recommendations on further in-depth quantitative research. Conclusions: In this study, we first identified possible COVID-19 reporting issues and biases across different countries and regions. Second, we identified crucial factors affecting the speed of COVID-19 disease spread and provided recommendations on choosing and operating economic and health system factors when analyzing COVID-19 progression. Particularly, we discovered that the political system and compliance with international disease control norms are crucial for effective COVID-19 pandemic cessation. However, the role of some widely-adopted measures, such as GHS Health Index, might have been overestimated in lieu of multiple biases and underreporting challenges. Third, we benchmarked our findings against the widely-adopted Global Health Security (GHS) model and found that the latter might be redundant when measuring and forecasting COVID-19 spread, while its individual components could potentially serve as stronger COVID-19 indicators. Fourth, we discovered four clusters of countries characterized by different COVID-19 development scenarios, highlighting the differences of the disease reporting and progression in different economic and health system settings. Finally, we provided recommendations on sophisticated measures and research approaches to be implemented for effective outbreak measurements, evaluation and forecasting. We have supported the latter recommendations by a preliminary regression analysis based on the our-collected dataset. We believe that our work would encourage further in-depth quantitative research along the direction as well as would be of support to public policy development when addressing the COVID-19 crisis worldwide.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aleksandr Farseev","author_inst":"ITMO University"},{"author_name":"Yu-Yi Chu-Farseeva","author_inst":"SoMin.ai Research"},{"author_name":"Yang Qi","author_inst":"ITMO University"},{"author_name":"Daron Benjamin Loo","author_inst":"National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Remi N Charrel","author_inst":"Unite des Virus Emergents (UVE: Aix Marseille Univ, IRD 190, INSERM U1207, IHU Mediterranee Infection), Marseille, France"},{"author_name":"Mina John","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Murdoch University"},{"author_name":"Suman Das","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Simon Mallal","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Phillips Jane Phillips","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jiri Cerven","author_inst":"University of Ostrava"},{"author_name":"Petr Pecinka","author_inst":"University of Ostrava"},{"author_name":"Guocai Zhong","author_inst":"Shenzhen Bay Laboratory"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.10.023358","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 detection with CRISPR diagnostics","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.10.023358","rel_abs":"The novel coronavirus (CoV) disease termed COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2) is causing a massive pandemic worldwide, threatening public health systems across the globe.
