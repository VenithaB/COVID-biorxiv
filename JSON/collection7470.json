We find that relaxing interventions has a strong impact on the size of the epidemic peak as a function of intervention re- moval time. We show that it is essential for predictive models to explicitly capture transmission from asymptomatic carriers and important to obtain precise information on asymptomatic transmission by testing. The asymptomatic reservoir, reported to account for as much as 85% of transmission, will contribute to resurgence of the epidemic if public health interventions are removed too soon. Use of more basic models that fail to capture asymptomatic transmission can result in large errors in predicted clinical caseload or in fitted epidemiological parameters and, therefore, may be unreliable in estimating the risk of a second wave based on the timing of terminated interventions.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ira B Schwartz","author_inst":"US Naval Research Laboratory"},{"author_name":"James H Kaufman","author_inst":"IBM Almaden Research Center"},{"author_name":"Kun Hu","author_inst":"IBM Almaden Research Center"},{"author_name":"Simone Bianco","author_inst":"IBM Almaden Research Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.19.20071399","rel_title":"Identification of super-transmitters of SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-04-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.19.20071399","rel_abs":"A newly emerged coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, caused severe outbreaks of pneumonia in China in December 2019 and has since spread to various countries around the world. To probe the origin and transmission dynamics of this virus, we performed phylodynamic analysis of 247 high quality genomic sequences of viruses available in the GISAID platform as of March 05, 2020. A substantial number of earliest sequences reported in Wuhan in December 2019, including those of viruses recovered from the Huanan Seafood Market (HNSM), the site of the initial outbreak, were genetically diverse, suggesting that viruses of multiple sources were involved in the original outbreak. The viruses were subsequently disseminated to different parts of China and other countries, with diverse mutational profiles being recorded in strains recovered subsequently. Interestingly, four genetic clusters defined as Super-transmitters (STs) were found to become dominant and were responsible for the major outbreaks in various countries. Among the four clusters, ST1 is widely disseminated in Asia and the US and mainly responsible for outbreaks in the states of Washington and California in the US as well as those in South Korea at the end of February and early March, whereas ST4 contributed to the pandemic in Europe. Each ST cluster carried a signature mutation profile which allowed us to trace the origin and transmission patterns of specific viruses in different parts of the world. Using the signature mutations as markers of STs, we further analysed 1539 genome sequences reported after February 29, 2020. We found that around 90% of these genomes belonged to STs with ST4 being the dominant one and their contribution to pandemic in different continents were also depicted. The identification of these super-transmitters provides insight into the control of further transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xuemei YANG","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Ning Dong","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Wai-Chi CHAN","author_inst":"The Hong Kong polytechnic university"},{"author_name":"Sheng CHEN","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.19.20071944","rel_title":"Community and Socioeconomic Factors Associated with COVID-19 in the United States: Zip code level cross sectional analysis","rel_date":"2020-04-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.19.20071944","rel_abs":"Background: Multiple reports have pointed towards involvement of community and socioeconomic characteristics of people in the United States may be associated with COVID-19 cases and deaths. Methods: In this study, zip-code level data from 5 major metropolitan areas, was utilized to study the effect of multiple demographic & socio-economic factors including race, age, income, chronic disease comorbidity, population density, number of people per household on number of positive cases and ensuing death. Adjusted linear regression analysis using 13 to 16 such variables was performed. Results: Overall, 442 zip codes reporting 93,170 positive COVID-19 cases and 138 zip codes reporting mortality ranging from 0 to 25 were included in this study. A multivariable linear regression model noted that 1% increase in the proportion of residents above the age of 65 years, proportion of African American residents, proportion of females, persons per household and population density of the zip code increased the proportion of positive cases by 0.77%, 0.23%, 1.64%, 1.83% and 0.46% respectively (P<0.01) with only population density remaining significant in zip codes with greater than median number of cases.

While many countries were affected, regions with an older population and weaker public health interventions tended to suffer more morbidity and mortality. Here we model and quantify the age-specific incidence of COVID-19 in four pandemic cities under different interventions. Methods We developed an age-specific and multiple-stage susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-hospitalized-quarantined-dead (SEIR-HQD) dynamical systems model expanded from the more basic SEIR model by incorporating location- and age-specific contact matrices to estimate the outcomes of COVID-19. Utilizing latest estimates of epidemiological parameters and demographic data, we model the potential effects of various interventions in four representative cities with different population structures - New York, Los Angeles, Daegu and Nairobi. We compared the effects of different interventions in the age-structure populations specific to each city. These policy options are then applied to determine the potential for effective containment. We model these dynamic policy scenarios to assess the risks of less-stringent social distancing, as has been proposed by those arguing to enhance economic activity over public health and safety. Finally, we explored the health impacts of different policy action timelines to understand the benefits of early interventions. Findings We find the spread of COVID-19 to be dramatically different in the regions modeled, with the primary drivers the variation of population age structures, and the dynamics of interactions of the younger demographics, whose higher interaction rates can lead to increasing transmission rates across these communities. A city with younger citizens may also have fewer hospitalized cases and deaths. Our modeling quantifies the value of early interventions, which avoided an additional 5%, 16%, 37% and 43% of the infections in Daegu, Nairobi, New York and Los Angeles, respectively, compared to what has been observed in the four cities. The finding is clear: in the absence of pharmaceutical options, delaying strict social policy interventions has resulted in substantial public health cost. This modeling can, and will, be applied to other cities and regions, and conducted in conjunction with other health insults, such as exposure to air pollution. Critically, we find that school closures, working from home, and reduction in other mobility were most beneficial for younger population (0-19 years old), middle-age (20-59 years old) population and older population (60 years and older), respectively across each city. Specifically, school closure avoided 25%, 18%, 16% and 12% of the infections for the population under 20 years old in Daegu, Los Angeles, New York and Nairobi, respectively. A 50% and 80% population working from home policy avoids 8% and 15% of the infections. Reduction in mobility was more effective than the working from home strategy. Any single social distancing policy if enacted alone can delay the spread of COVID-19 but was unable to totally suppress the infection. Coordinated policy action can be highly effective. Increasing the quarantine rate to 10% of infectious cases was more effective than strict social distancing alone in this study, although together they can suppress 80% of the epidemic. A combination of moderate social distancing and quarantine strategies was able to avoid 99% of the infections. Interpretation Moderate social distancing together with high quarantine rates was effective in each of the four cities. COVID-19 caused more deaths and hospitalization in cities with an ageing population than those with a younger population. However, in the cities with a younger population, there is a clear need to implement a social distancing strategy that is even more strict due to the higher transmission rates among younger people. Cities with more older people should prepare more hospital beds and healthcare facilities to save people who are in critical conditions. Cities with ageing population should take targeted action for the elderly to avoid the severe impacts on the vulnerable populations. Increasing quarantine rate is an effective strategy to avoid the substantial infection while also does not influence the economy fiercely. We recommend countries or regions experiencing, or likely to experience the rapid spread of COVID-19, to implement combination of multiple strategies in the early stage of the breakout which can avoid over 90% of infected cases.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hao Yin","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Zhu Liu","author_inst":"Center for Earth System Science, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Daniel M.

In Italy, there is a continued COVID-19 growth of cases and deaths that requires control measures for the correct management of the epidemiological emergency. To contribute to increasing the overall knowledge of COVID-19, systematic tests in the general population are required. Here, we describe the first Italian survey performed in 727 employees belonging to a Mother-Child Research hospital tested for both viral (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs) and antibody presence. Individuals were divided into three risk categories (high, medium and low) according to their job activity. Only one subject was positive at the swab test while 17.2% of the cohort was positive for the presence of antibodies. Results highlighted that the presence of Positive antibodies is significantly associated with high and medium risk exposure occupation (p-value=0.026) as well as cold and conjunctivitis symptoms (p-value=0.016 and 0.042 respectively). Moreover, among healthcare professionals, the category of medical doctors showed a significant association with the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (p-value=0.0127). Finally, we detected a rapid decrease in antibody intensity between two assessments performed within a very short period (p-value=0.009). Overall, the present study increases our knowledge of the epidemiological data of COVID-19 infection in Italy, suggesting a high prevalence of immune individuals (i.e. at least among at-risk

cases by 19th February 2020, since then it has become one of the most affected countries, with more than 73,000 cases and 4,585 deaths at the date. Spatial modeling could be used to approach an understanding of structural and sociodemographic factors that have impacted COVID-19 spread at a province-level in Iran. In the present paper, we developed a spatial statistical approach to describe how COVID-19 cases are spatially distributed and to identify significant spatial clusters of cases and how the socioeconomic features of Iranian provinces might predict the number of cases. We identified a cluster of provinces with significantly higher rates of COVID-19 cases around Tehran, which indicated that the spread of COVID-19 within Iran was spatially correlated. Urbanized, highly connected provinces with older population structures and higher average temperatures were the most susceptible to present a higher number of COVID-19 cases. Interestingly, literacy is a protective factor that might be directly related to health literacy and compliance with public health measures. These features indicate that policies related to social distancing, protecting older adults, and vulnerable populations, as well as promoting health literacy, might be targeted to reduce SARS-CoV2 spread in Iran. Our approach could be applied to model COVID-19 outbreaks in other countries with similar characteristics or in case of an upturn in COVID-19 within

(COVID-19) continues in several jurisdictions, causing significant strain to healthcare systems. The purpose of our study is to predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patient outcomes and the healthcare system in Ontario, Canada. Methods: We developed an individual-level simulation to model the flow of COVID-19 patients through the Ontario healthcare system. We simulated different combined scenarios of epidemic trajectory and healthcare capacity. Outcomes include numbers of patients needing admission to the ward, Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and requiring ventilation; days to resource depletion; and numbers of patients awaiting resources and deaths associated with limited access to resources. Findings: We demonstrate that with effective early public health measures system resources need not be depleted. For scenarios considering late or ineffective implementation of physical distancing, health system resources would be depleted within 14-26 days. Resource depletion was also avoided or delayed with aggressive measures to rapidly increase ICU, ventilator, and acute care hospital capacity. Interpretation: We found that without aggressive physical distancing measures the Ontario healthcare system would have been inadequately equipped to manage the expected number of patients with COVID-19, despite the rapid capacity increase. This overall lack of resources would have led to an increase in mortality. By slowing the spread of the disease via ongoing public health measures and having increased healthcare capacity, Ontario may have avoided catastrophic stresses to its health care system.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kali Barrett","author_inst":"University Health Network"},{"author_name":"Yasin A Khan","author_inst":"University Health Network"},{"author_name":"Stephen Mac","author_inst":"Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Raphael Ximenes","author_inst":"Toronto Health Economics and Technology Assessment (THETA) Collaborative, University Health Network"},{"author_name":"David MJ Naimark","author_inst":"Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre"},{"author_name":"Beate Sander","author_inst":"Toronto Health Economics and Technology Assessment (THETA) Collaborative, University Health Network"},{"author_name":"Roberta Bottega","author_inst":"1Department of Medicine, Surgery and Health Sciences, University of Trieste 2Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Petra Carli","author_inst":"Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Andrea Cassone","author_inst":"Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Eulalia Catamo","author_inst":"1Department of Medicine, Surgery and Health Sciences, University of Trieste 2Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Cocca","author_inst":"Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Massimo Del Pin","author_inst":"Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Mariateresa Di Stazio","author_inst":"1Department of Medicine, Surgery and Health Sciences, University of Trieste 2Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Agnese Feresin","author_inst":"1Department of Medicine, Surgery and Health Sciences, University of Trieste 2Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Martina La Bianca","author_inst":"Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Sara Morassut","author_inst":"Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Anna Morgan","author_inst":"1Department of Medicine, Surgery and Health Sciences, University of Trieste 2Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giulia Pelliccione","author_inst":"Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Vincenzo Petix","author_inst":"Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giulia Ragusa","author_inst":"Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Antonietta Robino","author_inst":"Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Stefano Russian","author_inst":"Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Beatrice Spedicati","author_inst":"1Department of Medicine, Surgery and Health Sciences, University of Trieste 2Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Sarah Suergiu","author_inst":"Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marianela Urriza","author_inst":"Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Fulvia Vascotto","author_inst":"Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Paola Toscani","author_inst":"Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giorgia Girotto","author_inst":"1Department of Medicine, Surgery and Health Sciences, University of Trieste 2Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Paolo Gasparini","author_inst":"1Department of Medicine, Surgery and Health Sciences, University of Trieste 2Institute for Maternal and Child Health  IRCCS, Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.19.20071845","rel_title":"The importance of timing of a population level intervention on COVID-19 mortality","rel_date":"2020-04-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.19.20071845","rel_abs":"COVID-19 poses an immense and immediate threat to global public health. Population level interventions (PLIs) impact this threat, with estimable large effects on reducing mortality. Many countries worldwide have currently zero\/low mortality and many have yet to implement such PLIs. The importance of timing of PLI implementation on mortality outcomes is poorly understood. We extracted cumulative country-specific COVID-19 mortality for France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK to examine country-specific mortality trends and found that all five countries experienced COVID-19 mortality epidemics initially of exponential nature. We estimated the magnitude of effect on mortality of the nationwide PLI implemented on day 18 of Italy's mortality epidemic and assessed the importance of timing of PLI implementation by computing the effect of implementation of a PLI of this magnitude at various times on subsequent mortality. The nationwide PLI in Italy saved an estimated 6,170 lives by day 30 of the Italian epidemic. Implementing a PLI with this effect magnitude in a country of 60 million people on the day of the first death, and on days 7, 10, 14 and 17 thereafter, compared to implementation on day 18, resulted in substantially greater numbers of lives saved. Implementation on day 1 resulted in an additional 3,477 lives saved, 6,955 intensive care unit admissions and 52,162 hospital admissions prevented, beyond that achieved by implementation on day 18. PLI implementation earlier than day 18 substantially enhances benefit. Intervention on the day of the first mortality event in a country achieves the greatest benefit.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jasper S Johnston","author_inst":"Virtus

disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a large New York City (NYC) medical center and describe their clinical course across the emergency department (ED), inpatient wards, and intensive care units (ICUs). Design: Retrospective manual medical record review. Setting: NewYork-Presbyterian\/Columbia University Irving Medical Center (NYP\/CUIMC), a quaternary care academic medical center in NYC. Participants: The first 1000 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Methods: We identified the first 1000 consecutive patients with a positive RT-SARS-CoV-2 PCR test who first presented to the ED or were hospitalized at NYP\/CUIMC between March 1 and April 5, 2020. Patient data was manually abstracted from the electronic medical record. Main outcome measures: We describe patient characteristics including demographics, presenting symptoms, comorbidities on presentation, hospital course, time to intubation, complications, mortality, and disposition. Results: Among the first 1000 patients, 150 were ED patients, 614 were admitted without requiring ICU-level care, and 236 were admitted or transferred to the ICU. The most common presenting symptoms were cough (73.2%), fever (72.8%), and dyspnea (63.1%). Hospitalized patients, and ICU patients in particular, most commonly had baseline comorbidities including of hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. ICU patients were older, predominantly male (66.9%), and long lengths of stay (median 23 days; IQR 12 to 32 days); 78.0% developed AKI and 35.2% required dialysis. Notably, for patients who required mechanical ventilation, only 4.4% were first intubated more than 14 days after symptom onset. Time to intubation from symptom onset had a bimodal distribution, with modes at 3-4 and 9 days. As of April 30, 90 patients remained hospitalized and 211 had died in the hospital. Conclusions: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 illness at this medical center faced significant morbidity and mortality, with high rates of AKI, dialysis, and a bimodal distribution in time to intubation from symptom onset.","rel_num_authors":48,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael G Argenziano","author_inst":"Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and

Timely epidemiological surveillance is essential for outbreak response, but is complicated by a high proportion of silent (non-symptomatic) infections and limited testing resources. Methods: We used a stochastic, individual-based model to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission along detailed inter-individual contact networks describing patient-staff interactions in real LTCF settings. We distributed nasopharyngeal swabs and RT-PCR tests using clinical and demographic indications, and evaluated the efficacy and resource-efficiency of a range of surveillance strategies, including group testing (sample pooling) and testing cascades, which couple (i) testing for multiple indications (symptoms, admission) with (ii) random daily testing. Results: In the baseline scenario, randomly introducing SARS-CoV-2 into a 170-bed LTCF led to large outbreaks, with a cumulative 86 (6-224) infections after three weeks of unmitigated transmission. Efficacy of symptom-based screening was limited by (i) lags between infection and symptom onset, and (ii) silent transmission from asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections. Testing upon admission detected up to 66% of patients silently infected upon LTCF entry, but missed potential introductions from staff. Random daily testing was more effective when targeting patients than staff, but was overall an inefficient use of limited resources. At high testing capacity (>1 test\/10 beds\/day), cascades were most effective, with a 22-52% probability of detecting outbreaks prior to any nosocomial transmission, and 38-63% prior to first onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Conversely, at low capacity (<1 test\/85 beds\/day), pooling randomly selected patients in a daily group test was most effective (9-15% probability of detecting outbreaks prior to transmission; 30-44% prior to symptoms). The most efficient strategy compared to the reference was to pool individuals with any COVID-like symptoms, requiring only 5-7 additional tests and 17-24 additional swabs to detect outbreaks 5-6 days earlier, prior to an additional 14-18 infections. Conclusions: Group testing is an effective and efficient COVID-19 surveillance strategy for resource-limited LTCFs. Cascades are even more effective given ample testing resources. Increasing testing capacity and updating surveillance protocols accordingly could facilitate earlier detection of emerging outbreaks, informing a need for urgent intervention in settings with ongoing nosocomial transmission.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David RM Smith","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Audrey Duval","author_inst":"Institut

Okinawa, Japan. We find that the initial spread is characterized by a doubling time of about 5 days. We implement a model to forecast the future spread under different scenarios. The model predicts that, if significant containment measures are not taken, a large fraction of the population will be infected with COVID-19, with the peak of the epidemic expected at the end of May and intensive care units having largely exceeded capacity. We analyzed scenarios implementing strong containment measures, similar to those imposed in Europe. The model predicts that an immediate implementation of strong containment measures (on the 19th of April) will significantly reduce the death count. We assess the negative consequences of these measure being implemented with a delay, or not being sufficiently stringent.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Simone

The results indicate that the IFR of COVID-19 may be an order of magnitude smaller than the current consensus, with the corollary that the virus is more prevalent than currently believed. These results emerge from a simple model and ought to be treated with caution.

spread of diseases such as the global COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. However, all models are based on simplifying assumptions and on sparse data. This limits the reliability of parameter estimates and predictions. In this manuscript, we demonstrate the relevance of these limitations by performing a study of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China. We perform parameter estimation, uncertainty analysis and model selection for a range of established epidemiological models. Amongst others, we employ Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, parameter and prediction profile calculation algorithms. Our results show that parameter estimates and predictions obtained for several established models on the basis of reported case numbers can be subject to substantial uncertainty. More importantly, estimates were often unrealistic and the confidence \/ credibility intervals did not cover plausible values of critical parameters obtained using different approaches. These findings suggest, amongst others, that several models are over-simplistic and that the reported case numbers provide often insufficient information.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elba Raim\u00fandez","author_inst":"University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Erika Dudkin","author_inst":"University of

worldwide and threatens millions of lives. It remains unknown if summer weather will reduce its continued spread, thereby alleviating strains on hospitals and providing time for vaccine development. Early insights from laboratory studies of related coronaviruses predicted that COVID-19 would decline at higher temperatures, humidity, and ultraviolet light. Using current, fine-scaled weather data and global reports of infection we developed a model that explained 36% of variation in early growth rates before intervention, with 17% based on weather or demography and 19% based on country-specific effects. We found that ultraviolet light was most strongly associated with lower COVID-19 growth rates. Projections suggest that, in the absence of intervention, COVID-19 will decrease temporarily during summer, rebound by autumn, and peak next winter. However, uncertainty remains high and the probability of a weekly doubling rate remained >20% throughout the summer in the absence of control. Consequently, aggressive policy interventions will likely be needed in spite of seasonal trends.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cory Merow","author_inst":"University of

Critically ill COVID-19 patients have relatively well-preserved lung mechanics despite severe gas exchange abnormalities, a feature not consistent with classical ARDS but more consistent with pulmonary vascular disease. Patients with severe COVID-19 also demonstrate markedly abnormal coagulation, with elevated D-dimers and higher rates of venous thromboembolism. We present five cases of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia with severe respiratory failure and shock, with evidence of markedly elevated dead-space ventilation who received tPA. All showed post treatment immediate improvements in gas exchange and\/or hemodynamics. We suspect that severe COVID-19 pneumonia causes respiratory failure via pulmonary microthrombi and endothelial dysfunction.

Since then the epidemic has taken different trajectories across different geographical locations in the country. This study explores the population aggregated trajectories of COVID19 susceptible, infected and recovered or dead cases in the south Indian state of Telangana with a population of approximately 40 million. Information on cases reported from March 2 to April 4 was collated from government records. The susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model for the spread of an infectious disease was used. Transmission parameters were extracted from existing literature that has emerged over past weeks from other regions with similar population densities as Telangana. Optimisation algorithms were used to get basic reproduction rate for different phases of nonpharmaceutical interventions rolled by the government. Peak accumulation is projected towards end of July with 36% of the population being infected by August 2020 if the population lockdown or social distancing mechanism is not continued. The number of deaths assuming no intervention is projected to be 488000 (95% CI: (329400, 646600)). A draconian enforcement of population lockdown combined with hand and face hygiene adherence would reduce the transmission by at least 99.7% whereas partial social distancing and hygiene would reduce it by 51.2%. Transmission parameters reported should be interpreted with caution as they are population aggregated and do not consider unique characteristics of susceptibility among micro-clusters and vulnerable individuals. More data will need to be collected to optimize transmission parameters and evaluate the full complexity, to simulate real world scenarios in the models.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rashmi Pant","author_inst":"Society for Health Allied Research and Education (SHARE-INDIA)"},{"author_name":"Lincoln Priyadarshi Choudhry","author_inst":"Krashapana consultancy private limited"},{"author_name":"Jammy Guru Rajesh","author_inst":"Society for Health Allied Research and Education (SHARE-INDIA)"},{"author_name":"Vijay V Yeldandi","author_inst":"Society for Health Allied Research and Education (SHARE-INDIA)"},{"author_name":"Gregory Serrao","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Amanda Zeidman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Neha S.

To identify the key parameters or processes that have the greatest effects on the pandemic and reveal the different progressions of epidemics in different countries, we quantified enhanced control measures and the dynamics of the production and provision of medical resources. We then nested these within a COVID-19 epidemic transmission model, which is parameterized by multi-source data. We obtained rate functions related to the intensity of mitigation measures, the effective reproduction numbers and the timings and durations of runs on medical resources, given differing control measures implemented in various countries. Increased detection rates may induce runs on medical resources and prolong their durations, depending on resource availability. Nevertheless, improving the detection rate can effectively and rapidly reduce the mortality rate, even after runs on medical resources. Combinations of multiple prevention and control strategies and timely improvement of abilities to supplement medical resources are key to effective control of the COVID-19 epidemic. A 50% reduction in comprehensive control measures would have led to the cumulative numbers of confirmed cases and deaths exceeding 590000 and 60000, respectively, by 27 March 2020 in mainland China. The proposed model can assist health authorities to predict when they will be most in need of hospital beds and equipment such as ventilators, personal protection equipment, drugs and staff.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xia Wang","author_inst":"Shaanxi Normal University"},{"author_name":"Qian Li","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Xiaodan Sun","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Sha He","author_inst":"Shaanxi Normal University"},{"author_name":"Fan Xia","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Pengfei Song","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Yiming Shao","author_inst":"Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jianhong Wu","author_inst":"York University"},{"author_name":"Robert A.

First, the spread of SARS-COV-2 has produced population specific lineages; second, epidemic spread model parameters are tied directly to these physiological and demic rates (e. g. incubation time, recovery time, transmission rate); and third, these parameters may serve as novel phenotypes to associate with region-specific genetic mutations as well as demic characteristics (e. g. age structure, cultural observance of personal space, crowdedness). Therefore, we sought to understand whether the parameters of epidemic models could be determined from the trajectory of infections, recovery, and hospitalizations prior to peak, and also to evaluate the quality and comparability of data between jurisdictions reporting their statistics necessary for the analysis of model parameters across populations. We found that, analytically, the pre-peak growth of an epidemic is limited by a subset of the model variates, and that the rate limiting variables are dominated by the expanding eigenmode of their equations. The variates quickly converge to the ratio of eigenvector components of the positive growth rate, which determines the doubling time. There are 9 parameters and 4 independent components in the eigenmode, leaving 5 undetermined parameters. Those parameters can be strikingly population dependent, and can have significant impact on estimates of hospital loads downstream. Without a sound framework, measurements of infection rates and other parameters are highly corrupted by uneven testing rates to uneven counting and reporting of relevant values. From the standpoint of phenotype parameters, this means that structured experiments must be performed to estimate these parameters in order to perform genetic association studies, or to construct viable models that accurately predict critical quantities such as hospitalization loads.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel E Platt","author_inst":"IBM"},{"author_name":"Laxmi E Parida","author_inst":"IBM Research"},{"author_name":"Pierre Zalloua","author_inst":"TH Chan Harvard School of Public Health; School of Medicine, Lebanese American University"},{"author_name":"Sha He","author_inst":"Shaanxi Normal University"},{"author_name":"Fan Xia","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Pengfei Song","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Yiming Shao","author_inst":"Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jianhong Wu","author_inst":"York University"},{"author_name":"Robert A.

COVID-19 is predominantly defined by respiratory symptoms, but cardiac complications including arrhythmias, heart failure, and viral myocarditis are also prevalent. Although the systemic ischemic and inflammatory responses caused by COVID-19 can detrimentally affect cardiac function, the direct impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on human cardiomyocytes is not well-understood. We used human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) as a model system to examine the mechanisms of cardiomyocyte-specific infection by SARS-CoV-2. Microscopy and immunofluorescence demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 can enter and replicate within hiPSC-CMs, localizing at perinuclear locations within the cytoplasm. Viral cytopathic effect induced hiPSC-CM apoptosis and cessation of beating after 72 hours of infection. These studies show that SARS-CoV-2 can infect hiPSC-CMs in vitro, establishing a model for elucidating the mechanisms of infection and potentially a cardiac-specific antiviral drug screening platform.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arun Sharma","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Gustavo Garcia Jr.","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Vaithilingaraja Arumugaswami","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Clive N Svendsen","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Fan Xia","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Pengfei Song","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Yiming Shao","author_inst":"Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jianhong Wu","author_inst":"York University"},{"author_name":"Robert A.

SARS-CoV-2 is genetically close to SARS-CoV, thus it is important to define the between antigenic cross-reactivity and neutralization. In this study, we firstly analyzed 20 convalescent serum samples collected from SARS-CoV infected individuals during the 2003 SARS outbreak. All patient sera reacted strongly with the S1 subunit and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV, cross-reacted with the S ectodomain, S1, RBD, and S2 proteins of SARS-CoV-2, and neutralized both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S protein-driven infections. Multiple panels of antisera from mice and rabbits immunized with a full-length S and RBD immunogens of SARS-CoV were also characterized, verifying the cross-reactive neutralization against SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, we found that a palm civet SARS-CoV-derived RBD elicited more potent cross-neutralizing responses in immunized animals than the RBD from a human SARS-CoV strain, informing a strategy to develop a universe vaccine against emerging CoVs.\n\nSummarySerum antibodies from SARS-CoV infected patients and immunized animals cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2 suggests strategies for universe vaccines

to severe respiratory disease that can result in death. Although vaccines exist against circulating influenza A viruses, such vaccines are ineffective against emerging pandemic influenza A viruses. Currently, no vaccine exists against coronavirus infections, including pandemic SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). To combat these RNA virus infections, alternative antiviral strategies are needed. A key drug target is the viral RNA polymerase, which is responsible for viral RNA synthesis. In January 2020, the World Health Organisation identified enisamium as a candidate therapeutic against SARS-CoV-2. Enisamium is an isonicotinic acid derivative that is an inhibitor of multiple influenza B and A virus strains in cell culture and clinically approved in 11 countries. Here we show using in vitro assays that enisamium and its putative metabolite, VR17-04, inhibit the activity of the influenza virus and the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase. VR17-04 displays similar efficacy against the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase as the nucleotide analogue remdesivir triphosphate. These results suggest that enisamium is a broad-spectrum small molecule inhibitor of RNA virus RNA synthesis, and implicate it as a possible therapeutic option for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Unlike remdesivir, enisamium does not require intravenous administration which may be advantageous for the development of COVID-19 treatments outside a hospital setting.\n\nImportanceInfluenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2 are respiratory viruses capable of causing pandemics, and the latter is responsible for the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Both viruses encode RNA polymerases which transcribe their RNA genomes and are important targets for antiviral drugs including remdesivir. Here, we show that the antiviral drug enisamium inhibits the RNA polymerases of both influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, we show that a putative metabolite of enisamium is a more potent inhibitor, inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase with similar efficiency to remdesivir. Our data offer insight into the mechanism of action for enisamium, and implicate it as a broad-spectrum antiviral which could be used in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexander Walker","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Haitian Fan","author_inst":"University of

Specifically, CREST pairs commonplace and reliable biochemical methods (PCR) with low-cost instrumentation, without sacrificing detection sensitivity. By taking advantage of simple fluorescence visualizers, CREST allows for a binary interpretation of results.

COVID-19 pandemic have posed a public health crisis. Higher morbidity and mortality of men with COVID-19 may be explained by androgen-driven mechanisms. One such proposed mechanism is androgen regulation of pulmonary TMPRSS2, the host co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2. We find no evidence for increased TMPRSS2 mRNA expression in the lungs of males compared to females in humans or mice. Furthermore, in male mice, treatment with the androgen receptor antagonist enzalutamide does not decrease pulmonary TMPRSS2 expression. Nevertheless, regardless of sex, smoking significantly increases the expression of TMPRSS2, which reverts back to never-smoker levels in former smokers. Finally, we show that in mouse models, despite equivalent AR transcript levels, males express markedly higher amounts of AR protein. If a similar sex-specific regulation of AR protein occurs in human lung, androgens could play important roles in clinical outcome of COVID-19 through mechanisms other than TMPRSS2 regulation.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mehdi Baratchian","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"Jeff McManus","author_inst":"Cleveland

pandemic is affecting the health and\/or socioeconomic life of almost each people in the world. Finding vaccines and therapeutics is urgent but without forgetting to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that allow some viruses to become dangerous for humans. Here, analysis of all proteins of SARS-CoV-2 revealed a unique PPxY Late (L) domain motif 25PPAY28 in spike protein inside hot disordered loop predicted subject to phosphorylation and binding. It was demonstrated in enveloped RNA viruses that PPxY motif recruits Nedd4 E3 ubiquitin ligases and ultimately the ESCRT complex to enhance virus budding and release that means a high viral load, hence facilitating new infections. Note that PPxY motif is not present in proteins of SARS-CoV. This suggests that PPxY motif by its role in enhancing the viral load could explain why SARS-CoV-2 is more contagious than SARS-CoV. Of course, after the experimental verifications showing that PPxY motif plays the same role as reported for other enveloped RNA viruses, it could become an interesting target for the development of novel host-oriented antivirals therapeutics for preventing S protein to recruit Nedd4 E3 ubiquitin ligases partners.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Halim
