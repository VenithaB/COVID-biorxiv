Methods: One week after the announcement of the COVID-19 as a pandemic, in a global survey, 177 addiction medicine professionals described COVID-19-related health responses in their own 77 countries in terms of SUD treatment and harm reduction services. The health response is categorized around (1) managerial measures and systems, (2) logistics, (3) service providers, and (4) vulnerable groups. Results: Respondents from over 88% of countries reported that core medical and psychiatric care for SUDs had continued; however, only 56% of countries reported having had any business continuity plan, and 37.5% of countries reported shortages of methadone or buprenorphine supplies. Participants of 41% of countries reported partial discontinuation of harm-reduction services such as needle and syringe programs and condom distribution. 57% of overdose prevention interventions and 81% of outreach services also having been negatively impacted. Conclusions: Participants reported that SUD treatment and harm reduction services had been significantly impacted globally early during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on our findings, we provide a series of recommendations to support countries to be prepared more efficiently for future waves or similar pandemics to 1) help policymakers generate business continuity plans, 2) maintain the use of evidence-based interventions for people with SUDs, 3) be prepared for adequate medication supplies, 4) integrate harm reduction programs with other treatment modalities and 5) have specific considerations for vulnerable groups such as immigrants and refugees.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Seyed Ramin Radfar","author_inst":"Integrated Substance Abuse Programs Department, University of California, Los Angeles, USA;  Department of Psychiatry, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Te"},{"author_name":"Cornelis A J De Jong","author_inst":"Radboud University, Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Ali Farhoudian","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran; Substance Abuse and Dependence Research Center, University of Social Welfare and "},{"author_name":"Mohsen Ebrahimi","author_inst":"Iranian National Center for Addiction Studies, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Iran; Materials and Energy Research Center, Iran"},{"author_name":"Parnian Rafei","author_inst":"Department of Psychology, Faculty of Psychology and Education, University of Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Mehrnoosh Vahidi","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Masud Yunesian","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Christos Kouimtsidis","author_inst":"Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, UK"},{"author_name":"Shalini Arunogiri","author_inst":"Turning Point, Eastern Health, Box Hill, Australia"},{"author_name":"Omid Massah","author_inst":"Substance Abuse and Dependence Research Center, University of Social Welfare and Rehabilitation Sciences, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Abbas Deylamizadeh","author_inst":"Rebirth Charity Society NGO, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Kathleen T Brady","author_inst":"Medical University of South Carolina, USA"},{"author_name":"Anja Busse","author_inst":"Prevention, Treatment and Rehabilitation Section; Drug Prevention and Health Branch, Division for Operations, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Vienna, "},{"author_name":"- ISAM-PPIG Global Survey Consortium","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Marc N Potenza","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine, Connecticut Council on Problem Gambling and Connecticut Mental Health Center, USA"},{"author_name":"Hamed Ekhtiari","author_inst":"Laureate Institute for Brain Research, Tulsa, OK, USA"},{"author_name":"Alexander Mario Baldacchino","author_inst":"University of St Andrews, UK"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"addiction medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.22.20199398","rel_title":"Epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 cases in non-Italian nationals notified to the Italian surveillance system","rel_date":"2020-09-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.22.20199398","rel_abs":"Background International literature suggests that disadvantaged groups are at higher risk of morbidity and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection due to poorer living\/working conditions and barriers to healthcare access. Yet, to date, there is no evidence of this disproportionate impact on non-national individuals, including economic migrants, short-term travellers, and refugees. Methods We analysed data from the Italian surveillance system of all COVID-19 laboratory-confirmed cases tested positive from the beginning of the outbreak (20th of February) to the 19th of July 2020. We used multilevel negative-binomial regression models to compare the case-fatality rate and the rate of admission to hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) between Italian and non-Italian nationals. The analysis was adjusted for differences in demographic characteristics, pre-existing comorbidities, and period of diagnosis. Results We analysed 213,180 COVID-19 cases, including 15,974 (7.5%) non-Italian nationals. We found that, compared to Italian cases, non-Italian cases were diagnosed at a later date and were more likely to be hospitalised [(adjusted relative risk (ARR)=1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.33-1.44)] and admitted to ICU (ARR=1.19, 95% CI: 1.07-1.32), with differences being more pronounced in those coming from countries with lower HDI. We also observed an increased risk of death in non-Italian cases from low-HDI countries (ARR=1.32, 95% CI: 1.01-1.75). Conclusions A delayed diagnosis in non-Italian cases could explain their worse outcomes compared to Italian cases. Ensuring early access to diagnosis and treatment to non-Italians could facilitate the control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and improve health outcomes in all people living in Italy, regardless of nationality.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Massimo Fabiani","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Alberto Mateo-Urdiales","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita; European Programme for Intervention Epidemiology Training (EPIET), European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)"},{"author_name":"Xanthi Andrianou","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita; Cyprus University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Antonino Bella","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Martina Del Manso","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita; European Programme for Intervention Epidemiology Training (EPIET), European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)"},{"author_name":"Stefania Bellino","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Maria C Rota","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Stefano Boros","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Maria F Vescio","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Fortunato P D'Ancona","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Andrea Siddu","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Ornella Punzo","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Antonietta Filia","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Silvio Brusaferro","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Rezza","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Maria G Dente","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Silvia Declich","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Patrizio Pezzotti","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Flavia Riccardo","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.21.20198838","rel_title":"Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 circulation and diversity through community wastewater sequencing","rel_date":"2020-09-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.21.20198838","rel_abs":"The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has rapidly become a major global health problem for which public health surveillance is crucial to monitor virus spread. Given the presence of viral RNA in feces in around 40% of infected persons, wastewater-based epidemiology has been proposed as an addition to disease-based surveillance to assess the spread of the virus at the community level. Here we have explored the possibility of using next-generation sequencing (NGS) of sewage samples to evaluate the diversity of SARS-CoV-2 at the community level from routine wastewater testing, and compared these results with the virus diversity in patients from the Netherlands and Belgium. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of viruses belonging to the most prevalent clades (19A, 20A and 20B) in both countries. Clades 19B and 20C were not identified, while they were present in clinical samples during the same period. Low frequency variant (LFV) analysis showed that some known LFVs can be associated with particular clusters within a clade, different to those of their consensus sequences, suggesting the presence of at least 2 clades within a single sewage sample. Additionally, combining genome consensus and LFV analyses we found a total of 57 unique mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome which have not been described before. In conclusion, this work illustrates how NGS analysis of wastewater can be used to approximate the diversity of SARS-CoV-2 viruses circulating in a community.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ray W.

Design: Online cross-sectional survey from 21st March to 4th April 2020. Setting: UK. Participants: 30,375 adults aged [&ge;]18y. Measurements: Changes in drinking over the past week, sociodemographic characteristics, diagnosed or suspected COVID-19, adherence to COVID-19 protective behaviours, stress about COVID-19, finances or boredom, recent drop in household income, key worker status, and health conditions. Findings: Of 22,113 drinkers (65.7% of analytic sample), 48.1% (95% CI=47.0-49.1%) reported drinking about the same as usual, 25.7% (24.8-26.6%) reported drinking less than usual, and 26.2% (25.4-27.1%) reported drinking more than usual over the past week. Drinking less than usual was independently associated with being younger (OR=0.88 [95% CI=0.83-0.93]), male (OR=0.76 [0.68-0.84]), of an ethnic minority (OR=0.76 [0.61-0.97]), low annual household income (OR=0.74 [0.66-0.83]), having diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 (OR=2.04 [1.72-2.41]), adhering to COVID-19 protective behaviours (OR=1.58 [1.08-2.32]), being significantly stressed about becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 (OR=1.26 [1.08-1.48]) and not being a key worker (OR=0.87 [0.76-0.99]). Drinking more than usual was independently associated with being younger (OR=0.73 [0.69-0.78]), female (OR=1.36 [1.22-1.51]), post-16 qualifications (OR=1.21 [1.04-1.40]), high annual household income (OR=1.43 [1.27-1.61]), being significantly stressed about catching (OR=1.22 [1.03-1.45]) or becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 (OR=1.28 [1.10-1.48]), being significantly stressed about finances (OR=1.43 [1.24-1.66]), and having a diagnosed anxiety disorder (OR=1.24 [1.05-1.46]). Conclusions: In a representative sample of adults in the UK, about half of drinkers reported drinking the same amount of alcohol as usual during the start of the COVID-19 related lockdown, with a quarter drinking more and a quarter drinking less than usual. Drinking more than usual was associated with being younger, female, high socioeconomic position, having an anxiety disorder, and being stressed about finances or COVID-19. These groups may benefit targeted alcohol reduction support if there are further periods of lockdown.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Claire Garnett","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Sarah E Jackson","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Melissa Oldham","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Jamie Brown","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Andrew Steptoe","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Daisy Fancourt","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Matthijs Kon","author_inst":"Department of Viroscience, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."},{"author_name":"Lu Lu","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK."},{"author_name":"Frank M.

The transmitting aerosol particles are generated through the breathing and vocalization by infectious subjects. Some authors state that this represents the dominant route of spreading, while others dismiss the option. Public health organizations generally categorize it as a secondary transmission pathway. Here we present a simple, easy-to-use spreadsheet model to estimate the infection risk for different indoor environments, constrained by published data on human aerosol emissions, SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, infective dose and other parameters. We evaluate typical indoor settings such as an office, a classroom, a choir practice room and reception\/party environments. These are examples, and the reader is invited to use the algorithm for alternative situations and assumptions. Our results suggest that aerosols from highly infective subjects can effectively transmit COVID-19 in indoor environments. This \"highly infective\" category represents approximately twenty percent of the patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. We find that \"super infective\" subjects, representing the top five to ten percent of positive-tested ones, plus an unknown fraction of less, but still highly infective, high aerosol-emitting subjects, may cause COVID-19 clusters (>10 infections), e.g. in classrooms, during choir singing and at receptions. The highly infective ones also risk causing such events at parties, for example. In general, active room ventilation and the ubiquitous wearing of face masks (i.e. by all subjects) may reduce the individual infection risk by a factor of five to ten, similar to high-volume HEPA air filtering. The most effective mitigation measure studied is the use of high-quality masks, which can drastically reduce the indoor infection risk through aerosols.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jos Lelieveld","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Chemistry"},{"author_name":"Frank Helleis","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Chemistry"},{"author_name":"Stephan Borrmann","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Chemistry"},{"author_name":"Yafang Cheng","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Chemistry"},{"author_name":"Frank Drewnick","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Chemistry"},{"author_name":"Gerald Haug","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Chemistry"},{"author_name":"Thomas Klimach","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Chemistry"},{"author_name":"J.

The reasons for this protection are not well understood but differences in the immune response to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been implicated. If such differences are due to differential exposure to non-SARS-CoV-2 infectious agents, adults who are close contacts of children may partly share in this protection. Such a protective effect would have important implications for the lives of children, not least in terms of schooling. Methods Using a Scotland-wide record-linkage based occupational cohort comprising healthcare workers and members of their households, we examined whether sharing a household with young children (aged 0 to 11) attenuated the risk of hospitalisation with COVID-19, and\/or testing positive for COVID-19 infection of any severity (any case of Covid-19). All healthcare workers directly employed by the National health Service (NHS) in Scotland, or contracted to provide general practice services, were included. Outcome and covariate data were obtained via linkage to Scotland-wide microbiology, drug prescribing, hospitalisation and death data. Results 241,266 adults did not share a household with young children; 41,198, 23,783 and 3,850 shared a household with 1, 2 and 3 or more young children respectively. The risk of hospitalisation with COVID-19 was lower in those with one child and lower still in those with two or more children, adjusting for age the hazard ratio (HR) was 0.83 per child (95% CI 0.70-0.99). On additionally adjusting for sex, socioeconomic deprivation, occupation, professional role, staff\/non-staff status, the number of adults and adolescents in each household, and comorbidity, the HR was 0.89 per child (95% CI 0.74-1.06). An association of the same magnitude, but more precisely estimated, was obtained for any case of COVID-19 (fully adjusted model, HR per child 0.89; 95% CI 0.84-0.95). Conclusion Increased household exposure to young children was associated with an attenuated risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and appeared to also be associated with an attenuated risk of COVID-19 disease severe enough to require hospitalisation.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rachael Wood","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh, Public Heath Scotland"},{"author_name":"Emma C Thomson","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Robert Galbraith","author_inst":"Retired"},{"author_name":"Ciara Gribben","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"David Caldwell","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Bishop","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Martin Reid","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Anoop Shah","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kate Templeton","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"David Goldberg","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Chris Robertson","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Sharon Hutchinson","author_inst":"Public Health Scotland"},{"author_name":"Helen M Colhoun","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Paul M McKeigue","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"David McAllister","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Maria G Dente","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Silvia Declich","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Patrizio Pezzotti","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Flavia Riccardo","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.21.305698","rel_title":"AI-guided discovery of the invariant host response to viral pandemics","rel_date":"2020-09-22","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.21.305698","rel_abs":"We sought to define the host immune response, a.k.a, the \"cytokine storm\" that has been implicated in fatal COVID-19 using an AI-based approach. Over 45,000 transcriptomic datasets of viral pandemics were analyzed to extract a 166-gene signature using ACE2 as a  seed gene; ACE2 was rationalized because it encodes the receptor that facilitates the entry of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) into host cells. Surprisingly, this 166-gene signature was conserved in all viral pandemics, including COVID-19, and a subset of 20-genes classified disease severity, inspiring the nomenclatures ViP and severe-ViP signatures, respectively. The ViP signatures pinpointed a paradoxical phenomenon wherein lung epithelial and myeloid cells mount an IL15 cytokine storm, and epithelial and NK cell senescence and apoptosis determines severity\/fatality. Precise therapeutic goals were formulated and subsequently validated in high-dose SARS-CoV-2-challenged hamsters using neutralizing antibodies that abrogate SARS-CoV-2*ACE2 engagement. IL15\/IL15RA were elevated in the lungs of patients with fatal disease, and plasma levels of the cytokine tracked with disease severity.

Strikingly, short exposure of high titer surface dried virus (3*10^6 IU\/ml) with UV-C light (16 mJ\/cm2) resulted in a total reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity.

Therefore it is necessary to describe the pathological processes in those animals that show symptoms similar to those described in humans affected by COVID-19. The potential for companion animals contributing to the continued human-to-human disease, infectivity, and community spread is an urgent issue to be considered.\n\nForty animals with pulmonary pathologies were studied by chest X-ray, ultrasound study, and computed tomography. Nasopharyngeal and rectal swab were analyzed to detect canine pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. Twenty healthy dogs living in SARS-CoV-2 positive households were included. Immunoglobulin detection by different immunoassays was performed. Our findings show that sick dogs presented severe alveolar or interstitial pattern, with pulmonary opacity, parenchymal abnormalities, and bilateral lesions. Forty dogs were negative for SARS-CoV-2 but Mycoplasma spp. was detected in 26 of 33 dogs. Five healthy and one pathological dog presented IgG against SARS-CoV-2.\n\nHere we report that despite detecting dogs with IgG -SARS-CoV-2, we never obtained a positive RT-qPCR, not even in dogs with severe pulmonary disease; suggesting that even in the case of a canine infection transmission would be unlikely.

Here, we present the room-temperature neutron structure of 3CL Mpro from SARS-CoV-2, which allows direct determination of hydrogen atom positions and, hence, protonation states. The catalytic site natively adopts a zwitterionic reactive state where His41 is doubly protonated and positively charged, and Cys145 is in the negatively charged thiolate state. The neutron structure also identified the protonation states of other amino acid residues, mapping electrical charges and intricate hydrogen bonding networks in the SARS-CoV-2 3CL Mpro active site cavity and dimer interface. This structure highlights the ability of neutron protein crystallography for experimentally determining protonation states at near-physiological temperature - the critical information for structure-assisted and computational drug design.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel W.

All three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of these two spike trimers are in the \"down\" conformation, indicating they are more prone to adopt this receptor-binding inactive state. However, we found that the PCoV_GX, but not the RaTG13, spike is comparable to the SARS-CoV-2 spike in binding the human ACE2 receptor and supporting pseudovirus cell entry. Through structure and sequence comparisons, we identified critical residues in the RBD that underlie the different activities of the RaTG13 and PCoV_GX\/SARS-CoV-2 spikes and propose that N-linked glycans serve as conformational control elements of the RBD.

Here we identified 11 unique nanobodies (Nbs) with high binding affinities to the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor domain (RBD). Of these, 8 effectively block the RBD:ACE2 interface. Via competitive binding analysis and detailed epitope mapping, we grouped all Nbs into 3 sets and demonstrated their neutralizing effect. Combinations from different sets showed a profound synergistic effect by simultaneously targeting different epitopes within the RBD. Finally, we established a competitive multiplex binding assay (\"NeutrobodyPlex\") enabling the detection of neutralizing antibodies in serum of infected patients. Overall, our Nbs have high potential for prophylactic and therapeutic options and provide a novel approach to screen for a neutralizing immune response in infected or vaccinated individuals, helping to monitor immune status or guide vaccine design.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Teresa R Wagner","author_inst":"Eberhard Karls University Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Philipp D Kaiser","author_inst":"Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Marius Gramlich","author_inst":"Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Matthias Becker","author_inst":"Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Bjoern Traenkle","author_inst":"Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Daniel Junker","author_inst":"Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Julia Haering","author_inst":"Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Alex Dulovic","author_inst":"Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Helen Schweizer","author_inst":"Ludwig Maximilians University Munich"},{"author_name":"Stefan Nueske","author_inst":"Ludwig Maximilians University Munich"},{"author_name":"Armin Scholz","author_inst":"Ludwig Maximilians University Munich"},{"author_name":"Anne Zeck","author_inst":"Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Katja Schenke-Layland","author_inst":"Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Annika Nelde","author_inst":"Eberhard Karls University Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Monika Strengert","author_inst":"Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research"},{"author_name":"Juliane S Walz","author_inst":"Eberhard Karls University Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Natalia Ruetalo","author_inst":"Eberhard Karls University Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Michael Schindler","author_inst":"University Hospital Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Nicole Schneiderhan-Marra","author_inst":"NMI Natural and Medical Sciences Institute at the University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Ulrich Rothbauer","author_inst":"University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Soumita Das","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Pradipta Ghosh","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.22.307975","rel_title":"Mass cytometry and artificial intelligence define CD169 as a specific marker of SARS-CoV2-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome","rel_date":"2020-09-22","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.22.307975","rel_abs":"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the main complication of COVID-19, requiring admission to Intensive Care Unit (ICU).

Medical laboratory professionals are key in the fight against COVID-19 as they provide confirmatory diagnosis which is the main basis upon which cases are identified and clinical management instituted. Lack of knowledge, poor attitude and unsafe laboratory practices could have negative implications towards the control of COVID-19. We conducted a quick online questionnaire to investigate the knowledge, attitudes and practices of medical laboratory personnel regarding COVID-19 in Zambia. Methods: We conducted a cross sectional study among medical laboratory professionals in Zambia from 10th to 29th June, 2020. Data were collected using google forms and exported to SPSS version 23 for statistical analysis. Independent predictors of COVID-19 knowledge and practices were determined. Adjusted odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals are reported. Results: A total of 208 medical laboratory professionals participated in the study. There were more males (58.2%) than females. The majority of respondents had good knowledge (84.1%) and practice (75%) regarding COVID-19. Less than half (n=97, 46.6%) reported willingness to participate in a vaccination program. Predictors of good knowledge included; having a Bachelors degree (AOR: 5.0, CI: 1.15-23.9) and having prior COVID-19 related training (AOR: 8.83, CI: 2.03-38.4).

This cross-sectional study investigated mental distress among HCWs during the early phase of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Method: 140 HCWs of a tertiary care hospital in India were assessed for perceived stress and insomnia. A factor analysis with principal component method reduced these questions to four components which were categorized as insomnia, Stress-related Anxiety, Stress-related Irritability, and Stress-related Hopelessness. Further statistical analyses were done on these factor scores to identify the predictors and investigate the differences between the different categories of HCWs. Result: Doctors were the most anxious among the HCWs. Both doctors and nurses perceived a greater level of irritability than the other HCWs. Compared to the doctors and nurses, other HCWs were more likely to experience insomnia. Lower age, higher education, female gender, and urban habitat were associated with the perception of anxiety. Older age, quarantine, single marital-status predicted irritability. Female gender, single marital-status, and greater ailments contributed to perceived hopelessness. Quarantine significantly predicted insomnia. Conclusion: Different categories of HCWs might experience disparate mental health problems owing to their heterogeneous socio-demographic backgrounds. Customized and personalized care might prove to be helpful in alleviating their problems.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sheshadri Shekhar Chatterjee","author_inst":"Diamond Harbour Medical College and Hospital"},{"author_name":"Madhushree Chakrabarty","author_inst":"Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Shiv Shekhar Chatterjee","author_inst":"Diamond Harbour Medical College and Hospital"},{"author_name":"Utpal Dan","author_inst":"Diamond Harbour Medical College and Hospital"},{"author_name":"Pipina Vlahakis","author_inst":"Copperbelt University, Michael Chilufya Sata School of Medicine, Ndola, Zambia"},{"author_name":"Samson Mwale","author_inst":"Tropical Diseases Research Centre, Ndola, Zambia"},{"author_name":"Kapambwe Mwape","author_inst":"Copperbelt University, Michael Chilufya Sata School of Medicine, Ndola, Zambia"},{"author_name":"Memory C Kalolekesha","author_inst":"COpperbelt University, Michael Chilufya Sata School of Medicine, Ndola, Zambia"},{"author_name":"Misheck Chileshe","author_inst":"Mary Begg Health Services, Ndola, Zambia"},{"author_name":"Joseph Mutale","author_inst":"Kabompo District Hospital, Kabompo, Zambia"},{"author_name":"Tobela Mudenda","author_inst":"Ndola Teaching Hospital, Ndola, Zambia"},{"author_name":"Grace Manda","author_inst":"Kalomo District Hospital, Kalomo, Zambia"},{"author_name":"Victor Daka","author_inst":"Copperbelt University, Michael Chilufya Sata School of Medicine, Ndola, Zambia"},{"author_name":"Simon Leonard","author_inst":"Univ Rennes 1"},{"author_name":"Jean Feuillard","author_inst":"CHU Limoges"},{"author_name":"Vijay Tiwari","author_inst":"Scailyte"},{"author_name":"Jean Marc Tadie","author_inst":"CHU Rennes"},{"author_name":"Michel Cogne","author_inst":"Univ Rennes1"},{"author_name":"Karin Tarte","author_inst":"Univ Rennes 1"},{"author_name":"Ulrich Rothbauer","author_inst":"University of Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Soumita Das","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Pradipta Ghosh","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.22.307637","rel_title":"Why the COVID-19 pandemic is a traumatic stressor","rel_date":"2020-09-22","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.22.307637","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic does not fit into prevailing Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) models, or diagnostic criteria, yet emerging research shows traumatic stress symptoms as a result of this ongoing global stressor.

Case confirmation is based on identification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in clinical samples. However, these tests have suboptimal sensitivity, especially during the early and late course of infection. Using open data, we estimated that among 1 343 730 people tested in Mexico since February 27th, there were 838 377 (95% CL 734 605 - 1 057 164) cases, compared with 604 376 considering only positive tests. ICU admissions and deaths were around 16% and 9% higher than reported. Thus, we show that accounting for the sensitivity of SARS-Cov-2 RT-PCR diagnostic tests is a simple way to improve estimations for the true number of COVID-19 cases in tested people, particularly in high-prevalence populations.

Given N{t*}, the daily number of new CoVID-19 cases is {rho}{t*} = dN{t*}\/d{t*}. Implementing society-wide Social Distancing increases the tdbl doubling time, and a linear function of time for tdbl was used in our Initial Model: No[t] = 1 exp[+KA t \/ (1 + {gamma}o t) ] = eGo exp(-Zo[t] ) , to describe these changes, where the [t]-axis is time-shifted from the t*-axis, back to the pandemic start, and Go = [ KA \/ {gamma}o ]. While this No[t] successfully modeled the USA CoVID-19 progress from 3\/2020 to 6\/2020, this equation could not easily model some quickly decreasing {rho}[t] cases (\"fast pandemic shutoff\"), indicating that a second process was involved. This situation was most evident in the initial CoVID-19 data from China, South Korea, and Italy. Modifying Zo[t] to allow exponential cutoffs: Zo[t] {equiv} +[Go \/ (1+{gamma}o t)] [exp(-{delta}ot)] = Zo[t] exp(-{delta}ot) , NA[t] = eGo exp(-ZA[t]) , resulted in an Enhanced Initial Model (EIM) that significantly improved data fits for these cases. After 6\/2020, many regions of the USA \"opened up\", loosening their Social Distancing requirements, which led to a sudden USA CoVID-19 Resurgence. Extrapolating the USA No[t] 3\/2020-6\/2020 results to 9\/2020 as an Initial Model Baseline (IMB), and subtracting this IMB from the newer USA data gives a Resurgence Only function, which is analyzed here. This USA CoVID-19 Resurgence function differs significantly from the No[t] IMB functional form, but it was well-modeled by the NA[t] fast pandemic shutoff function. These results indicate that: (a) the gradual increase in tdbl doubling time from society-wide shut-downs is likely due to eliminating of a large number of population gathering points that could have enabled CoVID-19 spread; and (b) having a non-zero {delta}o fast pandemic shutoff is likely due to more people wearing masks more often [with 12 Figures].","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Genghmun Eng","author_inst":"Retired Scientist"},{"author_name":"Pablo F.

Here we show that four major factors likely accounted for the entire dynamics of COVID-19 in Brazil. Mathematical modeling revealed that, initially, the \"super-spreading\" city of Sao Paulo accounted for roughly 80% of the case spread in the entire country. During the first 3 months of the epidemic, by adding only 16 other spreading cities, we accounted for 98-99% of the cases reported in Brazil at the time. Moreover, 26 of the major Brazilian federal highways accounted for about 30% of SARS-CoV-2's case spread. As cases accumulated rapidly in the Brazilian countryside, the distribution of COVID-19 deaths began to correlate with a third parameter: the geographic distribution of the country's hospital intensive care unit (ICU) beds, which is highly skewed towards state capitals where the epidemic began. That meant that severely ill patients living in the countryside had to be transported to state capitals to access ICU beds where they often died, creating a \"boomerang effect\" that contributed to the skew of the geographic distribution of COVID-19 deaths. Finally, we discovered that the geographic distribution of dengue fever, amounting to more than 3.5 million cases from January 2019 to July 2020, was highly complementary to that of COVID-19. This was confirmed by the identification of significant negative correlations between COVID-19's incidence, infection growth rate, and mortality to the percentage of people with antibody (IgM) levels for dengue fever in each of the country's states. No such correlations were observed when IgM data for chikungunya virus, which is transmitted by the same mosquito vector as dengue, was used. Thus, states in which a large fraction of the population had contracted dengue fever in 2019-2020 reported lower COVID-19 cases and deaths, and took longer to reach exponential community transmission, due to slower SARS-CoV-2 infection growth rates. This inverse correlation between COVID-19 and dengue fever was further observed in a sample of countries around Asia and Latin America, as well as in islands in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. This striking finding raises the intriguing possibility of an immunological cross-reactivity between DENV serotypes and SARS-CoV-2. If proven correct, this hypothesis could mean that dengue infection or immunization with an efficacious and safe dengue vaccine could produce some level of immunological protection for SARS-CoV-2, before a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 becomes available.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Miguel A.

This fundamental epidemiological parameter is still unknown for the recently-emerged COVID-19, and mathematical models have predicted very divergent results. Population studies using antibody testing to infer total cumulative infections can provide empirical evidence of the level of population immunity in severely affected areas. Here we show that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Manaus, located in the Brazilian Amazon, increased quickly during March and April and declined more slowly from May to September. In June, one month following the epidemic peak, 44% of the population was seropositive for SARS-CoV-2, equating to a cumulative incidence of 52%, after correcting for the false-negative rate of the antibody test. The seroprevalence fell in July and August due to antibody waning. After correcting for this, we estimate a final epidemic size of 66%. Although non-pharmaceutical interventions, plus a change in population behavior, may have helped to limit SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Manaus, the unusually high infection rate suggests that herd immunity played a significant role in determining the size of the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":34,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lewis F Buss","author_inst":"Departamento de Molestias Infecciosas e Parasitarias & Instituto de Medicina Tropical da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Carlos Augusto Prete Jr.","author_inst":"Departamento de Engenharia de Sistemas Eletronicos, Escola Politecnica da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Claudia MM Abrahim","author_inst":"Fundacao Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas, Manaus, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Mendrone Jr.","author_inst":"Fundacao Pro-Sangue -

We investigated whether hydroxychloroquine could prevent SARS CoV-2 in healthcare workers at high-risk of exposure. Methods: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of healthcare workers with ongoing exposure to persons with Covid-19, including those working in emergency departments, intensive care units, Covid-19 hospital wards, and first responders. Participants across the United States and in the Canadian province of Manitoba were randomized to hydroxychloroquine 400mg once weekly or twice weekly for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was confirmed or probable Covid-19-compatible illness. We measured hydroxychloroquine whole blood concentrations. Results: We enrolled 1483 healthcare workers, of which 79% reported performing aerosol-generating procedures. The incidence of Covid-19 (laboratory-confirmed or symptomatic compatible illness) was 0.27 events per person-year with once-weekly and 0.28 events per person-year with twice-weekly hydroxychloroquine compared with 0.38 events per person-year with placebo. For once weekly hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis, the hazard ratio was 0.72 (95%CI 0.44 to 1.16; P=0.18) and for twice weekly was 0.74 (95%CI 0.46 to 1.19; P=0.22) as compared with placebo. Median hydroxychloroquine concentrations in whole blood were 98 ng\/mL (IQR, 82-120) with once-weekly and 200 ng\/mL (IQR, 159-258) with twice-weekly dosing. Hydroxychloroquine concentrations did not differ between participants who developed Covid-19 (154 ng\/mL) versus participants without Covid-19 (133 ng\/mL; P=0.08). Conclusions: Pre-exposure prophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine once or twice weekly did not significantly reduce laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 or Covid-19-compatible illness among healthcare workers.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Radha Rajasingham","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Ananta S Bangdiwala","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Melanie R Nicol","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Caleb P Skipper","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Katelyn A Pastick","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Margaret L Axelrod","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Matthew F Pullen","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Alanna A Nascene","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Darlisha A Williams","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Nicole W Engen","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth C Okafor","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Brian I Rini","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ingrid A Mayer","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Emily G McDonald","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Todd C Lee","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Peter Li","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Lauren J MacKenzie","author_inst":"University of Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Justin M Balko","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Stephen J Dunlop","author_inst":"Hennepin Healthcare"},{"author_name":"Katherine H Hullsiek","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"David R Boulware","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"SARAH M LOFGREN","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA"},{"author_name":"Martirene A da Silva","author_inst":"Fundacao Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas, Manaus, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Brian Custer","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Manoel Barral-Netto","author_inst":"Instituto Goncalo Moniz - Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz), Salvador, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Moritz Kraemer","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Rafael HM Pererira","author_inst":"Institute for Applied Economic Research, Ipea, Brasilia, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Oliver G Pybus","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Michael P Busch","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"M\u00e1rcia C Castro","author_inst":"Department of Global Health and Population, Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Christopher Dye","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Vitor H Nascimento","author_inst":"Departamento de Engenharia de Sistemas Eletronicos, Escola Politecnica da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Nuno R Faria","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Ester C Sabino","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.17.20196436","rel_title":"Comparison of COVID-19 outcomes among shielded and non-shielded populations: A general population cohort study of 1.3 million","rel_date":"2020-09-21","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.17.20196436","rel_abs":"Background Shielding (extended self-isolation) of people judged, a priori, to be at high-risk from COVID-19 has been used by some countries to protect the individuals and reduce demand on health services.

Poisson regression models and population attributable fractions were used to compare COVID-19 outcomes by overall risk category, and individual risk criteria: confirmed infection, hospitalisation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, population mortality and case-fatality. Results Of the 1.3 million population, 32,533 (2.47%) had been advised to shield, a further 347,374 (26.41%) were classified as moderate risk. Testing for COVID-19 was more common in the shielded (6.75%) and moderate (1.99%) than low (0.72%) risk categories. Referent to low-risk, the shielded group had higher risk of confirmed infection (RR 7.91, 95% 7.01-8.92), case-fatality (RR 5.19, 95% CI 4.12-6.53) and population mortality (RR 48.64, 95% 37.23-63.56). The moderate risk had intermediate risk of confirmed infection (RR 4.11, 95% CI 3.82-4.42) and population mortality (RR 26.10, 95% CI 20.89-32.60), but had comparable case-fatality (RR 5.13, 95% CI 4.24-6.21) to the shielded, and accounted for a higher proportion of deaths (PAF 75.27% vs 13.38%). Age [&ge;]70 years made the largest contribution to deaths (49.53%) and was associated with an 8-fold risk of infection, 7-fold case-fatality and 74-fold mortality. Conclusions Shielding has not been effective at preventing deaths in those with highest risk. To be effective as a population strategy, shielding criteria would need to be widely expanded to include other criteria, such as the elderly.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bhautesh D Jani","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Frederick K Ho","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"David J Lowe","author_inst":"NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde"},{"author_name":"Sean MacBride-Stewart","author_inst":"NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde"},{"author_name":"Frances S Mair","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Jill P Pell","author_inst":"University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Matthew F Pullen","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Alanna A Nascene","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Darlisha A Williams","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Nicole W Engen","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth C Okafor","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Brian I Rini","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ingrid A Mayer","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Emily G McDonald","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Todd C Lee","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Peter Li","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Lauren J MacKenzie","author_inst":"University of Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Justin M Balko","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Stephen J Dunlop","author_inst":"Hennepin Healthcare"},{"author_name":"Katherine H Hullsiek","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"David R Boulware","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"SARAH M LOFGREN","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA"},{"author_name":"Martirene A da Silva","author_inst":"Fundacao Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas, Manaus, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Brian Custer","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Manoel Barral-Netto","author_inst":"Instituto Goncalo Moniz - Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz), Salvador, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Moritz Kraemer","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Rafael HM Pererira","author_inst":"Institute for Applied Economic Research, Ipea, Brasilia, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Oliver G Pybus","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Michael P Busch","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"M\u00e1rcia C Castro","author_inst":"Department of Global Health and Population, Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Christopher Dye","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Vitor H Nascimento","author_inst":"Departamento de Engenharia de Sistemas Eletronicos, Escola Politecnica da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Nuno R Faria","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Ester C Sabino","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.17.20196444","rel_title":"COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF COVID-19 MORTALITY IN BRAZIL, RIO DE JANEIRO, CAMPOS DOS GOYTACAZES, MACAE, CABO FRIO AND RIO DAS OSTRAS","rel_date":"2020-09-21","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.17.20196444","rel_abs":"Objective: To analyze quantitatively and comparatively the deaths by COVID-19 of the four largest municipalities in the North of Rio de Janeiro and Baixada Litoranea of Rio de Janeiro, within the national context. Methods: We used data from the Civil Registry and demographic information to elaborate a general picture of the pandemic up to the 31st epidemiological week in several aspects: evolution, scope, age, sex, race and impact on other causes of death. Results: We characterized the evolution of the pandemic. We found an exponential dependence on the mortality rate by age and a higher lethality in the male population. We determined that COVID-19 represents an important fraction of the causes of death in 2020, being associated with a significant excess of deaths in relation to 2019 and also with the change in mortality patterns due to other causes. Conclusion: Mortality is an effective and powerful indicator for understanding the infection and its pandemic, and it must be taken into account during the construction of public policies to deal with it.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Antonio C.

In addition to showing more disease in males, the elderly, and individuals with underlying co-morbidities, SARS-CoV-2 can seemingly render healthy individuals with profound clinical complications. We hypothesize that, in addition to viral load and host antibody repertoire, host genetic variants also impact vulnerability to infection. Here we apply human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based models and CRISPR-engineering to explore the host genetics of SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrate that a single nucleotide polymorphism (rs4702), common in the population at large, and located in the 3UTR of the protease FURIN, impacts alveolar and neuron infection by SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Thus, we provide a proof-of-principle finding that common genetic variation can impact viral infection, and thus contribute to clinical heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2. Ongoing genetic studies will help to better identify high-risk individuals, predict clinical complications, and facilitate the discovery of drugs that might treat disease.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kristina Dobrindt","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Daisy A Hoagland","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Carina Seah","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Bibi Kassim","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Marina Iskhakova","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Michael Fernando","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"PJ Michael Deans","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Samuel K Powell","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Behnam Javidfar","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Aleta Murphy","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Cyril Peter","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Rasmus Moeller","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Meilin Fernandez Garcia","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"John Crary","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Darrell Kotton","author_inst":"Boston University"},{"author_name":"Laura Huckins","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benjamin tenOever","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Schahram Akbarian","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kristen J Brennand","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Katherine H Hullsiek","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"David R Boulware","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"SARAH M LOFGREN","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA"},{"author_name":"Martirene A da Silva","author_inst":"Fundacao Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas, Manaus, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Brian Custer","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Manoel Barral-Netto","author_inst":"Instituto Goncalo Moniz - Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz), Salvador, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Moritz Kraemer","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Rafael HM Pererira","author_inst":"Institute for Applied Economic Research, Ipea, Brasilia, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Oliver G Pybus","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Michael P Busch","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"M\u00e1rcia C Castro","author_inst":"Department of Global Health and Population, Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Christopher Dye","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Vitor H Nascimento","author_inst":"Departamento de Engenharia de Sistemas Eletronicos, Escola Politecnica da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Nuno R Faria","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Ester C Sabino","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"cell biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.21.300913","rel_title":"Rapid detection of inter-clade recombination in SARS-CoV-2 with Bolotie","rel_date":"2020-09-21","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.21.300913","rel_abs":"The ability to detect recombination in pathogen genomes is crucial to the accuracy of phylogenetic analysis and consequently to forecasting the spread of infectious diseases and to developing therapeutics and public health policies.

Furthermore, the low divergence of near-identical genomes sequenced in short periods of time presents a statistical challenge not addressed by available methods. In this work we present Bolotie, an efficient method designed to detect recombination and reassortment events between clades of viral genomes. We applied our method to a large collection of SARS-CoV-2 genomes and discovered hundreds of isolates that are likely of a recombinant origin. In cases where raw sequencing data was available, we were able to rule out the possibility that these samples represented co-infections by analyzing the underlying sequence reads. Our findings further show that several recombinants appear to have persisted in the population.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ales Varabyou","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Christopher Pockrandt","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Steven Lloyd Salzberg","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Mihaela Pertea","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Marina Iskhakova","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Michael Fernando","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"PJ Michael Deans","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Samuel K Powell","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Behnam Javidfar","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Aleta Murphy","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Cyril Peter","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Rasmus Moeller","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Meilin Fernandez Garcia","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"John Crary","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Darrell Kotton","author_inst":"Boston University"},{"author_name":"Laura Huckins","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benjamin tenOever","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Schahram Akbarian","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kristen J Brennand","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Katherine H Hullsiek","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"David R Boulware","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"SARAH M LOFGREN","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA"},{"author_name":"Martirene A da Silva","author_inst":"Fundacao Hospitalar de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas, Manaus, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Brian Custer","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Manoel Barral-Netto","author_inst":"Instituto Goncalo Moniz - Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz), Salvador, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Moritz Kraemer","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Rafael HM Pererira","author_inst":"Institute for Applied Economic Research, Ipea, Brasilia, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Oliver G Pybus","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Michael P Busch","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"M\u00e1rcia C Castro","author_inst":"Department of Global Health and Population, Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Christopher Dye","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Vitor H Nascimento","author_inst":"Departamento de Engenharia de Sistemas Eletronicos, Escola Politecnica da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Nuno R Faria","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Ester C Sabino","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Tropical da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.21.306837","rel_title":"Baseline T cell immune phenotypes predict virologic and disease control upon SARS-CoV infection","rel_date":"2020-09-21","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.21.306837","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed that infection with SARS-CoV-2 can result in a wide range of clinical outcomes in humans, from asymptomatic or mild disease to severe disease that can require mechanical ventilation. An incomplete understanding of immune correlates of protection represents a major barrier to the design of vaccines and therapeutic approaches to prevent infection or limit disease. This deficit is largely due to the lack of prospectively collected, pre-infection samples from indiviuals that go on to become infected with SARS-CoV-2. Here, we utilized data from a screen of genetically diverse mice from the Collaborative Cross (CC) infected with SARS-CoV to determine whether circulating baseline T cell signatures are associated with a lack of viral control and severe disease upon infection. SARS-CoV infection of CC mice results in a variety of viral load trajectories and disease outcomes. Further, early control of virus in the lung correlates with an increased abundance of activated CD4 and CD8 T cells and regulatory T cells prior to infections across strains. A basal propensity of T cells to express IFNg and IL17 over TNFa also correlated with early viral control. Overall, a dysregulated, pro-inflammatory signature of circulating T cells at baseline was associated with severe disease upon infection. While future studies of human samples prior to infection with SARS-CoV-2 are required, our studies in mice with SARS-CoV serve as proof of concept that circulating T cell signatures at baseline can predict clinical and virologic outcomes upon SARS-CoV infection. Identification of basal immune predictors in humans could allow for identification of individuals at highest risk of severe clinical and virologic outcomes upon infection, who may thus most benefit from available clinical interventions to restrict infection and disease.\n\nSummaryWe used a screen of genetically diverse mice from the Collaborative Cross infected with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV in combination with comprehensive pre-infection immunophenotyping to identify baseline circulating immune correlates of severe virologic and clinical outcomes upon SARS-CoV infection.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jessica Graham","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Jessica Swarts","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Sarah R Leist","author_inst":"University of North Carolina"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Schafer","author_inst":"University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Vineet D Menachery","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Lisa Gralinski","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Sophia Jeng","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Darla R Miller","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Michael Mooney","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Shannon McWeeney","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Martin T.

Therapeutic approaches to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection are mostly focused on blocking S-ACE2 binding, but critical residues that stabilize this interaction are not well understood. By performing all-atom Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, we identified an extended network of salt bridges, hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, and hydrogen bonding between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein and ACE2. Mutagenesis of these residues on the RBD was not sufficient to destabilize binding but reduced the average work to unbind the S protein from ACE2. In particular, the hydrophobic end of RBD serves as the main anchor site and unbinds last from ACE2 under force. We propose that blocking this site via neutralizing antibody or nanobody could prove an effective strategy to inhibit S-ACE2 interactions.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elhan Taka","author_inst":"Istanbul Technical University"},{"author_name":"Sema Zeynep Yilmaz","author_inst":"Istanbul Technical University"},{"author_name":"Mert Golcuk","author_inst":"Istanbul Technical University"},{"author_name":"Ceren Kilinc","author_inst":"Istanbul Technical University"},{"author_name":"Umut Aktas","author_inst":"Istanbul Technical University"},{"author_name":"Ahmet Yildiz","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Mert Gur","author_inst":"Istanbul Technical University"},{"author_name":"Darla R Miller","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Michael Mooney","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Shannon McWeeney","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Martin T.
