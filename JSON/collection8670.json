Since identification, infections (coronavirus disease-2019; COVID-19) caused by this novel pathogen have spread globally, with more than 250,000 confirmed cases as of March 21, 2020. An open-label clinical trial has just concluded, suggesting improved resolution of viremia with use of two existing therapies: hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as monotherapy, and in combination with azithromycin (HCQ-AZ). The results of this important trial have major implications for global policy in the rapid scale-up and response to this pandemic. The authors present results with p-values for differences in proportions between the study arms, but their analysis is not able to provide effect size estimates. To address this gap, more modern analytical methods including survival models, have been applied to these data, and show modest to no impact of HCQ treatment, with more significant effects from the HCQ-AZ combination, potentially suggesting a role for co-infections in COVID-19 pathogenesis. The trial of Gautret and colleagues, with consideration of the effect sizes, and p-values from multiple models, does not provide sufficient evidence to support wide-scale rollout of HCQ monotherapy for the treatment of COVID-19; larger randomized studies should be considered.

Thus, preventing viral transmission by case isolation, quarantine, and social distancing is essential to slowing its spread. Here we model social networks using weighted graphs, where vertices represent individuals and edges represent contact. As public health measures are implemented, connectivity in the graph decreases, resulting in lower effective reproductive numbers, and reduced viral transmission. For COVID-19, model parameters were derived from the coronavirus epidemic in China, validated by epidemic data in Italy, then applied to the United States. We calculate that, in the U.S., the public is able to contain viral transmission by limiting the average number of contacts per person to less than 7 unique individuals over each 5 day period. This increases the average social distance between individuals to 10 degrees of separation.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pei Jun Zhao","author_inst":"Harvard University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.23.20042002","rel_title":"Is a COVID19 Quarantine Justified in Chile or USA Right Now?","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.23.20042002","rel_abs":"During the current COVID-19 pandemic it is imperative to give early warnings to reduce mortality.

We employ a set of difference-in-differences (DID) estimations to disentangle the lockdown effect on human mobility reductions from other confounding effects including panic effect, virus effect, and the Spring Festival effect. We find that the lockdown of Wuhan reduced inflow into Wuhan by 76.64%, outflows from Wuhan by 56.35%, and within-Wuhan movements by 54.15%. We also estimate the dynamic effects of up to 22 lagged population inflows from Wuhan and other Hubei cities, the epicenter of the 2019-nCoV outbreak, on the destination cities' new infection cases. We find, using simulations with these estimates, that the lockdown of the city of Wuhan on January 23, 2020 contributed significantly to reducing the total infection cases outside of Wuhan, even with the social distancing measures later imposed by other cities. We find that the COVID-19 cases would be 64.81% higher in the 347 Chinese cities outside Hubei province, and 52.64% higher in the 16 non-Wuhan cities inside Hubei, in the counterfactual world in which the city of Wuhan were not locked down from January 23, 2020. We also find that there were substantial undocumented infection cases in the early days of the 2019-nCoV outbreak in Wuhan and other cities of Hubei province, but over time, the gap between the officially reported cases and our estimated \"actual\" cases narrows significantly.

Fast diagnosis of COVID-19, and finding high-risk patients with worse prognosis for early prevention and medical resources optimization is important. Here, we proposed a fully automatic deep learning system for COVID-19 diagnostic and prognostic analysis by routinely used computed tomography. We retrospectively collected 5372 patients with computed tomography images from 7 cities or provinces. Firstly, 4106 patients with computed tomography images and gene information were used to pre-train the DL system, making it learn lung features. Afterwards, 1266 patients (924 with COVID-19, and 471 had follow-up for 5+ days; 342 with other pneumonia) from 6 cities or provinces were enrolled to train and externally validate the performance of the deep learning system. In the 4 external validation sets, the deep learning system achieved good performance in identifying COVID-19 from other pneumonia (AUC=0.87 and 0.88) and viral pneumonia (AUC=0.86). Moreover, the deep learning system succeeded to stratify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups whose hospital-stay time have significant difference (p=0.013 and 0.014). Without human-assistance, the deep learning system automatically focused on abnormal areas that showed consistent characteristics with reported radiological findings. Deep learning provides a convenient tool for fast screening COVID-19 and finding potential high-risk patients, which may be helpful for medical resource optimization and early prevention before patients show severe symptoms.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shuo Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Big Data-Based Precision Medicine, School of Medicine and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, 100191, China."},{"author_name":"Yunfei Zha","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Hubei, 430060, China."},{"author_name":"Weimin Li","author_inst":"Department of respiratory and critical care medicine, West China hospital of Sichuan University, Sichuan, 610041, China."},{"author_name":"Qingxia Wu","author_inst":"College of Medicine and Biomedical Information Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning 110819, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaohu Li","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Anhui 230022, China."},{"author_name":"Meng Niu","author_inst":"Department of Interventional Radiology, the First Hospital of China Medical University, Liaoning 110001, China."},{"author_name":"Meiyun Wang","author_inst":"Department of Medical Imaging, Henan Provincial Peoples Hospital and the Peoples Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450003, Henan, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaoming Qiu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Huangshi Central Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Hubei Polytechnic University, Edong Healthcare Group, Hubei, 435000, China."},{"author_name":"Hongjun Li","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100069, China."},{"author_name":"He Yu","author_inst":"Department of respiratory and critical care medicine, West China hospital of Sichuan University, Sichuan, 610041, China."},{"author_name":"Wei Gong","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Hubei, 430060, China."},{"author_name":"Yan Bai","author_inst":"Department of Medical Imaging, Henan Provincial Peoples Hospital and the Peoples Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450003, Henan, China."},{"author_name":"Li Li","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100069, China."},{"author_name":"Yongbei Zhu","author_inst":"Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Big Data-Based Precision Medicine, School of Medicine and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, 100191, China."},{"author_name":"Liusu Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Big Data-Based Precision Medicine, School of Medicine and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, 100191, China."},{"author_name":"Jie Tian","author_inst":"Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Big Data-Based Precision Medicine, School of Medicine and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, 100191, China."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.25.20037721","rel_title":"Risk Factors Associated with Clinical Outcomes in 323 COVID-19 Patients in Wuhan, China","rel_date":"2020-03-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.25.20037721","rel_abs":"Background With evidence of sustained transmission in more than 190 countries, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a global pandemic. As such, data are urgently needed about risk factors associated with clinical outcomes. Methods A retrospective chart review of 323 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan was conducted. Patients were classified into three disease severity groups (non-severe, severe, and critical), based on their initial clinical presentation. Clinical outcomes were designated as favorable and unfavorable, based on disease progression and response to treatments. Logistic regression models were performed to identify factors associated with clinical outcomes, and logrank test was conducted for the association with clinical progression. Results Current standard treatments did not show significant improvement on patient outcomes in the study. By univariate logistic regression model, 27 risk factors were significantly associated with clinical outcomes. Further, multivariate regression indicated that age over 65 years, smoking, critical disease status, diabetes, high hypersensitive troponin I (>0.04 pg\/mL), leukocytosis (>10 x 109\/L) and neutrophilia (>75 x 109\/L) predicted unfavorable clinical outcomes. By contrast, the use of hypnotics was significantly associated with favorable outcomes. Survival analysis also confirmed that patients receiving hypnotics had significantly better survival. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first indication that hypnotics could be an effective ancillary treatment for COVID-19. We also found that novel risk factors, such as higher hypersensitive troponin I, predicted poor clinical outcomes. Overall, our study provides useful data to guide early clinical decision making to reduce mortality and improve clinical outcomes of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ling Hu","author_inst":"Tianyou Hospital, Affiliated to Wuhan University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Shaoqiu Chen","author_inst":"John A.

These hotlines have struggled with the volume of callers, leading to wait times of hours or, even, an inability to contact health authorities. Symptoma is a symptom-to-disease digital health assistant that can differentiate more than 20,000 diseases with an accuracy of more than 90%. We tested the accuracy of Symptoma to identify COVID-19 using a set of diverse clinical cases combined with case reports of COVID-19. We showed that Symptoma can accurately distinguish COVID-19 in 96.32% of clinical cases. When considering only COVID-19 symptoms and risk factors, Symptoma identified 100% of those infected when presented with only three signs. Lastly, we showed that Symptomas accuracy far exceeds that of simple \"yes-no\" questionnaires widely available online. In summary, Symptoma provides unparalleled accuracy in systematically identifying cases of COVID-19 while also considering over 20,000 other diseases. Furthermore, Symptoma allows free text input, furthered with disease-specific follow up questions, in 36 languages.

Our approach was to design a tool with parameters that hospital leaders could adjust to reflect their local data and easily modify to conduct sensitivity analyses. We developed a model to facilitate hospital planning with estimates of the number of Intensive Care (IC) beds, Acute Care (AC) beds, and ventilators necessary to accommodate patients who require hospitalization for COVID-19 and how these compare to the available resources. Inputs to the model include estimates of the characteristics of the patient population and hospital capacity. We deployed this model as an interactive online tool.6 The model is implemented in R 3.5, RStudio, RShiny 1.4.0 and Python 3.7. The parameters used may be modified as data become available, for use at other institutions, and to generate sensitivity analyses. We illustrate the use of the model by estimating the demand generated by COVID-19+ arrivals for a hypothetical acute care medical center. The model calculated that the number of patients requiring an IC bed would equal the number of IC beds on Day 23, the number of patients requiring a ventilator would equal the number of ventilators available on Day 27, and the number of patients requiring an AC bed and coverage by the Medicine Service would equal the capacity of the Medicine service on Day 21. In response to the COVID-19 epidemic, hospitals must understand their current and future capacity to care for patients with severe illness. While there is significant uncertainty around the parameters used to develop this model, the analysis is based on transparent logic and starts from observed data to provide a robust basis of projections for hospital managers. The model demonstrates the need and provides an approach to address critical questions about staffing patterns for IC and AC, and equipment capacity such as ventilators.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Teng Zhang","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Engineering"},{"author_name":"Kelly McFarlane","author_inst":"Stanford University Graduate School of Business, Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline Vallon","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Engineering"},{"author_name":"Linying Yang","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Engineering"},{"author_name":"Jin Xie","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Engineering"},{"author_name":"Jose Blanchet","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Engineering"},{"author_name":"Peter Glynn","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Engineering"},{"author_name":"Kristan Staudenmayer","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kevin Schulman","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David Scheinker","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Engineering, Stanford University School of Medicine, Lucile Packard Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wen-xiong Yu","author_inst":"Tianyou Hospital Affiliated to Wuhan University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jia Liu","author_inst":"Tianyou Hospital Affiliated to Wuhan University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Chen Shao","author_inst":"Tianyou Hospital Affiliated to Wuhan University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jun-jie Hao","author_inst":"Tianyou Hospital Affiliated to Wuhan University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Chuan-zhen Wang","author_inst":"Tianyou Hospital Affiliated to Wuhan University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yao Ma","author_inst":"Tianyou Hospital Affiliated to Wuhan University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhanwei Wang","author_inst":"University of Hawaii Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Richard Yanagihara","author_inst":"John A.

As the pandemic progressed, a continued paucity of evidence on routes of SARS-CoV-2 transmission has resulted in shifting infection prevention and control guidelines between clasically-defined airborne and droplet precautions. During the initial isolation of 13 individuals with COVID-19 at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, we collected air and surface samples to examine viral shedding from isolated individuals. We detected viral contamination among all samples, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 may spread through both direct (droplet and person-to-person) as well as indirect mechanisms (contaminated objects and airborne transmission). Taken together, these finding support the use of airborne isolation precautions when caring for COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joshua L Santarpia","author_inst":"University of Nebraska Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Danielle N Rivera","author_inst":"National Strategic Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Vicki Herrera","author_inst":"University of Nebraska Medical Center"},{"author_name":"M.

Serum albumin, high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C), and C-reactive protein have been known to be associated with the severity and mortality of community-acquired pneumonia. However, the characteristics and role of metabolic and inflammatory indicators in COVID-19 is unclear. Methods: We included 97 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory indices; radiological features; and treatment were analysed. The differences in the clinical and laboratory parameters between mild and severe COVID-19 patients and the role of these indicators in severity prediction of COVID-19 were investigated. Results: All were Wuhan residents with contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases. The median age was 39 years (IQR: 30-59). The most common presenting symptoms were fever (58.8%), cough (55.7%), and fatigue (33%). Other features were lymphopenia, impaired fasting glucose, hypoproteinaemia, hypoalbuminemia, low high-density lipoproteinemia. Decrease in lymphocyte count, serum total protein, serum albumin, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), ApoA1, CD3+T%, and CD8+T% were found to be valuable in predicting the transition of COVID-19 from mild to severe illness. Chest computed tomography (CT) images showed that the absorption of bilateral lung lesions synchronized with the recovery of metabolic and inflammatory indicators. Conclusions: Hypoproteinaemia, hypoalbuminemia, low high-density lipoproteinemia, and decreased ApoA1, CD3+T%, and CD8+T% could predict severity of COVID-19. Lymphocyte count, total serum protein, and HDL-C may be potentially useful for the evaluation of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shuke Nie","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xueqing Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Kang Zhao","author_inst":"The third people's Hospital of Hubei province"},{"author_name":"Zhaohui Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhentao Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhan Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Disease and Intensive Care, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Kevin K Crown","author_inst":"National Strategic Research Institute"},{"author_name":"David Brett-Major","author_inst":"University of Nebraska Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Schnaubelt","author_inst":"University of Nebraska Medical Center"},{"author_name":"M.

The ability to recognize and potentially intervene early in those patients at greatest risk of developing this complication could be of great clinical utility. Methods: We performed detailed flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood samples from 28 COVID-19 patients treated at Xian No.8 Hospital and the First Affiliated Hospital of Xian Jiaotong University in early 2020 in an attempt to identify factors that could help predict severity of disease and patient outcome. Findings: While we did not detect significant differences in the number of monocytes between patients with COVID-19 and normal healthy individuals,we did identify significant morphological and functional differences, which are more pronounced in patients requiring prolonged hospitalization and ICU admission. Patients with COVID-19 have larger than normal monocytes, easily identified on forward scatter, side scatter analysis by routine flow cytometry,with the presence of a distinct population of monocytes with high forward scatter (FSC-high). On more detailed analysis, these FSC-high monocytes are CD11b+, CD14+, CD16+, CD68+, CD80+, CD163+, CD206+ and secrete IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-alpha, consistent with an inflammatory phenotype. Conclusions: The detection and serial monitoring of this subset of inflammatory monocytes using flow cytometry could be of great help in guiding the prognostication and treatment of patients with COVID-19 and merits further evaluation.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dan Zhang","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Rui Guo","author_inst":"Xi'an No.8 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Lei","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong Univerisity"},{"author_name":"Hongjuan Liu","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Yawen Wang","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Yili Wang","author_inst":"Xi'an No.8 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tongxin Dai","author_inst":"Xi'an No.8 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tianxiao Zhang","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiatong Univeristy"},{"author_name":"Yanjun Lai","author_inst":"Xi'an No.9 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jingya Wang","author_inst":"Tianjin Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang Liu","author_inst":"Tianjin Medical Univerisity"},{"author_name":"Aili He","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Michael O'Dwyer","author_inst":"National Univeristy of Ireland Galway"},{"author_name":"Jinsong Hu","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Chuan-zhen Wang","author_inst":"Tianyou Hospital Affiliated to Wuhan University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yao Ma","author_inst":"Tianyou Hospital Affiliated to Wuhan University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhanwei Wang","author_inst":"University of Hawaii Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Richard Yanagihara","author_inst":"John A.

Here, we account for importations from Wuhan and from other cities in China, combining COVID-19 prevalence estimates in 18 Chinese cities with estimates of flight passenger volume to predict for each day between early December 2019 to late February 2020 the number of cases exported from China. We predict that the main source of global case importation in early January was Wuhan, but due to the Wuhan lockdown and the rapid spread of the virus, the main source of case importation from mid February became Chinese cities outside of Wuhan. For destinations in Africa in particular, non-Wuhan cities were an important source of case imports (1 case from those cities for each case from Wuhan, range of model scenarios: 0.1-9.8). Our model predicts that 18.4 (8.5 - 100) COVID-19 cases were imported to 26 destination countries in Africa, with most of them (90%) predicted to have arrived between 7th January (+\/-10 days) and 5th February (+\/- 3 days), and all of them predicted prior to the first case detections. We finally observed marked heterogeneities in expected imported cases across those locations. Our estimates shed light on shifting sources and local risks of case importation which can help focus surveillance efforts and guide public health policy during the final stages of the pandemic. We further provide a time window for the seeding of local epidemics in African locations, a key parameter for estimating expected outbreak size and burden on local health care systems and societies, that has yet to be defined in these locations.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tigist Ferede Menkir","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

During the current COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing guidelines require alternative data collection in order protect both research staff and participants. Home-collected respiratory specimens are less resource intensive, can be collected earlier after symptom onset, and provide a low-contact means of data collection. A prospective, multi-year, community-based cohort study is an ideal setting to examine the utility of home-collected specimens for identification of influenza. Methods: We describe the feasibility and reliability of home-collected specimens for the detection of influenza. We collected data and specimens between October 2014 and June 2017 from the Household Influenza Vaccine Evaluation (HIVE) Study. Cohort participants were asked to collect a nasal swab at home upon onset of acute respiratory illness. Research staff also collected nose and throat swab specimens in the study clinic within 7 days of onset. We estimated agreement using Cohen's kappa and calculated sensitivity and specificity of home-collected compared to staff-collected specimens. Results: We tested 336 paired staff- and home-collected respiratory specimens for influenza by RT-PCR; 150 staff-collected specimens were positive for influenza A\/H3N2, 23 for influenza A\/H1N1, 14 for influenza B\/Victoria, and 31 for influenza B\/Yamagata. We found moderate agreement between collection methods for influenza A\/H3N2 (0.70) and B\/Yamagata (0.69) and high agreement for influenza A\/H1N1 (0.87) and B\/Victoria (0.86). Sensitivity ranged from 78-86% for all influenza types and subtypes. Specificity was high for influenza A\/H1N1 and both influenza B lineages with a range from 96-100%, and slightly lower for A\/H3N2 infections (88%). Conclusions: Collection of nasal swab specimens at home is both feasible and reliable for identification of influenza virus infections.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ryan E Malosh","author_inst":"University of Michigan School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Joshua G Petrie","author_inst":"University of Michigan School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Amy P Callear","author_inst":"University of Michigan School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Arnold S Monto","author_inst":"University of Michigan School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Emily Toth Martin","author_inst":"University of Michigan School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Caroline Buckee","author_inst":"Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Alexander Watts","author_inst":"BlueDot"},{"author_name":"Kamran Khan","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Ryan Sherbo","author_inst":"BlueDot"},{"author_name":"Ada W.C.

Before the implementation of control measures (e.g. social distancing, travel bans, etc) and under the assumption that infection elicits protective immunity, epidemiological theory indicates that the ongoing epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 will conform to this pattern. Here, we calibrate a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model to data on cumulative reported SARS-CoV-2 associated deaths from the United Kingdom (UK) and Italy under the assumption that such deaths are well reported events that occur only in a vulnerable fraction of the population. We focus on model solutions which take into consideration previous estimates of critical epidemiological parameters such as the basic reproduction number (R0), probability of death in the vulnerable fraction of the population, infectious period and time from infection to death, with the intention of exploring the sensitivity of the system to the actual fraction of the population vulnerable to severe disease and death. Our simulations are in agreement with other studies that the current epidemic wave in the UK and Italy in the absence of interventions should have an approximate duration of 2-3 months, with numbers of deaths lagging behind in time relative to overall infections. Importantly, the results we present here suggest the ongoing epidemics in the UK and Italy started at least a month before the first reported death and have already led to the accumulation of significant levels of herd immunity in both countries. There is an inverse relationship between the proportion currently immune and the fraction of the population vulnerable to severe disease. This relationship can be used to determine how many people will require hospitalisation (and possibly die) in the coming weeks if we are able to accurately determine current levels of herd immunity. There is thus an urgent need for investment in technologies such as virus (or viral pseudotype) neutralization assays and other robust assays which provide reliable read-outs of protective immunity, and for the provision of open access to valuable data sources such as blood banks and paired samples of acute and convalescent sera from confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 to validate these. Urgent development and assessment of such tests should be followed by rapid implementation at scale to provide real-time data. These data will be critical to the proper assessment of the effects of social distancing and other measures currently being adopted to slow down the case incidence and for informing future policy direction.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jose Lourenco","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Robert Paton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Mahan Ghafari","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Moritz Kraemer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Craig Thompson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Paul Klenerman","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Sunetra Gupta","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Ryan Sherbo","author_inst":"BlueDot"},{"author_name":"Ada W.C.

Methods: Using an age-structured compartmental model of COVID-19 transmission in the population of Ontario, Canada, we compared a base case with limited testing, isolation, and quarantine to scenarios with: enhanced case finding; restrictive social distancing measures; or a combination of enhanced case finding and less restrictive social distancing. Interventions were either implemented for fixed durations or dynamically cycled on and off, based on projected ICU bed occupancy. We present median and credible intervals (CrI) from 100 replicates per scenario using a two-year time horizon. Results: We estimated that 56% (95% CrI: 42-63%) of the Ontario population would be infected over the course of the epidemic in the base case. At the epidemic peak, we projected 107,000 (95% CrI: 60,760-149,000) cases in hospital and 55,500 (95% CrI: 32,700-75,200) cases in ICU. For fixed duration scenarios, all interventions were projected to delay and reduce the height of the epidemic peak relative to the base case, with restrictive social distancing estimated to have the greatest effect. Longer duration interventions were more effective. Dynamic interventions were projected to reduce the proportion of the population infected at the end of the two-year period. Dynamic social distancing interventions could reduce the median number of cases in ICU below current estimates of Ontario's ICU capacity. Interpretation: Without significant social distancing or a combination of moderate social distancing with enhanced case finding, we project that ICU resources would be overwhelmed. Dynamic social distancing could maintain health system capacity and also allow periodic psychological and economic respite for populations.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ashleigh Tuite","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"David N Fisman","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Amy L Greer","author_inst":"University of Guelph"},{"author_name":"Moritz Kraemer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Craig Thompson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Paul Klenerman","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Sunetra Gupta","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Ryan Sherbo","author_inst":"BlueDot"},{"author_name":"Ada W.C.

A total of 81,021 laboratory-confirmed cases, including 3,194 deaths (3.9%) had been reported in China by March 14, 2020, meanwhile, 61,518 laboratory-confirmed cases and 2,199 deaths were reported outside China. Common symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia included fever, fatigue and dry cough. Faced with such a sudden outbreak of new infectious diseases, we have no history to learn from and no evidence to count on. Traditional models often predict inconsistent results. Aiming at estimate the epidemic trend timely after the outbreak, we mainly used 7-day moving average of log-transformed daily new cases (LMA) to establish a new index named \"epidemic trend index\", which will be used to predict the evolutionary trend of the epidemic situation and support epidemic control decision making processes. We used SARS epidemic data from Hong Kong in 2003 to verify the practicability of the new index, which shows that the index is acceptable. The epidemic trend index was then applied to the COVID-19 epidemic analysis in China. The results show that during the epidemic, the trend direction of different districts of China changed on different date. In the whole country and in Hubei Province alone, the epidemic reached the peak on February 9. While the peak appeared earlier, i.e. on February 5 in other provinces. It indicated that decisive outbreak control measures of the Chinese government are effective. While local governments should adjust management measures based on local risk level of epidemic. Although the epidemic has eased since late February, continued efforts in epidemic control are still needed to accelerate the end of the epidemic in China. However, the global COVID-19 epidemic outside China continues to expand as indicated by the epidemic trend index we proposed. In order to cope with the novel coronavirus pandemic, people all over the world should work together and governments of all countries should take efficient measures in the light of China's experience and according to national circumstances and local conditions.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yun-ting He","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hao He","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jing Zhai","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xiao-jin Wang","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, Clinical Research Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bing-shun Wang","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, Clinical Research Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Paul Klenerman","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Sunetra Gupta","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Ryan Sherbo","author_inst":"BlueDot"},{"author_name":"Ada W.C.

We aimed to investigate whether COVID-19 and SARS exhibited similar spatial and temporal features at the provincial level in mainland China. Methods: The number of people infected by COVID-19 and SARS were extracted from daily briefings on newly confirmed cases during the epidemics, as of Mar. 4, 2020 and Aug. 3, 2003, respectively. We depicted the spatiotemporal patterns of the COVID-19 and SARS epidemics using spatial statistics such as Moran's I and the local indicators of spatial association (LISA). Results: Compared to SARS, COVID-19 had a higher incidence. We identified 3 clusters (predominantly located in south-central China, highest RR=135.08) for COVID-19 and 4 clusters (mainly in Northern China, highest RR=423.51) for SARS. Fewer secondary clusters were identified after the \"Wuhan lockdown\". The LISA cluster map detected a significantly high-low (Hubei) and low-high spatial clustering (Anhui, Hunan, and Jiangxi, in Central China) for COVID-19. Two significant high-high (Beijing and Tianjin) and low-high (Hebei) clusters were detected for SARS, although the global Moran's I value was not significant. Conclusions: The different spatiotemporal clustering patterns between COVID-19 and SARS could point to changes in social and demographic factors, local government containment strategies or differences in transmission mechanisms between these coronaviruses.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xi Zhang","author_inst":"Clinical Research Unit, Xin Hua Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, P.R.

The virus was first detected in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States in January, 2020, with subsequent COVID-19 outbreaks detected in all 50 states by early March. To uncover the sources of SARS-CoV-2 introductions and patterns of spread within the U.S., we sequenced nine viral genomes from early reported COVID-19 patients in Connecticut. Our phylogenetic analysis places the majority of these genomes with viruses sequenced from Washington state. By coupling our genomic data with domestic and international travel patterns, we show that early SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Connecticut was likely driven by domestic introductions. Moreover, the risk of domestic importation to Connecticut exceeded that of international importation by mid-March regardless of our estimated impacts of federal travel restrictions. This study provides evidence for widespread, sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within the U.S. and highlights the critical need for local surveillance.","rel_num_authors":36,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joseph R Fauver","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Mary E.

Methods: Adult suspected patients aged >18 years within 14 days who underwent chest CT scan and reverse-transcription polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) tests were enrolled. The enrolled patients were confirmed and grouped according to results of RT-PCR tests. The data of basic demographics, single chest CT features, and combined chest CT features were analyzed for confirmed and non-confirmed groups. Results: A total of 130 patients were enrolled with 54 cases positive and 76 cases negative. The typical CT imaging features of positive group were ground glass opacity (GGO), crazy-paving pattern and air bronchogram. The lesions were mostly distributed bilaterally, close to the lower lungs or the pleura. When features combined, GGO with bilateral pulmonary distribution and GGO with pleural distribution were more common, of which were 31 cases (57.4%) and 30 cases (55.6%) respectively. The combinations were almost presented statistically significant (P<0.05) except for the combination of GGO with consolidation. Most combinations presented relatively low sensitivity but extremely high specificity. The average specificity of these combinations is around 90%. Conclusions: The combinations of GGO could be useful in the identification and differential diagnosis of COVID-19, which alerts clinicians to isolate patients for treatment promptly and repeat RT-PCR tests until incubation ends.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Congliang Miao","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mengdi Jin","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Li Miao","author_inst":"High-tech Hospital, First Hospital Affiliated to Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"Xinying Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Peng Huang","author_inst":"People's Hospital of Yichun city"},{"author_name":"Huanwen Xiong","author_inst":"High-tech Hospital, First Hospital Affiliated to Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"Peijie Huang","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Qi Zhao","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jiang Du","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jiang Hong","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jafar Razeq","author_inst":"Connecticut State Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Randy Downing","author_inst":"Connecticut State Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Nagarjuna R.

Diabetes mellitus is an established risk factor for poor clinical outcomes, but the association of diabetes with the prognosis of COVID-19 have not been reported yet. Methods In this cohort study, we retrospectively reviewed 258 consecutive hospitalized COVID-19 patients with or without diabetes at the West Court of Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China, recruited from January 29 to February 12, 2020. The cases were confirmed by real-time PCR and the demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Prognosis was defined as hospitalization, discharged survivor and death, which was followed up until March 12, 2020. Results Of the 258 hospitalized patients (63 with diabetes) with COVID-19, the median age was 64 years (range 23-91), and 138 (53.5%) were male. No significant differences in age and sex were identified between patients with and without diabetes. Common symptoms included fever (82.2%), dry cough (67.1%), polypnea (48.1%), and fatigue (38%). Patients with diabetes had significantly higher leucocyte and neutrophil counts, and higher levels of fasting blood glucose, serum creatinine, urea nitrogen and creatine kinase isoenzyme MB at admission compared with those without diabetes. COVID-19 patients with diabetes were more likely to develop severe or critical disease condition with more complications at presentation, and had higher incidence rates of antibiotic therapy, non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation, and death (11.1% vs. 4.1%). Cox proportional hazard model showed that diabetes (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]=3.64; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09, 12.21) and fasting blood glucose (aHR=1.19; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.31) were associated with the fatality of COVID-19, adjusting for potential confounders. Conclusions Diabetes mellitus is associated with greater disease severity and a higher risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19. Primary and secondary prevention strategies are needed for COVID-19 patients with diabetes.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yan Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yanhui Cui","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Minxue Shen","author_inst":"Department of Dermatology, Xiangya Hospital; Department of Social Medicine and Health Management, Xiangya School of Public Health, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Jianchu Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Ben Liu","author_inst":"Department of Emergency, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Minhui Dai","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Linli Chen","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Duoduo Han","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yifei Fan","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yanjun Zeng","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Wen Li","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Fengyu Lin","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Sha Li","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xiang Chen","author_inst":"Department of Dermatology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Pinhua Pan","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Isabel Ott","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Josh Quick","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J.

Three-hundred and fifty-five COVID-19 patients with were recruited and clinical data were collected from electronic medical records. Patient's prognosis was tracked and risk factors of AKI was analyzed. Of 355 COVID-19 patients, common, severe and critical ill cases accounted for 63.1%, 16.9% and 20.0%, respectively. On admission, 56 (15.8%) patients were with AKI. Although AKI was more common in critical ill patients with COVID-19, there was no significant association between oxygenation index and renal functional indices among COVID-19 patients with AKI. By multivariate logistic regression, male, older age and comorbidity with diabetes were three important independent risk factors predicting AKI among COVID-19 patients. Among 56 COVID-19 patients with AKI, 33.9% were died on mean 10.9 day after hospitalization. Fatality rate was obviously higher among COVID-+19 patients with AKI than those without AKI (RR=7.08, P<0.001).

Two previous case series from China have suggested that cancer patients are at a higher risk of COVID-19 pneumonia, but the reports were limited by small numbers and few clinical information. Objective: To study clinical characteristics and outcomes of cancer patients infected with COVID-19. Design: Retrospective study. Setting: Four designated COVID-16 hospitals in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Participants: Medical records of 67 cancer patients admitted to hospitals between Jan 5, 2020 to Feb 18, 2020 were included. Measurements: Demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and treatment data were collected. Survival data of the cohort was cut-off on Mar 10, 2020. Results: Of the 67 patients (median age: 66 years), the median age of patients who had severe illness was older than that of patients who had mild symptoms (P<0.001). Forty-three (64.2%) patients had other concurrent chronic diseases, and the proportion of severe patients had co-morbidities was higher than patients with mild disease (P=0.004). Twenty-three (34.3%) patients were still at the anticancer treatment phase, but no tumour progression and recurrence was observed for all the patients during the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. About 70% of these patients had fever (n=53, 79.1%) and\/or cough (n=50, 74.6%). Lymphocytopenia was the main laboratory finding accompanying increased C-reactive protein and procalcitonin in cancer patients, especially in severe cases. By Mar 10, 2020, 18 (26.9%) patients died from COVID-19, and 39 (58.2%) patients have been discharged. The median age of survivors was younger than that of deaths (P=0.014). Lung cancer (n=15, 22.4%) with COVID-19 was the most common cancer type and accounted for the highest proportion COVID-19 resulted deaths (33.3%, 5\/15). We observed a tendency that patients at the follow-up phase had a better prognosis than that at anticancer treatment phase (P=0.095). Limitation: This is a retrospective study with only 67 cases from four hospitals. And some specific clinical information was insufficient. Conclusion: This study showed COVID-19 patients with cancer seem to have a higher proportion of severe cases and poorer prognosis. The tendency of poor prognosis was more obvious in patients at anticancer treatment phase. We should pay more intensive attentions to cancer patients infected with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hong-Yan Zhang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Lin-Wei Wang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yuan-Yuan Chen","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Kun Shen","author_inst":"Convalife (Shanghai) Co., Ltd."},{"author_name":"Qun Wang","author_inst":"the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"You-Qin Yan","author_inst":"the Seventh Hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Yi Yu","author_inst":"Han Kou Hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Qiuji Wu","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Ya-Hua Zhong","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Melvin Chua Lee Kiang","author_inst":"National Cancer Centre Singapore"},{"author_name":"Cong-Hua Xie","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"De-Xin Yu","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hui Zhao","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"De-Xiang Xu","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pinhua Pan","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Isabel Ott","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Josh Quick","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J.

We execute a comprehensive in silico analysis of viral peptide-MHC class I binding affinity across all known HLA -A, -B, and -C genotypes for all SARS-CoV-2 peptides. We further explore the potential for cross-protective immunity conferred by prior exposure to four common human coronaviruses. The SARS-CoV-2 proteome is successfully sampled and presented by a diversity of HLA alleles. However, we found that HLA-B*46:01 had the fewest predicted binding peptides for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting individuals with this allele may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, as they were previously shown to be for SARS (1). Conversely, we found that HLA-B*15:03 showed the greatest capacity to present highly conserved SARS-CoV-2 peptides that are shared among common human coronaviruses, suggesting it could enable cross-protective T-cell based immunity. Finally, we report global distributions of HLA types with potential epidemiological ramifications in the setting of the current pandemic.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Austin Nguyen","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Julianne K David","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Sean K Maden","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Mary A Wood","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin R Weeder","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Abhinav Nellore","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Reid F Thompson","author_inst":"Oregon Health & Science University"},{"author_name":"Qiuji Wu","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Ya-Hua Zhong","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Melvin Chua Lee Kiang","author_inst":"National Cancer Centre Singapore"},{"author_name":"Cong-Hua Xie","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"De-Xin Yu","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hui Zhao","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"De-Xiang Xu","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pinhua Pan","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Isabel Ott","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Josh Quick","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J.

It was first detected in the city of Wuhan in China and has spread globally resulting in substantial health and economic crisis in many countries. Observational studies have partially identified the different aspects of this disease. Up to this date, no comprehensive systematic review for the clinical, laboratory, epidemiologic and mortality findings has been published. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis for a better understanding of COVID-19. Methods: We reviewed the scientific literature published from January 1, 2019 to March 3, 2020. Statistical analyses were performed with STATA (version 14, IC; Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA). The pooled frequency with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was assessed using random effect model. Publication bias was assessed and p <0.05 was considered a statistically significant publication bias. Results: Out of 1102 studies, 32 satisfied the inclusion criteria. A total of 4789 patients with a mean age of 49 years were evaluated. Fever (83.0%, CI 77.5 to 87.6), cough (65.2%, CI 58.6 to 71.2) and myalgia\/fatigue (34.7, CI 26.0 to 44.4) were the most common symptoms. The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (18.5 %, CI 12.7 to 24.4) and Cardiovascular disease (14.9 %, CI 6.0 to 23.8). Among the laboratory abnormalities, elevated C-Reactive Protein (CRP) (72.0% (CI 54.3 to 84.6) and lymphopenia (50.1%, CI 38.0 to 62.4) were the most common findings. Bilateral ground-glass opacities (66.0%, CI 51.1 to 78.0) was the most common CT-Scan presentation. Pooled mortality rate was 6.6%, with males having significantly higher mortality compared to females (OR 3.4; 95% CI 1.2 to 9.1, P = 0.01). Conclusion: COVID-19 commonly presented with a progressive course of cough and fever with more than half of hospitalized patients showing leukopenia or a high CRP on their laboratory findings. Mortality associated with COVID19 was higher than that reported in studies in China with Males having a 3-fold higher risk of mortality in COVID19 compared to females.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammad Javad Nasiri","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sara Haddadi","author_inst":"University of Miami Miller School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Azin Tahvildari","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yeganeh Farsi","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mahta Arbabi","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Saba Hasanzadeh","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Parnian Jamshidi","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mukunthan Murthi","author_inst":"University of Miami Miller School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mehdi Mirsaeidi","author_inst":"University of Miami Miller School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Melvin Chua Lee Kiang","author_inst":"National Cancer Centre Singapore"},{"author_name":"Cong-Hua Xie","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"De-Xin Yu","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hui Zhao","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"De-Xiang Xu","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pinhua Pan","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Isabel Ott","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Josh Quick","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J.

However, the viral dynamics, host serologic responses, and their associations with clinical manifestations, have not been well described in prospective cohort. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort and enrolled 67 COVID-19 patients admitting between Jan 26 and Feb 5, 2020. Clinical specimens including nasopharyngeal swab, sputum, blood, urine and stool were tested periodically according to standardized case report form with final follow-up on February 27. The routes and duration of viral shedding, antibody response, and their associations with disease severity and clinical manifestations were systematically evaluated. Coronaviral particles in clinical specimens were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding were 12 (3-38), 19 (5-37), and 18 (7-26) days in nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum and stools, respectively. Only 13 urines (5.6%) and 12 plasmas (5.7%) were viral positive. Prolonged viral shedding was observed in severe patients than that of non-severe patients. Cough but not fever, aligned with viral shedding in clinical respiratory specimens, meanwhile the positive stool-RNA appeared to align with the proportion who concurrently had cough and sputum production, but not diarrhea. Typical coronaviral particles could be found directly in sputum by TEM. The anti-nucleocapsid-protein IgM started on day 7 and positive rate peaked on day 28, while that of IgG was on day 10 and day 49 after illness onset. IgM and IgG appear earlier, and their titers are significantly higher in severe patients than non-severe patients (p<0.05). The weak responders for IgG had a significantly higher viral clearance rate than that of strong responders (p= 0.011). Conclusions Nasopharyngeal, sputum and stools rather than blood and urine, were the major shedding routes for SARS-CoV-2, and meanwhile sputum had a prolonged viral shedding. Symptom cough seems to be aligned with viral shedding in clinical respiratory and fecal specimens. Stronger antibody response was associated with delayed viral clearance and disease severity.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wenting Tan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University), Chongqing 400038, China"},{"author_name":"Yanqiu Lu","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing 400036, China"},{"author_name":"Juan Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University), Chongqing 400038, China"},{"author_name":"Jing Wang","author_inst":"Division of Laboratory Diagnosis, Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing 400036, China;"},{"author_name":"Yunjie Dan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University), Chongqing 400038, China"},{"author_name":"Zhaoxia Tan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University), Chongqing 400038, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqing He","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing 400036, China"},{"author_name":"Chunfang Qian","author_inst":"Sector of Isolation Ward, Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing 400036, China"},{"author_name":"Qiangzhong Sun","author_inst":"Sector of Isolation Ward, Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing 400036, China"},{"author_name":"Qingli Hu","author_inst":"Sector of Isolation Ward, Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing 400036, China"},{"author_name":"Honglan Liu","author_inst":"Sector of Isolation Ward, Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing 400036, China"},{"author_name":"Sikuan Ye","author_inst":"Sector of Isolation Ward, Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing 400036, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaomei Xiang","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University), Chongqing 400038, China"},{"author_name":"Yi Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University), Chongqing 400038, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University), Chongqing 400038, China"},{"author_name":"Yanzhi Guo","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University), Chongqing 400038, China"},{"author_name":"Xiu-Hua Wang","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University), Chongqing 400038, China"},{"author_name":"Weiwei He","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University), Chongqing 400038, China"},{"author_name":"Xing Wan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University), Chongqing 400038, China"},{"author_name":"Fengming Sun","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University), Chongqing 400038, China"},{"author_name":"Quanfang Wei","author_inst":"Biomedical Analysis Center, College of Basic Medicine, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University), Chongqing 400038, China"},{"author_name":"Cong Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Pathology and Southwest Cancer Center, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University), Chongqing 400038, China"},{"author_name":"Guangqiang Pan","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University), Chongqing 400038, China"},{"author_name":"Jie Xia","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University), Chongqing 400038, China"},{"author_name":"Qing Mao","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University), Chongqing 400038, China"},{"author_name":"Yaokai Chen","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing 400036, China"},{"author_name":"Guohong Deng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University), Chongqing 400038, China"},{"author_name":"Saad B.

Modes of contact and risk of transmission among close contacts have not been well estimated. Methods We included 4950 closes contacts from Guangzhou, and extracted data including modes of contact, laboratory testing, clinical characteristics of confirmed cases and source cases. We used logistic regression analysis to explore the risk factors associated with infection of close contacts. Results Among 4950 closes contacts, the median age was 38.0 years, and males accounted for 50.2% (2484). During quarantine period, 129 cases (2.6%) were diagnosed, with 8 asymptomatic (6.2%), 49 mild (38.0%), and 5 (3.9%) severe to critical cases. The sensitivity of throat swab was 71.32% and 92.19% at first to second PCR test. Among different modes of contact, household contacts were the most dangerous in catching with infection of COVID-19, with an incidence of 10.2%. As the increase of age for close contacts and severity of source cases, the incidence of COVID-19 presented an increasing trend from 1.8% (0-17 years) to 4.2% (60 or over years), and from 0.33% for asymptomatic, 3.3% for mild, to 6.2% for severe and critical source cases, respectively. Manifestation of expectoration in source cases was also highly associated with an increased risk of infection in their close contacts (13.6%). Secondary cases were in general clinically milder and were less likely to have common symptoms than those of source cases. Conclusions In conclusion, the proportion of asymptomatic and mild infections account for almost half of the confirmed cases among close contacts. The household contacts were the main transmission mode, and clinically more severe cases were more likely to pass the infection to their close contacts. Generally, the secondary cases were clinically milder than those of source cases.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lei Luo","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Dan Liu","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xin-long Liao","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xian-bo Wu","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qin-long Jing","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jia-zhen Zheng","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fang-hua Liu","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Shi-gui Yang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, The"},{"author_name":"Bi Bi","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Zhi-hao Li","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jian-ping Liu","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wei-qi Song","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhu","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Zheng-he Wang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xi-ru Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pei-liang Chen","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hua-min Liu","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xin Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Miao-chun Cai","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qing-mei Huang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pei Yang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xin-fen Yang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhi-gang Huang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jin-ling Tang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yu Ma","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chen Mao","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Guohong Deng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University), Chongqing 400038, China"},{"author_name":"Saad B.

SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry depends on binding between the viral Spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) target cell receptor. Here, we report on the isolation and characterization of 206 RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) derived from single B cells of eight SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. These mAbs come from diverse families of antibody heavy and light chains without apparent enrichment for particular families in the repertoire. In samples from one patient selected for further analyses, we found coexistence of germline and germline divergent clones. Both clone types demonstrated impressive binding and neutralizing activity against pseudovirus and live SARS-CoV-2. However, the antibody neutralizing potency is determined by competition with ACE2 receptor for RBD binding. Surprisingly, none of the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies nor the infected plasma cross-reacted with RBDs from either SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV although substantial plasma cross-reactivity to the trimeric Spike proteins from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was found. These results suggest that antibody response to RBDs is viral species-specific while that cross-recognition target regions outside the RBD. The specificity and neutralizing characteristics of this plasma cross-reactivity requires further investigation. Nevertheless, the diverse and potent neutralizing antibodies identified here are promising candidates for prophylactic and therapeutic SARS-CoV-2 interventions.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bin Ju","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People Hospital, China"},{"author_name":"Qi Zhang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Ruoke Wang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University, China"},{"author_name":"Sisi Shan","author_inst":"Tsinghua University, China"},{"author_name":"Jinfang Yu","author_inst":"Tsinghua University, China"},{"author_name":"Jiwan Ge","author_inst":"Tsinghua University, China"},{"author_name":"Jun Lan","author_inst":"Tsinghua University, China"},{"author_name":"Shuye Zhang","author_inst":"Fudan University, China"},{"author_name":"Youchun Wang","author_inst":"National Institutes for Food and Drug Control, Beijing, China."},{"author_name":"Xuanling Shi","author_inst":"Tsinghua University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xinquan Wang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Linqi Zhang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhu","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Zheng-he Wang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xi-ru Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pei-liang Chen","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hua-min Liu","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xin Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Miao-chun Cai","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qing-mei Huang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pei Yang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xin-fen Yang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhi-gang Huang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jin-ling Tang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yu Ma","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chen Mao","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Guohong Deng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medial University), Chongqing 400038, China"},{"author_name":"Saad B.
