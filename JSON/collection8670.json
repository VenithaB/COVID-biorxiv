Crude mortality rate reached 49% in critical patients. Inflammation matters on disease progression. This study analyzed blood inflammation indicators among mild, severe and critical patients, helping to identify severe or critical patients early. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 100 patients were included and divided to mild, severe or critical groups. Correlation of peripheral blood inflammation-related indicators with disease criticality was analyzed. Cut-off values for critically ill patients were speculated through the ROC curve. ResultsSignificantly, disease severity were associated with age (R=-0.564, P<0.001), interleukin-2 receptor (IL2R) (R=-0.534, P<0.001), interleukin-6 (IL-6) (R=-0.535, P<0.001), interleukin-8 (IL-8) (R=-0.308, P<0.001), interleukin-10 (IL-10) (R=-0.422, P<0.001), tumor necrosis factor  (TNF) (R=-0.322, P<0.001), C-reactive protein (CRP) (R=-0.604, P<0.001), ferroprotein (R=-0.508, P<0.001), procalcitonin (R=-0.650, P<0.001), white cell counts (WBC) (R=-0.54, P<0.001), lymphocyte counts (LC) (R=-0.56, P<0.001), neutrophil count (NC) (R=-0.585, P<0.001) and eosinophil counts (EC) (R=-0.299, P=0.01). ConclusionWith following parameters such as age >67.5 years, IL2R >793.5U\/mL, CRP >30.7ng\/mL, ferroprotein >2252g\/L, WBC>9.5*10^9\/L or NC >7.305*10^9\/L, the progress of COVID-19 to critical stage should be closely observed and possibly prevented. Inflammation is closely related to severity of COVID-19, and IL-6, TNF and IL-8 might be promising therapeutic targets.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jing Gong","author_inst":"Department of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hui Dong","author_inst":"TongJiHospital"},{"author_name":"Song Qing Xia","author_inst":"TongJiHospital"},{"author_name":"Yi Zhao Huang","author_inst":"TongJiHospital"},{"author_name":"Dingkun Wang","author_inst":"TongJiHospital"},{"author_name":"Yan Zhao","author_inst":"TongJiHospital"},{"author_name":"Wenhua Liu","author_inst":"TongJiHospital"},{"author_name":"Shenghao Tu","author_inst":"TongJiHospital"},{"author_name":"Mingmin Zhang","author_inst":"TongJiHospital"},{"author_name":"Qi Wang","author_inst":"TongJiHospital"},{"author_name":"Fuer Lu","author_inst":"felu@tjh.tjmu.edu.cn"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.25.20027755","rel_title":"Application and optimization of RT-PCR in diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection","rel_date":"2020-02-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.25.20027755","rel_abs":"Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global threat to public health. Aiming to construct an efficient screening pattern, we comprehensively evaluated the performances of RT-PCR and chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19. Methods: The records including demographics, RT-PCR, and CT from 87 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 481 exclusion cases were collected. The diagnostic accuracy of the pharyngeal swab RT-PCR, CT, combination with the second pharyngeal swab RT-PCR or with CT were evaluated individually. Besides, all the stool RT-PCR results were plotted by time to explore the value of stool RT-PCR. Findings: Combination of RT-PCR and CT has the higher sensitivity (91.9%,79\/86) than RT-PCR alone (78.2%68\/87) or CT alone (66.7%, 54 of 81) or combination of two RT-PCR tests (86.2%,75\/87). There was good agreement between RT-PCR and CT (kappa-value, 0.430). In 34 COVID-19 cases with inconsistent results, 94.1% (n=32) are mild infection, 62.5% of which (20\/32) showed positive RT-PCR. 46.7% (35\/75) COVID-19 patients had at least one positive stool during the course. Two cases had positive stool earlier than the pharyngeal swabs. Importantly, one patient had consecutive positive stool but negative pharyngeal swabs. Interpretation: Combination of RT-PCR and CT with the highest sensitivity is an optimal pattern to screen COVID-19. RT-PCR is superior to CT in diagnosing mild infections. Stool RT-PCR should be considered as an item for improving discovery rate and hospital discharge. This study shed light for optimizing scheme of screening and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guanmin Jiang","author_inst":"The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University."},{"author_name":"Xiaoshuai Ren","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yan Liu","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Hongtao Chen","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Wei Liu","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Zhaowang Guo","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yaqin Zhang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Chaoqun Chen","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jianhui Zhou","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Qiang Xiao","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Hong Shan","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.26.20026989","rel_title":"The definition and risks of Cytokine Release Syndrome-Like in 11 COVID-19-Infected Pneumonia critically ill patients: Disease Characteristics and Retrospective Analysis","rel_date":"2020-02-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.26.20026989","rel_abs":"IMPORTANCE: COVID-19-infected pneumonia patients with severe immune abnormalities and risk of cytokine release syndrome.

Methods: In this retrospective, single-center study, 41 consecutive corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) patients (including 2 deaths) of COVID-2019 in Beijing Youan Hospital, China Jan 21 to Feb 03, 2020, were involved in this study. The high risk factors of cardiac injury in different COVID-2019 patients were analyzed. Computed tomographic (CT) imaging of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) has been used to demonstrate the cardiac inflammation of COVID-2019. ResultsOf the 41 COVID-2019 patients, 2 (4.88%), 32 (78.05%), 4 (9.75%) and 3 (7.32%) patients were clinically diagnosed as light, mild, severe and critical cases, according to the 6th guidance issued by the National Health Commission of China. 10 (24.4%) patients had underlying complications, such as hypertension, CAD, type 2 diabetes mellites and tumor. The peak value of TnI in critical patients is 40-fold more than normal value. 2 patients in the critical group had the onset of atrial fibrillation, and the peak heart rates reached up to 160 bpm. CT scan showed low EAT density in severe and critical patients. Conclusion: Our results indicated that cardiac injury of COVID-2019 was rare in light and mild patients, while common in severe and critical patients. Therefore, the monitoring of the heart functions of COVID-2019 patients and applying potential interventions for those with abnormal cardiac injury related characteristics, is vital to prevent the fatality.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hui Hui","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Molecular Imaging, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yingqian Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, China"},{"author_name":"Xin Yang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Molecular Imaging, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xi Wang","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, China"},{"author_name":"Bingxi He","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Molecular Imaging, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Li Li","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University, China"},{"author_name":"Hongjun Li","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University, China"},{"author_name":"Jie Tian","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Molecular Imaging, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yundai Chen","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, China"},{"author_name":"Qiang Xiao","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Hong Shan","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"cardiovascular medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.26.20026971","rel_title":"Clinical Features of COVID-19 Related Liver Damage","rel_date":"2020-02-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.26.20026971","rel_abs":"BACKGROUND: A recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs mainly in China, with rapidly increasing the number of cases (namely COVID-19). Abnormal liver functions are frequently present in these patients, here we aimed to clarify the clinical features of COVID-19-related liver damage to provide some references for the clinical treatment. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center study, we included all confirmed COVID-19 cases in Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center from January 20 to January 31, 2020. The outcomes were followed up until February 19, 2020. A total of 148 cases were analyzed for clinical features, laboratory parameters (including liver function tests), medications and the length of stay. FINDINGS: Of 148 confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, 49.3% were females and 50.7% were males. The median age was 50.5 years (interquartile range, 36-64). Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (70.1%), cough (45.3%), expectoration (26.7%) at admission. 75 patients (50.7%) showed abnormal liver functions at admission. Patients (n = 75) who had elevated liver function index were more likely to have a moderate-high degree fever (44% vs 27.4%; p = 0.035) and significantly present in male patients (62.67% vs 38.36%; p = 0.005). The numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were significantly lower in abnormal liver function group than those in normal liver function group. There was no statistical difference in prehospital medications between normal and abnormal liver function groups, while the utilization rate of lopinavir\/ritonavir after admission was significantly higher in patients with emerging liver injury than that in patients with normal liver functions. Importantly, the emerging abnormal liver functions after admission caused a prolonged length of stay. INTERPRETATION: SARS-CoV-2 may cause the liver function damage and the Lopinavir\/ritonavir should be applied carefully for the treatment of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhenyu Fan","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Liping Chen","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center Affiliated, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jun Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Cheng Tian","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yajun Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Shaoping Huang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zhanju Liu","author_inst":"The Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University"},{"author_name":"Jilin Cheng","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yundai Chen","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, China"},{"author_name":"Qiang Xiao","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Hong Shan","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"gastroenterology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.24.20027623","rel_title":"Spread and control of COVID-19 in China and their associations with population movement, public health emergency measures, and medical resources","rel_date":"2020-02-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.24.20027623","rel_abs":"ABSTRACT BACKGROUND The COVID-19 epidemic, first emerged in Wuhan during December 2019, has spread globally. While the mass population movement for Chinese New Year has significantly influenced spreading the disease, little direct evidence exists about the relevance to epidemic and its control of population movement from Wuhan, local emergency response, and medical resources in China. METHODS Spearman's correlation analysis was performed between official data of confirmed COVID-19 cases from Jan 20th to Feb 19th, 2020 and real-time travel data and health resources data. RESULTS There were 74,675 confirmed COVID-19 cases in China by Feb 19th, 2020. The overall fatality rate was 2.84%, much higher in Hubei than in other regions (3.27% vs 0.73%). The index of population inflow from Hubei was positively correlated with total (Provincial r=0.9159, p<0.001; City r=0.6311, p<0.001) and primary cases (Provincial r=0.8702, p<0.001; City r=0.6358, p<0.001). The local health emergency measures (eg, city lockdown and traffic control) were associated with reduced infections nationwide. Moreover, the number of public health employees per capita was inversely correlated with total cases (r=-0.6295, p<0.001) and infection rates (r=-0.4912, p<0.01). Similarly, cities with less medical resources had higher fatality (r=-0.4791, p<0.01) and lower cure rates (r=0.5286, p<0.01) among the confirmed cases. CONCLUSIONS The spread of the COVID-19 in China in its early phase was attributed primarily to population movement from Hubei, and effective governmental health emergency measures and adequate medical resources played important roles in subsequent control of epidemic and improved prognosis of affected individuals.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Songmin Ying","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fei Li","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xinwei Geng","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Zhouyang Li","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xufei Du","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Haixia Chen","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sisi Chen","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Min Zhang","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Zhehua Shao","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yinfang Wu","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Madiha Zahra Syeda","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fugui Yan","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Luanqing Che","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bin Zhang","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jian Lou","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shaobin Wang","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Zhengming Chen","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Wen Li","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ye Shen","author_inst":"Hangzhou Mitigenomics Technology Inc."},{"author_name":"Zhihua Chen","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Huahao Shen","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.26.20028217","rel_title":"Community responses during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hong Kong: risk perception, information exposure and preventive measures","rel_date":"2020-02-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.26.20028217","rel_abs":"Background: Community responses are important for outbreak management during the early phase when non-pharmaceutical interventions are the major preventive options. Therefore, this study aims to examine the psychological and behavioral responses of the community during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hong Kong. Method: A cross-sectional online survey was launched within 36 hours after confirmed COVID-19 cases were first reported. Councilors of all 452 district council constituency areas were approached for survey dissemination. Respondent demographics, anxiety level, risk perception, sources to retrieve COVID-19 information, actual adoption and perceived efficacy of precautionary measures were collected. Result: Analysis from 1715 complete responses indicated high perceived susceptibility (89%) and high perceived severity (97%). Most respondents were worried about COVID-19 (97%), and had their daily routines disrupted (slightly\/greatly: 98%). The anxiety level, measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, was borderline abnormal (9.01). Nearly all respondents were alert to the disease progression (99.5%). The most trusted information sources were doctors (84%), followed by broadcast (57%) and newspaper (54%), but they were not common information sources (doctor: 5%; broadcast: 34%; newspaper: 40%). Only 16% respondents found official websites reliable. Enhanced personal hygiene practices and travel avoidance to China were frequently adopted (>77%) and considered effective (>90%). The adoption of social-distancing measures was lower (39%-88%), and their drivers for greater adoption include: being female (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]:1.27), living in the New Territories (aOR:1.32-1.55), perceived as having good understanding of COVID-19 (aOR:1.84) and being more anxious (aOR:1.07). Discussion: Risk perception towards COVID-19 in the community was high. Most respondents are alert to the disease progression, and adopt self-protective measures. This study contributes by examining the psycho-behavioral responses of hosts, in addition to the largely studied mechanistic aspects, during the early phase of the current COVID-19 epidemic. The timely psychological and behavioral assessment of the community is useful to inform subsequent interventions and risk communication strategies as the epidemic progresses.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kin On Kwok","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Kin Kit Li","author_inst":"The City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Ho Hin Chan","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Yuan Yuan Yi","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Arthur Tang","author_inst":"Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul"},{"author_name":"Wan In Wei","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Yeung Shan Wong","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Min Zhang","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Zhehua Shao","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yinfang Wu","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Madiha Zahra Syeda","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fugui Yan","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Luanqing Che","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bin Zhang","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jian Lou","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shaobin Wang","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Zhengming Chen","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Wen Li","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ye Shen","author_inst":"Hangzhou Mitigenomics Technology Inc."},{"author_name":"Zhihua Chen","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Huahao Shen","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.25.20027433","rel_title":"An R package and a website with real-time data on the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak","rel_date":"2020-02-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.25.20027433","rel_abs":"To provide convenient access to epidemiological data on the coronavirus outbreak, we developed an R package, nCov2019 (https:\/\/github.com\/GuangchuangYu\/nCov2019).

Since December 2019, more than 69,000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in China and quickly spreads to other counties. Currently, researchers put their best efforts to identify effective drugs for COVID-19. The neutralizing antibody, which binds to viral capsid in a manner that inhibits cellular entry of virus and uncoating of the genome, is the specific defense against viral invaders. In this study, we investigate to identify neutralizing antibodies that can bind to SARS-CoV-2 Sipke (S) protein and interfere with the interaction between viral S protein and a host receptor by bioinformatic methods. The sequence analysis of S protein showed two major differences in the RBD region of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein compared to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV related bat viruses (btSARS-CoV). The insertion regions were close to interacting residues with the human ACE2 receptor. Epitope analysis of neutralizing antibodies revealed that SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies used conformational epitopes, whereas MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies used a common linear epitope region, which contributes to form the {beta}-sheet structure in MERS-CoV S protein and deleted in SARS-CoV-2 S protein. To identify effective neutralizing antibodies for SARS-CoV-2, the binding affinities of neutralizing antibodies with SARS-CoV-2 S protein were predicted and compared by antibody-antigen docking simulation. The result showed that CR3022 neutralizing antibody from human may have higher binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 S protein than SARS-CoV S protein. We also found that F26G19 and D12 mouse antibodies could bind to SARS-CoV S protein with high affinity. Our findings provide crucial clues towards the development of antigen diagnosis, therapeutic antibody, and the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tamina Park","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Sang-Yeop Lee","author_inst":"Korea Basic Science Institute"},{"author_name":"Seil Kim","author_inst":"Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science"},{"author_name":"Mi Jeong Kim","author_inst":"Korea Basic Science Institute"},{"author_name":"Hong Gi Kim","author_inst":"Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Sangmi Jun","author_inst":"Korea Basic Science Institute"},{"author_name":"Seung Il Kim","author_inst":"Korea Basic Science Institute"},{"author_name":"Bum Tae Kim","author_inst":"Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Edmond Changkyun Park","author_inst":"Korea Basic Science Institute"},{"author_name":"Daeui Park","author_inst":"Center for Convergent Research of Emerging Virus Infection"},{"author_name":"Madiha Zahra Syeda","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fugui Yan","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Luanqing Che","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bin Zhang","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jian Lou","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shaobin Wang","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Zhengming Chen","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Wen Li","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ye Shen","author_inst":"Hangzhou Mitigenomics Technology Inc."},{"author_name":"Zhihua Chen","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Huahao Shen","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.22.961268","rel_title":"A simple magnetic nanoparticles-based viral RNA extraction method for efficient detection of SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-02-27","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.22.961268","rel_abs":"1The ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) originating from Wuhan, China, draws worldwide concerns due to its long incubation period and strong infectivity. Although RT-PCR-based molecular diagnosis techniques are being widely applied for clinical diagnosis currently, timely and accurate diagnosis are still limited due to labour intensive and time-consuming operations of these techniques. To address the issue, herein we report the synthesis of poly (amino ester) with carboxyl groups (PC)-coated magnetic nanoparticles (pcMNPs), and the development of pcMNPs-based viral RNA extraction method for the sensitive detection of COVID-19 causing virus, the SARS-CoV-2. This method combines the lysis and binding steps into one step, and the pcMNPs-RNA complexes can be directly introduced into subsequent RT-PCR reactions. The simplified process can purify viral RNA from multiple samples within 20 min using a simple manual method or an automated high-throughput approach. By identifying two different regions (ORFlab and N gene) of viral RNA, a 10-copy sensitivity and a strong linear correlation between 10 and 105 copies of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus particles are achieved. Benefitting from the simplicity and excellent performances, this new extraction method can dramatically reduce the turn-around time and operational requirements in current molecular diagnosis of COVID-19, in particular for the early clinical diagnosis.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhen Zhao","author_inst":"Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Haodong Cui","author_inst":"Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wenxing Song","author_inst":"Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiaoling Ru","author_inst":"Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wenhua Zhou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xuefeng Yu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Seung Il Kim","author_inst":"Korea Basic Science Institute"},{"author_name":"Bum Tae Kim","author_inst":"Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Edmond Changkyun Park","author_inst":"Korea Basic Science Institute"},{"author_name":"Daeui Park","author_inst":"Center for Convergent Research of Emerging Virus Infection"},{"author_name":"Madiha Zahra Syeda","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fugui Yan","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Luanqing Che","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bin Zhang","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jian Lou","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shaobin Wang","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Zhengming Chen","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Wen Li","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ye Shen","author_inst":"Hangzhou Mitigenomics Technology Inc."},{"author_name":"Zhihua Chen","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Huahao Shen","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"molecular biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.25.963546","rel_title":"An Effective CTL Peptide Vaccine for Ebola Zaire Based on Survivors' CD8+ Targeting of a Particular Nucleocapsid Protein Epitope with Potential Implications for COVID-19 Vaccine Design","rel_date":"2020-02-27","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.25.963546","rel_abs":"The 2013-2016 West Africa EBOV epidemic was the biggest EBOV outbreak to date. An analysis of virus-specific CD8+ T-cell immunity in 30 survivors showed that 26 of those individuals had a CD8+ response to at least one EBOV protein. The dominant response (25\/26 subjects) was specific to the EBOV nucleocapsid protein (NP). It has been suggested that epitopes on the EBOV NP could form an important part of an effective T-cell vaccine for Ebola Zaire. We show that a 9-amino-acid peptide NP44-52 (YQVNNLEEI) located in a conserved region of EBOV NP provides protection against morbidity and mortality after mouse adapted EBOV challenge. A single vaccination in a C57BL\/6 mouse using an adjuvanted microsphere peptide vaccine formulation containing NP44-52 is enough to confer immunity in mice. Our work suggests that a peptide vaccine based on CD8+ T-cell immunity in EBOV survivors is conceptually sound and feasible. Nucleocapsid proteins within SARS-CoV-2 contain multiple class I epitopes with predicted HLA restrictions consistent with broad population coverage. A similar approach to a CTL vaccine design may be possible for that virus.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Charles V Herst","author_inst":"Flow Pharma, Inc"},{"author_name":"Scott Burkholz","author_inst":"Flow Pharma, Inc"},{"author_name":"John Sidney","author_inst":"La Jolla Institute for Immunology"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Sette","author_inst":"La Jolla Institute for Immunology"},{"author_name":"Paul E Harris","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Shane Massey","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch Office of Development"},{"author_name":"Trevor Brasel","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch Office of Development"},{"author_name":"Edecio Cunha-Neto","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Daniela S Rosa","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"William Chong Hang Chao","author_inst":"University of Macau"},{"author_name":"Richard Thomas Carback III","author_inst":"Flow Pharma, Inc"},{"author_name":"Tom Hodge","author_inst":"Flow Pharma, Inc"},{"author_name":"Lu Wang","author_inst":"Flow Pharma, Inc"},{"author_name":"Serban Ciotlos","author_inst":"Flow Pharma, Inc"},{"author_name":"Peter Lloyd","author_inst":"Flow Pharma, Inc"},{"author_name":"Reid Martin Rubsamen","author_inst":"Flow Pharma, Inc & Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhengming Chen","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Wen Li","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ye Shen","author_inst":"Hangzhou Mitigenomics Technology Inc."},{"author_name":"Zhihua Chen","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Huahao Shen","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.24.963348","rel_title":"Increasing Host Cellular Receptor--Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) Expression by Coronavirus may Facilitate 2019-nCoV Infection","rel_date":"2020-02-27","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.24.963348","rel_abs":"The ongoing outbreak of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) causes an epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans. 2019-nCoV rapidly spread to national regions and multiple other countries, thus, pose a serious threat to public health. Recent studies show that spike (S) proteins of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV may use the same host cell receptor called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entering into host cells. The affinity between ACE2 and 2019-nCoV S is much higher than ACE2 binding to SARS-CoV S protein, explaining that why 2019-nCoV seems to be more readily transmitted from the human to human. Here, we reported that ACE2 can be significantly upregulated after infection of various viruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Basing on findings here, we propose that coronavirus infection can positively induce its cellular entry receptor to accelerate their replication and spread, thus drugs targeting ACE2 expression may be prepared for the future emerging infectious diseases caused by this cluster of viruses.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pei-Hui Wang","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Scott Burkholz","author_inst":"Flow Pharma, Inc"},{"author_name":"John Sidney","author_inst":"La Jolla Institute for Immunology"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Sette","author_inst":"La Jolla Institute for Immunology"},{"author_name":"Paul E Harris","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Shane Massey","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch Office of Development"},{"author_name":"Trevor Brasel","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch Office of Development"},{"author_name":"Edecio Cunha-Neto","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Daniela S Rosa","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"William Chong Hang Chao","author_inst":"University of Macau"},{"author_name":"Richard Thomas Carback III","author_inst":"Flow Pharma, Inc"},{"author_name":"Tom Hodge","author_inst":"Flow Pharma, Inc"},{"author_name":"Lu Wang","author_inst":"Flow Pharma, Inc"},{"author_name":"Serban Ciotlos","author_inst":"Flow Pharma, Inc"},{"author_name":"Peter Lloyd","author_inst":"Flow Pharma, Inc"},{"author_name":"Reid Martin Rubsamen","author_inst":"Flow Pharma, Inc & Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhengming Chen","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Wen Li","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ye Shen","author_inst":"Hangzhou Mitigenomics Technology Inc."},{"author_name":"Zhihua Chen","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Huahao Shen","author_inst":"Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.26.964882","rel_title":"Structure-based drug design, virtual screening and high-throughput screening rapidly identify antiviral leads targeting COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-02-27","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.26.964882","rel_abs":"A new coronavirus (CoV) identified as COVID-19 virus is the etiological agent responsible for the 2019-2020 viral pneumonia outbreak that commenced in Wuhan1-4. Currently there is no targeted therapeutics and effective treatment options remain very limited. In order to rapidly discover lead compounds for clinical use, we initiated a program of combined structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening and high-throughput screening to identify new drug leads that target the COVID-19 virus main protease (Mpro). Mpro is a key CoV enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription, making it an attractive drug target for this virus5,6. Here, we identified a mechanism-based inhibitor, N3, by computer-aided drug design and subsequently determined the crystal structure of COVID-19 virus Mpro in complex with this compound. Next, through a combination of structure-based virtual and high-throughput screening, we assayed over 10,000 compounds including approved drugs, drug candidates in clinical trials, and other pharmacologically active compounds as inhibitors of Mpro. Six of these inhibit Mpro with IC50 values ranging from 0.67 to 21.4 M. Ebselen also exhibited promising antiviral activity in cell-based assays. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of this screening strategy, which can lead to the rapid discovery of drug leads with clinical potential in response to new infectious diseases where no specific drugs or vaccines are available.","rel_num_authors":31,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhenming Jin","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyu Du","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Yechun Xu","author_inst":"Drug Discovery and Design Center, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Yongqiang Deng","author_inst":"Department of Virology, State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Scienc"},{"author_name":"Meiqin Liu","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Yao Zhao","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Bing Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaofeng Li","author_inst":"Department of Virology, State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Scienc"},{"author_name":"Leike Zhang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Chao Peng","author_inst":"National Facility for Protein Science in Shanghai, Zhangjiang Lab, Shanghai Advanced Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Science, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Yinkai Duan","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Jing Yu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Lin Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Kailin Yang","author_inst":"Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, USA"},{"author_name":"Fengjiang Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Rendi Jiang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China."},{"author_name":"Xinglou Yang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China."},{"author_name":"Tian You","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoce Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiuna Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Fang Bai","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Hong Liu","author_inst":"Drug Discovery and Design Center, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiang Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Frontiers Science Center for Cell Response, College of Life Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Luke W.

This study took immune-informatics approaches to identify B- and T-cell epitopes for surface glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2, followed by estimating their antigenicity and interactions with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles. We identified four B cell epitopes, two MHC class-I and nine MHC class-II binding T-cell epitopes, which showed highly antigenic features. Allergenicity, toxicity and physiochemical properties analysis confirmed the specificity and selectivity of epitopes. The stability and safety of epitopes were confirmed by digestion analysis. No mutations were observed in all the selected B- and T-cell epitopes across all isolates from different locations worldwide. Epitopes were thus identified and some of them can be potential candidates for vaccine development.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lin Li","author_inst":"Beihang University"},{"author_name":"Ting Sun","author_inst":"Beihang University"},{"author_name":"YuFei He","author_inst":"Beihang University"},{"author_name":"Wendong Li","author_inst":"Beihang University"},{"author_name":"Yubo Fan","author_inst":"Beihang University"},{"author_name":"Jing Zhang","author_inst":"Beihang University"},{"author_name":"Bing Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaofeng Li","author_inst":"Department of Virology, State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Scienc"},{"author_name":"Leike Zhang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Chao Peng","author_inst":"National Facility for Protein Science in Shanghai, Zhangjiang Lab, Shanghai Advanced Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Science, Shanghai, China."},{"author_name":"Yinkai Duan","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Jing Yu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Lin Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Kailin Yang","author_inst":"Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, USA"},{"author_name":"Fengjiang Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Rendi Jiang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China."},{"author_name":"Xinglou Yang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China."},{"author_name":"Tian You","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoce Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiuna Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Fang Bai","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Hong Liu","author_inst":"Drug Discovery and Design Center, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiang Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Frontiers Science Center for Cell Response, College of Life Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Luke W.

Methods: Cross-sectional study of patients presenting for who received a COVID-19 diagnosis, from December 30, 2019 to February 7, 2020, at Tongji hospital, Tongji medical college, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Demographics, temperature was recorded, blood routine test (Rt), chest Computed Tomography (CT) were took intermittently, and SARS-COV-2 real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay were arranged for the nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swab samples. Results: A total of 102 patients (48 Male [50%] and 54 Female [50%]) with clinical symptoms, Rt, and chest Computed Tomography (CT) abnormalities were identified with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Patients had a mean [SD] gestational age of 57.63 [14.90] years. Of a total of 102 patients identified, 72 patients (36 men [50%] and 36 women [50%]; mean [SD] age, 58.68 [14.81] years) confirmed by laboratory diagnosis with SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR assay. Only two patients (2.78%) with conjunctivitis was identified from 72 patients with a laboratory confirmed COVID-19. However, SARS-COV-2 RNA fragments was found in ocular discharges by SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR only in one patient with conjunctivitis. Conclusions: Although we suspect the incidence of SARS-COV-2 infection through the ocular surface is extremely low, the nosocomial infection of SARS-CoV-2 through the eyes after occupational exposure is a potential route. The inefficient diagnostic method and the sampling time lag may contribute to the lower positive rate of conjunctival swab samples of SARS-COV-2. Therefore, to lower the SARS-COV-2 nosocomial infection, the protective goggles should be wore in all the health care workers.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xufang Sun","author_inst":"Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xian Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Ophthalmology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Xuhui Chen","author_inst":"Department of Ophthalmology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Liwen Chen","author_inst":"Department of Ophthalmology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Chaohua Deng","author_inst":"Department of Ophthalmology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaojing Zou","author_inst":"Department of Emergency, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Weiyong Liu","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Huimin Yu","author_inst":"Department of Ophthalmology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Jong-Hwan Lee","author_inst":"Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Cheol Woo Byeon","author_inst":"WELLS BIO, INC."},{"author_name":"Joong Jin Lee","author_inst":"WELLS BIO, INC."},{"author_name":"Jin-soo Maeng","author_inst":"Korea Food Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Seong Jun Kim","author_inst":"Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Seung Il Kim","author_inst":"Korea Basic Science Institute"},{"author_name":"Bum-Tae Kim","author_inst":"Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Min Jun Lee","author_inst":"WELLS BIO, INC."},{"author_name":"Hong Gi Kim","author_inst":"Korea Institute of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Tian You","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoce Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiuna Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Fang Bai","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Hong Liu","author_inst":"Drug Discovery and Design Center, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiang Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Frontiers Science Center for Cell Response, College of Life Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Luke W.

However, for human researchers studying the viruses and the hosts, the vast amount of information available cannot be processed effectively and in a timely manner, particularly when the scientific understanding may be limited, which can further lower the information processing efficiency. We present TWIRLS, a method that can automatically acquire, organize, and classify information. Additionally, independent functional data sources can be added to build an inference system using a machine-based approach, which can provide relevant knowledge to help human researchers quickly establish subject cognition and to make more effective decisions. TWIRLS can automatically analyze more than three million words in more than 14,000 literature articles in only 4 hours. Combining with generalized gene interaction databases creates a data interface that can help researchers to further analyze the information. Using the TWIRLS system, we found that an important regulatory factor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) may be involved in the host pathological changes on binding to the coronavirus after infection. After triggering functional changes in ACE2\/AT2R, an imbalance in the steady-state cytokine regulatory axis involving the Renin-Angiotensin System and IP-10 leads to a cytokine storm.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaoyang Ji","author_inst":"Joint Turing-Darwin Laboratory of Phil Rivers and Institute of Computing Technology, CAS, Beijing    2.

Type II was likely evolved from Type I and predominant in the infections. Our results suggest that Type II SARS-CoV-2 was the source of the outbreak in the Wuhan Huanan market and it was likely originated from a super-spreader. The outbreak caused by the Type I virus should have occurred somewhere else, because the patients had no direct link to the market. Furthermore, by analyzing three genomic sites that distinguish Type I and Type II strains, we found that synonymous changes at two of the three sites confer higher protein translational efficiencies in Type II strains than in Type I strains, which might explain why Type II strains are predominant, implying that Type II is more contagious (transmissible) than Type I.

Our research aimed to construct a system based on deep learning for detecting COVID-19 pneumonia on high resolution CT, relieve working pressure of radiologists and contribute to the control of the epidemic. Methods: For model development and validation, 46,096 anonymous images from 106 admitted patients, including 51 patients of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and 55 control patients of other diseases in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Wuhan, Hubei province, China) were retrospectively collected and processed. Twenty-seven consecutive patients undergoing CT scans in Feb, 5, 2020 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University were prospectively collected to evaluate and compare the efficiency of radiologists against 2019-CoV pneumonia with that of the model. Findings: The model achieved a per-patient sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 93.55%, accuracy of 95.24%, PPV of 84.62%, and NPV of 100%; a per-image sensitivity of 94.34%, specificity of 99.16%, accuracy of 98.85%, PPV of 88.37%, and NPV of 99.61% in retrospective dataset. For 27 prospective patients, the model achieved a comparable performance to that of expert radiologist. With the assistance of the model, the reading time of radiologists was greatly decreased by 65%. Conclusion: The deep learning model showed a comparable performance with expert radiologist, and greatly improve the efficiency of radiologists in clinical practice. It holds great potential to relieve the pressure of frontline radiologists, improve early diagnosis, isolation and treatment, and thus contribute to the control of the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jun Chen","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Lianlian Wu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Jun Zhang","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Liang Zhang","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Dexin Gong","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yilin Zhao","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Shan Hu","author_inst":"Wuhan EndoAngel Medical Technology Company"},{"author_name":"Yonggui Wang","author_inst":"China University of Geosciences"},{"author_name":"Xiao Hu","author_inst":"Wuhan EndoAngel Medical Technology Company"},{"author_name":"Biqing Zheng","author_inst":"Wuhan EndoAngel Medical Technology Company"},{"author_name":"Kuo Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan EndoAngel Medical Technology Company"},{"author_name":"Huiling Wu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zehua Dong","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Youming Xu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yijie Zhu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xi Chen","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Lilei Yu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Honggang Yu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoce Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiuna Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Fang Bai","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Hong Liu","author_inst":"Drug Discovery and Design Center, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiang Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Frontiers Science Center for Cell Response, College of Life Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Luke W.

The symptoms of COVID-19 varied from modest, mild to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and the latter of which is generally associated with deregulated immune cytokine production; however, we currently know little as to the interplay between the extent of clinical symptoms and the compositions of lung immune microenvironment. Here, we comprehensively characterized the lung immune microenvironment with the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from 3 severe and 3 mild COVID-19 patients and 8 previously reported healthy lung controls through single-cell RNA sequence (scRNA-seq) combined with TCR-seq. Our data shows that monocyte-derived FCN1+ macrophages, whereas notFABP4+ alveolar macrophages that represent a predominant macrophage subset in BALF from patients with mild diseases, overwhelm in the severely damaged lungs from patients with ARDS. These cells are highly inflammatory and enormous chemokine producers implicated in cytokine storm. Furthermore, the formation of tissue resident, highly expanded clonal CD8+ T cells in the lung microenvironment of mild symptom patients suggests a robust adaptive immune response connected to a better control of COVID-19. This study first reported the cellular atlas of lung bronchoalveolar immune microenvironment in COVID-19 patients at the single-cell resolution, and unveiled the potential immune mechanisms underlying disease progression and protection in COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Minfeng Liao","author_inst":"Institute for Hepatology"},{"author_name":"Yang Liu","author_inst":"Institute for Hepatology"},{"author_name":"Jin Yuan","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yanling Wen","author_inst":"Institute for Hepatology"},{"author_name":"Gang Xu","author_inst":"Institute for Hepatology"},{"author_name":"Juanjuan Zhao","author_inst":"Institute for Hepatology"},{"author_name":"Lin Chen","author_inst":"Institute for Hepatology"},{"author_name":"Jinxiu Li","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xin Wang","author_inst":"Institute for Hepatology"},{"author_name":"Fuxiang Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shuye Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and Institute of Biomedical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"Institute for Hepatology"},{"author_name":"Youming Xu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yijie Zhu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xi Chen","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Lilei Yu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Honggang Yu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoce Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiuna Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Fang Bai","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Hong Liu","author_inst":"Drug Discovery and Design Center, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiang Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Frontiers Science Center for Cell Response, College of Life Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Luke W.

This study aims to calculate its case fatality rate (CFR). Methods: The method, termed as converged CFR calculation, was based on the formula of dividing the number of known deaths by the number of confirmed cases T days before, where T was an average time period from case confirmation to death. It was found that supposing a T, if it was smaller (bigger) than the true T, calculated CFRs would gradually increase (decrease) to infinitely near the true T with time went on. According to the law, the true T value could be determined by trends of daily CFRs calculated with different assumed T values (left of true T is decreasing, right is increasing). Then the CFR could be calculated. Results: CFR of COVID-19 in China except Hubei Province was 0.8% to 0.9%. So far, the CFR had accurately predicted the death numbers more than 3 weeks. CFR in Hubei of China was 5.4% by which the calculated death number corresponded with the reported number for 2 weeks. Conclusion: The method could be used for CFR calculating while pandemics are still ongoing. Dynamic monitoring of the daily CFRs trends could help outbreak-controller to have a clear vision in the timeliness of the case confirmation.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rui Qi","author_inst":"Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Chao Ye","author_inst":"Shandong Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiang-rong Qin","author_inst":"Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xue-Jie Yu","author_inst":"Wuhan University School of Health Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China."},{"author_name":"Gang Xu","author_inst":"Institute for Hepatology"},{"author_name":"Juanjuan Zhao","author_inst":"Institute for Hepatology"},{"author_name":"Lin Chen","author_inst":"Institute for Hepatology"},{"author_name":"Jinxiu Li","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xin Wang","author_inst":"Institute for Hepatology"},{"author_name":"Fuxiang Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shuye Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and Institute of Biomedical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"Institute for Hepatology"},{"author_name":"Youming Xu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yijie Zhu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xi Chen","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Lilei Yu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Honggang Yu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoce Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiuna Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Fang Bai","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Hong Liu","author_inst":"Drug Discovery and Design Center, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiang Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Frontiers Science Center for Cell Response, College of Life Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Luke W.

We report the laboratory results of conjunctival PCR-tests and some clinical features of these patients in shenyang China. Design: This is a cross-sectional non-randomized study. Subjects: The study include 14 confirmly diagnosed cases, 16 suspected cases and some medical observed patients. Methods: All patients with diagnosed and suspected COVID-19 were admitted to a designated hospital in Shenyang,China. We collected conjunctival samples of these patients to do the laboratory tests by real time RT-PCR.Medical observed patients were enrolled if they had clinical symptoms. Then we analysed the PCR results and clinical data from eletronic medical records in order to find some relationships. Main Outcome Measures: Clinical condition and PCR results of conjunctival swabs compared with other specimens. Results: One of the identified case coverted from suspected case without typical clinical symptoms. Twenty-two medical observed cases were removed because none of them converted to identified cases.One of the suspected converted to identified case recently.The included cases in our study are imported cases with less underlying diseases and the severity of their infection was relatively moderate. All the conjunctival results of PCR-test were negative. Two cases had typical clinical symptoms but were finally confirmed by repeated pharynx swab tests. Conclusion: Conjunctiva may be a transmission way of COVID-19. And ocular conjunctival swabs in combination with PCR test could be a non-invasive,convenient and feasible diagnostic method for identifying the infection of COVID-19. Emphasis on the false-negative results is vital.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"li Xu","author_inst":"Shenyang Fourth People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xinyue Zhang","author_inst":"Shengjing Hospital of Chinese Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wei Song","author_inst":"Shenyang Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Baijun Sun","author_inst":"Shenyang Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jinping Mu","author_inst":"Shenyang Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xue Dong","author_inst":"Shenyang Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Bing Wang","author_inst":"Shenyang Center for Disease Control  and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jinxiu Li","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xin Wang","author_inst":"Institute for Hepatology"},{"author_name":"Fuxiang Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shuye Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and Institute of Biomedical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"Institute for Hepatology"},{"author_name":"Youming Xu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yijie Zhu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xi Chen","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Lilei Yu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Honggang Yu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoce Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiuna Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Fang Bai","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Hong Liu","author_inst":"Drug Discovery and Design Center, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiang Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Frontiers Science Center for Cell Response, College of Life Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Luke W.

DESIGN: Retrospective case series SETTING: Three designated COVID-19 care hospitals of the Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred fourteen hospitalized patients with laboratory confirmed diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome from coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Data were collected from 16 January 2020 to 19 February 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records and reviewed by a trained team of physicians. Neurological symptoms fall into three categories: central nervous system (CNS) symptoms or diseases (headache, dizziness, impaired consciousness, ataxia, acute cerebrovascular disease, and epilepsy), peripheral nervous system (PNS) symptoms (hypogeusia, hyposmia, hypopsia, and neuralgia), and skeletal muscular symptoms. Data of all neurological symptoms were checked by two trained neurologists. RESULTS: Of 214 patients studied, 88 (41.1%) were severe and 126 (58.9%) were non-severe patients. Compared with non-severe patients, severe patients were older (58.7 {+\/-} 15.0 years vs 48.9 {+\/-} 14.7 years), had more underlying disorders (42 [47.7%] vs 41 [32.5%]), especially hypertension (32 [36.4%] vs 19 [15.1%]), and showed less typical symptoms such as fever (40 [45.5%] vs 92 [73%]) and cough (30 [34.1%] vs 77 [61.1%]). Seventy-eight (36.4%) patients had neurologic manifestations. More severe patients were likely to have neurologic symptoms (40 [45.5%] vs 38 [30.2%]), such as acute cerebrovascular diseases (5 [5.7%] vs 1 [0.8%]), impaired consciousness (13 [14.8%] vs 3 [2.4%]) and skeletal muscle injury (17 [19.3%] vs 6 [4.8%]). CONCLUSION: Compared with non-severe patients with COVID-19, severe patients commonly had neurologic symptoms manifested as acute cerebrovascular diseases, consciousness impairment and skeletal muscle symptoms.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ling Mao","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Mengdie Wang","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Shanghai Chen","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology,"},{"author_name":"Quanwei He","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jiang Chang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Key Laboratory for Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of"},{"author_name":"Candong Hong","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yifan Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"David Wang","author_inst":"Barrow Neurological Institute\/Saint Joseph Hospital Medical Center Phoenix"},{"author_name":"Yanan Li","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Huijuan Jin","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Bo Hu","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Shuye Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and Institute of Biomedical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"Institute for Hepatology"},{"author_name":"Youming Xu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yijie Zhu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xi Chen","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Lilei Yu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Honggang Yu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoce Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiuna Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Fang Bai","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Hong Liu","author_inst":"Drug Discovery and Design Center, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiang Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Frontiers Science Center for Cell Response, College of Life Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Luke W.

This paper adopts the method of descriptive statistics. Results: 34 COVID-19-related articles were eligible for this systematic review;Four of the articles were related to pathology. We found that Fever (86.0%), cough (63.9%) and Malaise\/Fatigue (34.7%) were the most common symptoms in COVID-19. But in general, the clinical symptoms and signs of COVID-19 were not obvious. Compared with SARS, COVID-19 was transmitted in a more diverse way. The mortality rates of COVID-19 were 2.5%, and the overall infection rate of healthcare worker of COVID-19 was 3.9%. We also found that the pathological features of COVID-19 have greatly similar with SARS, which manifested as ARDS. But the latest pathological examination of COVID-19 revealed the obvious mucinous secretions in the lungs. Interpretation: The clinical and pathological characteristics of SARS and COVID-19 in China are very similar, but also difference. The latest finds of pathological examination on COVID-19 may upend existing treatment schemes, so the early recognition of disease by healthcare worker is very important.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"mao yaqian","author_inst":"Department of endocrinology, Fujian Provincial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wei Lin","author_inst":"FujianProvincial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Junping Wen","author_inst":"Fujian Provincial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gang Chen","author_inst":"Fujian Provincial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jiang Chang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Key Laboratory for Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of"},{"author_name":"Candong Hong","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yifan Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"David Wang","author_inst":"Barrow Neurological Institute\/Saint Joseph Hospital Medical Center Phoenix"},{"author_name":"Yanan Li","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Huijuan Jin","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Bo Hu","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Shuye Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and Institute of Biomedical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"Institute for Hepatology"},{"author_name":"Youming Xu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yijie Zhu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xi Chen","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Lilei Yu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Honggang Yu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoce Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiuna Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Fang Bai","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Hong Liu","author_inst":"Drug Discovery and Design Center, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiang Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Frontiers Science Center for Cell Response, College of Life Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Luke W.

As of February 13, 2020, a total of 59883 cases of COVID-19 in China have been confirmed and 1368 patients have died from the disease. However, the clinical characteristics of the dyed patients were still not clearly clarified. This study aims to summarize the clinical characteristics of death cases with COVID-19 and to identify critically ill patients of COVID-19 early and reduce their mortality. Methods The clinical records, laboratory findings and radiologic assessments included chest X-ray or computed tomography were extracted from electronic medical records of 25 died patients with COVID-19 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan 14 to Feb 13, 2020. Two experienced clinicians reviewed and abstracted the data. Findings The mean age of the dead was 71.48 years, the average course of the disease was 10.56 days, all patients eventually died of respiratory failure. All of those who died had underlying diseases, the most common of which was hypertension (16\/25, 64%), followed by diabetes (10\/25, 40%), heart diseases (8\/25, 32%), kidney diseases (5\/25, 20%), cerebral infarction (4\/25, 16%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, 2\/25, 8%), malignant tumors (2\/25, 8%) and acute pancreatitis (1\/25, 4%). The most common organ damage outside the lungs was the heart, followed by kidney and liver. In the patients' last examination before death, white blood cell and neutrophil counts were elevated in 17 patients (17\/25, 68%) and 18 patients (18\/25, 72%), lymphocyte counts were decreased in 22 patients (22\/25, 88%). Most patients' PCT, CRP and SAA levels were elevated, the percentages were 90.5% (19\/21), 85% (19\/20) and 100% (21\/21) respectively. The levels of the last test of neutrophils (15\/16, 93.8%), PCT (11\/11, 100%), CRP (11\/13, 84.6%), cTnI (8\/9, 88.9%), D-Dimer (11\/12, 91.6%) and LDH (9\/9, 100%) were increased as compared to the first test, while the levels of lymphocytes were decreased (14\/16, 87.5%). Interpretation The age and underlying diseases (hypertension, diabetes, etc.) were the most important risk factors for death of COVID-19 pneumonia. Bacterial infections may play an important role in promoting the death of patients. Malnutrition was common to severe patients. Multiple organ dysfunction can be observed, the most common organ damage was lung, followed by heart, kidney and liver. The rising of neutrophils, SAA, PCT, CRP, cTnI, D-Dimer and LDH levels can be used as indicators of disease progression, as well as the decline of lymphocytes counts.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xun Li","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Luwen Wang","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Shaonan Yan","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Fan Yang","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Longkui Xiang","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Jiling Zhu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Bo Shen","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zuojiong Gong","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yanan Li","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Huijuan Jin","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Bo Hu","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Shuye Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and Institute of Biomedical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"Institute for Hepatology"},{"author_name":"Youming Xu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yijie Zhu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xi Chen","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Lilei Yu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Honggang Yu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoce Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiuna Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Fang Bai","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Hong Liu","author_inst":"Drug Discovery and Design Center, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiang Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Frontiers Science Center for Cell Response, College of Life Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Luke W.

The clinical presentation of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) infected pneumonia (NCIP) resembles that of other etiologies of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). We aimed to identify clinical laboratory features to distinguish NCIP from CAP. Methods. We compared the ability of the hematological and biochemical features of 84 patients with NCIP at hospital admission and 316 patients with CAP. Parameters independently predictive of NCIP were calculated by multivariate logistic regression. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was measured to evaluate the discriminative ability. Results. Most hematological and biochemical indexes of patients with NCIP were significantly different from patients with CAP. Nine laboratory parameters were identified to be highly predictive of a diagnosis of NCIP by multivariate analysis. The AUCs demonstrated good discriminatory ability for red cell distribution width (RDW) with an AUC of 0.88 and Hemoglobin (HGB) with an AUC of 0.82. Red blood cell (RBC), albumin (ALB), eosinophil (EO), hematocrit (HCT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and white blood cell (WBC) had fair discriminatory ability. Combinations of any two parameters performed better than did the RDW alone. Conclusions. Routine laboratory examinations may be helpful for the diagnosis of NCIP. Application of laboratory tests may help to optimize the use of isolation rooms for patients when they present with unexplained febrile respiratory illnesses.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yunbao Pan","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Guangming Ye","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xiantao Zeng","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Guohong Liu","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaojiao Zeng","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xianghu Jiang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Jin Zhao","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Liangjun Chen","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Shuang Guo","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Qiaoling Deng","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyue Hong","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Ying Yang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yirong Li","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xinghuan Wang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yijie Zhu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xi Chen","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Lilei Yu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Honggang Yu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoce Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiuna Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Fang Bai","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Hong Liu","author_inst":"Drug Discovery and Design Center, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiang Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Frontiers Science Center for Cell Response, College of Life Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Luke W.

Methods We collected the cumulative number of confirmed cases of all cities and regions affected by COVID-19 in the world from January 20 to February 4, 2020, and calculated the daily means of the average, minimum and maximum temperatures in January. Then, restricted cubic spline function and generalized linear mixture model were used to analyze the relationships. Results There were in total 24,232 confirmed cases in China and 26 overseas countries. In total, 16,480 cases (68.01%) were from Hubei Province. The lgN rose as the average temperature went up to a peak of 8.72 and then slowly declined. The apexes of the minimum temperature and the maximum temperature were 6.70 and 12.42 respectively. The curves shared similar shapes. Under the circumstance of lower temperature, every 1 increase in average, minimum and maximum temperatures led to an increase of the cumulative number of cases by 0.83, 0.82 and 0.83 respectively. In the single-factor model of the higher-temperature group, every 1 increase in the minimum temperature led to a decrease of the cumulative number of cases by 0.86. Conclusion The study found that, to certain extent, temperature could significant change COVID-19 transmission, and there might be a best temperature for the viral transmission, which may partly explain why it first broke out in Wuhan. It is suggested that countries and regions with a lower temperature in the world adopt the strictest control measures to prevent future reversal.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mao Wang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Aili Jiang","author_inst":"Deparment of Occupatinal and Environmetal Health, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Lijuan Gong","author_inst":"Deparment of Occupatinal and Environmetal Health, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Lina Luo","author_inst":"Department of health and nurse, Nanfang College of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Wenbin Guo","author_inst":"Department of health and nurse, Nanfang College of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Chuyi Li","author_inst":"Department of health and nurse, Nanfang College of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jing Zheng","author_inst":"Department of health and nurse, Nanfang College of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Chaoyong Li","author_inst":"Department of health and nurse, Nanfang College of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Bixing Yang","author_inst":"Department of health and nurse, Nanfang College of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jietong Zeng","author_inst":"Department of health and nurse, Nanfang College of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Youping Chen","author_inst":"Department of health and nurse, Nanfang College of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Ke Zheng","author_inst":"Department of health and nurse, Nanfang College of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Hongyan Li","author_inst":"Department of health and nurse, Nanfang College of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xinghuan Wang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yijie Zhu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xi Chen","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Lilei Yu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Honggang Yu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoce Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiuna Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Fang Bai","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Hong Liu","author_inst":"Drug Discovery and Design Center, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xiang Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Frontiers Science Center for Cell Response, College of Life Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Luke W.
