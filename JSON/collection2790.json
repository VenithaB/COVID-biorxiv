Structure-based virtual screening efforts, fueled by a growing list of apo and inhibitor-bound SARS-CoV\/CoV-2 Mpro crystal structures, are underway in many labs. However, little is known about the dynamic enzyme mechanism, which is needed to inform both structure-based design and assay development. Here, we apply Biodynamics theory to characterize the structural dynamics of substrate-induced Mpro activation, and explore the implications thereof for efficacious inhibition under non-equilibrium conditions. The catalytic cycle (including tetrahedral intermediate formation and hydrolysis) is governed by concerted dynamic structural rearrangements of domain 3 and the m-shaped loop (residues 132-147) on which Cys145 (comprising the thiolate nucleophile and one-half of the oxyanion hole) and Gly143 reside (comprising the other half of the oxyanion hole). In particular: O_LIDomain 3 undergoes dynamic rigid-body rotations about the domain 2-3 linker, alternately visiting two conformational states (denoted as [Formula]).\nC_LIO_LIThe Gly143-containing crest of the m-shaped loop (denoted as crest B) undergoes up and down translations in concert with the domain 3 rotations (denoted as [Formula], whereas the Cys145-containing crest (denoted as crest A) remains statically in the up position.

Understanding various aspects of SARS-CoV2 biology, virulence and pathogenesis as well as determinants of immune response have become a global research priority. In this study, we performed bioinformatic analyses on SAR-CoV2 protein sequences, trying to unravel biologically important similarities between this newly emerged virus with other RNA viruses. Comparing the proteome of SARS-CoV2 with major positive and negative strand ssRNA viruses showed significant homologies between SARS-CoV2 spike protein with pathogenic paramyxovirus fusion proteins. This  spike-fusion homology was not limited to SARS-CoV2 and it existed for some other pathogenic coronaviruses; nonetheless, SARS-CoV2 spike-fusion homology was orders of magnitude stronger than homologies observed for other known coronaviruses. Moreover, this homology did not seem to be a consequence of general ssRNA virus phylogenetic relations. We also explored potential immunological significance of this spike-fusion homology. Spike protein epitope analysis using experimentally verified data deposited in Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) revealed that the majority of spikes T cell epitopes as well as many B cell and MHC binding epitopes map within the spike-fusion homology region. Overall, our data indicate that there might be a relation between SARS-CoV2 and paramyxoviruses at the level of their surface proteins and this relation could be of crucial immunological importance.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ehsan Ahmadi","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Reza Zabihi","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ramin Hosseinzadeh","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Farshid Noorbakhsh","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.19.197129","rel_title":"Population genetic analysis of Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates reveals a unique phylogenetic cluster","rel_date":"2020-07-20","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.19.197129","rel_abs":"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic originated from Wuhan, China in December 2019 raised an alarming situation all over the globe.

The stronger hACE2 affinity of SARS-CoV-2 has been connected with its higher infectivity. In this work, we study hACE2 complexes with the receptor binding domains (RBDs) of the human SARS-CoV-2 and human SARS-CoV viruses, using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and Computational Protein Design (CPD) with a physics-based energy function. The MD simulations identify charge-modifying substitutions between the CoV-2 and CoV RBDs, which either increase or decrease the hACE2 affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. The combined effect of these mutations is small, and the relative affinity is mainly determined by substitutions at residues in contact with hACE2. Many of these findings are in line and interpret recent experiments. Our CPD calculations redesign positions 455, 493, 494 and 501 of the SARS-CoV-2 RBM, which contact hACE2 in the complex and are important for ACE2 recognition. Sampling is enhanced by an adaptive importance sampling Monte Carlo method. Sequences with increased affinity replace CoV-2 glutamine by a negative residue at position 493, and serine by nonpolar, aromatic or a threonine at position 494. Substitutions at positions positions 455 and 501 have a smaller effect on affinity. Substitutions suggested by our design are seen in viral sequences encountered in other species, including bat and pangolin. Our results might be used to identify potential virus strains with higher human infectivity and assist in the design of peptide-based or peptidomimetic compounds with the potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 binding at hACE2.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEThe coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 and the earlier, closely related SARS-CoV virus bind at the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor at the cell surface. The higher human infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 may be linked to its stronger affinity for hACE2. Here, we study by computational methods complexes of hACE2 with the receptor binding domains (RBDs) of viruses SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We identify residues affecting the affinities of the two domains for hACE2. We also propose mutations at key SARS-CoV-2 positions, which might enhance hACE2 affinity. Such mutations may appear in viral strains with increased human infectivity and might assist the design of peptide-based compounds that inhibit infection of human cells by SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Savvas Polydorides","author_inst":"University of Cyprus"},{"author_name":"Georgios Archontis","author_inst":"University of Cyprus"},{"author_name":"Shah M Faruque","author_inst":"Independent University, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Farshid Noorbakhsh","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"biophysics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.17.20156505","rel_title":"Geographic access to COVID-19 healthcare in Brazil using a balanced float catchment area approach","rel_date":"2020-07-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.17.20156505","rel_abs":"The rapid spread of the new coronavirus across the world has raised concerns about the responsiveness of cities and healthcare systems during pandemics.

This paper shows how transport accessibility analysis can provide actionable information to help improve healthcare coverage and responsiveness. It analyzes accessibility to COVID-19 healthcare at high spatial resolution in the 20 largest cities of Brazil. Using network-distance metrics, we estimate the vulnerable population living in areas with poor access to healthcare facilities that could either screen or hospitalize COVID-19 patients. We then use a new balanced floating catchment area (BFCA) indicator to estimate spatial, income and racial inequalities in access to hospitals with intensive care unit (ICU) beds and mechanical ventilators while taking into account congestion effects. Based on this analysis, we identify substantial social and spatial inequalities in access to health services during the pandemic. The availability of ICU equipment varies considerably between cities and it is substantially lower among black and poor communities. The study maps territorial inequalities in healthcare access and reflects on different policy lessons that can be learned for other countries based on the Brazilian case.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rafael H.

The transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic is still unclear, but developing strategies for mitigating the severity of the pandemic is yet a top priority for global public health. In this study, we developed a novel compartmental model, SEIR-CV(susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed with control variables), which not only considers the key characteristics of asymptomatic infection and the effects of seasonal variations, but also incorporates different control measures for multiple transmission routes, so as to accurately predict and effectively control the spread of COVID-19. Based on SEIR-CV, we predicted the COVID-19 epidemic situation in China out of Hubei province and proposed corresponding control strategies. The results showed that the prediction results are highly consistent with the outbreak surveillance data, which proved that the proposed control strategies have achieved sound consequent in the actual epidemic control. Subsequently, we have conducted a rolling prediction for the United States, Brazil, India, five European countries (the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Germany, and France), southern hemisphere, northern hemisphere, and the world out of China. The results indicate that control measures and seasonal variations have a great impact on the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our prediction results show that the COVID-19 pandemic is developing more rapidly due to the impact of the cold season in the southern hemisphere countries such as Brazil. While the development of the pandemic should have gradually weakened in the northern hemisphere countries with the arrival of the warm season, instead of still developing rapidly due to the relative loose control measures such as the United States and India. Furthermore, the prediction results illustrate that if keeping the current control measures in the main COVID-19 epidemic countries, the pandemic will not be contained and the situation may eventually turn to group immunization, which would lead to the extremely severe disaster of about 5 billion infections and 300 million deaths globally. However, if China's super stringent control measures were implemented from 15 July, 15 August or 15 September 2020, the total infections would be contained about 15 million, 32 million or 370 million respectively, which indicates that the stringent and timely control measures is critical, and the best window period is before September for eventually overcoming COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shunxiang Huang","author_inst":"Institute of NBC Defense of PLA, Beijing 102205, China"},{"author_name":"Lin Wu","author_inst":"Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100029, China"},{"author_name":"Li Xu","author_inst":"Institute of NBC Defense of PLA, Beijing 102205, China"},{"author_name":"Aihong Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of NBC Defense of PLA, Beijing 102205, China"},{"author_name":"Li Sheng","author_inst":"National Meteorological Center, China Meteorological Administration, Beijing 100081, China"},{"author_name":"Feng Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Pure Blue Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing 100085, China"},{"author_name":"Long Zhou","author_inst":"Institute of NBC Defense of PLA, Beijing 102205, China"},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"Institute of NBC Defense of PLA, Beijing 102205, China"},{"author_name":"Rongzhang Hao","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100069, China"},{"author_name":"Hua Qian","author_inst":"school of energy and environment, Southeast University, Nanjing 210096"},{"author_name":"Sheng Fang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China"},{"author_name":"Zhongyi Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing 100071, China."},{"author_name":"Yingru Li","author_inst":"Materials Institute, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Jiangyou, Sichuan 621908, China"},{"author_name":"Yuguo Li","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Chan Lu","author_inst":"XiangYa School of Public Health, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410078, China"},{"author_name":"Qihong Deng","author_inst":"XiangYa School of Public Health, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410078, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.17.20156364","rel_title":"Preparing For the Next Pandemic: Learning Wild Mutational Patterns At Scale For For Analyzing Sequence Divergence In Novel Pathogens","rel_date":"2020-07-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.17.20156364","rel_abs":"As we begin to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, a key question is if we can avert such disasters in future. Current surveillance protocols generally focus on qualitative impact assessments of viral diversity. These efforts are primarliy aimed at ecosystem and human impact monitoring, and do not help to precisely quantify emergence. Currently, the similarity of biological strains is measured by the edit distance or the number of mutations that separate their genomic sequences, e.g. the number of mutations that make an avian flu strain human-adapted. However, ignoring the odds of those mutations in the wild keeps us blind to the true jump risk, and gives us little indication of which strains are more risky. In this study, we develop a more meaningful metric for comparison of genomic sequences. Our metric, the q-distance, precisely quantifies the probability of spontaneous jump by random chance. Learning from patterns of mutations from large sequence databases, the q-distance adapts to the specific organism, the background population, and realistic selection pressures; demonstrably improving inference of ancestral relationships and future trajectories. As important application, we show that the q-distance predicts future strains for seasonal Influenza, outperforming World Health Organization (WHO) recommended flu-shot composition almost consistently over two decades. Such performance is demonstrated separately for Northern and Southern hemisphere for different subtypes, and key capsidic proteins. Additionally, we investigate the SARS-CoV2 origin problem, and precisely quantify the likelihood of different animal species that hosted an immediate progenitor, producing a list of related species of bats that have a quantifiably high likelihood of being the source. Additionally, we identify specific rodents with a credible likelihood of hosting a SARS-CoV2 ancestor.

In a broader sense, BLI-ISA can be developed as a novel diagnostic platform to evaluate antibodies and other biomolecules in clinical specimens.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"John V Dzimianski","author_inst":"University of California Santa Cruz"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Lorig-Roach","author_inst":"University of California Santa Cruz"},{"author_name":"Sara M O'Rourke","author_inst":"University of California Santa Cruz"},{"author_name":"David L Alexander","author_inst":"Ontera Inc."},{"author_name":"Jacqueline M Kimmey","author_inst":"University of California Santa Cruz"},{"author_name":"Rebecca M DuBois","author_inst":"University of California Santa Cruz"},{"author_name":"Long Zhou","author_inst":"Institute of NBC Defense of PLA, Beijing 102205, China"},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"Institute of NBC Defense of PLA, Beijing 102205, China"},{"author_name":"Rongzhang Hao","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100069, China"},{"author_name":"Hua Qian","author_inst":"school of energy and environment, Southeast University, Nanjing 210096"},{"author_name":"Sheng Fang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China"},{"author_name":"Zhongyi Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing 100071, China."},{"author_name":"Yingru Li","author_inst":"Materials Institute, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Jiangyou, Sichuan 621908, China"},{"author_name":"Yuguo Li","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Chan Lu","author_inst":"XiangYa School of Public Health, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410078, China"},{"author_name":"Qihong Deng","author_inst":"XiangYa School of Public Health, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410078, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.17.20156513","rel_title":"Large-scale Multi-omic Analysis of COVID-19 Severity","rel_date":"2020-07-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.17.20156513","rel_abs":"We performed RNA-Seq and high-resolution mass spectrometry on 128 blood samples from COVID-19 positive and negative patients with diverse disease severities.

We mapped 219 molecular features with high significance to COVID-19 status and severity, many involved in complement activation, dysregulated lipid transport, and neutrophil activation. We identified sets of covarying molecules, e.g., protein gelsolin and metabolite citrate or plasmalogens and apolipoproteins, offering pathophysiological insights and therapeutic suggestions. The observed dysregulation of platelet function, blood coagulation, acute phase response, and endotheliopathy further illuminated the unique COVID-19 phenotype. We present a web-based tool (covid-omics.app) enabling interactive exploration of our compendium and illustrate its utility through a comparative analysis with published data and a machine learning approach for prediction of COVID-19 severity.","rel_num_authors":29,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Katherine A Overmyer","author_inst":"Morgridge Institute for Research"},{"author_name":"Evgenia Shishkova","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI USA"},{"author_name":"Ian Miller","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison WI, USA"},{"author_name":"Joseph Balnis","author_inst":"Albany Medical College, Albany NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Matthew N.

However, Bluetooth attenuation is not a reliable measure of distance, and infection risk is not a binary function of distance, nor duration, nor timing. Methods: We model uncertainty in the shape and orientation of an exhaled virus-containing plume and in inhalation parameters, and measure uncertainty in distance as a function of Bluetooth attenuation. We calculate expected dose by combining this with estimated infectiousness based on timing relative to symptom onset. We calibrate an exponential dose-response curve on the basis of the infection probabilities of household contacts. The conditional probability of current or future infectiousness, conditioned on how long post-exposure an exposed individual has been free of symptoms, decreases during quarantine, with shape determined by the distribution of incubation periods, proportion of asymptomatic cases, and distribution of asymptomatic shedding durations. It can be adjusted for negative test results using Bayes Theorem. Findings: We capture a 10-fold range of risk using 6 infectiousness values, 11-fold range using 3 Bluetooth attenuation bins, ~6-fold range from exposure duration given the 30 minute duration cap imposed by the Google\/Apple v1.1, and ~11-fold between the beginning and end of 14 day quarantine. Imposing a consistent risk threshold for the probability of infection can recommend quarantine with weaker Bluetooth signal, even when not recommended for the entirety of the infectious period. Interpretation: The Covid-Watch app is currently programmed either to use a threshold on initial infection risk to determine 14-day quarantine onset, or on the conditional probability of current and future infectiousness conditions to determine both quarantine and duration. Either threshold can be set by public health authorities.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amanda M Wilson","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Nathan Aviles","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"James I Petrie","author_inst":"Covid Watch"},{"author_name":"Paloma I Beamer","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Zsombor Szabo","author_inst":"Covid-Watch"},{"author_name":"Michelle Xie","author_inst":"Covid Watch"},{"author_name":"Janet McIllece","author_inst":"World Wide Technology"},{"author_name":"Yijie Chen","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Young-Jun Son","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Sameer Halai","author_inst":"Covid Watch"},{"author_name":"Tina White","author_inst":"Covid Watch"},{"author_name":"Kacey C Ernst","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Joanna Masel","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Anupama Tiwari","author_inst":"Albany Medical Center, Albany NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Marc A.

We aimed to characterize the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic in Qatar. Methods: A series of epidemiologic studies were conducted including analysis of the national SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing and hospitalization database, community surveys assessing current infection, ad-hoc PCR testing campaigns in workplaces and residential areas, serological testing for antibody on blood specimens collected for routine clinical screening\/management, national Coronavirus Diseases 2019 (COVID-19) death registry, and a mathematical model. Results: By July 10, 397,577 individuals had been PCR tested for SARS-CoV-2, of whom 110,986 were positive, a positivity cumulative rate of 27.9% (95% CI: 27.8-28.1%). PCR positivity of nasopharyngeal swabs in a national community survey (May 6-7) including 1,307 participants was 14.9% (95% CI: 11.5-19.0%); 58.5% of those testing positive were asymptomatic. Across 448 ad-hoc PCR testing campaigns in workplaces and residential areas including 26,715 individuals, pooled mean PCR positivity was 15.6% (95% CI: 13.7-17.7%). SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence was 24.0% (95% CI: 23.3-24.6%) in 32,970 residual clinical blood specimens. Antibody prevalence was only 47.3% (95% CI: 46.2-48.5%) in those who had at least one PCR positive result, but it was 91.3% (95% CI: 89.5-92.9%) among those who were PCR positive >3 weeks before serology testing. There were substantial differences in exposure to infection by nationality and sex, reflecting risk differentials between the craft\/manual workers and urban populations. As of July 5, case severity rate, based on the WHO severity classification, was 3.4% and case fatality rate was 1.4 per 1,000 persons. Model-estimated daily number of infections and active-infection prevalence peaked at 22,630 and 5.7%, respectively, on May 21 and May 23. Attack rate (ever infection) was estimated at 53.5% on July 12. R0 ranged between 1.45-1.68 throughout the epidemic. Rt was estimated at 0.70 on June 15, which was hence set as onset date for easing of restrictions. Age was by far the strongest predictor of severe, critical, or fatal infection. Conclusions: Qatar has experienced a large SARS-CoV-2 epidemic that is rapidly declining, apparently due to exhaustion of susceptibles. The epidemic demonstrated a classic susceptible-infected-recovered 'SIR' dynamics with a rather stable R0 of about 1.6. The young demographic structure of the population, in addition to a resourced public health response, yielded a milder disease burden and lower mortality than elsewhere.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Laith J Abu-Raddad","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar"},{"author_name":"Hiam Chemaitelly","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar"},{"author_name":"Houssein H Ayoub","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Physics, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Zaina Al Kanaani","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Abdullatif Al Khal","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Einas Al Kuwari","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Adeel A Butt","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Peter Coyle","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Andrew Jeremijenko","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Anvar Hassan Kaleeckal","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Ali Nizar Latif","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Robert C Owen","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Hanan F Abdul Rahim","author_inst":"College of Health Sciences, QU Health, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Samya A Al Abdulla","author_inst":"Primary Health Care Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Mohamed G Al Kuwari","author_inst":"Primary Health Care Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Mujeeb C Kandy","author_inst":"Primary Health Care Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Hatoun Saeb","author_inst":"Primary Health Care Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Shazia Nadeem N.

We used the Open Dataset of Mexican patients with COVID-19 suspicion who had a definite RT-PCR result to develop a statistical model that evaluated the progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population. We included patients of all ages with every risk factor provided by the dataset: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, smoking, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, immunodeficiencies, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular diseases, and pregnancy. The dataset also included an unspecified category for other risk factors that were not specified as a single variable. To avoid excluding potential patients at risk, that category was included in our analysis. Due to the nature of the dataset, the calculation of a standardized comorbidity index was not possible. Therefore, we treated risk factors as a categorical variable with two categories: absence of risk factors and the presence of at least one risk factor in accordance with previous epidemiological reports. Multiple logistic regressions were carried out to associate sex, risk factors, and age as a continuous variable (and the interaction that accounted for increasing diseases with older ages); and SARS-CoV-2 infection as the dependent zero-one binomial variable. Post estimation predictive marginal analysis was performed to generate probability trends along 95% confidence bands. This analysis was repeated several times through the course of the pandemic since the first record provided in their repository (April 12, 2020) to one month after the end of the state of sanitary emergency (the last date analyzed: June 27, 2020). After processing, the last measurement included 464,389 patients. The baseline analysis on April 12 revealed that people 35 years and older with at least one risk factor had a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in comparison to patients without risk factors (Figure 1). One month before the end of the nationwide state of emergency this age threshold was found at 50 years (May 2, 2020) and it shifted to 65 years on May 30. Two weeks after the end of the public emergency (June 13, 2020) the trends converged at 80 years and one week later (June 27, 2020) every male and female patient with at least one risk factor had a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to people without risk factors. Through the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, all four probability curves shifted upwards as a result of progressive disease spread. In conclusion, we found our model could monitor accurately the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection in relation to age, sex, and the presence of at least one risk factor. Also, because the model can be applied to any particular political region within Mexico, it could help evaluate the contagion spread in specific vulnerable populations. Further studies are needed to determine the underlying nature of the mechanisms behind such observations.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Juan Alonso Leon-Abarca","author_inst":"Instituto de Investigaciones de la Altura - Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia"},{"author_name":"Esdras Ismael Musayon","author_inst":"Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Instituto de Investigaciones de la Altura"},{"author_name":"Houssein H Ayoub","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Physics, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Zaina Al Kanaani","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Abdullatif Al Khal","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Einas Al Kuwari","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Adeel A Butt","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Peter Coyle","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Andrew Jeremijenko","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Anvar Hassan Kaleeckal","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Ali Nizar Latif","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Robert C Owen","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Hanan F Abdul Rahim","author_inst":"College of Health Sciences, QU Health, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Samya A Al Abdulla","author_inst":"Primary Health Care Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Mohamed G Al Kuwari","author_inst":"Primary Health Care Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Mujeeb C Kandy","author_inst":"Primary Health Care Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Hatoun Saeb","author_inst":"Primary Health Care Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Shazia Nadeem N.

Design and setting: Cross sectional study involving secondary analysis of publicly available data from a global online COVID-19 survey and the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. Participants: 106,497 participants from 58 countries. Main outcome measures: Outcomes were a worries index and a depression index. Predictors were stringency of policies, trust in government, and gender. Multivariable regression was conducted to determine the three-way interaction between the predictor variables for mental health outcomes, adjusting for age, income and education. Results: The median age of participants (56.4% women) was 37 years (interquartile range 29 to 48 years). Women had higher worries and depression scores than men. 45.4% distrusted the government and 43.8% trusted the government to take care of its citizens. Among those who strongly trusted the government, an increase in the stringency of policies was associated with a significant increase in the worries index. Among men who distrusted the government, an increase in policy stringency was associated with an increase in the depression index but not the worries index. In women that strongly distrusted the government, there was an inversed U-shaped association between policy stringency and both the worries and depression indices. Conclusion: As the stringency of public health measures increases, so too do depression and worries. The association is moderated by gender and trust in government. For safe and effective public health measures, governments should develop strategies to increase trust in their actions.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lily O'Hara","author_inst":"Qatar University"},{"author_name":"Hanan F Abdul Rahim","author_inst":"Qatar University"},{"author_name":"Zumin Shi","author_inst":"Qatar University"},{"author_name":"Zaina Al Kanaani","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Abdullatif Al Khal","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Einas Al Kuwari","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Adeel A Butt","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Peter Coyle","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Andrew Jeremijenko","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Anvar Hassan Kaleeckal","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Ali Nizar Latif","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Robert C Owen","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Hanan F Abdul Rahim","author_inst":"College of Health Sciences, QU Health, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Samya A Al Abdulla","author_inst":"Primary Health Care Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Mohamed G Al Kuwari","author_inst":"Primary Health Care Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Mujeeb C Kandy","author_inst":"Primary Health Care Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Hatoun Saeb","author_inst":"Primary Health Care Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Shazia Nadeem N.

Early evidence has suggested that IL-6R blockers may confer benefit, particularly in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). We leveraged large-scale human genetic data to investigate whether IL6-R blockade may confer therapeutic benefit in Covid-19. A genetic instrument consisting of seven genetic variants in or close to IL6R was recently shown to be linked to altered levels of c-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, circulating IL-6 and soluble IL-6R, concordant to known effects of pharmacological IL-6R blockade. We investigated the effect of these IL6R variants on risk of hospitalization for Covid-19 and other SARS-CoV-2-related outcomes using data from The Covid-19 Host Genetics Initiative. The IL6R variants were strongly associated with serum CRP levels in UK Biobank. Meta-analysis of scaled estimates revealed a lower risk of rheumatoid arthritis (OR 0.93 per 0.1 SD lower CRP, 95% CI, 0.90-0.96, P = 9.5 x 10-7), recapitulating this established indication for IL-6R blockers (e.g. tocilizumab and sarilumab). The IL-6R instrument was associated with lower risk of hospitalization for Covid-19 (OR 0.88 per 0.1 SD lower CRP, 95% CI, 0.78-0.99, P = 0.03). We found a consistent association when using a population-based control group (i.e. all non-cases; OR 0.91 per 0.1 SD lower CRP, 95% CI, 0.87-0.96, P = 4.9 x 10-4). Evaluation of further SARS-CoV-2-related outcomes suggested association with risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with no evidence of association with Covid-19 complicated by death or requiring respiratory support. We performed several sensitivity analyses to evaluate the robustness of our findings. Our results serve as genetic evidence for the potential efficacy of IL-6R blockade in Covid-19. Ongoing large-scale RCTs of IL-6R blockers will be instrumental in identifying the settings, including stage of disease, in which these agents may be effective.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jonas Bovijn","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Cecilia M.

Excessive complement and IFN-{gamma}-associated responses are known drivers of immunopathogenesis3 and are among the most highly induced immune programs in hyper-inflammatory SARS-CoV2 lung infection4. The molecular mechanisms that govern orderly shutdown and retraction of these responses remain poorly understood. Here, we show that complement triggers contraction of IFN-{gamma} producing CD4+ T helper (Th) 1 cell responses by inducing expression of the vitamin D (VitD) receptor (VDR) and CYP27B1, the enzyme that activates VitD, permitting T cells to both activate and respond to VitD. VitD then initiates the transition from pro-inflammatory IFN-{gamma}+ Th1 cells to suppressive IL-10+ Th1 cells. This process is primed by dynamic changes in the epigenetic landscape of CD4+ T cells, generating superenhancers and recruiting c-JUN and BACH2, a key immunoregulatory transcription factor5-7. Accordingly, cells in psoriatic skin treated with VitD increased BACH2 expression, and BACH2 haplo-insufficient CD4+ T cells were defective in IL-10 production. As proof-of-concept, we show that CD4+ T cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of patients with COVID-19 are Th1-skewed and that VDR is among the top regulators of genes induced by SARS-CoV2. Importantly, genes normally down-regulated by VitD were de-repressed in CD4+ BALF T cells of COVID-19, indicating that the VitD-driven shutdown program is impaired in this setting. The active metabolite of VitD, alfacalcidol, and cortico-steroids were among the top predicted pharmaceuticals that could normalize SARS-CoV2 induced genes. These data indicate that adjunct therapy with VitD in the context of other immunomodulatory drugs may be a beneficial strategy to dampen hyperinflammation in severe COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Reuben McGregor","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIDDK); University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Daniel Chauss","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIDDK)"},{"author_name":"Tilo Freiwald","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIDDK)"},{"author_name":"Bingyu Yan","author_inst":"Purdue University"},{"author_name":"Luopin Wang","author_inst":"Purdue University"},{"author_name":"Estefania Nova-Lamperti","author_inst":"University of Concepcion"},{"author_name":"Zonghao Zhang","author_inst":"Purdue University"},{"author_name":"Heather Teague","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NHLBI)"},{"author_name":"Erin West","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NHLBI)"},{"author_name":"Jack Bibby","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NHLBI)"},{"author_name":"Amna Malik","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Freeman","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIAID)"},{"author_name":"Daniella Schwartz","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIAID)"},{"author_name":"Didier Portilla","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIDDK); University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Michail S Lionakis","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIAID)"},{"author_name":"Nehal N Mehta","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NHLBI)"},{"author_name":"Claudia Kemper","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NHLBI)"},{"author_name":"Nichola Cooper","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Arian Laurence","author_inst":"Oxford University"},{"author_name":"Majid Kazemian","author_inst":"Purdue University"},{"author_name":"Ben Afzali","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIDDK)"},{"author_name":"Jesse C Martinez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Colin Chuba","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Earley","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Oscar Rodriguez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Davis Mdaki","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Katrina Kavelish","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Renee Escalona","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Cory Hallam","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Corbett Christie","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jean Patterson","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Tim Anderson","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical research institute"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Carrion Jr.","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Edward Dick Jr.","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Shannan Hall-Ursone","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Larry S Schlesinger","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Deepak Kaushal","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis D Giavedoni","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Xavier Alvarez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Joanne Turner","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis Martinez-Sobrido","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jordi B Torrelles","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc0","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.15.20154286","rel_title":"A privacy-preserving Bayesian network model for personalised COVID19 risk assessment and contact tracing","rel_date":"2020-07-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.15.20154286","rel_abs":"Concerns about the practicality and effectiveness of using Contact Tracing Apps (CTA) to reduce the spread of COVID19 have been well documented and, in the UK, led to the abandonment of the NHS CTA shortly after its release in May 2020.

We present a causal probabilistic model (a Bayesian network) that provides the basis for a practical CTA solution that does not compromise privacy. Users of the model can provide as much or little personal information as they wish about relevant risk factors, symptoms, and recent social interactions. The model then provides them feedback about the likelihood of the presence of asymptotic, mild or severe COVID19 (past, present and projected). When the model is embedded in a smartphone app, it can be used to detect new outbreaks in a monitored population and identify outbreak locations as early as possible. For this purpose, the only data needed to be centrally collected is the probability the user has COVID19 and the GPS location.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Norman Fenton","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Scott McLachlan","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Peter Lucas","author_inst":"University of Twente, Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Kudakwashe Dube","author_inst":"Massey University, New Zealand"},{"author_name":"Graham Hitman","author_inst":"Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Magda Osman","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Evangelia Kyrimi","author_inst":"Queen Mary University"},{"author_name":"Martin Neil","author_inst":"Queen Mary, University of London and Agena Ltd"},{"author_name":"Erin West","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NHLBI)"},{"author_name":"Jack Bibby","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NHLBI)"},{"author_name":"Amna Malik","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Freeman","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIAID)"},{"author_name":"Daniella Schwartz","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIAID)"},{"author_name":"Didier Portilla","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIDDK); University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Michail S Lionakis","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIAID)"},{"author_name":"Nehal N Mehta","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NHLBI)"},{"author_name":"Claudia Kemper","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NHLBI)"},{"author_name":"Nichola Cooper","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Arian Laurence","author_inst":"Oxford University"},{"author_name":"Majid Kazemian","author_inst":"Purdue University"},{"author_name":"Ben Afzali","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIDDK)"},{"author_name":"Jesse C Martinez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Colin Chuba","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Earley","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Oscar Rodriguez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Davis Mdaki","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Katrina Kavelish","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Renee Escalona","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Cory Hallam","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Corbett Christie","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jean Patterson","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Tim Anderson","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical research institute"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Carrion Jr.","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Edward Dick Jr.","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Shannan Hall-Ursone","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Larry S Schlesinger","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Deepak Kaushal","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis D Giavedoni","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Xavier Alvarez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Joanne Turner","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis Martinez-Sobrido","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jordi B Torrelles","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.16.20155747","rel_title":"Barriers to online learning in the time of COVID-19: A national survey of medical students in the Philippines","rel_date":"2020-07-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.16.20155747","rel_abs":"INTRODUCTION In March 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic forced medical schools in the Philippines to stop face-to-face learning activities and abruptly shift to an online curriculum. This study aimed to identify barriers to online learning from the perspective of medical students in a developing country. METHODS The authors sent out an electronic survey to medical students in the Philippines from 11 to 24 May 2020. Using a combination of multiple choice, Likert scale, and open-ended questions, the following data were obtained: demographics, medical school information, access to technological resources, study habits, living conditions, self-assessment of capacity for and perceived barriers to online learning, and proposed interventions. Descriptive statistics were calculated. Responses were compared between student subgroups using nonparametric tests. RESULTS Among 3,670 medical students, 3,421 (93%) owned a smartphone and 3,043 (83%) had a laptop or desktop computer. To access online resources, 2,916 (79%) had a postpaid internet subscription while 696 (19%) used prepaid mobile data. Under prevailing conditions, only 1,505 students (41%) considered themselves physically and mentally capable of engaging in online learning. Barriers were classified under five categories: technological, individual, domestic, institutional, and community barriers. Most frequently encountered were difficulty adjusting learning styles, having to perform responsibilities at home, and poor communication between educators and learners. DISCUSSION Medical students in the Philippines confronted several interrelated barriers as they tried to adapt to online learning. By implementing student-centered interventions, medical schools and educators play a significant role in addressing these challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ronnie E Baticulon","author_inst":"Department of Anatomy, University of the Philippines College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nicole Rose I Alberto","author_inst":"University of the Philippines College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Maria Beatriz C Baron","author_inst":"University of the Philippines College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Robert Earl C Mabulay","author_inst":"University of the Philippines College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lloyd Gabriel T Rizada","author_inst":"University of the Philippines College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jinno Jenkin Sy","author_inst":"University of the Philippines College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christl Jan S Tiu","author_inst":"University of the Philippines College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Charlie A Clarion","author_inst":"Section of Pulmonary Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Philippine General Hospital"},{"author_name":"John Carlo B Reyes","author_inst":"Department of Parasitology, University of the Philippines College of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Jack Bibby","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NHLBI)"},{"author_name":"Amna Malik","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Freeman","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIAID)"},{"author_name":"Daniella Schwartz","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIAID)"},{"author_name":"Didier Portilla","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIDDK); University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Michail S Lionakis","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIAID)"},{"author_name":"Nehal N Mehta","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NHLBI)"},{"author_name":"Claudia Kemper","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NHLBI)"},{"author_name":"Nichola Cooper","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Arian Laurence","author_inst":"Oxford University"},{"author_name":"Majid Kazemian","author_inst":"Purdue University"},{"author_name":"Ben Afzali","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIDDK)"},{"author_name":"Jesse C Martinez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Colin Chuba","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Earley","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Oscar Rodriguez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Davis Mdaki","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Katrina Kavelish","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Renee Escalona","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Cory Hallam","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Corbett Christie","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jean Patterson","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Tim Anderson","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical research institute"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Carrion Jr.","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Edward Dick Jr.","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Shannan Hall-Ursone","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Larry S Schlesinger","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Deepak Kaushal","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis D Giavedoni","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Xavier Alvarez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Joanne Turner","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis Martinez-Sobrido","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jordi B Torrelles","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"medical education"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.17.20155994","rel_title":"Effect of corticosteroid treatment on 1376 hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

The available evidence is uncertain, and knowledge on the subject is evolving. The aim of our cohort study was to evaluate the association between corticosteroid therapy and hospital mortality, in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 after balancing for possible confounders. Results: One thousand four hundred forty four patients were admitted to our hospital with a positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, 559 patients (39%) were exposed to corticosteroids during hospital stay, 844 (61%) were not exposed to corticosteroids.In the cohort of patients exposed to corticosteroids, 171 (30.6%) died. In the cohort of patients not exposed to corticosteroids, 183 (21.7%) died (unadjusted p <0.001). Nonetheless, exposure to corticosteroids was not associated with in-hospital mortality after balancing with overlap weight propensity score (adjusted p = 0.25). Patients in the corticosteroids cohort had reduced risk of ICU admission (adjusted p <0.001). Conclusions: Treatment with corticosteroids did not affect hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 after balancing for confounders. A possible advantage of corticosteroid therapy was to reduce Intensive Care Unit admission, which could be useful in reducing pressure on the Intensive Care Units in times of limited resources, as during the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Filippo Albani","author_inst":"Fondazione Poliambulanza"},{"author_name":"Federica Fusina","author_inst":"Fondazione Poliambulanza"},{"author_name":"Enza Granato","author_inst":"Fondazione Poliambulanza"},{"author_name":"Cristina Capotosto","author_inst":"Fondazione Poliambulanza"},{"author_name":"Claudia Ceracchi","author_inst":"Fondazione Poliambulanza"},{"author_name":"Riccardo Gargaruti","author_inst":"Fondazione Poliambulanza"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Santangelo","author_inst":"Fondazione Poliambulanza"},{"author_name":"Luca Schiavone","author_inst":"Fondazione Poliambulanza"},{"author_name":"Maria Salvatrice Taranto","author_inst":"Fondazione Poliambulanza"},{"author_name":"Cinzia Tosati","author_inst":"Fondazione Poliambulanza"},{"author_name":"Elena Vavassori","author_inst":"Fondazione Poliambulanza"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Natalini","author_inst":"Fondazione Poliambulanza"},{"author_name":"Daniella Schwartz","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIAID)"},{"author_name":"Didier Portilla","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIDDK); University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Michail S Lionakis","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIAID)"},{"author_name":"Nehal N Mehta","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NHLBI)"},{"author_name":"Claudia Kemper","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NHLBI)"},{"author_name":"Nichola Cooper","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Arian Laurence","author_inst":"Oxford University"},{"author_name":"Majid Kazemian","author_inst":"Purdue University"},{"author_name":"Ben Afzali","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIDDK)"},{"author_name":"Jesse C Martinez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Colin Chuba","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Earley","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Oscar Rodriguez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Davis Mdaki","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Katrina Kavelish","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Renee Escalona","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Cory Hallam","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Corbett Christie","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jean Patterson","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Tim Anderson","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical research institute"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Carrion Jr.","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Edward Dick Jr.","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Shannan Hall-Ursone","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Larry S Schlesinger","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Deepak Kaushal","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis D Giavedoni","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Xavier Alvarez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Joanne Turner","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis Martinez-Sobrido","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jordi B Torrelles","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.16.20155796","rel_title":"Validation of a new automated chemiluminescent anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibody assay system detecting both N and S proteins in Japan","rel_date":"2020-07-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.16.20155796","rel_abs":"PCR methods are presently the standard for the diagnosis of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but additional methodologies are needed to complement PCR methods, which have some limitations. Here, we validated and investigated the usefulness of measuring serum antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using the iFlash3000 CLIA analyzer. We measured IgM and IgG titers against SARS-CoV-2 in sera collected from 26 PCR-positive COVID-19 patients, 53 COVID-19-suspected but PCR-negative patients, and 20 and 100 randomly selected non-COVID-19 patients who visited our hospital in 2020 and 2017, respectively. The within-day and between-day precisions were regarded as good, since the coefficient variations were below 5%. Linearity was also considered good between 0.6 AU\/mL and 112.7 AU\/mL for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and between 3.2 AU\/mL and 55.3 AU\/mL for SARS-CoV-2 IgG, while the linearity curves plateaued above the upper measurement range. We also confirmed that the seroconversion and no-antibody titers were over the cutoff values in all 100 serum samples collected in 2017. These results indicate that this measurement system successfully detects SARS-CoV-2 IgM\/IgG. We observed four false-positive cases in the IgM assay and no false-positive cases in the IgG assay when 111 serum samples known to contain autoantibodies were evaluated. The concordance rates of the antibody test with the PCR test were 98.1% for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and 100% for IgG among PCR-negative cases and 30.8% for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and 73.1% for SARS-CoV-2 IgG among PCR-positive cases. In conclusion, the performance of this measurement system is sufficient for use in laboratory testing.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"RIn Yokoyama","author_inst":"The University of Tokyo Hospital"},{"author_name":"Makoto Kurano","author_inst":"The University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Yoshifumi Morita","author_inst":"the University of Tokyo Hospital"},{"author_name":"Takuya Shimura","author_inst":"the University of Tokyo Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuki Nakano","author_inst":"the University of Tokyo Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chungen Qian","author_inst":"Huazhong Universityof Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Fuzhen Xia","author_inst":"Reagent R&D Center, Shenzhen YHLO Biotech Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Fan He","author_inst":"ShenzhenYHLO Biotech Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Yoshihiro Kishi","author_inst":"Medical & Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Jun Okada","author_inst":"Medical & Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Naoyuki Yoshikawa","author_inst":"the University of Tokyo Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yutaka Nagura","author_inst":"the University of Tokyo Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hitoshi Okazaki","author_inst":"the University of Tokyo Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kyoji Moriya","author_inst":"the University of Tokyo Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yasuyuki Seto","author_inst":"the University of Tokyo Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tatsuhiko Kodama","author_inst":"Laboratory for Systems Biology and Medicine, The University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Yutaka Yatomi","author_inst":"the University of Tokyo Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nichola Cooper","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Arian Laurence","author_inst":"Oxford University"},{"author_name":"Majid Kazemian","author_inst":"Purdue University"},{"author_name":"Ben Afzali","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIDDK)"},{"author_name":"Jesse C Martinez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Colin Chuba","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Earley","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Oscar Rodriguez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Davis Mdaki","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Katrina Kavelish","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Renee Escalona","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Cory Hallam","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Corbett Christie","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jean Patterson","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Tim Anderson","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical research institute"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Carrion Jr.","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Edward Dick Jr.","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Shannan Hall-Ursone","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Larry S Schlesinger","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Deepak Kaushal","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis D Giavedoni","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Xavier Alvarez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Joanne Turner","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis Martinez-Sobrido","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jordi B Torrelles","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.16.20155853","rel_title":"SARS-Cov-2 cysteine-like protease (Mpro) is immunogenic and can be detected in serum and saliva of COVID-19-seropositive individuals","rel_date":"2020-07-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.16.20155853","rel_abs":"Currently, there is a need for reliable tests that allow identification of individuals that have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 even if the infection was asymptomatic. To date, the vast majority of the serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies are based on serum detection of antibodies to either the viral spike glycoprotein (the major target for neutralising antibodies) or the viral nucleocapsid protein that are known to be highly immunogenic in other coronaviruses. Conceivably, exposure of antigens released from infected cells could stimulate antibody responses that might correlate with tissue damage and, hence, they may have some value as a prognostic indicator. We addressed whether other non-structural viral proteins, not incorporated into the infectious viral particle, specifically the viral cysteine-like protease, might also be potent immunogens. Using ELISA tests, coating several SARS-CoV-2 proteins produced in vitro, we describe that COVID-19 patients make high titre IgG, IgM and IgA antibody responses to the Cys-like protease from SARS-CoV-2, also known as 3CLpro or Mpro, and it can be used to identify individuals with positive serology against the coronavirus. Higher antibody titres in these assays associated with more severe disease and no cross-reactive antibodies against prior betacoronavirus were found. Remarkably, IgG antibodies specific for Mpro and other SARS-CoV-2 antigens can also be detected in saliva. In conclusion, Mpro is a potent antigen in infected patients that can be used in serological tests and its detection in saliva could be the basis for a rapid, non-invasive test for COVID-19 seropositivity.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pedro Martinez-Fleta","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario La Princesa IIS-IP"},{"author_name":"Arantzazu Alfranca","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario La Princesa IIS-IP"},{"author_name":"Isidoro Gonz\u00e1lez-\u00c1lvaro","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario La Princesa IIS-IP"},{"author_name":"Jos\u00e9 M Casasnovas","author_inst":"National Centre for Biotechnology, CNB-CSIC"},{"author_name":"Daniel Fern\u00e1ndez Soto","author_inst":"National Centre for Biotechnology, CNB-CSIC"},{"author_name":"Gloria Esteso","author_inst":"National Centre for Biotechnology, CNB-CSIC"},{"author_name":"Yaiza C\u00e1ceres-Martell","author_inst":"National Centre for Biotechnology, CNB-CSIC"},{"author_name":"Sof\u00eda Gardeta","author_inst":"National Centre for Biotechnology, CNB-CSIC"},{"author_name":"Salom\u00e9 Prat","author_inst":"National Centre for Biotechnology, CNB-CSIC"},{"author_name":"Tamara Mateu-Alberoa","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario La Princesa IIS-IP"},{"author_name":"Ligia Gabrie","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario La Princesa IIS-IP"},{"author_name":"Eduardo L\u00f3pez-Granados","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario La Paz"},{"author_name":"Francisco S\u00e1nchez-Madrid","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario La Princesa IIS-IP"},{"author_name":"Jos\u00e9 M Rodr\u00edguez-Frade","author_inst":"National Centre for Biotechnology, CNB-CSIC"},{"author_name":"Hugh T Reyburn","author_inst":"National Centre for Biotechnology, CNB-CSIC"},{"author_name":"Mar Val\u00e9s-G\u00f3mez","author_inst":"National Centre for Biotechnology, CNB-CSIC"},{"author_name":"Yutaka Yatomi","author_inst":"the University of Tokyo Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nichola Cooper","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Arian Laurence","author_inst":"Oxford University"},{"author_name":"Majid Kazemian","author_inst":"Purdue University"},{"author_name":"Ben Afzali","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health (NIDDK)"},{"author_name":"Jesse C Martinez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Colin Chuba","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Earley","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Oscar Rodriguez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Davis Mdaki","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Katrina Kavelish","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Renee Escalona","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Cory Hallam","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Corbett Christie","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jean Patterson","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Tim Anderson","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical research institute"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Carrion Jr.","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Edward Dick Jr.","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Shannan Hall-Ursone","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Larry S Schlesinger","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Deepak Kaushal","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis D Giavedoni","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Xavier Alvarez","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Joanne Turner","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Luis Martinez-Sobrido","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jordi B Torrelles","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"}]}
