The WHO has also accepted that the pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus is going to last longer, and suggested that one needs to learn to live with this virus. Accepting this bitter truth that this pandemic is going to be a new normal and people of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus; however, older people and those with chronic diseases are more vulnerable to the virus. The study tries to access the household with at least one patient with few selected chronic diseases in India, which are presumed to be at a higher risk of losing at least one individual if this pandemic scenario is going to last long and spread is wider. The study used nationally representative data (NSSO) for information on morbidity and other health-related issues. Data from the official website of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare dedicated to COVID-19 reports have been used to look into the recent happenings caused by COVID-19 pandemic in India. Bivariate analysis has been used to calculate household at risk, and binary logistic regression has been used for the likelihood of household at risk. The case-fatality ratio is calculated using the number of confirmed cases and the number deceased due to the same. The study found that about 9.4% of Indian households are at a higher risk of losing at least one individual. Older people (60+), males and households with better economic status are at a higher risk. The chronic condition varies by states and social-economic and demographic status. The share of households at higher risk was highest in Kerala (33.19%), followed by Andhra Pradesh (19.85%) and Chandigarh (19.05%).","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rajeev Ranjan Singh","author_inst":"International Institute for Population Sciences"},{"author_name":"Palak Sharma","author_inst":"International Institute for Population Sciences"},{"author_name":"Priya Maurya","author_inst":"International Institute for Population Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.06.20124487","rel_title":"Are women leaders significantly better at controlling the contagion?","rel_date":"2020-06-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.06.20124487","rel_abs":"Recent media articles have suggested that women-led countries are doing better in terms of their responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The aims of this study were to quantify changes to sleep\/wake behavior and exercise patterns (e.g., exercise frequency, modality, and intensity), and the subsequent impact on physiological markers of health (e.g., total sleep duration, social jet lag, resting heart rate, and heart rate variability) with the introduction of physical distancing mandates and recommendations. A retrospective analysis of 50,000 subscribers to the WHOOP platform (mean age = 36.6 {+\/-} 10.5; 11,956 females, 38,044 males) was conducted covering the period from January 1st, 2020 through May 15th, 2020. In order to make robust comparisons, this time period was separated into a 68 day baseline period and a 67 day physical distancing period - with a total of 6.3 million sleeps and 4.9 million exercise sessions analyzed. As compared to baseline, during physical distancing, all subjects analyzed in this study dedicated more time to sleep (+0.21 hours), fell asleep earlier (-0.43 hours), woke up earlier (-0.29 hours), obtained more sleep (+0.19 hours) and reduced social jet lag (-0.23 hours). Subjects also increased exercise frequency by an average of 1.1% and increased exercise intensity by spending an average of 1.8% more time in the three highest heart rate zones. These changes to sleep and exercise behavior may have contributed to the observed lowered resting heart rate (-0.9 beats per minute) and increased heart rate variability (+1.3 milliseconds) during physical distancing. A potential explanation for these results is that decreases in business hours-based commitments during physical distancing may have resulted in increased opportunity to engage in exercise and prioritize sleep. Therefore, as the COVID-19 pandemic eases, maintenance of certain aspects of physical distancing (e.g., flexibility to work from home) may result in a healthier population.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emily R Capodilupo","author_inst":"Whoop, Inc., Department of Data Science and Research"},{"author_name":"Dean J Miller","author_inst":"CQUniversity"},{"author_name":"Bhramar Mukherjee","author_inst":"University of Michigan"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.08.20125195","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 in first trimester pregnancy - does it affect the fetus?","rel_date":"2020-06-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.08.20125195","rel_abs":"Background Several viral infections are known to be harmful to the fetus in the first trimester of pregnancy and can cause increased nuchal translucency thickness and pregnancy loss. Currently, no evidence exists regarding possible effects of SARS-CoV-2 in first trimester pregnancies. Methods Cohort 1 included pregnant women with a double test taken between Feb. 17 and Apr. 23, 2020, during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic peak in Denmark. The double test was taken as part of the first trimester risk assessment. Cohort 2 included women with a first trimester pregnancy loss before double test. Serum from the double test or from a blood sample, in case of pregnancy loss, was analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The results were correlated to the nuchal translucency thickness and the number of pregnancy losses. Results In total, 1,019 pregnant women with double test and 36 women with pregnancy loss participated in the study. Thirty (2.9%) women had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the serum from the double test. All women with pregnancy loss prior to the double test were negative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. There were no significant differences in nuchal translucency thickness for women testing positive (n=14) versus negative (p=0.20) or grey zone (n=16) versus negative (p=0.28). In total, 54 women experienced a pregnancy loss of whom two had grey zone or positive SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Conclusion Maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection did not seem harmful in first trimester pregnancies. Infection had no effect on the nuchal translucency thickness and women with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were not overrepresented among women with pregnancy loss.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nina la Cour Freiesleben","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The Fertility Clinic, Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre, Denmark and Institute of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of "},{"author_name":"Pia Egerup","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Kathrine Vauvert Rommelmayer Hviid","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Elin Rosenbek Severinsen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Astrid Marie Kolte","author_inst":"The Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Unit, The Capital Region, Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark and  Institute of Clinical Medicine, F"},{"author_name":"David Westergaard","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre, Denmark and Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research, University o"},{"author_name":"Line Fich Olsen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Lisbeth Praetorius","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The Fertility Clinic, Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Anne Zedeler","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The Fertility Clinic, Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Ann-Marie Hellerung Christiansen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Josefine Reinhardt Nielsen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Didi Bang","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre, Denmark."},{"author_name":"Sine Berntsen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The Fertility Clinic, Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Joaquim Olle-Lopez","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Cop"},{"author_name":"Andreas Ingham","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Cop"},{"author_name":"Judith Bello-Rodriuez","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Cop"},{"author_name":"Ditte Marie Storm","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Cop"},{"author_name":"Jeppe Ethelberg-Findsen","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Cop"},{"author_name":"Eva R Hoffmann","author_inst":"DNRF Center for Chromosome Stability (CCS), Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Cop"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Wilken-Jensen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Finn Stener Jorgensen","author_inst":"Fetal Med.

Key questions are the duration and determinants of infectious virus shedding. We assessed these questions using virus cultures of respiratory tract samples from hospitalized COVID-19 patients as a proxy for infectious virus shedding. Methods Clinical and virological data were obtained from 129 hospitalized COVID-19 patients (89 intensive care, 40 medium care). Generalized estimating equations were used to identify if viral RNA load, detection of viral subgenomic RNA, serum neutralizing antibody response, duration of symptoms, or immunocompromised status were predictive for a positive virus culture. Findings Infectious virus shedding was detected in 23 of the 129 patients (17,8%). The median duration of shedding was 8 days post onset of symptoms (IQR 5-11) and the probability of detecting infectious virus dropped below 5% after 15,2 days post onset of symptoms (95% confidence interval (CI) 13,4-17,2). Multivariate analyses identified viral loads above 7 log10 RNA copies\/mL (odds ratio [OR]; CI 14,7 (3,57-58,1; p<0,001) as independently associated with isolation of infectious SARS-CoV-2 from the respiratory tract. A serum neutralizing antibody titre of at least 1:20 (OR of 0,01 (CI 0,003-0,08; p<0,001) was independently associated with non-infectious SARS-CoV-2. Interpretation Infection prevention and control guidelines should take into account that patients with severe or critical COVID-19 may shed infectious virus for longer periods of time compared to what has been reported for in patients with mild COVID-19. Infectious virus shedding drops to undetectable levels below a viral RNA load threshold and once serum neutralizing antibodies are present, which warrants the use of quantitative viral RNA load assays and serological assays in test-based strategies to discontinue or de-escalate infection prevention and control precautions.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jeroen J.A. van Kampen","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"David A.M.C. van de Vijver","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Pieter L.A.

Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the survival of patients admitted to Brazilian hospitals due to the COVID-19 and estimate prognostic factors. This is a retrospective, multicenter cohort study, based on data from 46285 hospitalizations for COVID-19 in Brazil. Survival functions were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The Log-rank test compared the survival functions for each variable and from that, hazard ratios were calculated and the proportional hazards model was used in Cox multiple regression. The smallest survival curves were the ones for patients at the age of 68 years or more, black \/ brown race, illiterate, living in the countryside, dyspnea, respiratory distress, influenza-like outbreak, O2 saturation <95%, X-ray change, length of stay in the ICU, invasive ventilatory support, previous heart disease, pneumopathy, diabetes, down's syndrome, neurological disease and kidney disease. Better survival was observed in the symptoms and in an asthmatic patient. The multiple model for increased risk of death when they were admitted to the ICU HR 1.28 (95% CI 1.21;1.35), diabetes HR 1.17 (95% CI 1.11;1.24), neurological disease HR 1.34 (95% CI 1.22;1.46), kidney disease HR 1.11 (95% CI 1.02;1.21), heart disease HR 1.14 (95% CI 1.08;1.20), black or brown race of HR 1.50 (95% CI 1.43;1.58), asthma HR 0.71 (95% CI 0.61;0.81) and pneumopathy HR 1.12 (95% CI 1.02;1.23). The overall survival time was low in hospitalizations for COVID-19 and this reinforces the importance of sociodemographic and clinical factors as a prognosis for death. The lack of a protocol for scientific clinical management puts a greater risk of death for about 80 million Brazilians, who are chronically ill or living in poverty. COVID-19 can promote selective mortality that borders the eugenics of specific social segments in Brazil.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marquiony Santos","author_inst":"UERN"},{"author_name":"Eudes ES Lucena","author_inst":"UFRN"},{"author_name":"Kenio C Lima","author_inst":"UFRN"},{"author_name":"Andiara AC Brito","author_inst":"UFERSA"},{"author_name":"Monica B Bay","author_inst":"UFRN"},{"author_name":"Diego Bonfada","author_inst":"UFRN"},{"author_name":"Johannes P.C. van den Akker","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Henrik Endeman","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Diederik A.M.P.J.

Understanding the introductions of this new coronavirus in different settings may assist control efforts and the establishment of frameworks to support rapid response in future infectious disease outbreaks. We investigated the first four weeks of emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in Scotland after the first case reported on the 1st March 2020. We obtained full genome sequences from 452 individuals with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, representing 20% of all cases until 1st April 2020 (n=2310). This permitted a genomic epidemiology approach to study the introductions and spread of the SARS-2 virus in Scotland. From combined phylogenetic and epidemiological analysis, we estimated at least 113 introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Scotland during this period. Clusters containing multiple sequences suggestive of onward transmission occurred in 48\/86 (56%). 42\/86 (51%) clusters had no known international travel history indicating undetected introductions. The majority of viral sequences were most closely related to those circulating in other European countries, including Italy, Austria and Spain. Travel-associated introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Scotland predated travel restrictions in the UK and other European countries. The first local transmission occurred three days after the first case. A shift from travel-associated to sustained community transmission was apparent after only 11 days. Undetected introductions occurred prior to the first known case of COVID-19. Earlier travel restrictions and quarantine measures might have resulted in fewer introductions into Scotland, thereby reducing the number of cases and the subsequent burden on health services. The high number of introductions and transmission rates were likely to have impacted on national contact tracing efforts. Our results also demonstrate that local real-time genomic epidemiology can be used to monitor transmission clusters and facilitate control efforts to restrict the spread of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":42,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ana Da Silva Filipe","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"James Shepherd","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Thomas Williams","author_inst":"Institute of Evolutionary Biology, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Joseph Hughes","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Elihu Aranday-Cortes","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Patawee Asamaphan","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Carlos Balcazar","author_inst":"MRC Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Kirstyn Brunker","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Stephen Carmichael","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Dewar","author_inst":"Virology Department, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Michael D Gallagher","author_inst":"MRC Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Rory Gunson","author_inst":"West of Scotland Specialist Virology Centre, NHSGGC"},{"author_name":"Antonia Ho","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Natasha Jesudason","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Natasha Johnson","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"E.

A large number of serologic tests, platforms and methodologies are being employed to determine seroprevalence in populations to select convalescent plasmas for therapeutic trials, and to guide policies about reopening. However, tests have substantial variability in sensitivity and specificity, and their ability to quantitatively predict levels of nAb is unknown. We collected 370 unique donors enrolled in the New York Blood Center Convalescent Plasma Program between April and May of 2020. We measured levels of antibodies in convalescent plasma using commercially available SARS-CoV-2 detection tests and in-house ELISA assays and correlated serological measurements with nAb activity measured using pseudotyped virus particles, which offer the most informative assessment of antiviral activity of patient sera against viral infection. Our data show that a large proportion of convalescent plasma samples have modest antibody levels and that commercially available tests have varying degrees of accuracy in predicting nAb activity. We found the Ortho Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total Ig and IgG high throughput serological assays (HTSAs), as well as the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay, quantify levels of antibodies that strongly correlate with nAb assays and are consistent with gold-standard ELISA assay results. These findings provide immediate clinical relevance to serology results that can be equated to nAb activity and could serve as a valuable roadmap to guide the choice and interpretation of serological tests for SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Larry L Luchsinger","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Brett Ransegnola","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Daniel Jin","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Frauke Muecksch","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Yiska Weisblum","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Weili Bao","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Parakkal Jovvian George","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Marilis Rodriguez","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Nancy Tricoche","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Fabian Schmidt","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Chengjie Gao","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Shabnam Jawahar","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Mouli Pal","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Emily Schnall","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Huan Zhang","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Donna Strauss","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Karina Yazdanbakhsh","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Christopher D Hillyer","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Paul D Bieniasz","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Theodora Hatziioannou","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Martin McHugh","author_inst":"Virology Department, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh & University of St. Andrews"},{"author_name":"Jenna Nichols","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Marc Niebel","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Kyriaki Nomikou","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Richard J.

Methods We conducted a cohort study of patients hospitalized with COVID 19 in Spain. The primary outcome was time to death and the secondary outcome time to intensive care unit admission (ICU) or death. We used inverse probability weighting to fit marginal structural models adjusted for time varying covariates to determine the causal relationship between tocilizumab use and the outcomes. Results A total of 1,229 and 10,673 person\/days were analyzed. In the adjusted marginal structural models, a significant interaction between tocilizumab use and high C reactive protein (CRP) levels was detected. Tocilizumab was associated with decreased risk of death (aHR 0.34, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.72, p=0.005) and ICU admission or death (aHR 0.38, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.81, p=0.011) among patients with baseline CRP >150 mg\/L, but not among those with CRP [&le;]150 mg\/L. Exploratory subgroup analyses yielded point estimates that were consistent with these findings. Conclusions In this large observational study, tocilizumab was associated with a lower risk of death or ICU or death in patients with higher CRP levels. While the results of ongoing clinical trials of tocilizumab in patients with COVID 19 will be important to establish its safety and efficacy, our findings have implications for the design of future clinical trials and support the use of tocilizumab among subjects with higher CRP levels.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Javier Martinez-Sanz","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal"},{"author_name":"Alfonso Muriel","author_inst":"Clinical Biostatistic Unit, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Departamento de Enfermeria y Fisioterapia, Universidad de Alcala, IRYCIS, CIBERESP, Madrid, Sp"},{"author_name":"Raquel Ron","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Alcala, IRYCIS, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Sabina Herrera","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Alcala, IRYCIS, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Raquel Ron","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Alcala, IRYCIS, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Jose A Perez-Molina","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Alcala, IRYCIS, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Santiago Moreno","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Alcala, IRYCIS, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Sergio Serrano-Villar","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Alcala, IRYCIS, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Nancy Tricoche","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Fabian Schmidt","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Chengjie Gao","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Shabnam Jawahar","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Mouli Pal","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Emily Schnall","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Huan Zhang","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Donna Strauss","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Karina Yazdanbakhsh","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Christopher D Hillyer","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Paul D Bieniasz","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Theodora Hatziioannou","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Martin McHugh","author_inst":"Virology Department, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh & University of St. Andrews"},{"author_name":"Jenna Nichols","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Marc Niebel","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Kyriaki Nomikou","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Richard J.

Methods: Clinical data of common COVID-19 patients admitted to the Shanghai public health clinical center for treatment from January 20, 2020 to March 16, 2020 were collected. A retrospective study was conducted and the patients were divided into two groups according to whether they used proton pump inhibitors or not. The differences in SARS-CoV-2 clearance and hospital stay between the two groups were compared by univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: A total of 154 COVID-19 common cases were included in this study, including 80 males (51.9%), 35 patients (22.7%) in the proton pump inhibitors group, and 119 patients (77.3%) in the control group. In the proton pump inhibitors group and the control group, the duration of SARS-CoV-2 clearance were 7(6-9) and 7(6-11) days, and the duration of hospital stay was 21(16-25) and 20(15-26) days, respectively. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 clearance and the cumulative incidence of discharge, and the same after Propensity Score Match, all P > 0.05. Multivariate analysis suggested that chronic gastropathy prolonged the duration of SARS-CoV-2 clearance, the HR was 20.924(3.547-123.447). Hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic liver disease and malignant tumor all increased the duration of hospital stay for COVID-19, and the HR were 1.820 (1.073-3.085), 4.370 (1.205-15.844), 9.011 (2.681-30.290) and 5.270 (1.237-22.456), respectively; the duration of hospital stay in COVID-19 patients was shortened by SARS-CoV-2 clearance, and the HR was 0.907 (0.869-0.947); all P < 0.05. Conclusion: Proton pump inhibitors use have no effect on the prolonging or shortening of the course of adults hospitalized with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiao-Yu Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Hai-Bing Wu","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yun Ling","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zhi-Ping Qian","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Liang Chen","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jose A Perez-Molina","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Alcala, IRYCIS, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Santiago Moreno","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Alcala, IRYCIS, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Sergio Serrano-Villar","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Alcala, IRYCIS, Madrid, Spain."},{"author_name":"Nancy Tricoche","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Fabian Schmidt","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Chengjie Gao","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Shabnam Jawahar","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Mouli Pal","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Emily Schnall","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Huan Zhang","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Donna Strauss","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Karina Yazdanbakhsh","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Christopher D Hillyer","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Paul D Bieniasz","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Theodora Hatziioannou","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Martin McHugh","author_inst":"Virology Department, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh & University of St. Andrews"},{"author_name":"Jenna Nichols","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Marc Niebel","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Kyriaki Nomikou","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Richard J.

Participants with suspected or diagnosed Covid-19 will be included. The interventions being considered are drugs being repurposed, and comparators will include standard of care treatment or placebo. Methods: We searched Ovid-MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane library, clinical trial registration site in the UK(NIHR), Europe (clinicaltrialsregister.eu), US (ClinicalTrials.gov) and internationally (isrctn.com), and reviewed the reference lists of articles for eligible articles published up to April 22, 2020. All studies in English that evaluated the efficacy of the listed drugs were included. Cochrane RoB 2.0 and ROBINS-I tool were used to assess study quality. This systematic review adheres to the PRISMA guidelines. The protocol is available at PROSPERO (CRD42020180915). Results: From 708 identified studies or clinical trials, 16 studies and 16 case reports met our eligibility criteria. Of these, 6 were randomized controlled trials (763 patients), 7 cohort studies (321 patients) and 3 case series (191 patients). Chloroquine (CQ) had a 100% discharge rate compared to 50% with lopinavir-ritonavir at day 14, however a trial has recommended against a high dosage due to cardiotoxic events. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has shown no significant improvement in negative seroconversion rate which is also seen in our meta-analysis (p=0.68). Adverse events with HCQ have a significant difference compared to the control group (p=0.001). Lopinavir-ritonavir has shown no improvement in time to clinical improvement which is seen in our meta-analyses (p=0.1). Remdesivir has shown no significant improvement in time to clinical improvement but this trial had insufficient power. Discussion: Due to the paucity in evidence, it is difficult to establish the efficacy of these drugs in the treatment of Covid-19 as currently there is no significant clinical effectiveness of the repurposed drugs. Further large clinical trials are required to achieve more reliable findings. A risk-benefit analysis is required on an individual basis to weigh out the potential improvement in clinical outcome and viral load reduction compared to the risks of the adverse events.

This immediate clinical driver, combined with the general quest for more personalised health data, means that pulse oximetry measurement of capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) will likely expand into both the clinical and consumer market of wearable health technology in the near future. In this study, we set out to establish the feasibility of SpO2 measurement from the ear canal as a convenient site for long term monitoring, and perform a comprehensive comparison with the right index finger - the conventional clinical measurement site. During resting SpO2 estimation, we found a root mean square difference of 1.47% between the two measurement sites, with a mean difference of 0.23% higher SpO2 in the right ear canal. Through the simultaneous recording of pulse oximetry from both the right ear canal and index finger during breath holds, we observe a substantial improvement in response time between the ear and finger that has a mean of 12.4 seconds and a range of 4.2 - 24.2 seconds across all subjects. Factors which influence this response time, termed SpO2 delay, such as the sex of a subject are also explored. Furthermore, we examine the potential downsides of ear canal blood oxygen saturation measurement, namely the lower photoplethysmogram amplitude, and suggest ways to mitigate this disadvantage. These results are presented in conjunction with previously discovered benefits such as robustness to temperature, making the case for measurement of SpO2 from the ear canal being both convenient and superior to conventional finger measurement sites for continuous non-intrusive long term monitoring in both clinical and everyday-life settings.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Harry J Davies","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ian Williams","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Nicholas S Peters","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Danilo P Mandic","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Xiao-long Tian","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, China"},{"author_name":"Ming-liang Ma","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Huan Qi","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Qing-feng Meng","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Shu-juan Guo","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Yan-ling Wu","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Foshan Fourth People's Hospital, China"},{"author_name":"Xiao Yang","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"},{"author_name":"Da-wei Shi","author_inst":"National Institutes for Food and Drug Control, China"},{"author_name":"Jun-biao Dai","author_inst":"Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"},{"author_name":"Tian-lei Ying","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, China"},{"author_name":"Jie Zhou","author_inst":"Foshan Fourth People's Hospital, China"},{"author_name":"Sheng-ce Tao","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Christopher D Hillyer","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Paul D Bieniasz","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Theodora Hatziioannou","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Martin McHugh","author_inst":"Virology Department, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh & University of St. Andrews"},{"author_name":"Jenna Nichols","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Marc Niebel","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Kyriaki Nomikou","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Richard J.

Methods Ecological analysis using COVID-19 related mortality rates occurring by 24th April 2020, and ethnic composition of the population, across local authorities in England and Wales. Account is taken of age, population density, area deprivation and pollution. Results For every 1% rise in proportion of the population who are ethnic minority, COVID-19 related deaths increased by 5.10 (3.99 to 6.21) per million. This rise is present for each ethnic minority category examined. The size of this increase is a little reduced in a fully adjusted model, suggesting that some of the association results from ethnic minority people living in more densely populated, more polluted and more deprived areas. This estimate suggests that the average England and Wales COVID-19 related death rate would rise by 25% in a local authority with twice the average number of ethnic minority people. Discussion We find clear evidence that rates of COVID-19 related mortality within a local authority increase as the proportion of the population who are ethnic minority increases. We suggest that this is a consequence of social and economic inequalities, including among key workers, driven by entrenched structural and institutional racism and racial discrimination. We argue that these factors should be central to any investigation of ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 outcomes.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"James Nazroo","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Laia Becares","author_inst":"University of Sussex"},{"author_name":"Nicholas S Peters","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Danilo P Mandic","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Xiao-long Tian","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, China"},{"author_name":"Ming-liang Ma","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Huan Qi","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Qing-feng Meng","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Shu-juan Guo","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Yan-ling Wu","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Foshan Fourth People's Hospital, China"},{"author_name":"Xiao Yang","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"},{"author_name":"Da-wei Shi","author_inst":"National Institutes for Food and Drug Control, China"},{"author_name":"Jun-biao Dai","author_inst":"Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"},{"author_name":"Tian-lei Ying","author_inst":"Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, China"},{"author_name":"Jie Zhou","author_inst":"Foshan Fourth People's Hospital, China"},{"author_name":"Sheng-ce Tao","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Christopher D Hillyer","author_inst":"New York Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Paul D Bieniasz","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Theodora Hatziioannou","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Martin McHugh","author_inst":"Virology Department, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh & University of St. Andrews"},{"author_name":"Jenna Nichols","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Marc Niebel","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Kyriaki Nomikou","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research"},{"author_name":"Richard J.

It was declared on March 11, 2020, by the World Health Organization as pandemic disease. The disease has neither approved medicine nor vaccine and has made government and scholars search for drastic measures in combating the pandemic. Regrettably, the spread of the virus and mortality due to COVID-19 has continued to increase daily. Hence, it is imperative to control the spread of the disease particularly using non-pharmacological strategies such as quarantine, isolation and public health education. This work studied the effect of these different control strategies as time-dependent interventions using mathematical modeling and optimal control approach to ascertain their contributions in the dynamic transmission of COVID-19. The model was proven to have an invariant region and was well-posed. The basic reproduction number was computed with and without interventions and was used to carry out the sensitivity analysis that identified the critical parameters contributing to the spread of COVID-19. The optimal control analysis was carried out using the Pontryagin maximum principle to figure out the optimal strategy necessary to curtail the disease. The findings of the optimal control analysis and numerical simulations revealed that time-dependent interventions reduced the number of exposed and infected individuals compared to time-independent interventions. These interventions were time-bound and best implemented within the first 100 days of the outbreak. Again, the combined implementation of only two of these interventions produced a good result in reducing infection in the population, while the combined implementation of all three interventions performed better, even though zero infection was not achieved in the population. This implied that multiple interventions need to be deployed early in order to the virus to the barest minimum.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chinwendu Emilian Madubueze","author_inst":"University of Agriculture, Makurdi"},{"author_name":"Dachollom Sambo","author_inst":"Akanu  Ibiam  Federal  Polytechnic, Unwana, P.M.B.  1007  Afikpo,  Ebonyi State,  Nigeria."},{"author_name":"Isaac O.

We found that in comparison between mild and severe COVID-19 patients, Interleukin-37 signaling was one of the most relevant pathways; top significantly altered genes included POTEH, FAM27C, SPATA48, which were mostly expressed in prostate and testis; adrenal glands, small intestines and liver were tissues presenting most differentially expressed genes.

This research presents a mathematical model to empirically assess measures related to various pandemic containment strategies, their similarities and a probabilistic estimate on the evolution of Covid-19 incidence rates. The model is built on the principle that, the exponential rise and decay of the number of confirmed Covid-19 infections can be construed as a set of concurrent non-linear waves. These waves can be characterized by a linear combination of Gaussian and Cauchy Lorentz functions collectively termed as Gaussian-Lorentzian Composite (GLC) function. The GLC function is used for non-linear approximation of officially confirmed Covid-19 incidence rates in each country. Results of fitting GLC based models to incidence rate trends of 20 different countries proves that the models can empirically explain the growth and decay trajectory Covid-19 infections in a given population.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Radhakrishnan Poomari","author_inst":"Xformics Inc"},{"author_name":"Yu Lin","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Tao Wu","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Jinjin Xu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Zhichao Ma","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Kun Sun","author_inst":"Shenzhen Bay Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Hui Li","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Yuxue Luo","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China; School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Chen Zhang","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Fang Chen","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Jiao Wang","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Tingyu Kuo","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China; BGI Education Center, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaojuan Li","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Chunyu Geng","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Feng Lin","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Chaojie Huang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Junjie Hu","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Jianhua Yin","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Ming Liu","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Ye Tao","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Jiye Zhang","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Rijing Ou","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Furong Xiao","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Huanming Yang","author_inst":"BGI-Tianjin;Prince Aljawhra Center of Excellence in Research of Hereditary Disorders, King Abdulaziz University"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China; James D.

Ivermectin has been shown to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro but clinical response has not been previously evaluated. Objective: To determine whether Ivermectin is associated with lower mortality rate in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Design and Setting: Retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients hospitalized at four Broward Health hospitals in South Florida with confirmed SARS-CoV-2. Enrollment dates were March 15, 2020 through May 11, 2020. Follow up data for all outcomes was May 19, 2020. Participants: 280 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (mean age 59.6 years [standard deviation 17.9], 45.4% female), of whom 173 were treated with ivermectin and 107 were usual care were reviewed. 27 identified patients were not reviewed due to multiple admissions, lack of confirmed COVID results during hospitalization, age less than 18, pregnancy, or incarceration. Exposure: Patients were categorized into two treatment groups based on whether they received at least one dose of ivermectin at any time during the hospitalization. Treatment decisions were at the discretion of the treating physicians. Severe pulmonary involvement at study entry was characterized as need for either FiO2 [&ge;]50%, or noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included subgroup mortality in patients with severe pulmonary involvement and extubation rates for patients requiring invasive ventilation. Results: Univariate analysis showed lower mortality in the ivermectin group (25.2% versus 15.0%, OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.29-0.96, P=.03). Mortality was also lower among 75 patients with severe pulmonary disease treated with ivermectin (38.8% vs 80.7%, OR 0.15, CI 0.05-0.47, P=.001), but there was no significant difference in successful extubation rates (36.1% vs 15.4%, OR 3.11 (0.88-11.00), p=.07). After adjustment for between-group differences and mortality risks, the mortality difference remained significant for the entire cohort (OR 0.27, CI 0.09-0.85, p=.03; HR 0.37, CI 0.19-0.71, p=.03). Conclusions and Relevance: Ivermectin was associated with lower mortality during treatment of COVID-19, especially in patients who required higher inspired oxygen or ventilatory support. These findings should be further evaluated with randomized controlled trials.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Juliana Cepelowicz Rajter","author_inst":"Broward Health Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michael Sherman","author_inst":"Drexel University"},{"author_name":"Naaz Fatteh","author_inst":"Broward Health Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Fabio Vogel","author_inst":"Broward Health Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jamie Sacks","author_inst":"Broward Health Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jean-Jacques Rajter","author_inst":"Broward Health Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Hui Li","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Yuxue Luo","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China; School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Chen Zhang","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Fang Chen","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Jiao Wang","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Tingyu Kuo","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China; BGI Education Center, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaojuan Li","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Chunyu Geng","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Feng Lin","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Chaojie Huang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Junjie Hu","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Jianhua Yin","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Ming Liu","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Ye Tao","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Jiye Zhang","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Rijing Ou","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Furong Xiao","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Huanming Yang","author_inst":"BGI-Tianjin;Prince Aljawhra Center of Excellence in Research of Hereditary Disorders, King Abdulaziz University"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China; James D.

Several clinical studies have provided evidence for the antiviral effects of type I interferons (IFNs) in patients with respiratory coronaviruses. This study assessed the therapeutic efficacy of IFN-alpha 2b in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the first month after the outbreak began in Cuba. Method This multicenter prospective observational study was conducted in 16 hospitals in 8 Cuban provinces. Participants were patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection detected from throat swab specimens by real time RT-PCR who gave informed consent and had no contraindications for IFN treatment. Patients received therapy as per the Cuban COVID protocol, that included a combination of oral antivirals (lopinavir\/ritonavir and chloroquine) with intramuscular administration of IFN-alpha 2b (Heberon Alpha R, Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Havana), 3 times per week, for 2 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients discharged from hospital (without clinical and radiological symptoms and non-detectable virus by RT-PCR). The secondary endpoint was the case fatality rate (CFR), defined as the number of confirmed deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases. Results From March 11th to April 14th, 814 patients were confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive in Cuba, 761 (93.4%) were treated with Heberon Alpha R and 53 received the approved protocol without IFN treatment. The proportion of fully recovered patients was higher in the IFN-treated compared with non-IFN treated group (95.4% vs 26.1%, p<0.01). The CFR for all patients was 2.95%, and for those patients who received IFN-alpha 2b the CFR was reduce to 0.92. The estimated global CFR is 6.34% and 4.05% for the Americas reported by WHO and PAHO, respectively. In this study, 82 patients (10.1%) required intensive care and, of these, 42 (5.5%) were treated with IFN. Conclusions This report provides preliminary evidence for the therapeutic effectiveness of IFN alpha-2b for COVID-19 and suggests that the use of Heberon Alpha R may contribute to complete recovery.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ricardo Pereda","author_inst":"Medical college of Havana.

Nevertheless, there have been no attempts at modelling it at high spatial resolution, needed to understand geographical differences in the mortality patterns, to evaluate temporal lags and to plan for future waves of the pandemic. Methods This is the first subnational study on excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, the third most-hit country. We considered municipality level and estimated all-cause mortality weekly trends based on the first four months of 2016 -- 2019. We specified a Bayesian hierarchical model allowing for spatial heterogeneity as well as for non-linear smooth spatio-temporal terms. We predicted the weekly mortality rates at municipality level for 2020 based on the modelled spatio-temporal trends (i.e.~in the absence of the pandemic) and estimated the excess mortality and the uncertainty surrounding it. Results There was strong evidence of excess mortality for Northern Italy; Lombardia showed higher mortality rates than expected from the end of February, with 23,946 (23,013 to 24,786) total excess deaths. North-West and North-East regions showed higher mortality from the beginning of March, with 6,942 (6,142 to 7,667) and 8,033 (7,061 to 9,044) total excess deaths respectively. After discounting for the number of COVID-19-confirmed deaths, Lombardia still registered 10,197 (9,264 to 11,037) excess deaths, while regions in the North-West and North-East had 2,572 (1,772 to 3,297) and 2,047 (1,075 to 3,058) extra deaths, respectively. We observed marked geographical differences at municipality level. The city of Bergamo (Lombardia) showed the largest percent excess 88.9% (81.9% to 95.2%) at the peak of the pandemic. An excess of 84.2% (73.8% to 93.4%) was also estimated at the same time for the city of Pesaro (Central Italy), in stark contrast with the rest of the region, which does not show evidence of excess deaths.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marta Blangiardo","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Michela Cameletti","author_inst":"University of Bergamo"},{"author_name":"Monica Pirani","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Gianni Corsetti","author_inst":"Italian Statistical Institute"},{"author_name":"Marco Battaglini","author_inst":"Italian Statistical Institute"},{"author_name":"Gianluca Baio","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Natacha Mezquia","author_inst":"Medical college of Havana.

We adopted early CPAP and self-proning, and evaluated the safety and efficacy of this approach. Methods This retrospective observational study included all patients with a positive COVID-19 PCR, and negative patients with high clinical suspicion. Our protocol advised early CPAP and self-proning for severe cases, aiming to prevent rather than respond to deterioration. CPAP was provided outside ICU by ward staff supported by physiotherapists and an intensive critical care outreach program. Data were analysed descriptively and compared against a large UK cohort (ISARIC). Results 559 patients admitted before 1\/May\/20 were included. 365 were discharged alive, 182 died, and 12 remain inpatient. 165 patients (29.5%) received CPAP, 40 (7.2%) were admitted to ICU and 27 (4.8%) were ventilated. Hospital mortality was 33.3%, ICU mortality 54.5%. Following CPAP 64% of patients with moderate or severe ARDS, who were candidates for escalation, avoided intubation. Figures for ICU admission, intubation and hospital mortality are lower than those from ISARIC, whilst ICU mortality is similar. Following ISARIC proportions we would have admitted 92 patients to ICU and intubated 55. Using the described protocol, we intubated 27 patients from 40 admissions, and remained within our expanded ICU capacity. Conclusion Bradford's protocol produced good results despite our population having high levels of co-morbidity and ethnicities associated with poor outcomes. In particular we avoided overloading ICU capacity. We advocate this approach as both effective and safe.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tom Lawton","author_inst":"Bradford Institute of Health Research & Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Kate M Wilkinson","author_inst":"Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Aaron Corp","author_inst":"Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Rabeia Javid","author_inst":"Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Laura MacNally","author_inst":"Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Michael McCooe","author_inst":"Bradford Institute of Health Research & Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Newton","author_inst":"Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Rafael Venegas","author_inst":"Medical college of Havana.

This paper examines four demographic and clinical factors (age, time to hospital, presence of chronic disease, and sex) and utilizes Shapley values from coalitional game theory and machine learning to evaluate their relative importance in predicting COVID-19 mortality. The analyses suggest that out of the 4 factors studied, age is the most important in predicting COVID-19 mortality, followed by time to hospital. Sex and presence of chronic disease were both found to be relatively unimportant, and the two global interpretation techniques differed in ranking them. Additionally, this paper creates partial dependence plots to determine and visualize the marginal effect of each factor on COVID-19 mortality and demonstrates how local interpretation of COVID-19 mortality prediction can be applicable in a clinical setting. Lastly, this paper derives clinically applicable decision rules about mortality probabilities through a parsimonious 3-split surrogate tree, demonstrating that high-accuracy COVID-19 mortality prediction can be achieved with simple, interpretable models.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Russell Yang","author_inst":"The Harker School"},{"author_name":"Kate M Wilkinson","author_inst":"Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Aaron Corp","author_inst":"Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Rabeia Javid","author_inst":"Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Laura MacNally","author_inst":"Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Michael McCooe","author_inst":"Bradford Institute of Health Research & Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Newton","author_inst":"Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Rafael Venegas","author_inst":"Medical college of Havana.

The aim of this living systematic review is to synthesise early international evidence on mortality rates and incidence of COVID-19 among people who use and provide LTC. Methods: We report findings of a living systematic review (CRD42020183557), including studies identified through database searches up to 26 June 2020. We searched seven databases (MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL Plus; Web of Science; Global Health; WHO COVID-19 Research Database; medRxiv) to identify all studies reporting primary data on COVID-19 related mortality and incidence of disease among LTC users and staff. We excluded studies not focusing on LTC. Included studies were critically appraised and results on number of deaths and COVID-19 related mortality rates, case fatality rates, and excess deaths (co-primary outcomes), as well as incidence of disease, hospitalisations, and ICU admissions were synthesised narratively. Findings: A total of 54 study reports for 49 unique primary studies or outbreak reports were included. Outbreak investigations in LTC facilities found COVID-19 incidence rates of between 0.0% and 71.7% among residents and between 0.4% and 64.0% among staff at affected facilities. Mortality rates varied from 0.0% to 17.1% of all residents at outbreak facilities, with case fatality rates between 0.0% and 33.7%. In included studies of outbreaks, no LTC staff members had died. Studies of wider LTC populations found that between 0.4% and 40.8% of users, and between 4.0% and 23.8% of staff were infected, although the generalisability of these studies is limited. There was limited information on the impact of COVID-19 on LTC in the community. Interpretation: Long-term care users have been particularly vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we found wide variation in spread of disease and mortality rates between outbreaks at individual LTC facilities. Further research into the factors determining successful prevention and containment of COVID-19 outbreaks is needed to protect long-term care users and staff.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maximilian Salcher-Konrad","author_inst":"London School of Economics and Political Science"},{"author_name":"Arnoupe Jhass","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Huseyin Naci","author_inst":"London School of Economics and Political Science"},{"author_name":"Marselia Tan","author_inst":"London School of Economics and Political Science"},{"author_name":"Yousef El-Tawil","author_inst":"London School of Economics and Political Science"},{"author_name":"Adelina Comas-Herrera","author_inst":"London School of Economics and Political Science"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Newton","author_inst":"Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Rafael Venegas","author_inst":"Medical college of Havana.

Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in May 2020 in a single grocery retail store in Massachusetts, USA. We assessed workers personal\/occupational history and perception of COVID-19 by questionnaire. The health outcomes were measured by nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results, GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7) and PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9). Results: Among 104 workers tested, twenty-one (20%) had positive viral assays. Seventy-six percent positive cases were asymptomatic. After multi-variate adjustments, employees with direct customer exposure had an odds of 4.7 (95% CI 1.2 to 32.0) being tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, while smokers had an odds of 0.1 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.8) having positive assay. As to mental health, the prevalence of anxiety and depression (i.e. GAD-7 score > 4 or PHQ-9 score >4) was 24% and 8%, respectively. After adjusting for potential confounders, those able to practice social distancing consistently at work had odds of 0.2 (95% CI 0.1 to 0.7) and 0.1 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.6) screening positive for anxiety and depression, respectively. Conclusions: We found a considerable asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection rate among grocery workers. Employees with direct costumer exposure were 5 times more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2, while cigarette smokers were 90% less likely to have positive assays. Those able to practice social distancing consistently at work had significantly lower risk of anxiety or depression.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fan-Yun Lan","author_inst":"Harvard University T.H.

As discussion shifts towards relaxation of these restrictions, there is significant concern of second-wave resurgence. The key to managing these outbreaks is early detection and intervention, and yet there is significant lag time associated with usage of laboratory confirmed cases for surveillance purposes. To address this, syndromic surveillance can be considered to provide a timelier alternative for first-line screening. Existing syndromic surveillance solutions are however typically focused around a known disease and have limited capability to distinguish between outbreaks of individual diseases sharing similar syndromes. This poses a challenge for surveillance of COVID-19 as its active periods are tend to overlap temporally with other influenza-like illnesses. In this study we explore performing sentinel syndromic surveillance for COVID-19 and other influenza-like illnesses using a deep learning-based approach. Our methods are based on aberration detection utilizing autoencoders that leverages symptom prevalence distributions to distinguish outbreaks of two ongoing diseases that share similar syndromes, even if they occur concurrently. We first demonstrate that this approach works for detection of outbreaks of influenza, which has known temporal boundaries. We then demonstrate that the autoencoder can be trained to not alert on known and well-managed influenza-like illnesses such as the common cold and influenza. Finally, we applied our approach to 2019-2020 data in the context of a COVID-19 syndromic surveillance task to demonstrate how implementation of such a system could have provided early warning of an outbreak of a novel influenza-like illness that did not match the symptom prevalence profile of influenza and other known influenza-like illnesses.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew Wen","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Liwei Wang","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Huan He","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Sijia Liu","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Sunyang Fu","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Sunghwan Sohn","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Jacob A Kugel","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Vinod C Kaggal","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Ming Huang","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Yanshan Wang","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Feichen Shen","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Jungwei Fan","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Hongfang Liu","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Chunyu Geng","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Feng Lin","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Chaojie Huang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Junjie Hu","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Jianhua Yin","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Ming Liu","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Ye Tao","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Jiye Zhang","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Rijing Ou","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Furong Xiao","author_inst":"Hainan General Hospital, Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University, Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Genetic Translational M"},{"author_name":"Huanming Yang","author_inst":"BGI-Tianjin;Prince Aljawhra Center of Excellence in Research of Hereditary Disorders, King Abdulaziz University"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, Guangdong, China; James D.
