Thus, our goal is to recognize endothelial activation and pyroptosis in lung and myocardial samples of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases and compare to H1N1pdm09 and control cases. Approach and Results: Post-mortem lung (6 cases of COVID-19 group; 10 cases of H1N1 group and 11 cases of Control group) and myocardial samples (2 cases of COVID-19 and one control) were analyzed by conventional immunohistochemistry by using antibodies to identify molecules involving with endothelial activation (CD163, Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-alpha), Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM-1)) and pyroptosis (Caspase-1). As a result, IL-6, TNF-alpha, ICAM-1, and Caspase-1 show higher tissue expression in the COVID-19 group compared to H1N1 and Control groups. Conclusion: Our results indicate that the vascular endothelium has been activated and the presence of pyroptosis and endothelial dysfunction in lung and myocardial samples. These conditions could lead to a systemic immune-thrombotic process that may impair the clinical staff's efforts to prevent fatal outcomes. One aim of the health professionals is to avoid COVID-19 systemic vascular injury and immune-thrombosis by blocking the endothelial dysfunction and its consequences.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Seigo Nagashima","author_inst":"Pontifical Catholic University of Parana"},{"author_name":"Monalisa Castilho Mendes","author_inst":"Postgraduation Program in Biotechnology Applied in Health of Children and Adolescent"},{"author_name":"Ana Paula Camargo Martins","author_inst":"Pontifical Catholic University of Parana"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Henrique Borges","author_inst":"Pontifical Catholic University of Parana"},{"author_name":"Thiago Mateus Godoy","author_inst":"Pontifical Catholic University of Parana"},{"author_name":"Anna Flavia Miggiolaro Ribeiro","author_inst":"Pontifical Catholic University of Parana"},{"author_name":"Felipe da Silva Deziderio","author_inst":"Pontifical Catholic University of Parana"},{"author_name":"Lucia de Noronha","author_inst":"Pontifical Catholic University of Parana"},{"author_name":"Cleber Machado-Souza","author_inst":"Postgraduation Program in Biotechnology Applied in Health of Children and Adolescent"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pathology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.17.20133876","rel_title":"Community engagement for COVID-19 prevention and control: A Rapid Evidence Synthesis","rel_date":"2020-06-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.17.20133876","rel_abs":"Introduction Community engagement has been considered a fundamental component of past outbreaks, such as Ebola. The COVID-19 pandemic and its control efforts require social actions and behaviours, all of which place a large reliance on individual and community compliance, highlighting the need for appropriate community engagement to support such work. However, there is concern over the lack of involvement of communities within COVID-19 thus far. Identifying how community engagement approaches have been used in past epidemics may support more robust implementation of community engagement within COVID-19 response. Methodology A rapid evidence review was conducted to identity how community engagement is used for infectious disease prevention and control during epidemics. Three databases (PubMed, CINHAL and Scopus) were searched in addition to extensive snowballing for grey literature. Previous epidemics were limited to Ebola, Zika, SARS, MERS and H1N1 since 2000. No restrictions were applied to study design or language, though articles must have detailed a minimum of one community engagement for infection prevention and control initiative. All authors participated in searching, screening, and data extraction, with a minimum of two authors at each stage. Results From 1,112 references identified in our search, 32 articles met our inclusion criteria. All but 3 articles were published on or after 2015 which details 37 community engagement initiatives for Ebola (n=28), Zika (n=5) and H1N1 (n=4). Twenty-seven of these initiatives were implemented in low-income countries and 10 from high-income countries. Six broad community engagement actors were identified: local leaders, community and faith-based organisations, community groups, health facility or community health committees, individuals and key stakeholders. These actors worked across six different functions: designing and planning, community entry and trust-building, social and behaviour change communication, risk communication, surveillance and tracing, and logistics and administration. Leaders were the most prevalent actor being engaged, and behaviour change communication, risk communication, and surveillance and tracing were the most common function of community engagement. Implementation considerations community engagement in prevention and control of COVID-19 are reported within. Conclusion COVID-19 global presence and social transmission pathways require social and community responses. This may be particularly important to reach marginalised populations and support equity-informed responses. Previous experience from outbreaks shows that community engagement can take many forms and include different actors and approaches who support various prevention and control activities. Countries worldwide are encouraged to assess existing community engagement structures, and utilise community engagement approaches to support contextually specific, acceptable and appropriate COVID-19 prevention and control measures.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brynne Gilmore","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Rawlance Ndejjo","author_inst":"2 Department of Disease Control and Environmental Health, School of Public Health, College of Health Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda."},{"author_name":"Adalbert Tchetchia","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Expanded Programme on Immunization, Yaounde, Cameroon"},{"author_name":"Vergil de Claro","author_inst":"RTI International, Pasig, Philippines"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Nyamupachitu-Mago","author_inst":"Brandeis University, Massachusetts, USA"},{"author_name":"Alpha A Diallo","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Conakry, Guinea"},{"author_name":"Claudia Abreu Lopes","author_inst":"United Nations University, International Institute for Global Health, Kuala Lumpur Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Sanghita Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"Public Health Foundation of India, Haryana, India"},{"author_name":"Cleber Machado-Souza","author_inst":"Postgraduation Program in Biotechnology Applied in Health of Children and Adolescent"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.17.20133868","rel_title":"The impact of the Covid-19 lockdown on the experiences and feeding practices of new mothers in the UK: Preliminary data from the COVID-19 New Mum Study","rel_date":"2020-06-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.17.20133868","rel_abs":"Background: The COVID-19 New Mum Study is recording maternal experiences and infant feeding during the period of UK lockdown. This report from week 1 of the survey aims to (1) provide information relevant for those supporting this population; (2) identify groups currently under-represented in the survey. Methods: Women living in the UK aged [&ge;]18 years with an infant [&le;]12 months of age completed an anonymous online survey (https:\/\/is.gd\/covid19newmumstudy). Information\/links are shared via websites, social media and existing contacts. Results: Between May 27th and June 3rd 2020, 1365 women provided data (94% white, 95% married\/with partner, 66% degree\/higher qualification, 86% living in house; 1049 (77%) delivered before lockdown (BL) and 316 (23%) during lockdown (DL). Delivery mode, skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding initiation did not differ between groups. DL women had shorter hospital stays (p<0.001) and 39% reported changes to their birth plan. Reflecting younger infant age, 59% of DL infants were exclusively breast-fed or mixed fed versus 39% of BL (p<0.05). Thirteen % reported a change in feeding; often related to lack of breastfeeding support, especially with practical problems. Important sources of feeding support were the partner (60%), health professional (50%) and online groups (47%). 45% of DL women reported insufficient support with feeding. Among BL women, 57% and 69% reported decreased feeding support and childcare, respectively. 40% BL\/45% DL women reported insufficient support with their own health, 8%\/9% contacted a mental health professional and 11% reported their mental health was affected. 9% highlighted lack of contact and support from family and distress that they had missed seeing the baby. Conclusion: Lockdown has had an impact on maternal experiences, resulting in distress for many women. Survey participants are currently not representative of the population; notably, groups at greater risk are under-represented. Increasing the diversity of participants is a priority.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adriana Vazquez-Vazquez","author_inst":"UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Sarah Dib","author_inst":"UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Emeline Rougeaux","author_inst":"UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Jonathan C Wells","author_inst":"UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Mary Fewtrell","author_inst":"UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"},{"author_name":"Alpha A Diallo","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Conakry, Guinea"},{"author_name":"Claudia Abreu Lopes","author_inst":"United Nations University, International Institute for Global Health, Kuala Lumpur Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Sanghita Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"Public Health Foundation of India, Haryana, India"},{"author_name":"Cleber Machado-Souza","author_inst":"Postgraduation Program in Biotechnology Applied in Health of Children and Adolescent"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pediatrics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.17.20133587","rel_title":"Essential epidemiological parameters of COVID-19 for clinical and mathematical modeling purposes: a rapid review and meta-analysis","rel_date":"2020-06-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.17.20133587","rel_abs":"We present a literature review and meta-analysis of relevant epidemiological parameters (24 for adults, 7 for children) of COVID-19.

Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial drug that elicit immunomodulatory effects and had shown in vitro antiviral effects against SRAS-CoV-2. This drug divided opinion worldwide in the medical community but also in the press, the general public and in public health policies. The aim of this systematic review and this meta-analysis was to bring a new overview on this controversial drug and to assess whether hydroxychloroquine could reduce COVID-19 mortality risk in hospitalized patients. Methods and Findings: Pubmed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, MedRxiv and grey literature were searched until 10 June 2020. Only studies of COVID-19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine (with or without azithromycin) compared with a comparative standard care group and with full-text articles in English were included. Studies reporting effect sizes as Odds Ratios, Hazard Ratio and Relative Risk for mortality risk and the number of deaths per groups were included. This meta-analysis was conducted following PRISMA guidelines and registered on PROSPERO (Registration number: CRD42020190801). Independent extraction has been performed by two independent reviewers. Effect sizes were pooled using a random-effects model. The initial search leaded to 112 articles, from which 16 articles met our inclusion criteria. 15 studies were retained for association between hydroxychloroquine and COVID-19 survival including 15,081 patients (8,072 patients in the hydroxychloroquine arm and 7,009 patients in the standard care arm with respectively, 1,578 deaths and 1,423 deaths). 6 studies were retained for hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin. Hydroxychloroquine was not significantly associated with mortality risk (pooled Relative Risk RR=0.82 (95% Confidence Interval: 0.62-1.07, I2=82, Pheterogeneity<0.01, n=15)) within hospitalized patients, nor in association with azithromycin (pooled Relative Risk RR=1.33 (95% CI: 0.92-1.92, I2=75%, Pheterogeneity<0.01, n=6)), nor in the numerous subgroup analysis by study design, median age population, published studies (vs unpublished articles), level of bias risk. However, stratified analysis by continents, we found a significant decreased risk of mortality associated with hydroxychlroquine alone but not with azithromycin among European (RR= 0.62 (95%CI: 0.41-0.93, n=7)) and Asian studies (RR=0.36 (95%CI:0.18-0.73, n=1)), with heterogeneity detected across continent (Pheterogeneity between=0.003). These finding should be interpreted with caution since several included studies had a low quality of evidence with a small sample size, a lack of adjustment on potential confounders or selection and intervention biases. Conclusion: Our meta-analysis does not support the use of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin to reduce COVID-19 mortality in hospitalized patients. It raises the question of the hydroxychloroquine use outside of clinical trial. Additional results from larger randomised controlled trials are needed","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fiolet Thibault","author_inst":"Paris-Saclay University, INSERM U1018 (CESP)"},{"author_name":"Anthony Guihur","author_inst":"Department of Plant Molecular Biology, Faculty of Biology and Medicine, University of Lausanne"},{"author_name":"Mathieu Rebeaud","author_inst":"Department of Plant Molecular Biology, Faculty of Biology and Medicine, University of Lausanne"},{"author_name":"Matthieu Mulot","author_inst":"Laboratory of Soil Biodiversity, Faculty of Science, University of Neuchatel"},{"author_name":"Yahya Mahamat-Saleh","author_inst":"CESP, Fac. de medecine - Univ.

In this study we investigate if unemployed persons have a higher risk to become hospitalized with a COVID-19 diagnosis compared with employed persons. Methods: We used routine data on hospitalizations in a study population of 1,298,416persons between the ages 18 and 65 who were enrolled in a German health insurance and who were active on the labour market (either employed or unemployed). Hospital diagnosis of COVID-19 (ICD-10-GM U07.1 and U07.2) were reported on a daily basis from 01.01.2020 to 04.06.2020. We studied if the rate of persons hospitalized with a COVID-19 diagnoses differed by employment situation. Logistic regression models comparing employed with short- and long-term unemployed were calculated adjusting for age and sex. Results: In total, we observed 1,311 persons who were hospitalized, corresponding to a rate of 100.98 cases per 100.000 in our study population. Rates varied between the groups in different employment situations with lowest rates for employed and highest for long-term unemployed. Odds ratio for a hospitalization was 1.84 (1.64 - 2.07) for long-term and 1.18 (0.75 - 1.85) for short-term unemployed compared with employed persons. Conclusion: The results are in line with earlier (mainly ecological) studies from the USA and Great Britain which found social inequalities in hospitalization risk. The fact that differences exist in Germany, a country with a universal health care system, indicates socioeconomic differences in the COVID-19 pandemic exists across countries.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nico Dragano","author_inst":"University Hospital Duesseldorf"},{"author_name":"Christoph J.

Lopinavir-ritonavir (LPV\/RTV) is an HIV antiviral combination that has been considered for treatment of this disease. Aim of the study This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of lopinavir\/ritonavir in COVID-19 patients in the extant published research. A systematic review protocol was developed based on PRISMA-P and the PRISMA statement. Published English and non-English articles written since December 1, 2019 were selected for review from 8 electronic databases. Readily accessible full articles (cohort studies and clinical trials) which specifically mentioned lopinavir\/ritonavir and patients with lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 or COVOID-19 of any age were included. Three researchers separately evaluated the bias in the reported articles. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis with the objective of evaluation of the safety and efficacy of LPV\/RTV alone or in combination with other drugs with regard to time to becoming PCR negative, time to body temperature normalization and cough relief, radiological progression, and safety. Review Manager (RevMan) was used to conduct all statistical analyses and generate the forest plots. Meta-analyses were performed using the Mantel Hazel method or the inverse variance method for dichotomous data and continuous data respectively. Results Non-duplicate articles (n=76) were evaluated for possible inclusion. A consensus was reached to select 29 articles for full-text screening, only 11 articles comprised 1,192 patients were included in this study, and six of which were included for meta-analysis. In terms of virological cure (PCR negative), three studies reported less time in days to achieve a virological cure for LPV\/RTV arm relative to no antiviral therapy (conventional) (mean difference = -0.81 day; 95% CI, -4.44 to 2.81; P = 0.007, I2 = 80%). However, the overall effect was not significant (P = 0.66). When comparing LPV\/RTV arm to umifenovir arm, a favorable affect was observed for umifenovir arm, but not statically significant (mean difference = 0.95 day; 95% CI, -1.11 to 3.01; P = 0.09, I2 = 58%). In terms of time to body normalization and cough relief (clinical cure), two studies reported on time to temperature normalization with no significant effect of LPV\/RTV (n = 93) versus umifenovir (n = 71) arm), (OR = 0.87 day; 95% CI, 0.42 to 1.78; (P = 0.70), I2 = 0%), or alleviation of cough duration (p = 0.69). In terms of CT evidence of radiological progression of pneumonia\/lung damage, treatment with lopinavir\/ritonavir resulted in no significant decrease in the radiological progression (OR = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.42 to 1.54; P = 0.59, I2 = 81%), In terms of safety, a greater number of adverse events were reported for lopinavir\/ritonavir (n=45) relative to the umifenovir arm (n=14) and conventional treatments (n=10 ), P = 0.004, 0,0007, respectively Conclusions The small number of studies included in this systematic review and meta-analysis study did not reveal any statistically significant advantage in efficacy of lopinavir-ritonavir in COVID-19 patients, over conventional or other antiviral treatments. This result might not reflect the actual evidence.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mansour Tobaiqy","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacology, College of Medicine, University of Jeddah, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Saad Alhumaid","author_inst":"Drug Information and Research Department, Administration of Pharmaceutical Care, Ministry of Health, Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Abbas Al Mutair","author_inst":"Research Center, Dr Sulaiman Al Habib Medical Group, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Corrine Ruktanonchai","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Jessica Floyd","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Olivia Prosper","author_inst":"University of Tennessee"},{"author_name":"Chi Zhang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xiangjun Du","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Weizhong Yang","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Andrew J Tatem","author_inst":"University of Southampton"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.17.20132076","rel_title":"In-depth virological assessment of kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-06-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.17.20132076","rel_abs":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread widely, causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and significant mortality. However, data on viral loads and antibody kinetics in immunocompromised populations are lacking. We aimed to determine nasopharyngeal and plasma viral loads via RT-PCR and SARS-CoV-2 serology via ELISA and study their association with severe forms of COVID-19 and death in kidney transplant recipients. In this study we examined hospitalized kidney transplant recipients with non-severe (n = 21) and severe (n =19) COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal and plasma viral load and serological response were evaluated based on outcomes and disease severity. Ten recipients (25%) displayed persistent viral shedding 30 days after symptom onset. The SARS-CoV-2 viral load of the upper respiratory tract was not associated with severe COVID-19, whereas the plasma viral load was associated with COVID-19 severity (p=0.0087) and mortality (p=0.024). All patients harbored antibodies the second week after symptom onset that persisted for two months. We conclude that plasma viral load is associated with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, whereas nasopharyngeal viral load is not. SARS-CoV-2 shedding is prolonged in kidney transplant recipients and the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 does not show significant impairment in this series of transplant recipients.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ilies Benotmane","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, Franc"},{"author_name":"Gabriela Gautier-Vargas","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Maris-Josee Wendling","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Peggy Perrin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France.; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Aurelie Velay","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Xavier Bassand","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Dimitri Bedo","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Clement Baldacini","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Mylene Sagnard","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Dogan-Firat Bozman","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Margaux Della-Chiesa","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Morgane Solis","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Floriane Gallais","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Noelle Cognard","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Jerome Olagne","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Heloise Delagreverie","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Louise Gontard","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Baptiste Panaget","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"David Marx","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Francoise Heibel","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Laura Braun-Parvez","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Bruno Moulin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Sophie Caillard","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Samira Fafi-Kremer","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.17.20133389","rel_title":"A novel comprehensive metric to assess COVID-19 testing outcomes: Effects of geography, government, and policy response","rel_date":"2020-06-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.17.20133389","rel_abs":"Testing and case identification are key strategies in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Contact tracing and isolation are only possible if cases have been identified. The effectiveness of testing must be tracked, but a single comprehensive metric is not available to assess testing effectiveness, and no timely estimates of case detection rate are available globally, making inter-country comparisons difficult. The purpose of this paper was to propose a single, comprehensive metric, called the COVID-19 Testing Index (CovTI) scaled from 0 to 100, that incorporated several testing metrics. The index was based on case-fatality rate, test positivity rate, active cases, and an estimate of the detection rate. It used parsimonious modeling to estimate the true total number of COVID-19 cases based on deaths, testing, health system capacity, and government transparency. Publicly reported data from 188 countries and territories were included in the index. Estimates of detection rates aligned with previous estimates in literature (R2=0.97). As of June 3, 2020, the states with the highest CovTI included Iceland, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and Thailand, and some island nations. Globally, CovTI increased from April 20 ([x]=43.2) to June 3 ([x]=52.2) but declined in ca. 10% of countries. Bivariate analyses showed the average in countries with open public testing policies (59.7, 95% CI 55.6-63.8) were significantly higher than countries with no testing policy (30.2, 95% CI 18.1-42.3) (p<0.0001). A multiple linear regression model assessed the association of independent grouping variables with CovTI. Open public testing and extensive contact tracing were shown to significantly increase CovTI, after adjusting for extrinsic factors, including geographic isolation and centralized forms of government. This tool may be useful for policymakers to assess testing effectiveness, inform decisions, and identify model countries. It may also serve as a tool for researchers in analyses by combining it with other databases.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anthony C Kuster","author_inst":"Faculty of Public Health, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Hans J Overgaard","author_inst":"Faculty of Science and Technology, Norwegian University of Life Sciences, Norway"},{"author_name":"Maris-Josee Wendling","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Peggy Perrin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France.; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Aurelie Velay","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Xavier Bassand","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Dimitri Bedo","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Clement Baldacini","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Mylene Sagnard","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Dogan-Firat Bozman","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Margaux Della-Chiesa","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Morgane Solis","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Floriane Gallais","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Noelle Cognard","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Jerome Olagne","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Heloise Delagreverie","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Louise Gontard","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Baptiste Panaget","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"David Marx","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Francoise Heibel","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Laura Braun-Parvez","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Bruno Moulin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Sophie Caillard","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Samira Fafi-Kremer","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.17.20133702","rel_title":"Statistical Issues and Lessons Learned from COVID-19 Clinical Trials with Lopinavir-Ritonavir and Remdesivir","rel_date":"2020-06-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.17.20133702","rel_abs":"Background: Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in December 2019, it has rapidly spread in more than 200 countries or territories with over 8 million confirmed cases and 440,000 deaths by June 17, 2020. Recently, three randomized clinical trials on COVID-19 treatments were completed, one for lopinavir-ritonavir and two for remdesivir. One trial reported that remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery, while the other two showed no benefit of the treatment under investigation. However, several statistical issues in the original design and analysis of the three trials are identified, which might shed doubts on their findings and the conclusions should be evaluated with cautions. Objective: From statistical perspectives, we identify several issues in the design and analysis of three COVID-19 trials and reanalyze the data from the cumulative incidence curves in the three trials using more appropriate statistical methods. Methods: The lopinavir-ritonavir trial enrolled 39 additional patients due to insignificant results after the sample size reached the planned number, which led to inflation of the type I error rate. The remdesivir trial of Wang et al. failed to reach the planned sample size due to a lack of eligible patients, while the bootstrap method was used to predict the quantity of clinical interest conditionally and unconditionally if the trial had continued to reach the originally planned sample size. Moreover, we used a terminal (or cure) rate model and a model-free metric known as the restricted mean survival time or the restricted mean time to improvement (RMTI) in this context to analyze the reconstructed data due to the existence of death as competing risk and a terminal event. The remdesivir trial of Beigel et al. reported the median recovery time of the remdesivir and placebo groups and the rate ratio for recovery, while both quantities depend on a particular time point representing local information. We reanalyzed the data to report other percentiles of the time to recovery and adopted the bootstrap method and permutation test to construct the confidence intervals as well as the P values. The restricted mean time to recovery (RMTR) was also computed as a global and robust measure for efficacy. Results: For the lopinavir-ritonavir trial, with the increase of sample size from 160 to 199, the type I error rate was inflated from 0.05 to 0.071. The difference of terminal rates was -8.74% (95% CI [-21.04, 3.55]; P=.16) and the hazards ratio (HR) adjusted for terminal rates was 1.05 (95% CI [0.78, 1.42]; P=.74), indicating no significant difference. The difference of RMTIs between the two groups evaluated at day 28 was -1.67 days (95% CI [-3.62, 0.28]; P=.09) in favor of lopinavir-ritonavir but not statistically significant. For the remdesivir trial of Wang et al., the difference of terminal rates was -0.89% (95% CI [-2.84, 1.06]; P=.19) and the HR adjusted for terminal rates was 0.92 (95% CI [0.63, 1.35]; P=.67). The difference of RMTIs at day 28 was -0.89 day (95% CI [-2.84, 1.06]; P=.37). The planned sample size was 453, yet only 236 patients were enrolled. The conditional prediction shows that the HR estimates would reach statistical significance if the target sample size had been maintained, and both conditional and unconditional prediction delivered significant HR results if the trial had continued to double the target sample size. For the remdesivir trial of Beigel et al., the difference of RMTRs between the remdesivir and placebo groups up to day 30 was -2.7 days (95% CI [-4.0, -1.2]; P<.001), confirming the superiority of remdesivir. The difference in recovery time at the 25th percentile (95% CI [-3, 0]; P=.65) was insignificant, while the differences manifested to be statistically significant at larger percentiles. Conclusions: Based on the statistical issues and lessons learned from the recent three clinical trials on COVID-19 treatments, we suggest more appropriate approaches for the design and analysis for ongoing and future COVID-19 trials.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guosheng Yin","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Chenyang Zhang","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Huaqing Jin","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Peggy Perrin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France.; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Aurelie Velay","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Xavier Bassand","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Dimitri Bedo","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Clement Baldacini","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Mylene Sagnard","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Dogan-Firat Bozman","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Margaux Della-Chiesa","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Morgane Solis","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Floriane Gallais","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Noelle Cognard","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Jerome Olagne","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Heloise Delagreverie","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Louise Gontard","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Baptiste Panaget","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"David Marx","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Francoise Heibel","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Laura Braun-Parvez","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Bruno Moulin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Sophie Caillard","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Samira Fafi-Kremer","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.17.20134015","rel_title":"Analysis of Genetic Host Response Risk Factors in Severe COVID-19 Patients","rel_date":"2020-06-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.17.20134015","rel_abs":"BACKGROUND Epidemiological studies indicate that as many as 20% of individuals who test positive for COVID-19 develop severe symptoms that can require hospitalization. These symptoms include low platelet count, severe hypoxia, increased inflammatory cytokines and reduced glomerular filtration rate. Additionally, severe COVID-19 is associated with several chronic co-morbidities, including cardiovascular disease, hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The identification of genetic risk factors that impact differential host responses to SARS-CoV-2, resulting in the development of severe COVID-19, is important in gaining greater understanding into the biological mechanisms underpinning life-threatening responses to the virus. These insights could be used in the identification of high-risk individuals and for the development of treatment strategies for these patients. METHODS As of June 6, 2020, there were 976 patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and were hospitalized, indicating they had a severe response to SARS-CoV-2. There were however too few patients with a mild form of COVID-19 to use this cohort as our control population. Instead we used similar control criteria to our previous study looking at shared genetic risk factors between severe COVID-19 and sepsis, selecting controls who had not developed sepsis despite having maximum co-morbidity risk and exposure to sepsis-causing pathogens. RESULTS Using a combinatorial (high-order epistasis) analysis approach, we identified 68 protein-coding genes that were highly associated with severe COVID-19. At the time of analysis, nine of these genes have been linked to differential response to SARS-CoV-2. We also found many novel targets that are involved in key biological pathways associated with the development of severe COVID-19, including production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, endothelial cell dysfunction, lipid droplets, neurodegeneration and viral susceptibility factors. CONCLUSION The variants we found in genes relating to immune response pathways and cytokine production cascades, were in equal proportions across all severe COVID-19 patients, regardless of their co-morbidities. This suggests that such variants are not associated with any specific co-morbidity, but are common amongst patients who develop severe COVID-19. Among the 68 severe COVID-19 risk-associated genes, we found several druggable protein targets and pathways. Nine are targeted by drugs that have reached at least Phase I clinical trials, and a further eight have active chemical starting points for novel drug development. Several of these targets were particularly enriched in specific co-morbidities, providing insights into shared pathological mechanisms underlying both the development of severe COVID-19, ARDS and these predisposing co-morbidities. We can use these insights to identify patients who are at greatest risk of contracting severe COVID-19 and develop targeted therapeutic strategies for them, with the aim of improving disease burden and survival rates.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Krystyna Taylor","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Sayoni Das","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Matthew Pearson","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"James Kozubek","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Marcin Pawlowski","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Claus Erik Jensen","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Zbigniew Skowron","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Gert Lykke M\u00f8ller","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Mark Strivens","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Steve Gardner","author_inst":"PrecisionLife Ltd"},{"author_name":"Margaux Della-Chiesa","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Morgane Solis","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Floriane Gallais","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Noelle Cognard","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Jerome Olagne","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Heloise Delagreverie","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Louise Gontard","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Baptiste Panaget","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"David Marx","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Francoise Heibel","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Laura Braun-Parvez","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Bruno Moulin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Sophie Caillard","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Samira Fafi-Kremer","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"genetic and genomic medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.16.20132688","rel_title":"Assessing the impact of coordinated COVID-19 exit strategies across Europe","rel_date":"2020-06-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.16.20132688","rel_abs":"As rates of new COVID-19 cases decline across Europe due to non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing policies and lockdown measures, countries require guidance on how to ease restrictions while minimizing the risk of resurgent outbreaks.

Containing the virus has proven difficult, in large part due to its high transmissibility during the pre-symptomatic incubation. The study's aim was to determine if changes in respiratory rate could serve as a leading indicator of SARS-CoV-2 infections. A total of 271 individuals (age = 37.3 {+\/-} 9.5, 190 male, 81 female) who experienced symptoms consistent with COVID-19 were included - 81 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 190 tested negative; these 271 individuals collectively contributed 2672 samples (days) of data (1856 healthy days, 231 while infected with COVID-19 and 585 while infected with something other than COVID-19). To train a novel algorithm, individuals were segmented as follows; (1) a training dataset of individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 (n=57 people, 537 samples); (2) a validation dataset of individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 (n=24 people, 320 samples) ; (3) a validation dataset of individuals who tested negative for COVID-19 (n=190 people, 1815 samples). All data was extracted from the WHOOP system, which uses data from a wrist-worn strap to produce validated estimates of respiratory rate and other physiological measures. Using the training dataset, a model was developed to estimate the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on changes in respiratory rate during night-time sleep. The model's ability to identify COVID-positive individuals not used in training and robustness against COVID-negative individuals with similar symptoms were examined for a critical six-day period spanning the onset of symptoms. The model identified 20% of COVID-19 positive individuals in the validation dataset in the two days prior to symptom onset, and 80% of COVID-19 positive cases by the third day of symptoms.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dean J Miller","author_inst":"CQUniversity"},{"author_name":"John V Capodilupo","author_inst":"Whoop Inc."},{"author_name":"Michele Lastella","author_inst":"CQUniversity"},{"author_name":"Charli Sargent","author_inst":"CQUniversity"},{"author_name":"Gregory D Roach","author_inst":"CQUniversity"},{"author_name":"Victoria H Lee","author_inst":"Whoop Inc."},{"author_name":"Emily R Capodilupo","author_inst":"Whoop Inc."},{"author_name":"Alessandra Carioli","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Joshua Gwinn","author_inst":"University of Kentucky"},{"author_name":"Jessica Steele","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Olivia Prosper","author_inst":"University of Tennessee"},{"author_name":"Aaron Schneider","author_inst":"Google, Inc"},{"author_name":"Andrew Oplinger","author_inst":"Google, Inc"},{"author_name":"Paul Eastham","author_inst":"Google, Inc"},{"author_name":"Andrew J Tatem","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Heloise Delagreverie","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Louise Gontard","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Baptiste Panaget","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"David Marx","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Francoise Heibel","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Laura Braun-Parvez","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Bruno Moulin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Sophie Caillard","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Samira Fafi-Kremer","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.16.20132597","rel_title":"Hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin and in-hospital mortality or discharge in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection: a cohort study of 4,642 in-patients in France","rel_date":"2020-06-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.16.20132597","rel_abs":"Objective To assess the clinical effectiveness of oral hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) with or without azithromycin (AZI) in preventing death or leading to hospital discharge.

The study population was restricted to patients who did not receive COVID-19 treatments assessed in ongoing trials, including antivirals and immunosuppressive drugs. End of follow-up was defined as the date of death, discharge home, day 28 after admission, whichever occurred first, or administrative censoring on May 4, 2020. Intervention Patients were further classified into 3 groups: (i) receiving HCQ alone, (ii) receiving HCQ together with AZI, and (iii) receiving neither HCQ nor AZI. Exposure to a HCQ\/AZI combination was defined as a simultaneous prescription of the 2 treatments (more or less one day). Main outcome measures The primary outcome was all-cause 28-day mortality as a time-to-event endpoint under a competing risks survival analysis framework. The secondary outcome was 28-day discharge home. Augmented inverse probability of treatment weighted (AIPTW) estimates of the average treatment effect (ATE) were computed to account for confounding. Results A total of 4,642 patients (mean age: 66.1 +\/- 18; males: 2,738 (59%)) were included, of whom 623 (13.4%) received HCQ alone, 227 (5.9%) received HCQ plus AZI, and 3,792 (81.7%) neither drug. Patients receiving \"HCQ alone\" or \"HCQ plus AZI\" were more likely younger, males, current smokers and overall presented with slightly more co-morbidities (obesity, diabetes, any chronic pulmonary diseases, liver diseases), while no major difference was apparent in biological parameters. After accounting for confounding, no statistically significant difference was observed between the \"HCQ\" and \"Neither drug\" groups for 28-day mortality: AIPTW absolute difference in ATE was +1.24% (-5.63 to 8.12), ratio in ATE 1.05 (0.77 to 1.33). 28-day discharge rates were statistically significantly higher in the \"HCQ\" group: AIPTW absolute difference in ATE (+11.1% [3.30 to 18.9]), ratio in ATE (1.25 [1.07 to 1.42]). As for the \"HCQ+AZI\" vs neither drug, trends for significant differences and ratios in AIPTW ATE were found suggesting higher mortality rates in the former group (difference in ATE +9.83% [-0.51 to 20.17], ratio in ATE 1.40 [0.98 to 1.81];p=0.062). Conclusions Using a large non-selected population of inpatients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection in 39 hospitals in France and robust methodological approaches, we found no evidence for efficacy of HCQ or HCQ combined with AZI on 28-day mortality. Our results suggested a possible excess risk of mortality associated with HCQ combined with AZI, but not with HCQ alone. Significantly higher rates of discharge home were observed in patients treated by HCQ, a novel finding warranting further confirmation in replicative studies. Altogether, our findings further support the need to complete currently undergoing randomized clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emilie Sbidian","author_inst":"APHP hospital"},{"author_name":"Julie Josse","author_inst":"Polytechnique"},{"author_name":"Guillaume Lemaitre","author_inst":"INRIA"},{"author_name":"Imke Mayer","author_inst":"EHESS"},{"author_name":"Melodie Bernaux","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Gramfort","author_inst":"INRIA"},{"author_name":"Nathanael Lapidus","author_inst":"INRIA"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Paris","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Antoine Neuraz","author_inst":"Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ivan Lerner","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Garcelon","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Bastien Rance","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Olivier Grisel","author_inst":"INRIA"},{"author_name":"Thomas Moreau","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Ali Bellamine","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Pierre Wolkenstein","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Gael Varoquaux","author_inst":"INRIA"},{"author_name":"Eric Caumes","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Marc Lavielle","author_inst":"INRIA"},{"author_name":"Armand Mekontso Dessap","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Etienne Audureau","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Bruno Moulin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Sophie Caillard","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Samira Fafi-Kremer","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pharmacology and therapeutics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.16.20133280","rel_title":"The effectiveness of interventions to reduce COVID-19 transmission in a large urban jail","rel_date":"2020-06-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.16.20133280","rel_abs":"Objectives: To estimate the impact of various mitigation strategies on COVID-19 transmission in a U.S. jail beyond those offered in national guidelines. Methods: We developed a stochastic dynamic transmission model of COVID-19 in one large urban U.S. jail among staff and incarcerated individuals. We divided the outbreak into four intervention phases: the start of the outbreak, depopulation of the jail, increased proportion of people in single cells, and asymptomatic testing. We used the next generation method to estimate the basic reproduction ratio, R0, in each phase. We estimated the fraction of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths averted by these interventions along with the standard measures of sanitization, masking, and social distancing interventions. Results: For the first outbreak phase, the estimated R0 was 8.23 (95% CrI: 5.01-12.90), and for the subsequent phases, R0, phase 2 = 3.58 (95% CrI: 2.46-5.08), R0, phase 3 = 1.72 (95% CrI: 1.41-2.12), and R0, phase 4 = 0.45 (95% CrI: 0.32-0.59). In total, the jail's interventions prevented approximately 83% of projected cases and hospitalizations and 89% of deaths over 83 days. Conclusions: Depopulation, single celling, and asymptomatic testing within jails can be effective strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in addition to standard public health measures. Policy Implications: Decision-makers should prioritize reductions in the jail population, single celling, and testing asymptomatic populations, as additional measures to manage COVID-19 within correctional settings.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giovanni S.P.

We aimed to determine whether a 6-day course of intravenous methylprednisolone (MP) improves outcome in patients with SARS CoV-2 infection at risk of developing Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Methods. Multicentric, partially randomized, preference, open-label trial, including adults with COVID-19 pneumonia, impaired gas exchange and biochemical evidence of hyper-inflammation. Patients were assigned to standard of care (SOC), or SOC plus intravenous MP [40mg\/12h 3 days, then 20mg\/12h 3 days]. The primary endpoint was a composite of death, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) or requirement of non-invasive ventilation (NIV). Results. We analyzed 85 patients (34, randomized to MP; 22, assigned to MP by clinician preference; 29, control group). Patient age (mean 68{+\/-}yr) was related to outcome. The use of MP was associated with a reduced risk of the composite endpoint in the intention-to-treat, age-stratified analysis (combined risk ratio -RR- 0.55 [95% CI 0.33-0.91]; p=0.024). In the per-protocol analysis, RR was 0.11 (0.01-0.83) in patients aged 72 yr or less, 0.61 (0.32-1.17) in those over 72 yr, and 0.37 (0.19-0.74, p=0.0037) in the whole group after age-adjustment by stratification. The decrease in C-reactive protein levels was more pronounced in the MP group (p=0.0003). Hyperglycemia was more frequent in the MP group. Conclusions A short course of MP had a beneficial effect on the clinical outcome of severe COVID-19 pneumonia, decreasing the risk of the composite end point of admission to ICU, NIV or death.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luis Corral","author_inst":"Hospital Rio Hortega"},{"author_name":"Alberto Bahamonde","author_inst":"Hsopital Bierzo"},{"author_name":"Francisco Arnaiz delas Revillas","author_inst":"Hospital UM Valdecilla"},{"author_name":"Julia Gomez-Barquero","author_inst":"Hospital Rio Hortega"},{"author_name":"Jesica Abadia-Otero","author_inst":"Hospital Rio Hortega"},{"author_name":"Carmen Garcia-Ibarbia","author_inst":"Hospital UM Valdecilla"},{"author_name":"Victor Mora","author_inst":"Hospital UM Valdecilla"},{"author_name":"Ana cerezo-hernandez","author_inst":"Hospital Rio Hortega"},{"author_name":"Jose L Hernandez","author_inst":"University of Cantabria"},{"author_name":"Graciela Lopez-Muniz","author_inst":"Hospital Rio Hortega"},{"author_name":"Fernando Hernandez-Blanco","author_inst":"Hospital Bierzo"},{"author_name":"Jose M Cifrian","author_inst":"Hospital UM Valdecilla"},{"author_name":"Jose M Olmos","author_inst":"University of Cantabria"},{"author_name":"Miguel Carrascosa","author_inst":"Hospital Laredo"},{"author_name":"maria Carmen farinas","author_inst":"University of Cantabria"},{"author_name":"Jose A Riancho","author_inst":"University of Cantabria"},{"author_name":"- Glucocovid investigators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Eric Caumes","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Marc Lavielle","author_inst":"INRIA"},{"author_name":"Armand Mekontso Dessap","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Etienne Audureau","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Bruno Moulin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Sophie Caillard","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Samira Fafi-Kremer","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.17.20133629","rel_title":"Introduction to and spread of COVID-19 in care homes in Norfolk, UK","rel_date":"2020-06-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.17.20133629","rel_abs":"BACKGROUND: Residential care homes for the elderly have been important settings for transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 disease. METHODS: We undertook a secondary analysis of a dataset about 248 care homes in the county of Norfolk, eastern England. The dataset recorded categories of staff (nurses, care workers and non-care workers), their status (available, absent due to leave or sickness and extra staff needed to address the coronavirus pandemic) in the period 6 April -6 May 2020. Counts of residents (if any) at each care home with COVID-19 were also available, as well as descriptions of access by the home to personal protection equipment (PPE: gloves, masks, eye protection, aprons and Sanitiser). PPE access was categorised as (most to least) green, amber or red. We undertook two stage modelling, first for any detection of COVID-19 in the homes, and a second model to relate any increases in case counts after introduction to staffing or PPE levels. RESULTS: We found that the counts of non-care workers had strongest relationships (and only link significant at p < 0.05) to any introduction of SARS-CoV-2 to the homes. After a home had at least one detected case, higher staff levels and more severe PPE shortages were most linked to higher case counts (p < 0.05) during the monitoring period. CONCLUSION: Better managing aspects of staff interaction with residents and some working practices should help reduce ingression to and spread of COVID-19 within residential homes for the elderly.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julii Suzanne Brainard","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Steven Rushton","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Tim Winters","author_inst":"Norfolk County Council"},{"author_name":"Paul R Hunter","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Jesica Abadia-Otero","author_inst":"Hospital Rio Hortega"},{"author_name":"Carmen Garcia-Ibarbia","author_inst":"Hospital UM Valdecilla"},{"author_name":"Victor Mora","author_inst":"Hospital UM Valdecilla"},{"author_name":"Ana cerezo-hernandez","author_inst":"Hospital Rio Hortega"},{"author_name":"Jose L Hernandez","author_inst":"University of Cantabria"},{"author_name":"Graciela Lopez-Muniz","author_inst":"Hospital Rio Hortega"},{"author_name":"Fernando Hernandez-Blanco","author_inst":"Hospital Bierzo"},{"author_name":"Jose M Cifrian","author_inst":"Hospital UM Valdecilla"},{"author_name":"Jose M Olmos","author_inst":"University of Cantabria"},{"author_name":"Miguel Carrascosa","author_inst":"Hospital Laredo"},{"author_name":"maria Carmen farinas","author_inst":"University of Cantabria"},{"author_name":"Jose A Riancho","author_inst":"University of Cantabria"},{"author_name":"- Glucocovid investigators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Eric Caumes","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Marc Lavielle","author_inst":"INRIA"},{"author_name":"Armand Mekontso Dessap","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Etienne Audureau","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Bruno Moulin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Sophie Caillard","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Samira Fafi-Kremer","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.16.20133256","rel_title":"Exosomal microRNAs Drive Thrombosis in COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-06-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.16.20133256","rel_abs":"Thrombotic and thromboembolic complications have been shown to play a critical role in the clinical outcome of COVID-19.

While infectious SARS-CoV-2 has yet to be identified in the aquatic environment, the virus potentially enters the wastewater stream from patient excretions and thus can be a great tool for pandemic monitoring.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Manish Kumar","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar, India"},{"author_name":"Arbind K Patel","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India"},{"author_name":"Anil V Shah","author_inst":"Gujarat Pollution Control Board, Gandhinagar, India"},{"author_name":"Janvi Raval","author_inst":"Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Neha Rajpara","author_inst":"Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Madhvi Joshi","author_inst":"Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Chaitanya G Joshi","author_inst":"Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre, Gujarat"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Sakel","author_inst":"East Kent University NHS Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rafey Faruqui","author_inst":"Kent & Medway NHS and Social care Partnership Trust"},{"author_name":"Ikbal Kabir Jahid","author_inst":"Jashore University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zahid Hossain","author_inst":"Bangladesh Health Professions Institute"},{"author_name":"Jose M Cifrian","author_inst":"Hospital UM Valdecilla"},{"author_name":"Jose M Olmos","author_inst":"University of Cantabria"},{"author_name":"Miguel Carrascosa","author_inst":"Hospital Laredo"},{"author_name":"maria Carmen farinas","author_inst":"University of Cantabria"},{"author_name":"Jose A Riancho","author_inst":"University of Cantabria"},{"author_name":"- Glucocovid investigators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Eric Caumes","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Marc Lavielle","author_inst":"INRIA"},{"author_name":"Armand Mekontso Dessap","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Etienne Audureau","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Bruno Moulin","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Sophie Caillard","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Samira Fafi-Kremer","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Strasbourg University Hospital, Strasbourg, France; INSERM U1109, LabEx TRANSPLANTEX Strasbourg, France"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.16.20133116","rel_title":"Mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in two longitudinal UK population cohorts","rel_date":"2020-06-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.16.20133116","rel_abs":"Background: The impact of COVID-19 on mental health is unclear. Evidence from longitudinal studies with pre pandemic data are needed to address (1) how mental health has changed from pre-pandemic levels to during the COVID-19 pandemic and (2), whether there are groups at greater risk of poorer mental health during the pandemic? Methods: We used data from COVID-19 surveys (completed through April\/May 2020), nested within two large longitudinal population cohorts with harmonised measures of mental health: two generations of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALPSAC): the index generation ALSPAC-G1 (n= 2850, mean age 28) and the parents generation ALSPAC-G0 (n= 3720, mean age = 59) and Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study (GS, (n= 4233, mean age = 59), both with validated pre-pandemic measures of mental health and baseline factors. To answer question 1, we used ALSPAC-G1, which has identical mental health measures before and during the pandemic. Question 2 was addressed using both studies, using pre-pandemic and COVID-19 specific factors to explore associations with depression and anxiety in COVID-19. Findings: In ALSPAC-G1 there was evidence that anxiety and lower wellbeing, but not depression, had increased in COVID-19 from pre-pandemic assessments. The percentage of individuals with probable anxiety disorder was almost double during COVID-19: 24% (95% CI 23%, 26%) compared to pre-pandemic levels (13%, 95% CI 12%, 14%), with clinically relevant effect sizes. In both ALSPAC and GS, depression and anxiety were greater in younger populations, women, those with pre-existing mental and physical health conditions, those living alone and in socio-economic adversity. We did not detect evidence for elevated risk in key workers or health care workers. Interpretation: These results suggest increases in anxiety and lower wellbeing that may be related to the COVID-19 pandemic and\/or its management, particularly in young people. This research highlights that specific groups may be disproportionally at risk of elevated levels of depression and anxiety during COVID-19 and supports recent calls for increasing funds for mental health services.

Many hard-hit localities have witnessed a large influx of severe cases that strained existing hospitals. As COVID-19 spreads in India, it is essential to evaluate the country's capacity to treat severe cases. Methods We combined data on public and private sector hospitals in India to produce state level estimates of hospital beds, ICU beds, and mechanical ventilators. Based on the number of public sector hospitals from the 2019 National Health Profile (NHP) of India and the relative proportions of public and private health care facilities from the National Sample Survey (NSS) 75th round (2017-2018), we estimated capacity in each Indian state and union territory (UT). We assumed that 5% of all hospital beds were ICU beds and that 50% of ICU beds were equipped with ventilators. Results We estimated that India has approximately 1.9 million hospital beds, 95,000 ICU beds and 48,000 ventilators. Nationally, resources are concentrated in the private sector (hospital beds: 1,185,242 private vs 713,986 public; ICU beds: 59,262 private vs 35,699 public; ventilators: 29,631 private vs. 17,850 public). Our findings suggest substantial variation in available resources across states and UTs. Conclusion Some projections shave suggested a potential need for approximately 270,000 ICU beds in an optimistic scenario, over 2.8 times the estimated number of total available ICU beds in India. Additional resources will likely be required to accommodate patients with severe COVID-19 infections in India.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Geetanjali Kapoor","author_inst":"Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Hauck","author_inst":"Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Aditi Sriram","author_inst":"Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Jyoti Joshi","author_inst":"Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Emily Schueller","author_inst":"Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Isabel Frost","author_inst":"Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Ruchita Balasubramanian","author_inst":"Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Ramanan Laxminarayan","author_inst":"Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Arindam Nandi","author_inst":"The Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Stan Zammit","author_inst":"Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"David J Gunnell","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Paul Moran","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Nadia Micali","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Abraham Reichenberg","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hickman","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Dheeraj Rai","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Simon Haworth","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Archie Campbell","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Drew Altschul","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Robin Flaig","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Andrew M McIntosh","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Deborah A Lawlor","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"David Porteous","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J Timpson","author_inst":"University of Bristol"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.16.20132878","rel_title":"The Cardiac Toxicity of Chloroquine or Hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-regression Analysis","rel_date":"2020-06-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.16.20132878","rel_abs":"Abstract Importance The antimalarial agents chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been proposed as a potential treatment for COVID-19 due their effect on several cellular processes that impact viral replication. Although more than 100 ongoing trials are testing their efficacy, CQ and HCQ are being used widely in clinical practice, exposing COVID-19 patients to potentially significant cardiac adverse effects. Objective To systematically review the literature and estimate the risk of cardiac toxicity in patients receiving CQ or HCQ for COVID-19. Data Sources A systematic search was conducted on May 27, 2020 of Ovid EBM Reviews, Ovid Embase (1974+), Ovid Medline (1946+ including epub ahead of print, in-process & other non-indexed citations), Scopus (1970+) and Web of Science (1975+) and preprint servers (Medrvix and ResearchSquare) and manual search of references lists. Study Selection Studies that included COVID-19 patients treated with CQ or HCQ, with or without azithromycin, were included as follows: (1) COVID-19 patient population, (2) the study included more than 10 patients receiving either one of the medications, (3) reported electrocardiographic changes and\/or cardiac arrhythmias. Data Extraction and Synthesis Study characteristics and endpoints incidence were extracted. Due to the very low incidence of torsades de pointes (TdP) and other endpoints (rare events), the arcsine transformation was used to obtain a pooled estimate of the different incidences using a random-effects meta-analysis. Meta-regression analyses were used to assess whether the incidence of different endpoints significantly varied by multiple study-level variables specified a priori. Main Outcomes and Measures Pooled Incidence of: (1) change in QTc value from baseline [&ge;] 60 ms, (2) QTc [&ge;] 500 ms, (3) the composite of endpoint 1 and 2, (4) TdP arrhythmia or ventricular tachycardia (VT) or cardiac arrest, (5) discontinuation of treatment due to drug-induced QT prolongation or arrhythmias. Results A total of 19 studies with a total of 5652 patients were included. All included studies were of high methodological quality in terms of exposure ascertainment or outcome assessment. Among 2719 patients treated with CQ or HCQ, only two episodes of TdP were reported; the pooled incidence of TdP arrhythmia or VT or cardiac arrest was 3 per 1000, 95% CI (0-21), I2=96%, 18 studies with 3725 patients. Among 13 studies of 4334 patients, the pooled incidence of discontinuation of CQ or HCQ due to prolonged QTc or arrhythmias was 5%, 95% CI (1-11), I2=98%. The pooled incidence of change in QTc from baseline of [&ge;] 60 ms was 7%, 95% CI (3-14), I2=94% (12 studies of 2008 patients). The pooled incidence of QTc [&ge;] 500 ms was 6%, 95% CI (2-12), I2=95% (16 studies of 2317 patients). Among 11 studies of 3127 patients, the pooled incidence of change in QTc from baseline of [&ge;] 60 ms or QTc [&ge;] 500 ms was 9%, 95% CI (3-17), I2=97%. Mean\/median age, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, concomitant QT prolonging medications, ICU care, and severity of illness in the study populations explained between-studies heterogeneity. Conclusions and Relevance Treatment of COVID-19 patients with CQ or HCQ is associated with a significant risk of drug-induced QT prolongation, which is a harbinger for drug-induced TdP\/VT or cardiac arrest. CQ\/HCQ use resulted in a relatively higher incidence of TdP as compared to drugs withdrawn from the market for this particular adverse effect. Therefore, these agents should be used only in the context of randomized clinical trials, in patients at low risk for drug-induced QT prolongation, with adequate safety monitoring.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Imad Tleyjeh","author_inst":"King Fahd Medical City"},{"author_name":"Zakariya Kashour","author_inst":"University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Ca"},{"author_name":"Oweida AlDosary","author_inst":"King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Riaz","author_inst":"Quaid Azam University Islamabad, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Haytham Tlayjeh","author_inst":"King Abdulaziz Medical City, King Saud bin Abdulaziz for Health Sciences and King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Musa A Garbati","author_inst":"University of Maiduguri, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Rana Tleyjeh","author_inst":"Al Faisal University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Mouaz H Al-Mallah","author_inst":"Houston Methodist DeBakey Heart and Vascular Center, Houston, TX , USA"},{"author_name":"Rizwan M Sohail","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, Rochester, MN, USA"},{"author_name":"Dana Gerberi","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA"},{"author_name":"Aref A Bin Abdulhak","author_inst":"Swedish Medical Center, Seattle, WA, USA"},{"author_name":"John R Giudicessi","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, Rochester, MN, USA"},{"author_name":"Michael John Ackerman","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, Rochester, MN, USA"},{"author_name":"Tarek Kashour","author_inst":"King Saud University Medical City  Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hickman","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Dheeraj Rai","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Simon Haworth","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Archie Campbell","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Drew Altschul","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Robin Flaig","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Andrew M McIntosh","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Deborah A Lawlor","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"David Porteous","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J Timpson","author_inst":"University of Bristol"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.17.20133348","rel_title":"Perceived Challenges of COVID-19 Infection Prevention and Control Preparedness: A Multinational Survey","rel_date":"2020-06-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.17.20133348","rel_abs":"Objectives Implementation of effective infection prevention and control (IPC) measures is needed to support global capacity building to limit transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and mitigate its impact on health systems.

Methods A cross-sectional survey using an electronic survey was circulated between February 26, 2020, and March 20, 2020, to IPC professionals during COVID-19 pandemic. The survey addressed the presence of COVID-19 guidelines as well as specific IPC preparedness activities in response to the outbreak. Findings In total, 339 IPC professionals spanning 63 countries in all 6 World Health Organization (WHO) regions, mostly from tertiary care centres participated. Of all participants, 66{middle dot}6% were aware of the existence of national guidelines to prevent COVID-19. A shortage of PPE supplies was reported by 48% (ranging from 64{middle dot}2% in low-income countries to 27{middle dot}4% in high-income countries); 41{middle dot}5% of respondents considered that the media had an impact on guideline development and 63{middle dot}6% believed that guidelines were based on maximum security rather than on evidence-based analyses. 58{middle dot}5% and 72{middle dot}7% of participants believed that healthcare facilities and community settings respectively were not sufficiently prepared. Conclusion Results revealed lack of guidelines and concerns over insufficient PPE supply in both high- and low-income countries. Our findings should alert national health authorities to ramp up the implementation of IPC measures and focus on long-term preparedness and readiness for future pandemics, likely requiring government funds rather than reliance on healthcare institutions.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"ERMIRA TARTARI","author_inst":"University of Malta"},{"author_name":"Joost Hopman","author_inst":"Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Benedetta Allegranzi","author_inst":"World Health Organziation"},{"author_name":"Bin Gao","author_inst":"Tianjin 4th Centre Hospital"},{"author_name":"Andreas Widmer","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Vincent Chi-Chung Cheng","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Shuk Ching Wong","author_inst":"Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Kalisvar Marimuthu","author_inst":"Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Folasade Ogunsola","author_inst":"College of Medicine of the University of Lagos, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Andreas Voss","author_inst":"Radboud University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Aref A Bin Abdulhak","author_inst":"Swedish Medical Center, Seattle, WA, USA"},{"author_name":"John R Giudicessi","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, Rochester, MN, USA"},{"author_name":"Michael John Ackerman","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, Rochester, MN, USA"},{"author_name":"Tarek Kashour","author_inst":"King Saud University Medical City  Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hickman","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Dheeraj Rai","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Simon Haworth","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Archie Campbell","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Drew Altschul","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Robin Flaig","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Andrew M McIntosh","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Deborah A Lawlor","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"David Porteous","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J Timpson","author_inst":"University of Bristol"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.17.20133520","rel_title":"Effect of evacuation of Japanese residents from Wuhan, China, on preventing transmission of novel coronavirus infection: a modelling study","rel_date":"2020-06-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.17.20133520","rel_abs":"Objective: In late January 2020, the Japanese government carried out three evacuations by aircraft from Wuhan, China, to avoid further cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among Wuhan's Japanese residents.

Scalable, sensitive and specific serological assays are essential to this process. The detection of antibody in hospitalized patients with severe disease has proven straightforward; detecting responses in subjects with mild disease and asymptomatic infections has proven less reliable. We hypothesized that the suboptimal sensitivity of antibody assays and the compartmentalization of the antibody response may contribute to this effect. Methods: We systemically developed an ELISA assay, optimising different antigens and amplification steps, in serum and saliva from symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects. Results: Using trimeric spike glycoprotein, rather than nucleocapsid enabled detection of responses in individuals with low antibody responses. IgG1 and IgG3 predominate to both antigens, but more anti-spike IgG1 than IgG3 was detectable. All antigens were effective for detecting responses in hospitalized patients. Anti-spike, but not nucleocapsid, IgG, IgA and IgM antibody responses were readily detectable in saliva from non-hospitalized symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Antibody responses in saliva and serum were largely independent of each other and symptom reporting. Conclusions. Detecting antibody responses in both saliva and serum is optimal for determining virus exposure and understanding immune responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Funding.

The diagnosis of infection is complicated by 30-50% of COVID-19 hospital admissions with nose\/throat swabs testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, frequently after the first week of illness when SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses become detectable. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of combined rapid antibody point of care (POC) and nucleic acid assays for suspected COVID-19 disease in the emergency department. Methods We developed (i) an in vitro neutralization assay using a lentivirus expressing a genome encoding luciferase and pseudotyped with spike (S) protein and (ii) an ELISA test to detect IgG antibodies to nucleocapsid (N) and S proteins from SARS-CoV-2. We tested two lateral flow rapid fingerprick tests with bands for IgG and IgM. We then prospectively recruited participants with suspected moderate to severe COVID-19 and tested for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in a combined nasal\/throat swab using the standard laboratory RT-PCR and a validated rapid POC nucleic acid amplification (NAAT) test. Additionally, serum collected at admission was retrospectively tested by in vitro neutralisation, ELISA and the candidate POC antibody tests. We evaluated the performance of the individual and combined rapid POC diagnostic tests against a composite reference standard of neutralisation and standard laboratory based RT-PCR. Results 45 participants had specimens tested for nucleic acid in nose\/throat swabs as well as stored sera for antibodies. Using the composite reference standard, prevalence of COVID-19 disease was 53.3% (24\/45). Median age was 73.5 (IQR 54.0-86.5) years in those with COVID-19 disease by our reference standard and 63.0 (IQR 41.0-72.0) years in those without disease. The overall detection rate by rapid NAAT was 79.2% (95CI 57.8-92.9%), decreasing from 100% (95% CI 65.3-98.6%) in days 1-4 to 50.0% (95% CI 11.8-88.2) for days 9-28 post symptom onset. Correct identification of COVID-19 with combined rapid POC diagnostic tests was 100% (95CI 85.8-100%) with a false positive rate of 5.3-14.3%, driven by POC LFA antibody tests. Conclusions Combined POC tests have the potential to transform our management of COVID-19, including inflammatory manifestations later in disease where nucleic acid test results are negative. A rapid combined approach will also aid recruitment into clinical trials and in prescribing therapeutics, particularly where potentially harmful immune modulators (including steroids) are used.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Petra Mlcochova","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Dami Collier","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Allyson V Ritchie","author_inst":"Diagnostics for the Real World Europe Ltd"},{"author_name":"Sonny M Assennato","author_inst":"DRW"},{"author_name":"Myra Hosmillo","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Neha Goel","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Bo Meng","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Krishna Chatterji","author_inst":"NIHR Cambridge Clinical Research Facility"},{"author_name":"Vivien Mendoza","author_inst":"CUH NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Nigel Temperton","author_inst":"University of Kent"},{"author_name":"Leo Kiss","author_inst":"Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Katarzyna A Ciazyns","author_inst":"Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Xiaoli Xiong","author_inst":"Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"John AG Briggs","author_inst":"Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"James Nathan","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Federica Mescia","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Hongyi Zhang","author_inst":"CUH NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Petros Barmpounakis","author_inst":"Athens University of Economics and Business"},{"author_name":"Nikos Demeris","author_inst":"Cambridge Clinical Trials Unit-Cancer Theme"},{"author_name":"Richard Skells","author_inst":"Cambridge Clinical Trials Unit-Cancer Theme"},{"author_name":"Paul Lyons","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"John Bradley","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Stephen Baker","author_inst":"Cambridge University"},{"author_name":"Jean Pierre Allain","author_inst":"Diagnostics for the Real World EU Ltd"},{"author_name":"Kenneth GC Smith","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Ian Goodfellow","author_inst":"ig299@cam.ac.uk"},{"author_name":"Ravindra K Gupta","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Alex G.
