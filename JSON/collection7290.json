However, little is known about its pathological mechanism, and reports on clinical study on specific treatment are few. Objective: The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy in COVID-19 patients. Design, setting and participants: This multicenter retrospective cohort study enrolled 325 adult critical COVID-19 patients, including severe type and critical type, according to the clinical classification defined by National Health Commission of China, in 8 government designated treatment centers in China from Dec 23, 2019 to Mar 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data as well as prognosis were extracted from electronic medical records. Exposure: IVIG was exposure factor. Main outcomes and measures: Primary outcomes were the 28-day and 60-day mortality, and secondary outcomes were the total length of in-hospital and the total duration of the disease. Meanwhile, the parameters of inflammation responses and organ functions were measured. The risk factors were determined by COX proportional hazards model. The subgroup analysis was carried out according to clinical classification of COVID-19, IVIG dosage, and timing. Results: In the enrolled 325 patients, 222 (68%) were severe type and 103 (32%) were critical type; 42 (13%) died in 28-day within hospitalization, and 54 (17%) died within 60-day; The death in 60-day includes 6 (3%) severe type patients and 48 (47%) critical type patients. 174 cases were used IVIG, and 151 cases were not. Compared with the baseline characteristics between two groups, the results showed that the patients in IVIG group presented higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHII) score and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, higher plasm levels of IL-6 and lactate, and lower lymphocyte count and oxygenation index (all P<0.05). The 28-day and 60-day mortality were not improved with IVIG in overall cohort. The in-hospital stay and the total duration of disease were longer in IVIG group (P<0.001). Risk factors were clinical classifications (hazards ratio 0.126, 95% confidence interval 0.039-0.413, P=0.001), and using IVIG (hazards ratio 0.252, 95% confidence interval 0.107-0.591, P=0.002) with COX proportional hazards model. Subgroup analysis showed that only in patients with critical type, IVIG could significantly reduce the 28-day mortality, decrease the inflammatory response, and improve some organ functions (all P<0.05); and application of IVIG in the early stage (admission[&le;]7 days) with a high dose (>15 g\/d) exhibited significant reduction of 60-day mortality in the critical type patients. Conclusions and Relevance: Early administration of IVIG with high dose improves the prognosis of critical type patients with COVID-19. This study provides important information on clinical application of the IVIG in treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including patient selection and administration timing and dosage.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ziyun Shao Sr.","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, General Hospital of Central Theater Command of PLA, Wuhan, 430070, China."},{"author_name":"Yongwen Feng","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine and Infection Prevention and Control, The Second People's Hospital of Shenzhen 518035, China."},{"author_name":"Li Zhong","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital, Guizhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guiyang, 550001, China."},{"author_name":"Qifeng Xie","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, General Hospital of Southern Theater Command of PLA, Guangzhou, 510010, China."},{"author_name":"Ming Lei","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Guangzhou Eighth people's hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou,510060, China"},{"author_name":"Zheying Liu","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, General Hospital of Southern Theater Command of PLA, Guangzhou, 510010, China."},{"author_name":"Conglin Wang","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, General Hospital of Southern Theater Command of PLA, Guangzhou, 510010, China."},{"author_name":"Jingjing Ji","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, General Hospital of Southern Theater Command of PLA, Guangzhou, 510010, China."},{"author_name":"Huiheng Liu","author_inst":"Department of Emergency, Zhongshan Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361000, China."},{"author_name":"Zhengtao Gu","author_inst":"Department of Treatment Center For Traumatic Injuries, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Southern Medical University, Academy of Orthopedics Guangdong Province, Gu"},{"author_name":"Zhongwei Hu","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Guangzhou Eighth people's hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou,510060, China"},{"author_name":"Lei Su","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, General Hospital of Southern Theater Command of PLA, Guangzhou, 510010, China."},{"author_name":"Min Wu","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine and Infection Prevention and Control, The Second People's Hospital of Shenzhen  518035, China."},{"author_name":"Zhifeng Liu","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, General Hospital of Southern Theater Command of PLA, Guangzhou, 510010, China."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.10.20061291","rel_title":"Modifying reusable elastomeric respirators to utilise breathing system filters with 3D printed adapters, a safe alternative to N95 during COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-04-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.10.20061291","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment including N95 and FFP3 respirators. Reusable elastomeric respirators are suitable alternatives when used with compatible filters. These filters may be difficult to source and elastomeric respirators are not recommended for surgical use as the exhaled air is not filtered. Breathing system filters are routinely used in anaesthetic circuits to filter virus and bacteria. In this study, we designed 3D printed adapters that allowed elastomeric respirators to utilise breathing system filters and made simple modifications to the respirators to filter exhaled breaths. We then evaluated the performance and safety of our modified elastomeric respirators with quantitative fit tests. We recruited 8 volunteers to perform quantitative fit tests. Fit factors, respiratory rate and end-tidal carbon dioxide were recorded before and after wearing the modified respirators for 1 hour. All 8 volunteers obtained fit factors of 200+, the maximum achievable, for all tests exercises in all fit tests. The mean (range) end-tidal carbon dioxide was 4.5 (3.9-5.5) kPa and 4.6 (range 4.1-5.3) kPa before and after 1 hour of usage. The mean (range) respiratory rate was 16.5 (11-24) min-1 and 17.4 (15-22) min-1 before and after 1 hour of usage. Four (50%) did not experience any subjective discomfort while 2 (25%) reported pressure on the face, 1 (12.5%) reported exhalation resistance and 1 (12.5%) reported transient dizziness with exertion. Breathing system filters combined with properly fitted reusable elastomeric respirators is a safe alternative to N95 during the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dexter Chee Yuen Liu","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Tai Hong Koo","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Jackson Kai Kit Wong","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Ying Hong Wong","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Kitty Sau Chun Fung","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Yung Chan","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Huey Sing Lim","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Jingjing Ji","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, General Hospital of Southern Theater Command of PLA, Guangzhou, 510010, China."},{"author_name":"Huiheng Liu","author_inst":"Department of Emergency, Zhongshan Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361000, China."},{"author_name":"Zhengtao Gu","author_inst":"Department of Treatment Center For Traumatic Injuries, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Southern Medical University, Academy of Orthopedics Guangdong Province, Gu"},{"author_name":"Zhongwei Hu","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Guangzhou Eighth people's hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou,510060, China"},{"author_name":"Lei Su","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, General Hospital of Southern Theater Command of PLA, Guangzhou, 510010, China."},{"author_name":"Min Wu","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine and Infection Prevention and Control, The Second People's Hospital of Shenzhen  518035, China."},{"author_name":"Zhifeng Liu","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, General Hospital of Southern Theater Command of PLA, Guangzhou, 510010, China."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"anesthesia"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.10.20061226","rel_title":"An epidemiologic profile of COVID-19 patients in Vietnam","rel_date":"2020-04-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.10.20061226","rel_abs":"Background and Aim. There is a paucity of data on the COVID-19 pandemic in Vietnam. In this paper, we sought to provide an epidemiologic description of patients who were infected with SARS-Cov-2 in Vietnam. Methods. Data were abstracted from the wikipedia's COVID-19 information resource and Johns Hopkins University Dashboard. Demographic data and treatment status were obtained for each patient in each day. The coverage period was from 23\/1\/2020 to 10\/4\/2020. Descriptive analyses of incident cases were stratified by gender and age group. The estimation of the reproduction ratio was done with a bootstrap method using the R statistical environment. Results. During the coverage period, Vietnam has recorded 257 cases of COVID-19. Approximately 54% of the cases were women. The median age of patients was 30 years (range: 3 months to 88 years), with 78% of patients aged 49 or younger. About 66% (n = 171) of patients were overseas tourists (20%) and Vietnamese students or workers returning from overseas (46%). Approximately 57% (n = 144) of patients have been recovered and discharged from hospitals. There have been no mortality. The reproduction ratio was estimated to range between 0.95 and 1.24. Conclusion. These data indicate that a majority of COVID-19 patients in Vietnam was imported cases in overseas tourists and young students and workers who had returned from overseas.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Huy G Nguyen","author_inst":"University of Technology, Sydney, Australia"},{"author_name":"Tuan V Nguyen","author_inst":"Garvan Institute of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Jackson Kai Kit Wong","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Ying Hong Wong","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Kitty Sau Chun Fung","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Yung Chan","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Huey Sing Lim","author_inst":"United Christian Hospital, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Jingjing Ji","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, General Hospital of Southern Theater Command of PLA, Guangzhou, 510010, China."},{"author_name":"Huiheng Liu","author_inst":"Department of Emergency, Zhongshan Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361000, China."},{"author_name":"Zhengtao Gu","author_inst":"Department of Treatment Center For Traumatic Injuries, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Southern Medical University, Academy of Orthopedics Guangdong Province, Gu"},{"author_name":"Zhongwei Hu","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Guangzhou Eighth people's hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou,510060, China"},{"author_name":"Lei Su","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, General Hospital of Southern Theater Command of PLA, Guangzhou, 510010, China."},{"author_name":"Min Wu","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine and Infection Prevention and Control, The Second People's Hospital of Shenzhen  518035, China."},{"author_name":"Zhifeng Liu","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, General Hospital of Southern Theater Command of PLA, Guangzhou, 510010, China."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.10.20060822","rel_title":"Estimate of the Maximum Limit of Total Cases of Infected Patients COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-04-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.10.20060822","rel_abs":"In this work, we present a method to estimate the maximum limit of total cases of COVID-19 considering that the time in which the maximum number of new daily cases occurs corresponds to the inflection point of the curve described by the total number of cases that assumed to have a growth according to a logistical function in which the number of total cases at the inflection point will correspond to half of the maximum limit of total cases COVID-19.

MethodThe data of COVID-19 patients in china were collected from the websites of provincial and municipal health commissions. The mean hospitalization time and mortality in the mild or severe patients and the mean time from severe to mild illness were calculated by Gaussian mixture modeling. Results: The mean hospitalization time among mild patients in Hubei province, other areas except Hubei province, and the national areas was 20.71 {+\/-} 9.30, 16.86 {+\/-} 8.24, and 19.34 {+\/-} 9.29 days, respectively. The mean transition time from severe to mild illness in the above three areas were 15.00, 17.00, and 14.99 days, respectively. The death rate of mild and severe patients in Hubei province and the national areas were 1.10% and 18.14%, and 1.10% and 17.70%, respectively. Among those patients who died of COVID-19, the mean time from severe transition to death in Hubei province and the national areas was 6.22 {+\/-} 5.12 and 6.35 {+\/-} 5.27 days, respectively. Conclusion: There were regional differences in the average length of stay between Hubei province and other regions, which may be related to different medical configurations. For those severe patients who died of COVID-19, the average time from hospitalization to death was about one week, and proper and effective treatments in the first week were critical.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Songshan Chai","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dongdong Xiao","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qikai Cheng","author_inst":"School of information and management; Wuhan university"},{"author_name":"Shengzhi Huang","author_inst":"School of information and management; Wuhan university"},{"author_name":"Yihao Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jiajia Qian","author_inst":"School of information and management; Wuhan university"},{"author_name":"Jiajing Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Junjun Li","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Peng Fu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qiangping Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jing Rao","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hongyang Zhao","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fangcheng Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nanxiang Xiong","author_inst":"Wuhan union hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.11.20061408","rel_title":"A Preliminary Assessment of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Knowledge and Perceptions in Nigeria","rel_date":"2020-04-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.11.20061408","rel_abs":"This study assessed knowledge and perceptions about COVID-19 among the general public in Nigeria during the initial week of the pandemic lockdown in the country. From March 28 to April 4, 2020, this cross-sectional survey used an anonymous online questionnaire to collect data from respondents within Nigeria. Purposive and snowball sampling techniques were used to recruit 1357 respondents, aged 15-70 years, from 180 cities and towns within Nigeria. Study data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Approximately more than half (57.02%) of the respondents were male with a high level of education (48.86% bachelor degree or higher). Approximately half of the respondents (46.94%) opined that COVID-19 was a biological weapon designed by the Chinese government. About 94% of the respondents identified contact with airborne droplets via breathing, sneezing, or coughing as the most common mode of transmission; most respondents associated COVID-19 with coughing (81.13%), shortness of breath (73.47%) and fever (62.79%). Regular hand washing and social distancing were selected by most respondents (94.25%) as a way of preventing infection whereas 11.86% reported consuming gins, garlic, ginger, herbal mixtures and African foods\/soups as preventive measures against COVID-19. The majority of the respondents (91.73%) thought COVID-19 is deadly, and most respondents (84.3%) got 4 or more answers correctly. It was also observed that the traditional media (TV\/Radio) is the most common source of health information about COVID-19 (93.5%). Findings revealed that Nigerians have relatively high knowledge, mostly derived from traditional media, about COVID-19. Their perceptions of COVID-19 bear implications across public health initiatives, compliance with precautionary behavior as well as bilateral relations with foreign nations. Evidence-based campaign should be intensified to remove misconceptions and promote precautionary measures.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peter O OLAPEGBA","author_inst":"University of Ibadan"},{"author_name":"Olusola AYANDELE","author_inst":"The Polytechnic Ibadan"},{"author_name":"Samson Olowo KOLAWOLE","author_inst":"Nigeria Police Academy, Wudil, Kano"},{"author_name":"Rotimi OGUNTAYO","author_inst":"University of Ilorin"},{"author_name":"Joshua Chiroma GANDI","author_inst":"University of Jos"},{"author_name":"Abdullahi Lawal DANGIWA","author_inst":"Federal University, Dutse"},{"author_name":"Iboro Friday Akpan OTTU","author_inst":"University of Uyo"},{"author_name":"Steven Kator IORFA","author_inst":"University of Nigeria, Nsukka"},{"author_name":"Peng Fu","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qiangping Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jing Rao","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hongyang Zhao","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fangcheng Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nanxiang Xiong","author_inst":"Wuhan union hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.11.20062091","rel_title":"Cardiac or Infectious?

Nevertheless, via local data collected by certain regions, it is possible to develop accurate local prediction tools, which may be coupled to develop global models. In this study, we analyze the dynamics of local outbreaks of COVID-19 via a coupled system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs).

Besides other problems, this is associated with the lack of knowledge concerning distribution of tidal volume and the patients' individual respiratory system mechanics. In this study we used two simple hand-manufactured adaptors to connect physical models of two adult respiratory systems to one ventilator. The artificial lungs were ventilated in the pressure-controlled mode and we investigated if disconnecting one lung from the ventilation circuit for several breaths would allow to determine reliably the other lung's tidal volume and compliance. Compliances and volumes were measured both with the ventilator and external sensors corresponded well. However, tidal volumes measured via the ventilator were smaller compared to the tidal volumes measured via the external sensors with an absolute error of 5.3 +\/- 2.5%. The tidal volumes of the individual artificial lungs were distributed in proportion to the compliances and did not differ relevantly when both artificial lungs were connected to when one was disconnected. We conclude that in case of emergency, ventilation of two patients with one ventilator requires two simple hand-crafted tubes as adaptors and available standard breathing circuit components. In such a setting, respiratory system mechanics and tidal volume of each individual patient can be reliably measured during short term clamping of the tracheal tube of the respective other patient.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peter C.

Using multiple countries, data streams and methods, we consistently estimate that European COVID-19 cases doubled every three days when unconstrained, with the impact of physical distancing interventions typically seen about nine days after implementation, during which time cases grew eight-fold. The combination of fast growth and long detection delays explains the struggle in countries' response better than large values of R0 alone, and warns against relaxing physical distancing measures too quickly. Testing and tracing are fundamental in shortening such delays, thus preventing cases from escalating unnoticed.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lorenzo Pellis","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Francesca Scarabel","author_inst":"York University"},{"author_name":"Helena B Stage","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Christopher E Overton","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Lauren H K Chappell","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Katrina A Lythgoe","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Fearon","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Emma Bennett","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Jacob Curran-Sebastian","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Rajenki Das","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Martyn Fyles","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Hugo Lewkowicz","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Xiaoxi Pang","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Bindu Vekaria","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Luke Webb","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Thomas A House","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Ian Hall","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.10.20060632","rel_title":"FFP-2 respirator masks in times of crisis","rel_date":"2020-04-15","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.10.20060632","rel_abs":"Given the current shortage of respirator masks and the resulting lack of personal protective equipment for use by clinical staff, we examined bottom-up solutions that would allow hospitals to fabricate respirator masks that: (i) meet requirements in terms of filtering capacities, (ii) are easy to produce rapidly and locally, and (iii) can be constructed using materials commonly available in hospitals worldwide. We found that Halyard H300 material used for wrapping of surgical instruments and routinely available in hospitals, met these criteria. Specifically, three layers of material achieved a filter efficiency of 94%, 99%, and 100% for 0.3 um, 0.5 um, and 3.0 um particles, respectively; importantly, these values are close to the efficiency provided by FFP2 and N95 masks. After re-sterilization up to 5 times, the filter's efficiency remains sufficiently high for use as an FFP1 respirator mask. Finally, using only one layer of the material satisfies the criteria for use as a 'surgical mask'. This material can therefore be used to help protect hospital staff and other healthcare professionals who require access to suitable masks but lack commercially available solutions.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Johanna H.

SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and often leads to severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure and death in the elderly and subjects with pre-existing conditions, but the reason for this age dependence is unclear. Here, we found that the case fatality rate for COVID-19 grows exponentially with age in Italy, Spain, South Korea, and China, with the doubling time approaching that of all-cause human mortality. In addition, men and those with multiple age-related diseases are characterized by increased mortality. Moreover, similar mortality patterns were found for all-cause pneumonia. We further report that the gene expression of ACE2, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, grows in the lung with age, except for subjects on a ventilator. Together, our findings establish COVID-19 as an emergent disease of aging, and age and age-related diseases as its major risk factors. In turn, this suggests that COVID-19, and deadly respiratory diseases in general, may be targeted, in addition to therapeutic approaches that affect specific pathways, by approaches that target the aging process.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Didac Santesmasses","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jos\u00e9 Pedro Castro","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Aleksandr A Zenin","author_inst":"Lomonosov Moscow State University"},{"author_name":"Anastasia V Shindyapina","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maxim V Gerashchenko","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bohan Zhang","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Csaba Kerepesi","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sun Hee Yim","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Peter O Fedichev","author_inst":"Lomonosov Moscow State University"},{"author_name":"Vadim N Gladyshev","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Martyn Fyles","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Hugo Lewkowicz","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Xiaoxi Pang","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Bindu Vekaria","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Luke Webb","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Thomas A House","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Ian Hall","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.040667","rel_title":"COVID-19 Knowledge Graph: a computable, multi-modal, cause-and-effect knowledge model of COVID-19 pathophysiology","rel_date":"2020-04-15","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.040667","rel_abs":"SummaryThe past few weeks have witnessed a worldwide mobilization of the research community in response to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive-stranded RNA betacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae. Expanding virus populations, as that of SARS-CoV-2, accumulate a number of narrowly shared polymorphisms imposing a confounding effect on traditional clustering methods. In this context, approaches that reduce the complexity of the sequence space occupied by the SARS-CoV-2 population are necessary for a robust clustering. Here, we proposed the subdivision of the global SARS-CoV-2 population into sixteen well-defined subtypes by focusing on the widely shared polymorphisms in nonstructural (nsp3, nsp4, nsp6, nsp12, nsp13 and nsp14) cistrons, structural (spike and nucleocapsid) and accessory (ORF8) genes. Six virus subtypes were predominant in the population, but all sixteen showed amino acid replacements which might have phenotypic implications. We hypothesize that the virus subtypes detected in this study are records of the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 diversification that were randomly sampled to compose the virus populations around the world, a typical founder effect. The genetic structure determined for the SARS-CoV-2 population provides substantial guidelines for maximizing the effectiveness of trials for testing the candidate vaccines or drugs.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ivair Jose Morais Junior","author_inst":"Universidade de Brasilia"},{"author_name":"Richard Costa Polveiro","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Vicosa"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Medeiros Souza","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Uberlandia"},{"author_name":"Daniel Inserra Bortolin","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Uberlandia"},{"author_name":"Flavio Tetsuo Sassaki","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Uberlandia"},{"author_name":"Alison Talis Martins Lima","author_inst":"Unversidade Federal de Uberlandia"},{"author_name":"Christian Ebeling","author_inst":"Fraunhofer SCAI"},{"author_name":"Martin Hofmann-Apitius","author_inst":"Fraunhofer SCAI"},{"author_name":"Alpha Tom Kodamullil","author_inst":"Fraunhofer SCAI"},{"author_name":"Vadim N Gladyshev","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Martyn Fyles","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Hugo Lewkowicz","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Xiaoxi Pang","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Bindu Vekaria","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Luke Webb","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Thomas A House","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Ian Hall","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.041228","rel_title":"The FDA-approved gold drug Auranofin inhibits novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) replication and attenuates inflammation in human cells","rel_date":"2020-04-15","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.041228","rel_abs":"SARS-COV-2 has recently emerged as a new public health threat.

The virus having its roots in Wuhan (China) has been spread over the world by its own property to change itself accordingly. These changes correspond to its transmission and pathogenicity due to which the concept of social distancing appeared into the picture. In this paper, a few findings from the whole genome sequence analysis of viral genome sequences submitted from India are presented. The data used for analysis comprises 440 collective genome sequences of virus submitted in GenBank, GISAID, and SRA projects, from around the world as well as 28 viral sequences from India. Multiple sequence alignment of all genome sequences was performed and analysed. A novel non-synonymous mutation 4809C>T (S1515F) in NSP3 gene of SARS-CoV2 Indian strains is reported along with other frequent and important changes from around the world: 3037C>T, 14408C>T, and 23403A>G. The novel change was observed in samples collected in the month of March, whereas was found to be absent in samples collected in January with the respective persons travel history to China. Phylogenetic analysis clustered the sequences with this change as one separate clade. Mutation was predicted as stabilising change by insilco tool DynaMut. A second patient in the world to our knowledge with multiple (Wuhan and USA) strain contraction was observed in this study. The infected person is among the two early infected patients with travel history to China. Strains sequenced in Iran stood out to have different variants, as most of the reported frequent variants were not observed. The objective of this paper is to highlight the similarities and changes observed in the submitted Indian viral strains. This helps to keep track on the activity, that how virus is changing into a new subtype. Major strains observed were European with the novel change in India and other being emergent clade of Iran. Its important to observe the changes in NSP3 gene, as this gene has been reported with extensive positive selection as well as potential drug target. Extensive Positive Selection Drives the Evolution of Nonstructural Proteins. With the limited number of sequences this was the only frequent novel non-synonymous change observed from Indian strains, thereby making this change vulnerable for investigation in future.

Infection also downregulates autophagy-inducing spermidine, and facilitates AKT1\/SKP2-dependent degradation of autophagy-initiating Beclin-1 (BECN1). Targeting of these pathways by exogenous administration of spermidine, AKT inhibitor MK-2206, and the Beclin-1 stabilizing, antihelminthic drug niclosamide inhibited SARS-CoV-2 propagation by 85, 88, and >99%, respectively.

SARS-CoV-2 causes acute infection of the respiratory tract (COVID-19) that can result in severe disease and lethality. Currently, there is no approved antiviral drug for treating COVID-19 patients and there is an urgent need for specific antiviral therapies and vaccines.\n\nIn order for SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells, its surface glycoprotein spike (S) must be cleaved at two different sites by host cell proteases, which therefore represent potential drug targets. In the present study we investigated which host cell proteases activate the SARS-CoV-2 S protein in Calu-3 human airway epithelial cells. We show that S can be cleaved by both the proprotein convertase furin at the S1\/S2 site and the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) at the S2 site. We demonstrate that TMPRSS2 is essential for activation of SARS-CoV-2 S in Calu-3 cells through antisense-mediated knockdown of TMPRSS2 expression. Further, we show that SARS-CoV-2 replication can be efficiently inhibited by two synthetic inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and also by the broad range serine protease inhibitor aprotinin. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 replication was also strongly inhibited by the synthetic furin inhibitor MI-1851. Combining various TMPRSS2 inhibitors with MI-1851 produced more potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 than an equimolar amount of any single serine protease inhibitor. In contrast, inhibition of endosomal cathepsins by E64d did not affect virus replication.\n\nOur data demonstrate that both TMPRSS2 and furin are essential for SARS-CoV-2 activation in human airway cells and are promising drug targets for the treatment of COVID-19 either by targeting one of these proteases alone or by a combination of furin and TMPRSS2 inhibitors. Therefore, this approach has a high therapeutic potential for treatment of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dorothea Bestle","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Philipps-University, Marburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Miriam Ruth Heindl","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Philipps-University, Marburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Hannah Limburg","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Philipps-University, Marburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Thuy Van Lam van","author_inst":"Institute of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Philipps-University, Marburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Oliver Pilgram","author_inst":"Institute of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Philipps-University, Marburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Hong Moulton","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences, Carlson College of Veterinary Medicine, Oregon State University, Corvallis, USA"},{"author_name":"David A.

Using a surface plasmon resonance direct binding assay, we found that both monomeric and trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike more tightly bind to immobilized heparin (KD = 40 pM and 73 pM, respectively) than the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV SGPs (500 nM and 1 nM, respectively).

Finally, unbiased computational ligand docking indicates that heparan sulfate interacts with the GAG-binding motif at the S1\/S2 site on each monomer interface in the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 SGP, and at another site (453-459 (YRLFRKS)) when the receptor-binding domain is in an open conformation.

SARS-CoV-2 triggers severe pneumonia, which leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death in severe cases. As reported, SARS-CoV-2 is 80% genetically identical to the 2003 SARS-CoV virus. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the main receptor for entry of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 into human cells. ACE2 is normally expressed in cardiovascular and lung type II alveolar epithelial cells, where it positively modulates the RAS system that regulates blood flow, pressure, and fluid homeostasis. Thus, virus-induced reduction of ACE2 gene expression is considered to make a significant contribution to severe acute respiratory failure. Chromatin remodeling plays a significant role in the regulation of ACE2 gene expression and the activity of regulatory elements within the genome.\n\nMethodsHere, we integrated data on physical chromatin interactions within the genome organization (captured by Hi-C) with tissue-specific gene expression data to identify spatial expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and thus regulatory elements located within the ACE2 gene.\n\nResultsWe identified regulatory elements within ACE2 that control the expression of PIR, CA5B, and VPS13C in the lung. The gene products of these genes are involved in inflammatory responses, de novo pyrimidine and polyamine synthesis, and the endoplasmic reticulum, respectively.\n\nConclusionOur study, although limited by the fact that the identification of the regulatory interactions is putative until proven by targeted experiments, supports the hypothesis that viral silencing of ACE2 alters the activity of gene regulatory regions and promotes an intra-cellular environment suitable for viral replication.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tayaza Fadason","author_inst":"Liggins Institute, The University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Sreemol Gokuladhas","author_inst":"Liggins Institute, The University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Evgeniia Golovina","author_inst":"Liggins Institute, The University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Daniel Ho","author_inst":"Liggins Institute, The University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Sophie Farrow","author_inst":"Liggins Institute, The University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Denis M Nyaga","author_inst":"Liggins Institute, The University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Hong Pan","author_inst":"Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences (SICS), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR)"},{"author_name":"Neerja Karnani","author_inst":"Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences (SICS), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR)"},{"author_name":"Conroy Wong","author_inst":"Respiratory Medicine, Middlemore Hospital"},{"author_name":"Antony Cooper","author_inst":"Australian Parkinsons Mission, Garvan Institute of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"William Schierding","author_inst":"Liggins Institute, The University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Jamie Lovaglio","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Patrick Hanley","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Greg Saturday","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Catharine Bosio","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Sarah Anzick","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Kent Barbian","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Tomas Chilar","author_inst":"Gilead"},{"author_name":"Craig Martens","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Dana Scott","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Emmie de Wit","author_inst":"NIAID, NIH"},{"author_name":"Kazuyuki Aihara","author_inst":"University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Shingo Iwami","author_inst":"Kyushu University"},{"author_name":"Makoto Takeda","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jane McKeating","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Takaji Wakita","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.15.036285","rel_title":"Genome based Evolutionary study of SARS-CoV-2 towards the Prediction of Epitope Based Chimeric Vaccine","rel_date":"2020-04-15","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.15.036285","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 is known to infect the neurological, respiratory, enteric, and hepatic systems of human and has already become an unprecedented threat to global healthcare system. COVID-19, the most serious public condition caused by SARS-CoV-2 leads the world to an uncertainty alongside thousands of regular death scenes. Unavailability of specific therapeutics or approved vaccine has made the recovery of COVI-19 more troublesome and challenging. The present in silico study aimed to predict a novel chimeric vaccines by simultaneously targeting four major structural proteins via the establishment of ancestral relationship among different strains of coronaviruses. Conserved regions from the homologous protein sets of spike glycoprotein (S), membrane protein (M), envelope protein and nucleocapsid protein (N) were identified through multiple sequence alignment. The phylogeny analyses of whole genome stated that four proteins (S, E, M and N) reflected the close ancestral relation of SARS-CoV-2 to SARS-COV-1 and bat coronavirus. Numerous immunogenic epitopes (both T cell and B cell) were generated from the common fragments which were further ranked on the basis of antigenicity, transmembrane topology, conservancy level, toxicity and allergenicity pattern and population coverage analysis. Top putative epitopes were combined with appropriate adjuvants and linkers to construct a novel multiepitope subunit vaccine against COVID-19. The designed constructs were characterized based on physicochemical properties, allergenicity, antigenicity and solubility which revealed the superiority of construct V3 in terms safety and efficacy. Essential molecular dynamics and Normal Mode analysis confirmed minimal deformability of the refined model at molecular level. In addition, disulfide engineering was investigated to accelerate the stability of the protein. Molecular docking study ensured high binding affinity between construct V3 and HLA cells, as well as with different host receptors. Microbial expression and translational efficacy of the constructs were checked using pET28a(+) vector of E. coli strain K12. The development of preventive measures to combat COVID-19 infections might be aided the present study. However, the in vivo and in vitro validation might be ensured with wet lab trials using model animals for the implementation of the presented data.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mst Rubaiat Nazneen Akhand","author_inst":"Sylhet Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Kazi Faizul Azim","author_inst":"Sylhet Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Syeda Farjana Hoque","author_inst":"Sylhet Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Mahmuda Akther Moli","author_inst":"Sylhet Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Bijit Das Joy","author_inst":"Sylhet Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Hafsa Akter","author_inst":"Sylhet Agricultural university"},{"author_name":"Ibrahim Khalil Afif","author_inst":"Noakhali Science and Technology University"},{"author_name":"Nadim Ahmed","author_inst":"Sylhet Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Mahmudul Hasan","author_inst":"Sylhet Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Antony Cooper","author_inst":"Australian Parkinsons Mission, Garvan Institute of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"William Schierding","author_inst":"Liggins Institute, The University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Jamie Lovaglio","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Patrick Hanley","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Greg Saturday","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Catharine Bosio","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Sarah Anzick","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Kent Barbian","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Tomas Chilar","author_inst":"Gilead"},{"author_name":"Craig Martens","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Dana Scott","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Emmie de Wit","author_inst":"NIAID, NIH"},{"author_name":"Kazuyuki Aihara","author_inst":"University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Shingo Iwami","author_inst":"Kyushu University"},{"author_name":"Makoto Takeda","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jane McKeating","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Takaji Wakita","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.14.042010","rel_title":"Humanized Single Domain Antibodies Neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by Targeting Spike Receptor Binding Domain","rel_date":"2020-04-15","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.14.042010","rel_abs":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread across more than 200 countries and regions, leading to an unprecedented medical burden and live lost.

In humans, it binds to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with the help a structural protein on its surface called the S-spike. Further, cleavage of the viral spike protein (S) by the proteases like transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) or Cathepsin L (CTSL) is essential to effectuate host cell membrane fusion and virus infectivity. COVID-19 poses intriguing issues with imperative relevance to clinicians. The pathogenesis of GI symptoms, diabetes-associated mortality, and disease recurrence in COVID-19 are of particular relevance because they cannot be sufficiently explained from the existing knowledge of the viral diseases. Tissue specific variations of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry related receptors expression in healthy individuals can help in understanding the pathophysiological basis the aforementioned collection of symptoms.\n\nMaterials and MethodsThe data were downloaded from the Human Protein Atlas available at (https:\/\/www.proteinatlas.org\/humanproteome\/sars-cov-2) and the tissue specific expressions (both mRNA and protein) of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 as yielded from the studies with RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were analyzed as a function of the various components of the digestive tract. A digestive system specific functional enrichment map of ACE2 gene was created using g:profiler (https:\/\/biit.cs.ut.ee\/gprofiler\/gost) utility and the data were visualized using Cytoscape software, version 3.7.2 (https:\/\/cytoscape.org\/).\n\nResultsThe correlated expression (transcriptomic and proteomic) of ACE2 (to which SARS-CoV-2 binds through the S-spike) was found to be enriched in the lower gastrointestinal tract (GIT) (highest in small intestine, followed by colon and rectum), and was undetectable in the upper GIT components: mouth cavity (tongue, oral mucosa, and salivary glands), esophagus, and stomach. High expression of ACE2 was noted in the glandular cells as well as in the enterocytes in the lining epithelium (including brush border epithelium). Among other digestive system organs, Gall bladder (GB) showed high expression of ACE2 in glandular cells, while any protein expression was undetectable in liver and pancreas. TMPRSS2 was found enhanced in GIT and exocrine glands of pancreas, and co-localized with ACE2 in enterocytes.\n\nConclusionsBased on the findings of this study and supportive evidence from the literature we propose that a SARS-CoV-2 binding with ACE2 mediates dysregulation of the sodium dependent nutrient transporters and hence may be a plausible basis for the digestive symptoms in COVID-19 patients. ACE2 mediated dysregulation of sodium dependent glucose transporter (SGLT1 or SLC5A1) in the intestinal epithelium also links it to the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus which can be a possible reason for the associated mortality in COVID-19 patients with diabetes. High expression of ACE2 in mucosal cells of the intestine and GB make these organs potential sites for the virus entry and replication. Continued replication of the virus at these ACE2 enriched sites may be a basis for the disease recurrence reported in some, thought to be cured, patients.\n\nGraphical Abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"- Etiologically Elusive Disorders Research Network (EEDRN)","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Ashutosh Kumar","author_inst":"Department of Anatomy, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Patna, India"},{"author_name":"Muneeb A.

The SARS-CoV-2 genome includes conserved RNA elements that offer potential targets for RNA-targeting small-molecule drugs, but 3D structures of most of these elements have not been experimentally characterized. Here, we provide a dataset called  FARFAR2-SARS-CoV-2, a collection of 3D coordinates modeled using Rosettas FARFAR2 algorithm, including de novo models for thirteen RNA elements in SARS-CoV-2 and homology models for a fourteenth. These elements comprise SL1, SL2, SL3, SL4, SL5, putative SL6 and SL7 in the extended 5' UTR, as well as the entire extended 5' UTR; the frameshifting element (FSE) from the SARS-CoV-2 ORF1a\/b gene and a putative dimer of FSE; and the extended pseudoknot, hypervariable region, and the s2m of the 3' UTR, as well as the entire 3' UTR. For five of these elements (SL1, SL2, SL3, FSE, s2m), convergence of lowest predicted energy structures supports their accuracy in capturing low energy states that might be targeted for small molecule binding. To aid efforts to discover small molecule RNA binders guided by computational models, we provide a second benchmarking dataset called  FARFAR2-Apo-Riboswitch, which consists of similarly prepared Rosetta-FARFAR2 models for RNA riboswitch aptamer regions that bind small molecules. Both datasets include up to 400 3D models for each RNA element, which may facilitate drug discovery approaches targeting dynamic ensembles of low-energy excited states of RNA molecules.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ramya Rangan","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Andrew M.

Design: Observational, descriptive study of ICUs monitored by a tele-ICU system across Northwell Health. Inclusion criteria: All patients admitted to Northwell Health tele-ICUs during 2019 and between March 23, 2020 and April 6, 2020. Exposure: A data extract was developed to collect data every hour for each ICU bed in the Northwell tele-critical care program as a quality reporting initiative to understand ICU capacity and resource utilization. A similar extract was developed for each hour of 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Average of any given hour during the pre-COVID-19 and pandemic periods for the following metrics: proportion of beds occupied, proportion of ventilated patients, severity of illness (measured by the ICU Discharge Readiness Score (DRS)), and length of stay (LOS). Results: Hourly analysis of data from 186 ICU beds from 14 ICUs and 9 hospitals were included, representing 10,714 patients in 2019 and 465 patients between March 23 and April 6, 2020. Average hourly occupancy increased from 64% to 78%, while the proportion of patients invasively ventilated increased from 33.9% to 84.2%. Median DRS (severity of illness score) increased from 1.08 (IQR: 0.24-6.98) to 39.38 (IQR: 12.00-71.28). Proportion of patients with Hispanic ethnicity doubled (7.8% to 16.6%; p<0.01) and proportion of female patients decreased from 46.3% to 32.9% (p<0.01). Conclusions and Relevance: In addition to the expected increase in ICU occupancy and ventilator requirements, this large group of ICUs in midst of the COVID-19 epidemic are faced with managing a cohort of ICU patients with a dramatically higher severity of illness than their typical census.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Omar Badawi","author_inst":"Philips Healthcare"},{"author_name":"Xinggang Liu","author_inst":"Philips Healthcare"},{"author_name":"Iris Berman","author_inst":"Northwell Health"},{"author_name":"Pamela J Amelung","author_inst":"Philips Healthcare"},{"author_name":"Martin Doerfler","author_inst":"Northwell Health"},{"author_name":"Saurabh Chandra","author_inst":"Northwell Health"},{"author_name":"Pranav Prasoon","author_inst":"Pittsburgh Center for Pain Research, School of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA"},{"author_name":"Pavan Kumar","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, USA"},{"author_name":"Maheswari Kulandhasamy","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, Maulana Azad Medical College (MAMC), New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Chiman Kumari","author_inst":"Department of Anatomy, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, India"},{"author_name":"Kamla Kant","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Bhatinda, India"},{"author_name":"Himanshu N.

We apply a Bayesian adaptive patient-centered model---which minimizes the expected harm of false positives and false negatives---to optimize the clinical trial development path during such outbreaks. When the epidemic is more infectious and fatal, the Bayesian-optimal sample size in the clinical trial is lower and the optimal statistical significance level is higher. For COVID-19 (assuming a static R0=2 and initial infection percentage of 0.1%), the optimal significance level is 7.1% for a clinical trial of a non-vaccine anti-infective therapeutic clinical trial and 13.6% for that of a vaccine. For a dynamic R0 ranging from 2 to 4, the corresponding values are 14.4% and 26.4%, respectively. Our results illustrate the importance of adapting the clinical trial design and the regulatory approval process to the specific parameters and stage of the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qingyang Xu","author_inst":"MIT"},{"author_name":"Shomesh Chaudhuri","author_inst":"QLS Advisors LLC"},{"author_name":"Danying Xiao","author_inst":"MIT"},{"author_name":"Andrew W Lo","author_inst":"MIT"},{"author_name":"Martin Doerfler","author_inst":"Northwell Health"},{"author_name":"Saurabh Chandra","author_inst":"Northwell Health"},{"author_name":"Pranav Prasoon","author_inst":"Pittsburgh Center for Pain Research, School of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA"},{"author_name":"Pavan Kumar","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, USA"},{"author_name":"Maheswari Kulandhasamy","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, Maulana Azad Medical College (MAMC), New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Chiman Kumari","author_inst":"Department of Anatomy, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, India"},{"author_name":"Kamla Kant","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Bhatinda, India"},{"author_name":"Himanshu N.

The outbreak has a significant threat to international health and economy. At present, there is no approved vaccine or treatment for the disease, while efforts are underway. Remdesivir, a nucleotide-analogue antiviral drug developed for Ebola, is determined to prevent and stop infections with COVID-19, while results are yet controversial. Here, we aim to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to compare the effectiveness of remdesivir and placebo in patients with COVID-19. Method and analysis: We will search MEDLINE-PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google scholar databases without restriction in year of publication. We will include randomized controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness of remdesivir versus placebo for patients confirmed with COVID-19. We will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA 2015) guidelines for the design and reporting of the results. The primary endpoint will be time to clinical recovery. The secondary endpoints will be all cause mortality, discharged date, frequency of respiratory progression, and treatment-emergent adverse events. Two independent authors will perform study selection, data extraction, and methodology quality assessment. RevMan 5.3 software will be used for statistical analysis. Random\/fixed effect model will be carried out to calculate mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratio for dichotomous outcomes between remdesivir and placebo. Ethics and dissemination: This study does not require ethical approval, because no participants data will be involved in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The findings of this study will be published in reputable and peer-reviewed journal. Registration: This review protocol is submitted in PROSPERO database for registration and we will include the registration number in the revised version of the manuscript.
