While studies analyzing humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 were available rather early during the pandemic, cellular immunity came into focus of investigations just recently. For the present work, we have adapted a protocol, designed for the detection of rare neoantigen-specific Memory T cells in cancer patients for studying cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV-2. Both, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were detected after 6 days of in vitro expansion using overlapping peptide libraries representing the whole viral protein. The assay readout was an Intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometric analysis detecting four functional markers simultaneously (CD154, TNF, IL-2, IFN-{gamma}). We were able to detect SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in 9 of 9 COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms. All patients had reactive T cells against at least one of 12 analyzed viral antigens and all patients had Spike-specific T cells. While some antigens were detected by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, Membrane protein was mainly recognized by CD4+ T cells. Strikingly, we were not able to detect SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in 9 unexposed healthy individuals. We are presenting a highly specific protocol for the detection of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells. Our data confirmed the important role of cellular immune responses in understanding SARS-CoV-2 clearance. We showed that Spike is the most immunogenic antigen. We have introduced Membrane protein as interesting target for studying humoral immune responses in convalescent COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Henning Zelba","author_inst":"CeGaT GmbH"},{"author_name":"David Worbs","author_inst":"CeGaT GmbH"},{"author_name":"Johannes Harter","author_inst":"CeGaT GmbH"},{"author_name":"Natalia Pieper","author_inst":"CeGaT GmbH"},{"author_name":"Christina Kyzirakos-Feger","author_inst":"Praxis fuer Humangenetik"},{"author_name":"Simone Kayser","author_inst":"Praxis fuer Humangenetik"},{"author_name":"Marcel Seibold","author_inst":"Praxis fuer Humangenetik"},{"author_name":"Oliver Bartsch","author_inst":"Praxis fuer Humangenetik"},{"author_name":"Jiri Koedding","author_inst":"CeGaT GmbH"},{"author_name":"Saskia Biskup","author_inst":"Praxis fuer Humangenetik"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.10.20170894","rel_title":"Deciphering the state of immune silence in fatal COVID-19 patients","rel_date":"2020-08-13","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.10.20170894","rel_abs":"Since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, COVID-19 has appeared as a unique disease with unconventional tissue and systemic immune features. While COVID-19 severe forms share clinical and laboratory aspects with various pathologies such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, sepsis or cytokine release syndrome, their exact nature remains unknown. This is severely impeding the ability to treat patients facing severe stages of the disease. To this aim, we performed an in-depth, single-cell RNA-seq analysis of more than 150.000 immune cells isolated from matched blood samples and broncho-alveolar lavage fluids of COVID-19 patients and healthy controls, and integrated it with clinical, immunological and functional ex vivo data. We unveiled an immune signature of disease severity that correlated with the accumulation of naive lymphoid cells in the lung and an expansion and activation of myeloid cells in the periphery. Moreover, we demonstrated that myeloid-driven immune suppression is a hallmark of COVID-19 evolution and arginase 1 expression is significantly associated with monocyte immune regulatory features. Noteworthy, we found monocyte and neutrophil immune suppression loss associated with fatal clinical outcome in severe pa-tients. Additionally, our analysis discovered that the strongest association of the patients clinical outcome and immune phenotype is the lung T cell response. We found that patients with a robust CXCR6+ effector memory T cell response have better outcomes. This result is line with the rs11385942 COVID-19 risk allel, which is in proximity to the CXCR6 gene and suggest effector memory T cell are a primary feature in COVID-19 patients. By systemically quantifying the viral landscape in the lung of severe patients, we indeed identified Herpes-Simplex-Virus 1 (HSV-1) as a potential opportunistic virus in COVID-19 patients. Lastly, we observed an unexpectedly high SARS-CoV-2 viral load in an immuno-compromised patient, allowing us to study the SARS-CoV-2 in-vivo life cycle. The development of myeloid dysfunctions and the impairment of lymphoid arm establish a condition of immune paralysis that supports secondary bacteria and virus infection and can progress to immune silence in patients facing death.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pierre Bost","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel, Systems Biology Group, Department of Computational Biology and USR 3756, Institut Past"},{"author_name":"Francesco De Sanctis","author_inst":"Immunology Section, Department of Medicine, University and Hospital Trust of Verona, Verona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Stefania Cane","author_inst":"Immunology Section, Department of Medicine, University and Hospital Trust of Verona, Verona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Stefano Ugel","author_inst":"Immunology Section, Department of Medicine, University and Hospital Trust of Verona, Verona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Katia Donadello","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Department of Surgery, Dentistry, Maternity and Infant, University and Hospital Trust of Verona, Verona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Monica Castellucci","author_inst":"The Center for Technological Platforms, University of Verona, Verona, Italy"},{"author_name":"David Eyal","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Fiore","author_inst":"Immunology Section, Department of Medicine, University and Hospital Trust of Verona, Verona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Cristina Anselmi","author_inst":"Immunology Section, Department of Medicine, University and Hospital Trust of Verona, Verona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Roza Maria Barouni","author_inst":"Immunology Section, Department of Medicine, University and Hospital Trust of Verona, Verona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Rosalinda Trovato","author_inst":"Immunology Section, Department of Medicine, University and Hospital Trust of Verona, Verona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Simone Caligola","author_inst":"Immunology Section, Department of Medicine, University and Hospital Trust of Verona, Verona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessia Lamolinara","author_inst":"CAST- Center for Advanced Studies and Technology, University of G.

Objectives: We created a Pandemic Vulnerability Index (PVI) to support counties and municipalities by integrating baseline data on relevant community vulnerabilities with dynamic data on local infection rates and interventions. The PVI visually synthesizes county-level vulnerability indicators, enabling their comparison in regional, state, and nationwide contexts. Methods: We describe the data streams used and how these are combined to calculate the PVI, detail the supporting epidemiological modeling and machine-learning forecasts, and outline the deployment of an interactive web Dashboard. Finally, we describe the practical application of the PVI for real-world decision-making. Results: Considering an outlook horizon from 1 to 28 days, the overall PVI scores are significantly associated with key vulnerability-related outcome metrics of cumulative deaths, population adjusted cumulative deaths, and the proportion of deaths from cases. The modeling results indicate the most significant predictors of case counts are population size, proportion of black residents, and mean PM2.5. The machine learning forecast results were strongly predictive of observed cases and deaths up to 14 days ahead. The modeling reinforces an integrated concept of vulnerability that accounts for both dynamic and static data streams and highlights the drivers of inequities in COVID-19 cases and deaths. These results also indicate that local areas with a highly ranked PVI should take near-term action to mitigate vulnerability. Discussion: The COVID-19 PVI Dashboard monitors multiple data streams to communicate county-level trends and vulnerabilities and facilitates decision-making and communication among government officials, scientists, community leaders, and the public to enable effective and coordinated action to combat the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Skylar W Marvel","author_inst":"North Carolina State University"},{"author_name":"John S House","author_inst":"National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Matthew Wheeler","author_inst":"National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Kuncheng Song","author_inst":"North Carolina State University"},{"author_name":"Yihui Zhou","author_inst":"North Carolina State University"},{"author_name":"Fred A Wright","author_inst":"North Carolina State University"},{"author_name":"Weihsueh A Chiu","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Ivan Rusyn","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Alison Motsinger-Reif","author_inst":"National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"David M Reif","author_inst":"North Carolina State University"},{"author_name":"Rosalinda Trovato","author_inst":"Immunology Section, Department of Medicine, University and Hospital Trust of Verona, Verona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Simone Caligola","author_inst":"Immunology Section, Department of Medicine, University and Hospital Trust of Verona, Verona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessia Lamolinara","author_inst":"CAST- Center for Advanced Studies and Technology, University of G.

Since then, the viral genome has shown considerable variance as the disease spread across the world, in part due to the zoonotic origins of the virus and the human host adaptation process. As a virus with an RNA genome that codes for its own genomic replication proteins, mutations in these proteins can significantly impact the variance rate of the genome, affecting both the survival and infection rate of the virus, and attempts at combating the disease. In this study, we analyzed the mutation densities of viral isolates carrying frequently observed mutations for four proteins in the RNA synthesis complex over time in comparison to wildtype isolates. Our observations suggest mutations in nsp14, an error-correcting exonuclease protein, have the strongest association with increased mutation load in both regions without selective pressure and across the genome, compared to nsp7, 8, and 12, which form the core polymerase complex. We propose nsp14 as a priority research target for understanding genomic variance rate in SARS-CoV-2 isolates, and nsp14 mutations as potential predictors for high mutability strains.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Do\u011fa Eskier","author_inst":"Izmir Biomedicine and Genome Center (IBG), Izmir, Turkey; Izmir International Biomedicine and Genome Institute, Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Asl\u0131 Suner","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, Faculty of Medicine, Ege University, Izmir, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Yavuz Oktay","author_inst":"Izmir Biomedicine and Genome Center (IBG), Izmir, Turkey; Izmir International Biomedicine and Genome Institute, Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey; Departmen"},{"author_name":"G\u00f6khan Karak\u00fclah","author_inst":"Izmir Biomedicine and Genome Center (IBG), Izmir, Turkey; Izmir International Biomedicine and Genome Institute, Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Edith Cowan University"},{"author_name":"Qun Meng","author_inst":"Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Youxin Wang","author_inst":"Capital medical university"},{"author_name":"Ivan Rusyn","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Alison Motsinger-Reif","author_inst":"National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"David M Reif","author_inst":"North Carolina State University"},{"author_name":"Rosalinda Trovato","author_inst":"Immunology Section, Department of Medicine, University and Hospital Trust of Verona, Verona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Simone Caligola","author_inst":"Immunology Section, Department of Medicine, University and Hospital Trust of Verona, Verona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessia Lamolinara","author_inst":"CAST- Center for Advanced Studies and Technology, University of G.

SARS-CoV-2 belongs to an order of Nidovirales with very large RNA genomes. It is proposed that the fidelity of CoV genome replication is aided by an RNA nuclease complex, formed of non-structural proteins 14 and 10 (nsp14-nsp10), an attractive target for antiviral inhibition. Here, we confirm that the SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-nsp10 complex is an RNase. Detailed functional characterisation reveals nsp14-nsp10 is a highly versatile nuclease capable of digesting a wide variety of RNA structures, including those with a blocked 3-terminus. We propose that the role of nsp14-nsp10 in maintaining replication fidelity goes beyond classical proofreading and purges the nascent replicating RNA strand of a range of potentially replication terminating aberrations. Using the developed assays, we identify a series of drug and drug-like molecules that potently inhibit nsp14-nsp10, including the known Sars-Cov-2 major protease (Mpro) inhibitor ebselen and the HIV integrase inhibitor raltegravir, revealing the potential for bifunctional inhibitors in the treatment of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hannah T Baddock","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Sanja Brolih","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Yuliana Yosaatmadja","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Malitha Ratnaweera","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Marcin Bielinski","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Lonnie Swift","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Abimael Cruz-Migoni","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Garrett M Morris","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Christopher J Schofield","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Opher Gileadi","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter J McHugh","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth E Fry","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David I Stuart","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Manuela Iezzi","author_inst":"CAST- Center for Advanced Studies and Technology, University of G.

The underlying dynamics of damage to the vasculature, and whether it is a direct consequence of endothelial infection or an indirect consequence of immune cell mediated cytokine storms is unknown. This is in part because in vitro infection models are typically monocultures of epithelial cells or fail to recapitulate vascular physiology.\n\nMethodsWe establish a vascularised lung-on-chip infection model consisting of a co-culture of primary human alveolar epithelial cells ( epithelial) and human lung microvascular endothelial cells ( endothelial), with the optional addition of CD14+ macrophages to the epithelial side. A combination of qRT-PCR, RNAscope, immunofluorescence, and ELISA measurements are used to study the dynamics of viral replication and host responses to a low dose infection of SARS-CoV-2 delivered to the apical surface of the epithelial face maintained at an air-liquid interface.\n\nFindingsSARS-CoV-2 inoculation does not lead to a productive amplification of infectious virions. However, both genomic and antisense viral RNA can be found in endothelial cells within 1-day post infection (dpi) and persist upto 3 dpi. This generates an NF-KB inflammatory response typified by IL-6 secretion and a weak antiviral interferon response even in the absence of immune cells. Endothelial inflammation leads to a progressive loss of barrier integrity, a subset of cells also shows a transient hyperplasic phenotype. Administration of Tocilizumab slows the loss of barrier integrity but does not reduce the occurrence of the latter.\n\nInterpretationEndothelial infection can occur through basolateral transmission from infected epithelial cells at the air-liquid interface. SARS-CoV-2 mediated inflammation occurs despite the lack of rapid viral replication and the consequences are cell-type dependent. Infected endothelial cells might be a key source of circulating IL-6 in COVID-19 patients. Vascular damage occurs independently of immune-cell mediated cytokine storms, whose effect would only exacerbate the damage.\n\nFindingCore support from EPEL.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vivek V Thacker","author_inst":"Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne"},{"author_name":"Kunal Sharma","author_inst":"Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne"},{"author_name":"Neeraj Dhar","author_inst":"Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne"},{"author_name":"Gian-Filippo Mancini","author_inst":"Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne"},{"author_name":"Jessica Sordet-Dessimoz","author_inst":"Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne"},{"author_name":"John D McKinney","author_inst":"Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne"},{"author_name":"Abimael Cruz-Migoni","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Garrett M Morris","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Christopher J Schofield","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Opher Gileadi","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter J McHugh","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth E Fry","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David I Stuart","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Manuela Iezzi","author_inst":"CAST- Center for Advanced Studies and Technology, University of G.

However, empirical evidence of the effectiveness of specific NPIs has been inconsistent. We assessed the effectiveness of NPIs around internal containment and closure, international travel restrictions, economic measures, and health system actions on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in 130 countries and territories. Methods: We used panel (longitudinal) regression to estimate the effectiveness of 13 categories of NPIs in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission with data from January - June 2020. First, we examined the temporal association between NPIs using hierarchical cluster analyses. We then regressed the time-varying reproduction number (Rt) of COVID-19 against different NPIs. We examined different model specifications to account for the temporal lag between NPIs and changes in Rt, levels of NPI intensity, time-varying changes in NPI effect and variable selection criteria. Results were interpreted taking into account both the range of model specifications and temporal clustering of NPIs. Results: There was strong evidence for an association between two NPIs (school closure, internal movement restrictions) and reduced Rt. Another three NPIs (workplace closure, income support and debt\/contract relief) had strong evidence of effectiveness when ignoring their level of intensity, while two NPIs (public events cancellation, restriction on gatherings) had strong evidence of their effectiveness only when evaluating their implementation at maximum capacity (e.g., restrictions on 1000+ people gathering were not effective, restrictions on <10 people gathering was). Evidence supporting the effectiveness of the remaining NPIs (stay-at-home requirements, public information campaigns, public transport closure, international travel controls, testing, contact tracing) was inconsistent and inconclusive. We found temporal clustering between many of the NPIs. Conclusion: Understanding the impact that specific NPIs have had on SARS-CoV-2 transmission is complicated by temporal clustering, time-dependent variation in effects and differences in NPI intensity. However, the effectiveness of school closure and internal movement restrictions appears robust across different model specifications taking into account these effects, with some evidence that other NPIs may also be effective under particular conditions. This provides empirical evidence for the potential effectiveness of many although not all the actions policy-makers are taking to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yang Liu","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christian Morgenstern","author_inst":"Informed Portfolio Management"},{"author_name":"James Kelly","author_inst":"Informed Portfolio Management"},{"author_name":"Rachel Lowe","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"- CMMID COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Mark Jit","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Abimael Cruz-Migoni","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Garrett M Morris","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Christopher J Schofield","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Opher Gileadi","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter J McHugh","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth E Fry","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David I Stuart","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Manuela Iezzi","author_inst":"CAST- Center for Advanced Studies and Technology, University of G.

I model the mitigation measures implemented in mid-March in both locations (distancing, quarantine, isolation, etc) via a time-dependent reproduction number Rt that declines monotonically from R0 to a smaller asymptotic value, with a parameterized functional form. The timing (mid-March) and duration (several days) of the transitions in Rt appear well determined by the data. However, the fatality data determine only a degenerate combination of the parameters R0, the percentage reduction in social contact due to mitigation measures, X, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), f . With flat priors, based on simulations the NYC model parameters have 95.45% credible intervals of R0 = 3.0 - 5.4, X = 80 - 99.9% and f = 2 - 6%, with 5 - 13% of the population asymptotically infected. A strong external prior indicating a lower value of f or of 1\/{gamma} would imply lower values of R0 and X and higher percentage infection of the population. For Cook County, the evolution was qualitatively different: after mitigation measures were implemented, the daily fatality counts reached a plateau for about a month before tailing off. This is consistent with an SIR model that exhibits \"critical slowing-down\", in which Rt plateaus at a value just above unity. For Cook County, the 95.45% credible intervals for the model parameters are much broader and shifted downward, R0 = 1.4 - 4.7, X = 26 - 54%, and f = 0.1 - 0.6% with 15 - 88% of the population asymptotically infected. Despite the apparently lower efficacy of its social contact reduction measures, Cook County has had significantly fewer fatalities per population than NYC, D{infty}\/N = 100 vs. 270 per 100,000. In the model, this is attributed to the lower inferred IFR for Cook; an external prior pointing to similar values of the IFR for the two locations would instead chalk up the difference in D\/N to differences in the relative growth rate of the disease. I derive a model-dependent threshold, Xcrit, for \"safe\" re-opening, that is, for easing of contact reduction that would not trigger a second wave; for NYC, the models predict that increasing social contact by more than 20% from post-mitigation levels will lead to renewed spread, while for Cook County the threshold value is very uncertain, given the parameter degeneracies. The timing of 2nd-wave growth will depend on the amplitude of contact increase relative to Xcrit and on the asymptotic growth rate, and the impact in terms of fatalities will depend on the parameter f .","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joshua Frieman","author_inst":"Fermilab"},{"author_name":"Luiza Angheluta","author_inst":"Njord Center, Dept. of Physics, Univ. of Oslo, Norway"},{"author_name":"James Kelly","author_inst":"Informed Portfolio Management"},{"author_name":"Rachel Lowe","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"- CMMID COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Mark Jit","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Abimael Cruz-Migoni","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Garrett M Morris","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Christopher J Schofield","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Opher Gileadi","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter J McHugh","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth E Fry","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David I Stuart","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Manuela Iezzi","author_inst":"CAST- Center for Advanced Studies and Technology, University of G.

These control measures include the identification, isolation and testing of potentially infected individuals. As this relies on an individual's awareness of infection, we investigated the extent to which healthy adults suspected having had COVID-19, and how COVID-19 suspicion and symptoms relate to antibodies indicative of a past infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Methods and findings Individuals donating plasma anywhere in the Netherlands between May 11th and 18th were screened for total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using ELISA and invited to participate in an online questionnaire about COVID-19-related symptoms and awareness. Antibody and questionnaire data were complete for 3,676 individuals, including 239 (6.5%) that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Here, we show that a 38% of the individuals that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies reported having had no or only very mild symptoms at any time during the peak of the epidemic. The loss of taste and\/or smell in particular was significantly associated with seropositivity, independent of age and sex. Forty-eight percent of antibody-positive persons did not suspect having had COVID-19, in spite of most of them reporting symptoms. Conclusions Awareness of infection was low among individuals that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, even at the peak of the epidemic. Improved awareness and recognition of COVID-19 symptoms and tracing of asymptomatic contacts is crucial to halting SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Katja van den Hurk","author_inst":"Sanquin Research"},{"author_name":"Eva-Maria Merz","author_inst":"Sanquin Research"},{"author_name":"Femmeke J.

Here we report follow-up serological analysis in these care homes five weeks later. Methods: Residents and staff had a convalescent blood sample for SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels and neutralising antibodies by SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR five weeks after the primary COVID-19 outbreak investigation. Results: Of the 518 residents and staff in the initial investigation, 208\/241 (86.3%) surviving residents and 186\/254 (73.2%) staff underwent serological testing. Almost all SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive residents and staff were antibody positive five weeks later, whether symptomatic (residents 35\/35, 100%; staff, 22\/22, 100%) or asymptomatic (residents 32\/33, 97.0%; staff 21\/22, 95.1%). Symptomatic but SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative residents and staff also had high seropositivity rates (residents 23\/27, 85.2%; staff 18\/21, 85.7%), as did asymptomatic RT-PCR negative individuals (residents 62\/92, 67.3%; staff 95\/143, 66.4%). Neutralising antibody was present in 118\/132 (89.4%) seropositive individuals and was not associated with age or symptoms. Ten residents (10\/108, 9.3%) remained RT-PCR positive, but with lower RT-PCR cycle threshold values; all 7 tested were seropositive. New infections were detected in three residents and one staff member. Conclusions: RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 significantly underestimates the true extent of an outbreak in institutional settings. Elderly frail residents and younger healthier staff were equally able to mount robust and neutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2. More than two-thirds of residents and staff members had detectable antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 irrespective of their nasal swab RT-PCR positivity or symptoms status.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shamez N Ladhani","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Anna J Jeffery-Smith","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Monika Patel","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Roshni Janarthanan","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Fok","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Emma Crawley-Boevey","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Amoolya Vusirikala","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Elena Fernandez","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Marina Sanchez-Perez","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Suzanne Tang","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Kate Dun-Campbell","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Edward Wynne-Evans","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Anita Bell","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Bharat Patel","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Zahin Amin-Chowdhury","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Felicity Aiano","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Karthik Paranthaman","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Thomas Ma","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Maria Saavedra-Campos","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Joanna Ellis","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Meera Chand","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Kevin Brown","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mary E Ramsay","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Susan Hopkins","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Nandini Shetty","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"J Yimmy Chow","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Robin Gopal","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Maria Zambon","author_inst":"Public Health England"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.10.244350","rel_title":"Human Embryonic Stem Cell-derived Lung Organoids: a Model for SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Drug Test","rel_date":"2020-08-12","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.10.244350","rel_abs":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is spread primary via respiratory droplets and infects the lungs. Currently widely used cell lines and animals are unable to accurately mimic human physiological conditions because of the abnormal status of cell lines (transformed or cancer cells) and species differences between animals and humans. Organoids are stem cell-derived self-organized three-dimensional culture in vitro and model the physiological conditions of natural organs. Here we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infected and extensively replicated in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)-derived lung organoids, including airway and alveolar organoids. Ciliated cells, alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells and rare club cells were virus target cells. Electron microscopy captured typical replication, assembly and release ultrastructures and revealed the presence of viruses within lamellar bodies in AT2 cells. Virus infection induced more severe cell death in alveolar organoids than in airway organoids. Additionally, RNA-seq revealed early cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and an unexpected downregulation of ACE2 mRNA. Further, compared to the transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) inhibitor camostat, the nucleotide analog prodrug Remdesivir potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung organoids. Therefore, human lung organoids can serve as a pathophysiological model for SARS-CoV-2 infection and drug discovery.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rongjuan Pei","author_inst":"Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, China"},{"author_name":"Jianqi Feng","author_inst":"Cancer Research Institute, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China"},{"author_name":"Yecheng Zhang","author_inst":"Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, China"},{"author_name":"Hao Sun","author_inst":"Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, China"},{"author_name":"Lian Li","author_inst":"Cancer Research Institute, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China"},{"author_name":"Xuejie Yang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510530, China"},{"author_name":"Jiangping He","author_inst":"The Centre of Cell Lineage and Atlas (CCLA), Bioland Laboratory (Guangzhou Regenerative Medicine and Health-Guangdong Laboratory), Guangzhou 510530, China"},{"author_name":"Shuqi Xiao","author_inst":"Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, China"},{"author_name":"Jin Xiong","author_inst":"Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, China"},{"author_name":"Ying Lin","author_inst":"Cancer Research Institute, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China"},{"author_name":"Kun Wen","author_inst":"Microbiome Medicine Center, Division of Laboratory Medicine, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Hongwei Zhou","author_inst":"Microbiome Medicine Center, Division of Laboratory Medicine, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Jiekai Chen","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510530, China"},{"author_name":"Zhili Rong","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xinwen Chen","author_inst":"Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, China"},{"author_name":"Felicity Aiano","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Karthik Paranthaman","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Thomas Ma","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Maria Saavedra-Campos","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Joanna Ellis","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Meera Chand","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Kevin Brown","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mary E Ramsay","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Susan Hopkins","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Nandini Shetty","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"J Yimmy Chow","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Robin Gopal","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Maria Zambon","author_inst":"Public Health England"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.11.20145458","rel_title":"Oncologic Immunomodulatory Agents in Patients with Cancer and COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-08-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.11.20145458","rel_abs":"Background Corticosteroids, anti-CD20 agents, immunotherapies, and cytotoxic chemotherapy are commonly used in the treatment of patients with cancer. How these agents impact patients with cancer who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear. Methods We retrospectively investigated associations between SARS-CoV-2-associated respiratory failure or death with receipt of the aforementioned medications and with pre-COVID-19 neutropenia. The study included all cancer patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center until June 2, 2020 (N=820). We controlled for cancer-related characteristics known to predispose to worse COVID-19. To address that more acutely ill patients receive therapeutic corticosteroids, we examined patient subsets based on different levels of respiratory support: <=2 L\/min supplemental oxygen, >2L\/min supplemental oxygen, and advanced respiratory support prior to death. Results Corticosteroid administration was associated with worse outcomes in the pre-2L supplemental oxygen cohort; no statistically significant difference was observed in the >2L\/min supplemental oxygen and post-critical cohorts. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were lower, and ferritin levels were higher, after corticosteroid administration. In patients with metastatic thoracic cancer, 9 of 25 (36%) and 10 of 31 (32%) had respiratory failure or death among those who did and did not receive immunotherapy, respectively. Seven of 23 (30%) and 52 of 187 (28%) patients with hematologic cancer had respiratory failure or death among those who did and did not receive anti-CD20 therapy, respectively. Chemotherapy itself was not associated with worse outcomes, but pre-COVID-19 neutropenia was associated with worse COVID-19 course. Relative prevalence of chemotherapy-associated neutropenia in previous studies may account for different conclusions regarding the risks of chemotherapy in patients with COVID-19. In the absence of prospective studies and evidence-based guidelines, our data may aid providers looking to assess the risks and benefits of these agents in caring for cancer patients in the COVID-19 era.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Justin Jee","author_inst":"MSKCC"},{"author_name":"Aaron J Stonestrom","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Sean Devlin","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Teresa Nguyentran","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Beatriz Wills","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Varun Narendra","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Michael B Foote","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Melissa Lumish","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Santosha Vardhana","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Stephen Pastores","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Neha Korde","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Dhwani Patel","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Steven Horwitz","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Michael Scordo","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Anthony Daniyan","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Felicity Aiano","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Karthik Paranthaman","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Thomas Ma","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Maria Saavedra-Campos","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Joanna Ellis","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Meera Chand","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Kevin Brown","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mary E Ramsay","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Susan Hopkins","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Nandini Shetty","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"J Yimmy Chow","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Robin Gopal","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Maria Zambon","author_inst":"Public Health England"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"oncology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.10.20171637","rel_title":"Hospital length of stay for severe COVID-19: implications for Remdesivir's value","rel_date":"2020-08-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.10.20171637","rel_abs":"Remdesivir has been granted emergency use authorization for treatment of severe COVID-19. Remdesivir's pricing is based on a presumed reduction of hospital length of stay (LOS) by four days. But the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT-1) that suggested this treatment benefit excluded patients who were expected to be discharged within 72 hours. Perhaps as a result, median time to recovery was unusually long in both arms of the study (15 days vs 11 days). Remdesivir requires a 5-day inpatient stay, so patients who would otherwise be discharged in fewer than 5 days may remain hospitalized to complete treatment while patients who would be discharged between 5 and 8 days, would only have potential reductions in their hospital LOS of 0-3 days. In a retrospective analysis of 1643 adults with severe COVID-19 admitted to Columbia University Medical Center and the Allen community hospital between March 9, 2020 and April 23, 2020, median hospital LOS was 7 (3-14) days.

Accounting for missing data and the delay from symptom onset to confirmation test, this corresponds to 7,258 [95% CI 7,160-7,336] cases with symptom onset during this period, a likely underestimation of the real number. Using age-stratified transmission models parameterized to behavioral data and calibrated to regional hospital admissions, we estimated that 69,115 [58,072-77,449] COVID-19 symptomatic cases occurred, suggesting that 9 out of 10 cases with symptoms were not ascertained. Median detection rate increased from 7% [6-9]% to 31% [28-35]% over time, with regional estimates varying from 11% (Grand Est) to 78% (Normandy) by the end of June. Healthcare-seeking behavior in COVID-19 suspect cases remained low (31%) throughout the period. Model projections for the incidence of symptomatic cases (4.5 [3.9-5.0] per 100,000) were compatible with estimates integrating participatory and virological surveillance data, assuming all suspect cases consulted. Encouraging healthcare-seeking behavior and awareness in suspect cases is critical to improve detection. Substantially more aggressive and efficient testing with easier access is required to act as a pandemic-fighting tool. These elements should be considered in light of the currently observed resurgence of cases in France and other European countries.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giulia Pullano","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Laura Di Domenico","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Chiara E Sabbatini","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Eugenio Valdano","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Cl\u00e9ment Turbelin","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Marion Debin","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Caroline Guerrisi","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Charly Kengne-Kuetche","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"C\u00e9cile Souty","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Thomas Hanslik","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Thierry Blanchon","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Pierre-Yves Bo\u00eblle","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Julie Figoni","author_inst":"Sant\u00e9 publique France"},{"author_name":"Sophie Vaux","author_inst":"Sant\u00e9 publique France"},{"author_name":"Christine Camp\u00e8se","author_inst":"Sant\u00e9 publique France"},{"author_name":"Sibylle Bernard-Stoecklin","author_inst":"Sant\u00e9 publique France"},{"author_name":"Vittoria Colizza","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Thomas Ma","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Maria Saavedra-Campos","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Joanna Ellis","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Meera Chand","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Kevin Brown","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mary E Ramsay","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Susan Hopkins","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Nandini Shetty","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"J Yimmy Chow","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Robin Gopal","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Maria Zambon","author_inst":"Public Health England"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.10.20171850","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence survey among 18,000 healthcare and administrative personnel at hospitals, pre-hospital services, and specialist practitioners in the Central Denmark Region","rel_date":"2020-08-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.10.20171850","rel_abs":"Objectives: The objective of this study was to perform a large seroprevalence survey on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among Danish healthcare workers to identify high risk groups. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: All healthcare workers and administrative personnel at the seven hospitals, pre-hospital services and specialist practitioner clinics in the Central Denmark Region were invited by e-mail to be tested for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 by a commercial SARS-CoV-2 total antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise Co., Ltd., Beijing, China). Participants: A total of 25,950 participants were invited. Of these, 17,987 (69%) showed up for blood sampling, and 17,971 had samples available for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. Main outcome measures: 1) Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies; 2) Risk factors for seropositivity; 3) Association of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibodies. Results: After adjustment for assay sensitivity and specificity, the overall seroprevalence was 3.4% (CI: 2.5%-3.8%). The seroprevalence was higher in the western part of the region than in the eastern part (11.9% vs 1.2%, difference: 10.7 percentage points, CI: 9.5-12.2). In the high prevalence area, the emergency departments had the highest seroprevalence (29.7%) while departments without patients or with limited patient contact had the lowest seroprevalence (2.2%). Multivariable logistic regression analysis with age, sex, and profession as the predictors showed that nursing staff, medical doctors, and biomedical laboratory scientists had a higher risk than medical secretaries, who served as reference (OR = 7.3, CI: 3.5-14.9; OR = 4., CI: 1.8-8.9; and OR = 5.0, CI: 2.1-11.6, respectively). Among the total 668 seropositive participants, 433 (64.8%) had previously been tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and 50.0% had a positive RT-PCR result. A total of 98% of individuals who had a previous positive viral RNA test were also found to be seropositive. Conclusions: We found large differences in the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in staff working in the healthcare sector within a small geographical area of Denmark and signs of in-hospital transmission. Half of all seropositive staff had been tested positive by PCR prior to this survey. This study raises awareness of precautions which should be taken to avoid in-hospital transmission. Additionally, regular testing of healthcare workers for SARS-CoV-2 should be considered to identify areas with increased transmission. Trial registration: The study is approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency (1-16-02-207-20).","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sanne Jespersen","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Susan Mikkelsen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Thomas Greve","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Kathrine Agergaard Kaspersen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital & Danish Big Data Centre for Environment and Health (BERTHA), Aarhus University, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Martin Tolstrup","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Jens Kjaergaard Boldsen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital & Danish Big Data Centre for Environment and Health (BERTHA), Aarhus University, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Jacob Dvinge Redder","author_inst":"Business Intelligence, Central Denmark Region, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Kent Nielsen","author_inst":"Department of Occupational Medicine, Herning Regional Hospital, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Anders Moensted Abildgaard","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Henrik Albert Kolstad","author_inst":"Department of Occupational Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Lars Oestergaard","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Marianne Kragh Thomsen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Holger Jon Moeller","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Christian Erikstrup","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital & Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Christine Camp\u00e8se","author_inst":"Sant\u00e9 publique France"},{"author_name":"Sibylle Bernard-Stoecklin","author_inst":"Sant\u00e9 publique France"},{"author_name":"Vittoria Colizza","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Thomas Ma","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Maria Saavedra-Campos","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Joanna Ellis","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Meera Chand","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Kevin Brown","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mary E Ramsay","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Susan Hopkins","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Nandini Shetty","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"J Yimmy Chow","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Robin Gopal","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Maria Zambon","author_inst":"Public Health England"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.10.20171884","rel_title":"On the track of the D839Y mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike fusion peptide: emergence and geotemporal spread of a highly prevalent variant in Portugal","rel_date":"2020-08-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.10.20171884","rel_abs":"Mutations in the Spike motif predicted to correspond to the fusion peptide are considered of interest as this domain is a potential target for anti-viral drug development that plays a pivotal role in inserting SARS-CoV-2 into human cell membranes. We tracked the temporal and geographical spread of a SARS-CoV-2 variant with the Spike D839Y mutation in the fusion peptide, which was detected early during the COVID-19 epidemic in Portugal. We show that this variant was most likely imported from Italy in mid-late February 2020, becoming prevalent in the Northern and Central regions of Portugal, where represented 22% and 59% of the sampled genomes, respectively, until the end of April 2020. Based on our high sequencing sampling during the early epidemics [15,5% (1275\/8251) and 6,0% (1500\/24987) of all confirmed cases until the end of March and April, respectively)], we estimate that, between March 14th and April 9th (covering the exponential phase of the epidemic), the relative frequency of Spike Y839 variant increased at a rate of 12.1% (6.1%-18.2%, CI 95%) at every three days, being potentially associated with one in each four (20.8-29.7%, CI 95%) COVID-19 cases in Portugal during the same period. This observation places the Spike Y839 variant in the origin of the largest SARS-CoV-2 transmission chain during the first month of the COVID-19 epidemic in Portugal. We hypothesize that population\/epidemiological effects (founder effects) and enhanced selective advantage might have concomitantly contributed to the increasing frequency trajectory of the Spike Y839 variant. Screening of the D839Y mutation globally confirmed its detection in 12 additional countries, even though the huge differences in genome sampling between countries hampers any accurate estimate of D839Y global frequency. In summary, our data points out that SARS-CoV-2 Spike Y839 variants, namely the descendent variant of the globally spread G614 variant detected in Portugal, need continuous and close surveillance.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"V\u00edtor Borges","author_inst":"Bioinformatics Unit, Department of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Health Doutor Ricardo Jorge (INSA), Lisbon, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Joana Isidro","author_inst":"Bioinformatics Unit, Department of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Health Doutor Ricardo Jorge (INSA), Lisbon, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Helena Cortes-Martins","author_inst":"Reference and Surveillance Unit, Department of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Health Doutor Ricardo Jorge (INSA), Lisbon, Portugal"},{"author_name":"S\u00edlvia Duarte","author_inst":"Innovation and Technology Unit, Department of Human Genetics, National Institute of Health Doutor Ricardo Jorge (INSA), Lisbon, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Lu\u00eds Vieira","author_inst":"Innovation and Technology Unit, Department of Human Genetics, National Institute of Health Doutor Ricardo Jorge (INSA), Lisbon, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Leite","author_inst":"Instituto Gulbenkian de Ci\u00eancia (IGC), Oeiras, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Isabel Gordo","author_inst":"Instituto Gulbenkian de Ci\u00eancia (IGC), Oeiras, Portugal."},{"author_name":"Constantino P.

Individuals infected by the virus exhibited different degrees of symptoms, the basis of which remains largely unclear. Currently, though convalescent individuals have been shown with both cellular and humoral immune responses, there is very limited understanding on the immune responses, especially adaptive immune responses, in patients with severe COVID-19. Here, we examined 10 blood samples from COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The majority of them (70%) mounted SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral immunity with production of neutralizing antibodies. However, compared to healthy controls, the percentages and absolute numbers of both NK cells and CD8+ T cells were significantly reduced, accompanied with decreased IFNg expression in CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood from severe patients. Most notably, we failed in detecting SARS-CoV-2-specific IFNg production by peripheral blood lymphocytes from these patients. Our work thus indicates that COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms are associated with defective cellular immunity, which not only provides insights on understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19, but also has implications in developing an effective vaccine to SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ling Ni","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine,Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Meng-Li Cheng","author_inst":"College of Basic Medical Science, Jilin University"},{"author_name":"Hui Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Virology, State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yu Feng","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Jingyuan Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, and Beijing Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases,"},{"author_name":"Fang Ye","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Chui Yang Liu Hospital affiliated to Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Qing Ye","author_inst":"Department of Virology, State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences,"},{"author_name":"Gengzhen Zhu","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoli Li","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Pengzhi Wang","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Jing Shao","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Yong-qiang Deng","author_inst":"Department of Virology, State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Peng Wei","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Fang Chen","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Chui Yang Liu Hospital affiliated to Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Cheng-feng Qin","author_inst":"Department of Virology, State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Guoqing Wang","author_inst":"College of Basic Medical Science, Jilin University"},{"author_name":"Fan Li","author_inst":"College of Basic Medical Science, Jilin University"},{"author_name":"Hui Zeng","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, and Beijing Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Chen Dong","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Joanna Ellis","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Meera Chand","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Kevin Brown","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mary E Ramsay","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Susan Hopkins","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Nandini Shetty","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"J Yimmy Chow","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Robin Gopal","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Maria Zambon","author_inst":"Public Health England"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"allergy and immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.10.20171439","rel_title":"Extended SEIQR type model for COVID-19 epidemic and data analysis","rel_date":"2020-08-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.10.20171439","rel_abs":"An extended SEIQR type model is considered in order to model the COVID-19 epidemic.

This is a scenario generally not much anticipated by previous theory, and in particular, there has been little attention paid to the question of extinction as a means to eradicate the virus; the prevailing view appears to be that this is unfeasible without a vaccine. We use a simple well-mixed stochastic SIR model as a basis for our considerations, and calculate a new result, using branching process theory, for the distribution of times to extinction. Surprisingly, the distribution is an extreme value distribution of the Gumbel type, and we show that the key parameter determining its mean and standard deviation is the expected rate of decline Re = {gamma}(1-Re) of infections, where {gamma} is the rate of recovery from infection and Re is the usual effective reproductive number. The result also reveals a critical threshold number of infected I&#134 = 1\/(1-Re), below which stochastic forces dominate and need be considered for accurate predictions. As this theory ignores migration between populations, we compare against a realistic spatial epidemic simulator and simple stochastic simulations of sub-divided populations with global migration, to find very comparable results to our simple predictions; in particular, we find global migration has the effect of a simple upwards rescaling of Re with the same Gumbel extinction time distribution we derive from our non-spatial model. Within the UK, using recent estimates of I0{approx}37000 infected and Re= 0.9, this model predicts a mean extinction time of 616{+\/-}90 days or approximately ~2 years, but could be as short as 123{+\/-}15 days, or roughly 4 months for Re = 0.4. Globally, the theory predicts extinction in less than 200 days, if the reproductive number is restricted to Re < 0.5. Overall, these results highlight the extreme sensitivity of extinction times when Re approaches 1 and the necessity of reducing the effective reproductive number significantly (Re<{approx}0.5) for relatively rapid extinction of an epidemic or pandemic.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bhavin S Khatri","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Vitaly Volpert","author_inst":"Institut Camille Jordan, UMR 5208 CNRS, University Lyon 1, 69622 Villeurbanne, France"},{"author_name":"Malay Banerjee","author_inst":"IIT Kanpur"},{"author_name":"Yu Feng","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Jingyuan Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, and Beijing Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases,"},{"author_name":"Fang Ye","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Chui Yang Liu Hospital affiliated to Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Qing Ye","author_inst":"Department of Virology, State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences,"},{"author_name":"Gengzhen Zhu","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoli Li","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Pengzhi Wang","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Jing Shao","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Yong-qiang Deng","author_inst":"Department of Virology, State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Peng Wei","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Fang Chen","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Chui Yang Liu Hospital affiliated to Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Cheng-feng Qin","author_inst":"Department of Virology, State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Guoqing Wang","author_inst":"College of Basic Medical Science, Jilin University"},{"author_name":"Fan Li","author_inst":"College of Basic Medical Science, Jilin University"},{"author_name":"Hui Zeng","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, and Beijing Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Chen Dong","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Joanna Ellis","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Meera Chand","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Kevin Brown","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mary E Ramsay","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Susan Hopkins","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Nandini Shetty","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"J Yimmy Chow","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Robin Gopal","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Maria Zambon","author_inst":"Public Health England"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.10.20171942","rel_title":"High prevalence of symptoms among Brazilian subjects with antibodies against SARS-CoV-2: a nationwide household survey","rel_date":"2020-08-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.10.20171942","rel_abs":"Since the beginning of the pandemic of COVID-19, there has been a widespread assumption that most infected persons are asymptomatic. A frequently-cited early study from China suggested that 86% of all infections were undocumented, which was used as indirect evidence that patients were asymptomatic. Using data from the most recent wave of the EPICOVID19 study, a nationwide household-based survey including 133 cities from all states of Brazil, we estimated the proportion of people with and without antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 who were asymptomatic, which symptoms were most frequently reported, the number of symptoms reported and the association between symptomatology and socio-demographic characteristics. We were able to test 33,205 subjects using a rapid antibody test that was previously validated. Information on symptoms was collected before participants received the test result. Out of 849 (2.7%) participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, only 12.1% (95%CI 10.1-14.5) reported no symptoms since the start of the pandemic, compared to 42.2% (95%CI 41.7-42.8) among those who tested negative. The largest difference between the two groups was observed for changes in smell or taste (56.5% versus 9.1%, a 6.2-fold difference). Symptoms change in smell or taste, fever and myalgia were most likely to predict positive test results as suggested by recursive partitioning tree analysis. Among individuals without any of these three symptoms (74.2% of the sample), only 0.8% tested positive, compared to 18.3% of those with both fever and changes in smell or taste. Most subjects with antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil are symptomatic, even though most present only mild symptoms.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ana Maria Baptista Menezes","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Cesar G Victora","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Fernando P Hartwig","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Mariangela F Silveira","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Bernardo L Horta","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Aluisio J D Barros","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Fernando C Whermeister","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Marilia A Mesenburg","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Lucia C Pellanda","author_inst":"Fundacao Universidade Federal de Ciencias de Saude de Porto Alegre"},{"author_name":"Odir A Dellagostin","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Claudio J Struchiner","author_inst":"Fundacao Getulio Vargas"},{"author_name":"Marcelo N Burattini","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Fernando C Barros","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Pedro C Hallal","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Cheng-feng Qin","author_inst":"Department of Virology, State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Guoqing Wang","author_inst":"College of Basic Medical Science, Jilin University"},{"author_name":"Fan Li","author_inst":"College of Basic Medical Science, Jilin University"},{"author_name":"Hui Zeng","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, and Beijing Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Chen Dong","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Joanna Ellis","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Meera Chand","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Kevin Brown","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mary E Ramsay","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Susan Hopkins","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Nandini Shetty","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"J Yimmy Chow","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Robin Gopal","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Maria Zambon","author_inst":"Public Health England"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.11.20173005","rel_title":"Histopathology of Third Trimester Placenta from SARS-CoV-2-Positive Women","rel_date":"2020-08-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.11.20173005","rel_abs":"Background: This study aims to investigate whether maternal SARS-CoV-2 status affect placental pathology. Methods: A retrospective case-control study was conducted by reviewing charts and slides of placentas between April 1 to July 24, 2020. Clinical history of COVID-19 were searched in Pathology Database (CoPath). Controls were matched with SARS-CoV-2-negative women with singleton deliveries in the 3rd-trimester. Individual and group, pathological features were extracted from placental pathology reports. Results: Twenty-one 3rd-trimester, placentas from SARS-CoV-2-positive women were identified and compared to 20 placentas from SARS-CoV-2-negative women. There were no significant differences in individual or group gross or microscopic pathological features between the groups. Within the SARS-CoV-2+ group, there are no differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic women. Conclusion: Placentas from SARS-CoV-2-positive women do not demonstrate a specific pathological pattern. Pregnancy complicated with COVID-19 during the 3rd trimester does not have a demonstrable effect on placental structure and pathology.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mai He","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Priya Skaria","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kasey Kreutz","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ling Chen","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ian Hagemann","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ebony B Carter","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Indira U Mysorekar","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"D Michael Nelson","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Pfeifer","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Louis P Dehner","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Claudio J Struchiner","author_inst":"Fundacao Getulio Vargas"},{"author_name":"Marcelo N Burattini","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Fernando C Barros","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Pedro C Hallal","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Cheng-feng Qin","author_inst":"Department of Virology, State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Guoqing Wang","author_inst":"College of Basic Medical Science, Jilin University"},{"author_name":"Fan Li","author_inst":"College of Basic Medical Science, Jilin University"},{"author_name":"Hui Zeng","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, and Beijing Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Chen Dong","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Joanna Ellis","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Meera Chand","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Kevin Brown","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mary E Ramsay","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Susan Hopkins","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Nandini Shetty","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"J Yimmy Chow","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Robin Gopal","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Maria Zambon","author_inst":"Public Health England"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pathology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.10.20169912","rel_title":"Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in children with household exposition to adults with COVID-19: preliminary findings","rel_date":"2020-08-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.10.20169912","rel_abs":"wheather children are easily susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection is still a debated question and a currently a hot topic, particularly in view of important decisions on school opening. For this reason, we decide to describe preliminary data showing the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in children with known household exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, our report shows that household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is high in both adults and children, with similar rates of SARS-CoV-2 IgG in all age groups, including the younger children. A total of 44 out of 80 household contacts (55%) of index patients had anti SARS-CoV-2 IgG. In particular, 16 (59,26%) adult partners had IgG antibodies compared with 28 (52,83%) of pediatric contacts (P > 0.05). Among the pediatric population, children [&ge;] 5 years of age had similar probability of having SARS-CoV-2 IgG (21\/39, 53.8%) compared with those < 5 years (7\/14, 50%) (P > 0.05). Adult partners and children also had a probability of having SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Interestingly, 35.7% of children and 33.3% of adults with SARS-CoV-2 IgG were previously diagnosed as COVID-19 cases. Since this evidence of high rate of IgG in children exposed to SARS-CoV-2 has public health implication, with this comment we highlight the need of establishing appropriate guidelines for school opening and other social activities related to childhood.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"danilo buonsenso","author_inst":"Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

On 22 March 2020, amid increasing daily case numbers, the Australian Government implemented lockdown restrictions to help flatten the curve. Our study aimed to understand the impact of lockdown restrictions on sexual and reproductive health. Here we focus on sexual practices. Methods: An online survey was open from the 23 April 2020 to the 11 May 2020. Participants were recruited online via social media and other networks and were asked to report on their sexual practices in 2019 and during lockdown. Logistic regression was used to calculate the difference (including 95% confidence intervals) in the proportion of sex practices between time periods. Results: Of the 1187 who commenced the survey, 965 (81.3%) completed it. Overall 70% were female and 66.3% were aged 18 to 29 years. Most (53.5%) reported less sex during lockdown than in 2019. Compared with 2019, participants were more likely to report sex with a spouse (35.3% vs 41.7%; difference=6.4%; 95%CI: 3.6, 9.2) and less likely to report sex with a girl\/boyfriend (45.1% vs 41.8%; diff=-3.3%; 95%CI: -7.0, -0.4) or with casual hook-up (31.4% vs 7.8%; 95%CI:-26.9, -19.8). Solo sex activities increased, 14.6% (123\/840) reported using sex toys more often and 26.0% (218\/838) reported masturbating more often. Dating app use decreased during lockdown compared with 2019 (42.1% vs 27.3%; difference= -14.8%; 95%CI: -17.6, -11.9). Using dating apps for chatting\/texting (89.8% vs 94.5%; diff=4.7%; 95%CI:1.0, 8.5) and for setting up virtual dates (2.6% vs 17.2%; diff=14.6%; 95%CI:10.1, 19.2) increased during lockdown. Conclusion: Although significant declines in sexual activity during lockdown were reported, people did not completely stop engaging in sexual activities during the pandemic, highlighting the importance of ensuring availability of normal sexual and reproductive health services during global emergencies.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jacqueline Coombe","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Fabian Kong","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Helen Bittleston","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Hennie Williams","author_inst":"Melbourne Sexual Health Centre & The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Jane Tomnay","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Alaina Vaisey","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Sue Malta","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Jane Goller","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Meredith Temple-Smith","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Louise Bourchier","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Andrew Lau","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Eric Chow","author_inst":"Melbourne Sexual Health Centre, The University of Melbourne, Monash University"},{"author_name":"Jane S Hocking","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Pedro C Hallal","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Cheng-feng Qin","author_inst":"Department of Virology, State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Guoqing Wang","author_inst":"College of Basic Medical Science, Jilin University"},{"author_name":"Fan Li","author_inst":"College of Basic Medical Science, Jilin University"},{"author_name":"Hui Zeng","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, and Beijing Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Chen Dong","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Joanna Ellis","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Meera Chand","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Kevin Brown","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mary E Ramsay","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Susan Hopkins","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Nandini Shetty","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"J Yimmy Chow","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Robin Gopal","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Maria Zambon","author_inst":"Public Health England"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"sexual and reproductive health"}]}
