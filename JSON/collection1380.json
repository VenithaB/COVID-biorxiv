Beside demographic data and media exposure anxiety was assessed using generalized anxiety disorder scale GAD-7. multivariable regression was used to identify the correlation between anxiety and media exposure Result: the result show that there is positive correlation between media exposure and anxiety during COVID19 outbreak in Kuwait (p<.001), furthermore it revealed that there is significant relationship between the frequency of exposure and anxiety(<.001) Conclusion: from this study we can understand that during COVID19 pandemic exposure to media can cause anxiety therefore measures should be taken by the governments to fight misinformation and physician should pay more attention to mental health disease during this period.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"lulua falah alasousi","author_inst":"KIMS"},{"author_name":"sara alhammouri","author_inst":"KIMS"},{"author_name":"sara alabdulhadi","author_inst":"KIMS"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"primary care research"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.24.20180729","rel_title":"Convalescent Plasma in treatment of COVID-19: A review of evidence for a living systematic benefit-risk assessment","rel_date":"2020-08-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.24.20180729","rel_abs":"Objectives: We aimed to review the evidence for a living systematic benefit risk assessment for convalescent plasma use amongst patients with severe COVID-19 disease, based on currently available data. Methods: The assessment used the Benefit-Risk Action Team (BRAT) framework. Convalescent plasma treatment in severe COVID-19 was compared to standard of care, placebo or other treatments. A literature search was conducted to identify published papers from January 1st, 2019 until July 8th, 2020. A value tree was constructed which included ranked key benefits and risks. Results: We screened 396 papers from PubMed and 127 papers from Embase. Four studies were eligible for inclusion as they contained comparative data. Results from a randomised controlled trial revealed a non-statistically significant shortening of time to clinical improvement of 2.15 days (95% CI, -5.28 to 0.99 days) in the intervention group compared with the control group, with a possible signal of increased efficacy amongst a small subset of patients with severe disease (but not life threatening disease), however this study may have been underpowered. Interpretation of findings amongst the three controlled non-randomised studies were limited by small patient numbers, lack of randomisation, and confounding by co-administration of other treatments. Limited data availability at the current time precluded construction of a data summary table and further quantitative analysis. Conclusions: There was insufficient evidence from controlled studies to complete a data summary table for a systematic benefit-risk assessment of the use of CP for severe COVID-19 disease at the current time, and as such a benefit-risk conclusion could not be made. Whilst uncontrolled case series have suggested positive findings with CP, results from these studies are very difficult to interpret. We provide a framework which can be updated when further data that have an impact on the benefit-risk become available.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Miranda Davies","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Samantha Lane","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Alison Evans","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline Denyer","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Sandeep Dhanda","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Debabrata Roy","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Vicki Osborne","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Saad AW Shakir","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit, Southampton, UK"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.24.20180810","rel_title":"Mutational landscape and dominant lineages in the SARS-CoV-2 infections in the state of Telangana, India","rel_date":"2020-08-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.24.20180810","rel_abs":"The novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19 has rapidly turned into a pandemic, infecting millions and causing ~7 million deaths across the globe.

Such a tool can save time in interpreting chest X-rays and increase the accuracy and thereby enhance our medical capacity for detection and diagnosis COVID-19. The idea is that a set of X-ray medical lung images (which include normal, infected by bacteria, infected by virus including COVID-19) were used to train a deep CNN which can be able to distinguish between the noise and the useful information and then uses this training to interpret new images by recognizing patterns that indicate certain diseases such as coronavirus infection in the individual images. The supervised learning method is used as the process of learning from the training dataset can be thought of as a doctor supervising the learning process. It becomes more accurate as the number of analyzed images growing. In this way, it imitates the training for a doctor, but the theory is that since it is capable of learning from a far larger set of images than any human, can have the potential of being more accurate.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Terry Gao Sr.","author_inst":"CMDHB"},{"author_name":"Grace Wang","author_inst":"AUT"},{"author_name":"Pratyusha Bala","author_inst":"Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics, Hyderabad, India"},{"author_name":"Vinay Donipadi","author_inst":"Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics, Hyderabad, India"},{"author_name":"Divya Vashisht","author_inst":"Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics, Hyderabad"},{"author_name":"Madhumohan Rao Katika","author_inst":"Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, India"},{"author_name":"Manohar Kandakatla","author_inst":"Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, India"},{"author_name":"Debashis Mitra","author_inst":"Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics, Hyderabad, India"},{"author_name":"Ashwin Dalal","author_inst":"Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics, Hyderabad, India"},{"author_name":"Murali Dharan Bashyam","author_inst":"Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics,, Hyderabad, India"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.24.20180836","rel_title":"Perceptions of Risk of Attending Hospital during the COVID-19 Pandemic: a UK public opinion survey","rel_date":"2020-08-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.24.20180836","rel_abs":"In order to inform clinical and research practice in secondary care in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, an online survey was used to collect public opinions on attending hospitals. The survey link was circulated via the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Public Involvement (PPI) Leads network and social media. 402 people completed the survey. Participants age ranged from the 18-85+, with the majority (337 (84%)) aged between 35 to 74 years. There were a higher number of women (77%) compared to men (23%); and were mainly White European (91%) compared to BAME (6%), or other (2%). Data collection included self-identified risk status due to comorbidity or age, and 100 point Likert-type scales to measures feelings of safety, factors affecting feelings of safety, intention to participate in research, comfort with new ways of working and attitudes to research. Results for feelings of safety scales indicate two distinct groups; one of respondents who felt quite safe and one of those who did not. Implementation of COVID-19 related safety measures such as social distancing, use of PPE and cleaning were strongly supported by most respondents. There was ambivalence around less certain measures such as regular staff antigen and antibody testing. Respondents were most likely to participate in research related to their own condition, COVID-19 research and vaccine research, but less likely to participate in healthy volunteer research, especially if suffering from a pre-existing comorbidity identified with increased risk or were female. There was general agreement that participants are comfortable with new ways of working, such as remote consultation, though women and BAME respondents were less comfortable. Findings raise concerns for health inequalities already impacting some groups in the pandemic. The role of clinical necessity and personal benefit support the reopening of services in line with clinical necessity. Moderate caution in respect of vaccine research relative to patient-participant research presents a challenge for pending recruitment demands, and would benefit from qualitative research to explore themes and concerns in more depth and support development and targeting of key messaging.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rebecca Pritchard","author_inst":"University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Emer Brady","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Yogini Chudasama","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Melanie Davies","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Gerry McCann","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Madhumohan Rao Katika","author_inst":"Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, India"},{"author_name":"Manohar Kandakatla","author_inst":"Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, India"},{"author_name":"Debashis Mitra","author_inst":"Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics, Hyderabad, India"},{"author_name":"Ashwin Dalal","author_inst":"Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics, Hyderabad, India"},{"author_name":"Murali Dharan Bashyam","author_inst":"Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics,, Hyderabad, India"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.22.20179911","rel_title":"Clinical Outcomes of Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 on Therapeutic Anticoagulants","rel_date":"2020-08-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.22.20179911","rel_abs":"Background: COVID-19 is associated with hypercoagulability and an increased incidence of thrombosis. We evaluated the clinical outcomes of adults hospitalized with COVID-19 who either continued therapeutic anticoagulants previously prescribed or who were newly started on anticoagulants during hospitalization. Methods: We performed an observational study of adult inpatients with COVID-19 at 10 hospitals affiliated with Northwestern Medicine in the Chicagoland area from March 9 to June 26, 2020. We evaluated clinical outcomes of subjects with COVID-19 who were continued on their outpatient therapeutic anticoagulation during hospitalization and those who were newly started on these medications compared to those who were on prophylactic doses of these medications based on the World Health Organization (WHO) Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement. The primary outcome was overall death while secondary outcomes were critical illness (WHO score >5), need for mechanical ventilation, and death among those subjects who first had critical illness adjusted for age, sex, race, body mass index (BMI), Charlson score, glucose on admission, and use of antiplatelet agents. Results: 1,716 subjects with COVID-19 were included in the analysis. 171 subjects (10.0%) were continued on their outpatient therapeutic anticoagulation and 201(11.7%) were started on new therapeutic anticoagulation during hospitalization. In subjects continued on home therapeutic anticoagulation, there were no differences in overall death, critical illness, mechanical ventilation, or death among subjects with critical illness compared to subjects on prophylactic anticoagulation. Subjects receiving new therapeutic anticoagulation for COVID-19 were more likely to die (OR 5.93; 95% CI 3.71-9.47), have critical illness (OR 14.51; 95% CI 7.43-28.31), need mechanical ventilation (OR 11.22; 95% CI 6.67-18.86), and die after first having critical illness.

Therapeutic anticoagulation for COVID-19 in absence of other indications was associated with worse clinical outcomes.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Niti G Patel","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of medicine"},{"author_name":"Ajay Bhasin","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Joseph M Feinglass","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Steven M Belknap","author_inst":"Independent Researcher"},{"author_name":"Michael P Angarone","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Elaine R Cohen","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey H Barsuk","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Debashis Mitra","author_inst":"Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics, Hyderabad, India"},{"author_name":"Ashwin Dalal","author_inst":"Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics, Hyderabad, India"},{"author_name":"Murali Dharan Bashyam","author_inst":"Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics,, Hyderabad, India"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"hematology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.19.20178376","rel_title":"Preventing disease after exposure to COVID-19 using hydroxychloroquine: A summary of a protocol for exploratory re-analysis of age and time-nuanced effects.","rel_date":"2020-08-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.19.20178376","rel_abs":"BACKGROUND: Three companion randomized pragmatic trials were recently published assessing the effect of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on pre- exposure prophylaxis (PrEP - Rajasingham, NCT04328467), post- exposure prophylaxis (PEP - Boulware, NCT04308668) and treatment of early COVID-19 (Skipper, NCT04308668). Respectively, they found non-statistically significant reductions in development or persistence of COVID of 17%, 27% and 20% and concluded that HCQ did not reduce, prevent or substantially treat COVID-19 illness. With a likely Type 2 error and over ambitious powering (50% effect), these effects may impact trajectory and resource models that drive decisions on lockdowns. All three studies have signals mostly found in the data appendices that suggest useful effects of HCQ in sub-groups worthy of re-analysis and prospective exploration. HCQ appeared to benefit younger rather than older patients in both the PrEP and PEP studies with respective reductions in COVID-19 of 45% and 36%. There was a strong benefit (40%) of HCQ in women (PrEP). Response to HCQ appeared to vary by type of exposure, with a large benefit (64%) in first responders (PrEP) and in household contacts (31%, PEP). Further confounding the data was the undefined, ex-protocol use of zinc and ascorbic acid. INTERIM FINDINGS: A major impediment in interpreting the PEP and treatment studies concerns the estimation of the time from exposure or symptom onset to treatment. Our initial analysis of the PEP study as published revealed a negative correlation between treatment lag and disease reduction, reaching 49% when HCQ was initiated within one day (RR 0.51, CI 0.176-1.46, p=0.249). However, our initial review (pursuant to this protocol, v1.1) of the publicly released PEP dataset revealed that, contrary to the study conclusion, this four-day period referred not to the time from exposure to treatment as we (and others) had understood, but to the time from exposure and enrollment, a difference of up to 3.5 days. Our re-stratification of new data we had requested revealed that HCQ may reduce the development of COVID-19 by as much as 65% (RR 0.35, CI 0.13-0.93, p=0.044) when received within 3 days of exposure (RR 0.83 at 3-5 days; RR 1.37 at 5-7 days). There remains ambiguity in these estimates addressable by further data we have requested. This same issue appears shared by the Treatment study. Further, patients in the PEP study were likely exposed to a series, rather than a single, index exposure, an issue possibly shared with the PrEP study. In the treatment study, there may be a bimodal effect of responders and non-responders, in whom symptoms may actually worsen. All three studies share the confounding effect of a possibly active folate placebo. OBJECTIVES: To conduct a post hoc exploratory re-analyses of the de-identified raw datasets from randomized studies of the use of HCQ for pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis, and treatment of early of COVID-19 with view to further defining: (a) The time dependent effect of HCQ, on post exposure prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19; (b) The age dependent effect of HCQ, on pre- and post- exposure prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19; (c) The sub-stratification of gender, time- and age-dependent effects by exposure type and risk level, as well as by the use of zinc and ascorbic acid; (d) The design of prospective clinical trials designed to test the hypotheses generated by this study. These analyses will be expanded should datasets from similarly designed Spanish studies involving PEP or treatment of (both NCT04304053) COVID-19, with directionally similar results, become available.

Methods - We investigated for SARS-CoV-2 presence in heart tissue autopsies of 6 consecutive COVID-19 patients deceased for respiratory failure showing no signs of cardiac involvement and with no history of heart disease. Cardiac autopsy samples were analysed by digital PCR, Western blot, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, RNAScope, and transmission electron microscopy assays. Results - The presence of SARS-CoV-2 into cardiomyocytes was invariably detected. A variable pattern of cardiomyocytes injury was observed, spanning from the absence of cell death and subcellular alterations hallmarks to the intracellular oedema and sarcomere ruptures. In addition, we found active viral transcription in cardiomyocytes, by detecting both sense and antisense SARS-CoV-2 spike RNA. Conclusions - In this analysis of autopsy cases, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 into cardiomyocytes, determining variable patterns of intracellular involvement, has been documented. All these findings suggest the need of a cardiologic surveillance even in survived COVID-19 patients not displaying a cardiac phenotype, in order to monitor potential long-term cardiac sequelae.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gaetano Pietro Bulfamante","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Gianluca Lorenzo Perrucci","author_inst":"Centro Cardiologico Monzino-IRRCS"},{"author_name":"Monica Falleni","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Elena Sommariva","author_inst":"Centro Cardiologico Monzino-IRCCS"},{"author_name":"Delfina Tosi","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Carla Martinelli","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Paola Songia","author_inst":"Centro Cardiologico Monzino-IRCCS"},{"author_name":"Paolo Poggio","author_inst":"Centro Cardiologico Monzino-IRCCS"},{"author_name":"Stefano Carugo","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Giulio Pompilio","author_inst":"Centro Cardiologico Monzino-IRCCS"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"cardiovascular medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.24.20174367","rel_title":"COVID-19 and heart medications: What's the connection?","rel_date":"2020-08-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.24.20174367","rel_abs":"Aim: To determine association between clinical outcome of COVID-19 and prior usage of cardiovascular and metabolic drugs, including, Aspirin, ACEIs, ARBs, Clopidogrel, metformin, and Statins.

Methods: All SARS-CoV-2 laboratory-confirmed cases with at least one PCR positive swab that is [&ge;]45 days after a first-positive swab were individually investigated for evidence of reinfection, and classified as showing strong, good, some, or weak\/no evidence for reinfection. Viral genome sequencing of the paired first-positive and reinfection viral specimens was conducted to confirm reinfection. Risk and incidence rate of reinfection were estimated. Results: Out of 133,266 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases, 243 persons (0.18%) had at least one subsequent positive swab [&ge;]45 days after the first-positive swab. Of these, 54 cases (22.2%) had strong or good evidence for reinfection. Median time between first and reinfection swab was 64.5 days (range: 45-129). Twenty-three of the 54 cases (42.6%) were diagnosed at a health facility suggesting presence of symptoms, while 31 (57.4%) were identified incidentally through random testing campaigns\/surveys or contact tracing. Only one person was hospitalized at time of reinfection, but still with mild infection. No deaths were recorded. Viral genome sequencing confirmed four out of 12 cases with available genetic evidence. Risk of reinfection was estimated at 0.01% (95% CI: 0.01-0.02%) and incidence rate of reinfection was estimated at 0.36 (95% CI: 0.28-0.47) per 10,000 person-weeks. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 reinfection can occur but is a rare phenomenon suggestive of a strong protective immunity against reinfection that lasts for at least a few months post primary infection.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Laith J Abu-Raddad","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Epidemiology Group, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar"},{"author_name":"Hiam Chemaitelly","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Epidemiology Group, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar"},{"author_name":"Joel A Malek","author_inst":"Genomics Laboratory, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar"},{"author_name":"Ayeda A Ahmed","author_inst":"Genomics Laboratory, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar"},{"author_name":"Yasmin A Mohamoud","author_inst":"Genomics Laboratory, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar"},{"author_name":"Shameem Younuskunju","author_inst":"Genomics Laboratory, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar"},{"author_name":"Houssein H.

Home containment and education lockdown had the largest independent impacts and were predicted to reduce the reproduction number by 35% and 26%, respectively. However, we find that in contexts with a reproduction number >2, no individual intervention is sufficient to stop the epidemic and increasingly stringent intervention combinations may be required.

Neighborhood deprivation has been observed to be associated with poorer health outcomes. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between neighborhood deprivation and COVID-19 in Louisiana. Methods: The Area Deprivation Index (ADI) was calculated and used to classify neighborhood deprivation at the census tract level. A total of 17 US census variables were used to calculate the ADI for each of the 1148 census tracts in Louisiana. The data were extracted from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2018. The neighborhoods were categorized into quintiles as well as low and high deprivation. The publicly available COVID-19 cumulative case counts by census tract was obtained from the Louisiana Department of Health website on July 31, 2020. Descriptive and Poisson regression analyses were performed. Results: Neighborhoods in Louisiana were substantially different with respect to deprivation. The ADI ranged from 136.00 for the most deprived neighborhood and -33.87 in the least deprived neighborhood. We observed that individuals residing in the most deprived neighborhoods had a 45% higher risk of COVID-19 disease compared to those residing in the least deprived neighborhoods. Conclusion: While the majority of previous studies were focused on very limited socio-environmental factors such as crowding and income, this study used a composite area-based deprivation index to examine the role of neighborhood environment on COVID-19. We observed a positive relationship between neighborhood deprivation and COVID-19 risk in Louisiana. The study findings can be utilized to promote public health preventions measures besides social distancing, wearing a mask while in public and frequent handwashing in vulnerable neighborhoods with greater deprivation.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Madhav KC","author_inst":"Epidemiology Program, School of Public Health, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center New Orleans, New Orleans, LA, United States"},{"author_name":"Evrim Oral","author_inst":"Biostatistics Program, School of Public Health, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center New Orleans, New Orleans, LA, United States"},{"author_name":"Susanne Straif-Bourgeois","author_inst":"Epidemiology Program, School of Public Health, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center New Orleans, New Orleans, LA, United States"},{"author_name":"Ariane L Rung","author_inst":"Epidemiology Program, School of Public Health, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center New Orleans, New Orleans, LA, United States"},{"author_name":"Edward S Peters","author_inst":"Epidemiology Program, School of Public Health, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center New Orleans, New Orleans, LA, United States"},{"author_name":"Peter J Loewen","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Amy L Greer","author_inst":"University of Guelph"},{"author_name":"Philippe Vanhems","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Bruno Lina","author_inst":"University of Lyon"},{"author_name":"Laurence Josset","author_inst":"University of Lyon"},{"author_name":"Thierry Wirth","author_inst":"PSL University"},{"author_name":"Peter Coyle","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Andrew Jeremijenko","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Anvar Hassan Kaleeckal","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Ali Nizar Latif","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation"},{"author_name":"Riyazuddin Mohammad Shaik","author_inst":"Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Hanan F Abdul Rahim","author_inst":"College of Health Sciences, QU Health, Qatar University"},{"author_name":"Hadi M Yassine","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Center, Qatar University"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Ghaith Al Kuwari","author_inst":"Primary Health Care Corporation"},{"author_name":"Hamad Eid Al Romaihi","author_inst":"Ministry of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Sheikh Mohammad Al Thani","author_inst":"Ministry of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Roberto Bertollini","author_inst":"Ministry of Public Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.24.20179192","rel_title":"UK prevalence of underlying conditions which increase the risk of severe COVID-19 disease: a point prevalence study using electronic health records","rel_date":"2020-08-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.24.20179192","rel_abs":"Background This study aimed to describe the population at risk of severe COVID-19 due to underlying health conditions across the United Kingdom in 2019. Methods We used anonymised electronic health records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD to describe the point prevalence on 5 March 2019 of the at-risk population following national guidance. Prevalence for any risk condition and for each individual condition is given overall and stratified by age and region. We repeated the analysis on 5 March 2014 for full regional representation and to describe prevalence of underlying health conditions in pregnancy. We additionally described the population of cancer survivors, and assessed the value of linked secondary care records for ascertaining COVID-19 at-risk status. Findings On 5 March 2019, 24.4% of the UK population were at risk due to a record of at least one underlying health condition, including 8.3% of school-aged children, 19.6% of working-aged adults, and 66.2% of individuals aged 70 years or more. 7.1% of the population had multimorbidity. The size of the at-risk population was stable over time comparing 2014 to 2019, despite increases in chronic liver disease and diabetes and decreases in chronic kidney disease and current asthma. Separately, 1.6% of the population had a new diagnosis of cancer in the past five years.

A multi-national survey about such mental health information about COVID-19 was conducted in May 2020 across six Asian regions: Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. Data were collected from a population representative sample of 11,895 adults on their stress symptoms and reactions to COVID-19 and the related public health measures. 59.1% of the respondents showed at least one substantial stress symptom. The situation was particularly worrying in South Korea, where 75% of the respondents reported substantial stress symptoms. Respondents who were young, educated, lived in an urban area, had a high socio-economic status, had a history of chronic illness or mental illness, or who lived with a pregnant woman, elderly or children were most vulnerable to stress during the pandemic. Stress reactions showed a positive relationship with the amount of time spent following news about the COVID-19 outbreak. Asian adults coped with their stress by preparing safety equipment and extra daily commodities (62.4%) and by following government-issued public health measures (60.1%). Most Asian (71%) also frequently checked on the safety of family members and friends to keep each other safe. The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated stringent public health measures have largely increased the prevalence of substantial stress symptoms across multiple Asian regions. Governments should prepare this mental health pandemic and the associated social repercussions.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ricci P.H.

However, the applicability of internet searches to monitor COVID-19 infections and public health awareness in South Asian countries are unclear. Objectives To assess the association of public interest and health literacy in COVID-19 with the actual number of infected cases for countries in South Asia. Methods Google Trends data from January to March 2020 were used to correlate public interest and health literacy with official data on COVID-19 cases using the relative search volume (RSV) index. Public interest in COVID-19 was retrieved in RSV indices with the search term Coronavirus (Virus). Similarly, an OR combination of search terms hand wash, face mask, hand sanitizer, face shield, and gloves were used to retrieve RSV indices as a surrogate of population health literacy in COVID-19. Daily confirmed COVID-19 cases were obtained from the COVID-19 data repository managed by the Johns Hopkins University. Country-level time-lag correlation analyses were performed for a time lag between 30 and +30 days. Results COVID-19-related worldwide public interest reached a peak on March 16, 2020, right after the WHO announcement of coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic. COVID-19 related public interest reached the highest peak in South Asian countries a few days after each county reported 100th confirmed cases. There were significant positive correlations between COVID-19 related public interest and daily laboratory-confirmed cases in countries expect Nepal, Bhutan, and Sri Lanka. The highest public interest in South Asian Countries was on average 12 days before the local maximum of new confirmed cases. Similarly, web searches related to personal hygiene and COVID-19 preventive measures in south Asia correlated to the number of confirmed cases as well as national restriction measures. Conclusion Public interest indicated by RSV indices can help to monitor the progression of an outbreak such as the current COVID-19 pandemic particularly in countries with a lack of diagnostic and surveillance capacity, and thereby distribute appropriate health information to the general public.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hasan Symum","author_inst":"University of South Florida"},{"author_name":"Kh Mohammed Ali","author_inst":"Dhaka Medical College Hospital,  Dhaka,  Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Nick H.K.

Results: We assessed contamination of laboratory surfaces (n=6) and rate of SARS-nCov-2 positivity from their nasal and throat swab by RT-PCR among laboratory personnel (n=18) after 14 days of their use along with other routine safety devices like use of gloves, surgical masks, OT gowns etc. These HCWs were checked regularly for signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and none had any signs and symptoms during these 14days. The SARS-nCov-2 test report was negative for the staff members and no surface contamination was detected. We conclude that innovative and cost effective protective devices can be built in-house with locally available resources and are effective in preventing the spread of COVID 19 among the staff working in clinical biochemistry laboratories. Conclusions: Laboratory managers in resource scarce areas need to be innovative to face such sudden safety challenges like COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abhishek Dubey","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, Maulana Azad Medical College & Associated Hospitals New Delhi- 110002"},{"author_name":"Aastha Bansal","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, Maulana Azad Medical College & Associated Hospitals New Delhi- 110002"},{"author_name":"Subash Chandra Sonkar","author_inst":"Multidisciplinary Research Unit, Maulana Azad Medical College and Associated Hospital, New Delhi, India-110002"},{"author_name":"Binita Goswami","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, Maulana Azad Medical College & Associated Hospitals New Delhi- 110002"},{"author_name":"Naina Makwane","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, Maulana Azad Medical College & Associated Hospitals New Delhi- 110002"},{"author_name":"Vikas Manchanda","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Maulana Azad Medical College & Associated Hospitals New Delhi- 110002"},{"author_name":"Bidhan Chandra Koner","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, Maulana Azad Medical College & Associated Hospitals New Delhi- 110002"},{"author_name":"Christopher T.

Using forward sensitivity index the model parameters are carried out to determine and identify the key factors for the spread of disease dynamics. From country to country the sensitive parameters for the spread of the virus varies. It is found out that the reproduction number depends mostly on the infection rates, the threshold value of the force of infection for a population, the recovery rates, and the virus decay rate in the environment. It is also demonstrated that control of the effective transmission rate (recommended human behavioral change towards self-protective measures) is essential to stop the spreading of the virus.

Method: Retrospective observational study to evaluate effectiveness of M-TA is conducted. Results: A total of 33 M-TA samples were analyzed. In 66,6% of the cases, results led to a change in medical decision making. A 100% accuracy was achieved regarding COVID-19 diagnosis and a 56% bacterial growth-rate in cultives where VAP was suspected.

Implicit solvation methodology may be particularly useful in the early stages of such research, as it can offer valuable insights into the binding process, quickly. Here we evaluate the potential of the related molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MMGB\/SA) approach to estimate the binding free energy {Delta}Gbind between the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain and the human ACE2 receptor. The calculations are based on a recent flavor of the generalized Born model, GBNSR6. Two estimates of {Delta}Gbind are performed: one based on standard bondi radii, and the other based on a newly developed set of atomic radii (OPT1), optimized specifically for protein-ligand binding. We take the average of the resulting two {Delta}Gbind values as the consensus estimate. For the well-studied Ras-Raf protein-protein complex, which has similar binding free energy to that of the SARS-CoV-2\/ACE2 complex, the consensus {Delta}Gbind = -11.8 {+\/-} 1 kcal\/mol, vs. experimental -9.7 {+\/-} 0.2 kcal\/mol.\n\nThe consensus estimates for the SARS-CoV-2\/ACE2 complex is {Delta}Gbind = -9.4 {+\/-} 1.5 kcal\/mol, which is in near quantitative agreement with experiment (-10.6 kcal\/mol).

DARPin molecules are an emerging class of novel therapeutics based on naturally occurring repeat proteins ([~]15 kDa in size) and can be rapidly produced in bacteria in large quantities. Here, we report the identification of 380 DARPin molecules specifically targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein selected from a naive library of 1012 DARPin molecules. Using extensive biophysical and biochemical characterization, (pseudo)virus neutralization assays and cryo-EM analysis, 11 mono-DARPin molecules targeting either the receptor binding domain (RBD), the S1 N-terminal-domain (NTD) or the S2 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were chosen. Based on these 11 mono-DARPin molecules, 31 anti-SARS-CoV-2 multi-DARPin molecules were constructed which can broadly be grouped into 2 types; multi-paratopic RBD-neutralizing DARPin molecules and multi-mode DARPin molecules targeting simultaneously RBD, NTD and the S2 domain. Each of these multi-DARPin molecules acts by binding with 3 DARPin modules to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, leading to potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection down to 1 ng\/ml (12 pM) and potentially providing protection against viral escape mutations. Additionally, 2 DARPin modules binding serum albumin, conferring an expected half-life of about 3 weeks in humans, were included in the multi-DARPin molecules. The protective efficacy of one multi-DARPin molecule was studied in a Golden Syrian hamster SARS-CoV-2 infection model, resulting in a significant reduction in viral load and pathogenesis. In conclusion, the multi-DARPin molecules reported here display very high antiviral potency, high-production yield, and a long systemic half-life, and thereby have the potential for single-dose use for prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":51,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marcel Walser","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Sylvia Rothenberger","author_inst":"Spiez Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Daniel L.

In this study, we compared 207 of SARS-CoV-2 genomes reported from different parts of Bangladesh and their comparison with 467 globally reported sequences to understand the origin of viruses, possible patterns of mutations, availability of unique mutations, and their apparent impact on pathogenicity of the virus in victims of Bangladeshi population. Phylogenetic analyses indicates that in Bangladesh, SARS-CoV-2 viruses might arrived through infected travelers from European countries, and the GR clade was found as predominant in this region. We found 2602 mutations including 1602 missense mutations, 612 synonymous mutations, 36 insertions and deletions with 352 other mutations types. In line with the global trend, D614G mutation in spike glycoprotein was predominantly high (95.6%) in Bangladeshi isolates. Interestingly, we found the average number of mutations in ORF1ab, S, ORF3a, M and N of genomes, having nucleotide shift at G614 (n=459), were significantly higher (p[&le;]0.001) than those having mutation at D614 (n=215). Previously reported frequent mutations such as P4715L, D614G, R203K, G204R and I300F were also prevalent in Bangladeshi isolates. Additionally, 87 unique amino acid changes were revealed and were categorized as originating from different cities of Bangladesh. The analyses would increase our understanding of variations in virus genomes circulating in Bangladesh and elsewhere and help develop novel therapeutic targets against SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Md Mahbub Hasan","author_inst":"Department of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Chittagong, Chattogram-4331, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Rasel Das","author_inst":"Global Innovation Center, Kyushu University, Fukuoka 816-8580, Japan"},{"author_name":"Md.

We developed the Global COVID Assessment of Mortality (GCAM), a statistical model with continually improving precision that combines actual mortality counts with Bayesian inference, to predict COVID trends, currently until December 1, 2020. In Colombia, the GCAM analysis found the peak of COVID mortality around August 12 and an expected total of COVID deaths of 24,000-31,000, or 48%-92% over the total through August 21. In Peru, a first mortality peak occurred around May 24, and given the current trajectory, a second peak is predicted around September 6. Peru can expect 29,000-43,000 COVID deaths, representing an increase of 7%-55% over COVID deaths through August 21. GCAM projections are also used to estimate medical surge capacity needs. To gauge the reliability of COVID mortality forecasts, we compared all-cause mortality from January through June 2020 with average all-cause mortality in previous years in Colombia and Peru, and found that the excesses were consistent with GCAM forecast, most notably a doubling of overall mortality from May 25-June 7th of weeks in Peru. The GCAM results predict that as a percentage of all adult deaths in previous years, Colombia can expect about 13% excess from COVID deaths, whereas Peru can expect 34% excess. Comparisons of GCAM analyses of several other countries with Colombia and Peru demonstrate the extreme variability that characterizes COVID mortality around the world, emphasizing the need for country-specific analyses and ongoing monitoring as more mortality data become available.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patrick E Brown","author_inst":"Centre for Global Health Research, Unity Health Toronto and Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto; Department of Statistical Sciences, Unive"},{"author_name":"Zo\u00eb R Greenwald","author_inst":"Centre for Global Health Research, Unity Health Toronto and Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Luis Ernesto Salinas","author_inst":"World Bank, Human Development Network and Colombia Country Office"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Aguirre Martens","author_inst":"World Bank, Human Development Network and Colombia Country Office"},{"author_name":"Leslie Newcombe","author_inst":"Centre for Global Health Research, Unity Health Toronto and Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Peter S Rodriguez","author_inst":"Centre for Global Health Research, Unity Health Toronto and Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Hellen Gelband","author_inst":"Centre for Global Health Research, Unity Health Toronto and Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Veillard","author_inst":"Centre for Global Health Research, Unity Health Toronto and Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto; World Bank, Human Development Network and"},{"author_name":"Prabhat Jha","author_inst":"Centre for Global Health Research, Unity Health Toronto and Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Adnan Mannan","author_inst":"Department of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Chittagong, Chattogram-4331, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Andreas Cornelius","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Patricia Schildknecht","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Mirela Matzner","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Martin Haenggi","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Marco Franchini","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Yvonne Kaufmann","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Iris Schlegel","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Chloe Iss","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Thamar Loser","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Susanne Mangold","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Christel Herzog","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Dieter Schiegg","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Christian Reichen","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Filip Radom","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Andreas Bosshart","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Andreas Lehmann","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Micha A.

Several countries have used large scale SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR testing as one of the important strategies for combating the pandemic. In order to process the massive needs for coronavirus testing, the usual throughput of routine clinical laboratories has reached and often surpassed its limits and new approaches to cope with this challenge must be developed. This study has aimed to evaluate the use pool of samples as a strategy to optimize the diagnostic of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR in a general population. A total of 220 naso\/orofaryngeal swab samples were collected and tested using two different protocols of sample pooling. In the first protocol (Protocol A); 10 clinical samples were pooled before RNA extraction. The second protocol (Protocol B) consisted of pooling the already extracted RNAs from 10 individual samples. Results from Protocol A were identical (100% agreement) with the individual results. However, for results from Protocol B, reduced agreement (91%) was observed in relation to results obtained by individual testing. Inconsistencies observed were related to RT-qPCR results with higher Cycle Thresholds (Ct > 32.73). Furthermore, in pools containing more than one positive individual, the Ct of the pool was equivalent to the lowest Ct among the individual results. These results provide additional evidence in favor of the clinical use of pooled samples for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis by RT-qPCR and suggest that pooling of samples before RNA extraction is preferrable in terms of diagnostic yield.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fabiana Volpato","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"Daiana Lima-Morales","author_inst":"Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre"},{"author_name":"Priscila Lamb Wink","author_inst":"Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre"},{"author_name":"Julia Willig","author_inst":"Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre"},{"author_name":"Fernanda de-Paris","author_inst":"Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre"},{"author_name":"Patricia Ashton-Prolla","author_inst":"Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre"},{"author_name":"Afonso Luis Barth","author_inst":"Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Veillard","author_inst":"Centre for Global Health Research, Unity Health Toronto and Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto; World Bank, Human Development Network and"},{"author_name":"Prabhat Jha","author_inst":"Centre for Global Health Research, Unity Health Toronto and Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Adnan Mannan","author_inst":"Department of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Chittagong, Chattogram-4331, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Andreas Cornelius","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Patricia Schildknecht","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Mirela Matzner","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Martin Haenggi","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Marco Franchini","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Yvonne Kaufmann","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Iris Schlegel","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Chloe Iss","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Thamar Loser","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Susanne Mangold","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Christel Herzog","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Dieter Schiegg","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Christian Reichen","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Filip Radom","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Andreas Bosshart","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Andreas Lehmann","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Micha A.

For this reason, efforts to determine changes in laboratory parameters of COVID-19 patients as biomarkers are urgent. Lipids are essential components of the human body, and their modulation has been observed implicated in some viral infections. Methods: To evaluate the clinical diagnosis utility of the lipid profile changes in Mexican COVID-19 patients, the lipid profile of one hundred two COVID-19 positive patients from three hospitals in Culiacan, Sinaloa in northwest Mexico, was analyzed. ROC curves and binary logistic regression analysis were used as a predictive model to determine their clinical diagnostic utility. Results: Significant changes in the serum lipid profile of patients with COVID-19, such as low levels of cholesterol, LDL, and HDL, while high triglycerides and VLDL were observed. The same abnormalities in the lipid profile among non-critical and critical COVID-19 patients were detected. The predictive model analysis suggests that cholesterol and LDL have AUC values of 0.710 and 0.769, respectively, for COVID-19 (p= 0.0002 and p= <0.0001), and LDL low levels might be a risk factor for critical COVID-19 (OR= 2.07, 95% IC: 1.18 to 3.63; p= 0.01). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that low cholesterol and LDL levels could be considered an acceptable predictor for COVID-19, and low levels of LDL might be a risk factor for critical COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Juan Fidel Osuna-Ramos","author_inst":"Cinvestav"},{"author_name":"Horacio Rendon Aguilar","author_inst":"Hospital General de Culiacan"},{"author_name":"Luis Adrian De Jesus-Gonzalez;","author_inst":"Cinvestav"},{"author_name":"Jose Manuel Reyes Ruiz","author_inst":"Cinvestav"},{"author_name":"Arely Montserrat Espinoza Ortega","author_inst":"Hospital General de Culiacan, Sinaloa"},{"author_name":"Luis Antonio Ochoa Ramirez","author_inst":"Hospital General de Culiacan, Sinaloa"},{"author_name":"Alejandra Romero Utrilla","author_inst":"IMSS"},{"author_name":"Efren Rios Burgueno","author_inst":"CIDOCS-UAS"},{"author_name":"Alejandro Soto-Almaral","author_inst":"Hospital General de Culiacan"},{"author_name":"Juan Jose Rios-Tostado","author_inst":"Hospital General de Culiacan"},{"author_name":"Jose Geovanni Romero-Quintana","author_inst":"UAS"},{"author_name":"Hector Ponce Ramos","author_inst":"Hospital General de Culiacan"},{"author_name":"Carlos Noe Farfan Morales","author_inst":"Cinvestav"},{"author_name":"Rosa Maria del Angel","author_inst":"Cinvestav"},{"author_name":"Hector Barajas Martinez","author_inst":"LIMR"},{"author_name":"Jose Rodriguez Millan","author_inst":"Hospital General de Culiacan"},{"author_name":"Jesus Salvador Velarde Felix","author_inst":"Escuela de Biologia, UAS"},{"author_name":"Chloe Iss","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Thamar Loser","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Susanne Mangold","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Christel Herzog","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Dieter Schiegg","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Christian Reichen","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Filip Radom","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Andreas Bosshart","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Andreas Lehmann","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Micha A.

Further species were shown to be susceptible under experimental conditions. The extent of natural infections of animals, however, is still largely unknown. Serological methods will be useful tools for tracing SARS-CoV-2 infections in animals once test systems are validated for use in different species. Here, we developed an indirect multi-species ELISA based on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. The newly established ELISA was validated using 59 sera of infected or vaccinated animals including ferrets, raccoon dogs, hamsters, rabbits, chickens, cattle and a cat, and a total of 220 antibody-negative sera of the same animal species. Overall, a diagnostic specificity of 100.0% and sensitivity of 98.31% was achieved, and the functionality with every species included in this study could be demonstrated. Hence, a versatile and reliable ELISA protocol was established that enables high-throughput antibody detection in a broad range of animal species, which may be used for outbreak investigations, to assess the seroprevalence in susceptible species or to screen for reservoir or intermediate hosts.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kerstin Wernike","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Andrea Aebischer","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Anna Michelitsch","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Donata Hoffmann","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Conrad Freuling","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Anne Balkema-Buschmann","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Annika Graaf","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Thomas Mueller","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Nikolaus Osterrieder","author_inst":"Freie Universitaet Berlin"},{"author_name":"Melanie Rissmann","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Dennis Rubbenstroth","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Jacob Schoen","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Claudia Schulz","author_inst":"University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover"},{"author_name":"Jakob Trimpert","author_inst":"Freie Universitaet Berlin"},{"author_name":"Lorenz Ulrich","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Asisa Volz","author_inst":"University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover"},{"author_name":"Thomas Mettenleiter","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Martin Beer","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Thamar Loser","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Susanne Mangold","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Christel Herzog","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Dieter Schiegg","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Christian Reichen","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Filip Radom","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Andreas Bosshart","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Andreas Lehmann","author_inst":"Molecular Partners AG"},{"author_name":"Micha A.

This protein is involved in modulating the host adaptive immunity through downregulating MHC (Major Histocompatibility Complex) molecules and innate immune responses by surpassing the interferon mediated antiviral response of the host. To understand the immune perspective of the host with respect to the ORF8 protein, a comprehensive study of the ORF8 protein as well as mutations possessed by it, is performed. Chemical and structural properties of ORF8 proteins from different hosts, that is human, bat and pangolin, suggests that the ORF8 of SARS-CoV-2 and Bat RaTG13-CoV are very much closer related than that of Pangolin-CoV. Eighty-seven mutations across unique variants of ORF8 (SARS-CoV-2) are grouped into four classes based on their predicted effects. Based on geolocations and timescale of collection, a possible flow of mutations was built. Furthermore, conclusive flows of amalgamation of mutations were endorsed upon sequence similarity and amino acid conservation phylogenies. Therefore, this study seeks to highlight the uniqueness of rapid evolving SARS-CoV-2 through the ORF8.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sk.
