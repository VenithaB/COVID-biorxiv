We have analyzed the available data for China and Italy. The evolution in time of the number of cumulative diagnosed positive cases of Covid-19 in China very well approximates a distribution of the type of the Error Function, that is, the integral of a normal, Gaussian distribution. We have then used such a function to study the potential evolution in time of the number of positive cases in Italy by performing a number of fits of the official data so far available. We then found a statistical prediction for the day in which the peak of the number of daily positive cases in Italy occurs, corresponding to the flex of the fit, i.e., to the change in sign of its second derivative (that is the change from acceleration to deceleration) as well as of the day in which a substantial attenuation of such number of daily cases is reached. We have then performed 150 Monte Carlo simulations in the attempt to have a more robust prediction of the day of the above-mentioned peak and of the day of the substantial decrease of the number of daily positive cases. Although, official data have been used, these predictions are obtained with a heuristic approach, since those predictions are based on statistical approach and do not take into account either a number of relevant issues (such as medical, social distancing, virologic, epidemiological, etc.) or models of contamination diffusion.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ignazio Ciufolini","author_inst":"University of Salento"},{"author_name":"Antonio Paolozzi","author_inst":"Sapienza University of Rome"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.27.20044891","rel_title":"Evaluating the effectiveness of social distancing interventions against COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.27.20044891","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 140,000 people as of March 14, 2020.

We explore four social distancing strategies by reducing the contacts of adults over 60 years old, adults over 60 years old and children, all adults (25, 75 or 95% compliance), and everyone in the population. Our results suggest that social distancing interventions can avert cases by 20% and hospitalizations and deaths by 90% even with modest compliance within adults as long as the intervention is kept in place, but the epidemic is set to rebound once the intervention is lifted. Our models suggest that social distancing interventions will buy crucial time but need to occur in conjunction with testing and contact tracing of all suspected cases to mitigate transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Laura Matrajt","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Tiffany Leung","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.26.20044826","rel_title":"Children are unlikely to have been the primary source of household SARS-CoV-2 infections","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.26.20044826","rel_abs":"BACKGROUND: Since its identification on the 7th of January 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has spread to more than 180 countries worldwide, causing >11,000 deaths. At present, viral disease and transmission amongst children is incompletely understood. Specifically, there is concern that children could be an important source of SARS-CoV-2 in household transmission clusters. METHODS: We performed an observational study analysing literature published between December 2019 and March 2020 of the clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 in children and descriptions of household transmission clusters of SARS-CoV-2. In these studies the index case of each cluster defined as the individual in the household cluster who first developed symptoms. FINDINGS: Drawing on studies from China, Singapore, South Korea, Japan, and Iran a broad range of clinical symptoms were observed in children. These ranged from asymptomatic to severe disease. Of the 31 household transmission clusters that were identified, 9.7% (3\/31) were identified as having a paediatric index case. This is in contrast other zoonotic infections (namely H5N1 influenza virus) where 54% (30\/56) of transmission clusters identified children as the index case. INTERPRETATION: Whilst SARS-CoV-2 can cause mild disease in children, the data available to date suggests that children have not played a substantive role in the intra-household transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yanshan Zhu","author_inst":"The University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Conor J Bloxham","author_inst":"The University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Katina D Hulme","author_inst":"The University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Jane E Sinclair","author_inst":"The University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Zhen Wei Marcus Tong","author_inst":"The University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Lauren E Steele","author_inst":"The University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Ellesandra C Noye","author_inst":"The University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Jiahai Lu","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Keng Yih Chew","author_inst":"The University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Janessa Pickering","author_inst":"Telethon Kids Institute"},{"author_name":"Charles Gilks","author_inst":"School of Public Health, The University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Asha C Bowen","author_inst":"Telethon Kids Institute"},{"author_name":"Kirsty R Short","author_inst":"School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences, The University of Queensland, Brisbane Australia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.28.20046045","rel_title":"Deep Learning-Based Recognizing COVID-19 and other Common Infectious Diseases of the Lung by Chest CT Scan Images","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.28.20046045","rel_abs":"Purpose: COVID-19 has become global threaten. CT acts as an important method of diagnosis. However, human-based interpretation of CT imaging is time consuming. More than that, substantial inter-observer-variation cannot be ignored. We aim at developing a diagnostic tool for artificial intelligence (AI)-based classification of CT images for recognizing COVID-19 and other common infectious diseases of the lung. Experimental Design: In this study, images were retrospectively collected and prospectively analyzed using machine learning. CT scan images of the lung that show or do not show COVID-19 were used to train and validate a classification framework based on convolutional neural network. Five conditions including COVID-19 pneumonia, non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, and normal lung were evaluated. Training and validation set of images were collected from Wuhan Jin Yin-Tan Hospital whereas test set of images were collected from Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University and the fifth Hospital of Wuhan. Results: Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the AI framework were reported. For test dataset, accuracies for recognizing normal lung, COVID-19 pneumonia, non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, and pulmonary tuberculosis were 99.4%, 98.8%, 98.5%, 98.3%, and 98.6%, respectively. For the test dataset, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of recognizing COVID-19 were 98.8%, 98.2%, 98.9%, 94.5%, and 99.7%, respectively. Conclusions: The performance of the proposed AI framework has excellent performance of recognizing COVID-19 and other common infectious diseases of the lung, which also has balanced sensitivity and specificity.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Min Fu","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Shuang-Lian Yi","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Yuanfeng Zeng","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Feng Ye","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Yuxuan Li","author_inst":"Hubei University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Xuan Dong","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Yan-Dan Ren","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Linkai Luo","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jin-Shui Pan","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Qi Zhang","author_inst":"Jin Yin-Tan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Charles Gilks","author_inst":"School of Public Health, The University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Asha C Bowen","author_inst":"Telethon Kids Institute"},{"author_name":"Kirsty R Short","author_inst":"School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences, The University of Queensland, Brisbane Australia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.26.20044768","rel_title":"Persistent SARS-CoV-2 presence is companied with defects in adaptive immune system in non-severe COVID-19 patients","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.26.20044768","rel_abs":"Background: COVID-19 has been widely spreading. We aim to examine adaptive immune cells in non-severe patients with persistent SARS-CoV-2 shedding. Methods 37 non-severe patients with persistent SARS-CoV-2 presence transferred to Zhongnan hospital of Wuhan University were retrospectively recruited to PP (persistently positive) group, which was further allocated to PPP group (n=19) and PPN group (n=18), according to their testing results after 7 days (N=negative). Epidemiological, demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected and analyzed. Data from age- and sex-matched non-severe patients at disease onset (PA [positive on admission] patients, n=37), and lymphocyte subpopulation measurements from matched 54 healthy subjects were extracted for comparison. Results Compared with PA patients, PP patients had much improved laboratory findings, including WBCs, neutrophils, lymphocytes, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, albumin, AST, CRP, SAA, and IL-6. The absolute numbers of CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and NK cells were significantly higher in PP group than that in PA group, and were comparable to that in healthy controls. PPP subgroup had markedly reduced B cells and T cells compared to PPN group and healthy subjects. Finally, paired results of these lymphocyte subpopulations from 10 PPN patients demonstrated that the number of T cells and B cells significantly increased when the SARS-CoV-2 tests turned negative. Conclusion Persistent SARS-CoV-2 presence in non-severe COVID-19 patients is associated with reduced numbers of adaptive immune cells. Monitoring lymphocyte subpopulations could be clinically meaningful in identifying fully recovered COVID-19 patients.

In the present analysis we coupled climate data with COVID-19 spread rates worldwide, and in a single country (USA). Methods: Data of confirmed COVID-19 cases was derived from the COVID-19 Global Cases by the CSSE at Johns Hopkins University up to March 19, 2020. We assessed disease spread by two measures: replication rate (RR), the slope of the logarithmic curve of confirmed cases, and the rate of spread (RoS), the slope of the linear regression of the logarithmic curve. Results: Based on predefined criteria, the mean COVID-19 RR was significantly lower in warm climate countries (0.12{+\/-} 0.02) compared with cold countries (0.24{+\/-} 0.01), (P<0.0001). Similarly, RoS was significantly lower in warm climate countries 0.12{+\/-} 0.02 vs. 0.25{+\/-} 0.01 than in cold climate countries (P<0.001). In all countries (independent of climate classification) both RR and RoS displayed a moderate negative correlation with temperature R= -0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.87 to -0.36; P<0.001 and R= -0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.87 to -0.36; P<0.001, respectively. We identified a similar moderate negative correlation with the dew point temperature. Additional climate variables did not display a significant correlation with neither RR nor RoS. Finally, in an ancillary analysis, COVID-19 intra-country model using an inter-state analysis of the USA did not identify yet correlation between climate parameters and RR or RoS as of March, 19, 2020. Conclusions: Our analysis suggests a plausible negative correlation between warmer climate and COVID-19 spread rate as defined by RR and RoS worldwide. This initial correlation should be interpreted cautiously and be further validated over time, the pandemic is at different stages in various countries as well as in regions within these countries. As such, some associations may be more affected by local transmission patterns rather than by climate. Importantly, we provide an online surveillance dashboard (https:\/\/covid19.net.technion.ac.il\/) to further assess the association between climate parameters and outbreak dynamics worldwide as time goes by","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gil Caspi","author_inst":"Faculty of Electrical Engineering the Technion, Israel"},{"author_name":"Uri Shalit","author_inst":"The Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Management, Israel"},{"author_name":"Soren Lund Kristensen","author_inst":"The Department of Cardiology, Rigshospitalet University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Doron Aronson","author_inst":"The department of Cardiology, Rambam Health Care Campus4  and the B.

The number of cases dramatically increased beginning in early March 2020. Aim: We assessed the cumulative change in the incidence and case-fatality rates of COVID-19 at the global, regional, and national levels from January to March 16, 2020, in 154 affected countries and territories globally. Methods: We collected data of COVID-19 cases using the GitHub repository, which provided real-time surveillance information developed by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE), Johns Hopkins University (USA). Information such as confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries reported across all affected countries was collected from January 22 to March 16, 2020. We estimated the change in the incidence rate, case-fatality rate, and recovery rate from January 22 to February 29 and from March 1 to March 16, 2020. Results: From January 22 to March 16, 2020, globally, the number of incident COVID-19 cases increased by 276.2%, and Europe recorded 65,281 new cases from March 1 to 16, 2020. Overall, the case-fatality rate was 3.92%, with a high COVID-19 fatality rate in Italy (7.7%), Iran (5.7%), China (4.2%) and the United Kingdom (3.6%). The estimated percentage change in COVID-19 cases from March 1 to 16, 2020, was highest in Belgium (105.8\/100,000 population), followed by Qatar (439\/100,000 population) and Portugal (331\/100,000 population).

However, inaccurate test results (for example, high false negative rate and some false positive rate) were reported in both China and US CDC using the RT-PCR method. Inaccurate results are caused by inadequate detection sensitivity of RT-PCR, low viral load in some patients, difficulty to collect samples from COVID-19 patients, insufficient sample loading during RT-PCR tests, and RNA degradation during sample handling process. False negative detection could subject patients to multiple tests before diagnosis can be made, which burdens health care system. Delayed diagnosis could cause infected patients to miss the best treatment time window. False negative detection could also lead to prematurely releasing infected patients who still carry residual SARS-CoV-2 virus. In this case, these patients could infect many others. A high sensitivity RNA detection method to resolve the existing issues of RT-PCR is in need for more accurate COVID-19 diagnosis. Methods: Digital PCR (dPCR) instrument DropX-2000 and assay kits were used to detect SARS-CoV-2 from 108 clinical specimens from 36 patients including pharyngeal swab, stool and blood from different days during hospitalization. Double-blinded experiment data of 108 clinical specimens by dPCR methods were compared with results from officially approved RT-PCR assay. A total of 109 samples including 108 clinical specimens and 1 negative control sample were tested in this study. All of 109 samples, 26 were from 21patients reported as positive by officially approved clinical RT-PCR detection in local CDC and then hospitalized in Nantong Third Hospital. Among the 109 samples, dPCR detected 30 positive samples on ORFA1ab gene, 47 samples with N gene positive, and 30 samples with double positive on ORFA1ab and N genes. Results: The lower limit of detection of the optimize dPCR is at least 10-fold lower than that of RT-PCR. The overall accuracy of dPCR for clinical detection is 96.3%. 4 out 4 of (100 %) negative pharyngeal swab samples checked by RT-PCR were positive judged by dPCR based on the follow-up investigation. 2 of 2 samples in the RT-PCR grey area (Ct value > 37) were confirmed by dPCR with positive results. 1 patient being tested positive by RT-PCR was confirmed to be negative by dPCR. The dPCR results show clear viral loading decrease in 12 patients as treatment proceed, which can be a useful tool for monitoring COVID-19 treatment. Conclusions: Digital PCR shows improved lower limit of detection, sensitivity and accuracy, enabling COVID-19 detection with less false negative and false positive results comparing with RT-PCR, especially for the tests with low viral load specimens. We showed evidences that dPCR is powerful in detecting asymptomatic patients and suspected patients. Digital PCR is capable of checking the negative results caused by insufficient sample loading by quantifying internal reference gene from human RNA in the PCR reactions. Multi-channel fluorescence dPCR system (FAM\/HEX\/CY5\/ROX) is able to detect more target genes in a single multiplex assay, providing quantitative count of viral load in specimens, which is a powerful tool for monitoring COVID-19 treatment.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Renfei Lu","author_inst":"Nantong Third Hospital Affiliated to Nantong University, Clinical laboratory"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"Nantong Third Hospital Affiliated to Nantong University, Clinical laboratory"},{"author_name":"Min Li","author_inst":"Nantong Third Hospital Affiliated to Nantong University, Clinical laboratory"},{"author_name":"Yaqi Wang","author_inst":"RainSure Scientific Co, Ltd."},{"author_name":"Jia Dong","author_inst":"RainSure Scientific Co, Ltd."},{"author_name":"Weihua Cai","author_inst":"Nantong Third Hospital Affiliated to Nantong University, Infection Division"},{"author_name":"Qincai Dong","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Zhang Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Zhongyi Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yong Hu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yangbo Fu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yanwen Jin","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Kaitong Li","author_inst":"Beijing Key Laboratory of Bio-products Safety Assessment, Joinn Laboratories (China) Co.

The plasma and urine samples were all negative, except for urine samples from two severe cases at the latest available detection point. Conversely, virus was shed in respiratory swabs and feces samples during the diseased period. Ten of 12 (83.3%) cases were positive for feces samples, while 14 of 21 (66.7%) were positive for respiratory samples. In addition, the median duration of virus shedding was 10.0 days (IQR 8.0 to 17.0) in the upper respiratory swabs, but was 22.0 days (IQR 15.5 to 23.5) for the feces. Notably, at 26 days after discharge, case 3 (a 45-year-old) was detected positive again in the feces samples, but appears to be healthy and negative for respiratory swabs.

However, it is urgent to need the rapid and accurate detection for SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis. We aimed to evaluate the antibodies-based and nucleic acid-based tests (NAT) for SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Method: We retrospectively and observationally studied 133 patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 and admitted in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, China, from Feb 17 to Mar 1, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, clinical examination, laboratory tests, and clinical outcomes were collected. Data were compared between IgM-IgG antibody test and real-time RT-PCR detection for COVID-19 patients. Results: Of 133 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, there were 44 moderate cases, 52 severe cases, and 37 critical cases with no significant difference of gender and age among three subgroups. Overall, the positive ratio in IgM antibody test was higher than in RT-PCR detection. In RT-PCR detection, the positive ratio was 65.91%, 71.15%, and 67.57% in moderate, severe, and critical cases, respectively. Whereas, the positive ratio of IgM\/IgG antibody detection in patients was 79.55%\/93.18%, 82.69%\/100%, and 72.97%\/97.30% in moderate, severe, and critical cases, respectively. Moreover, the concentrations of antibodies were also measured in three subgroups. Conclusion: The IgM-IgG antibodies-based test exhibited a comparative superiority to the NAT for COVID-19 diagnosis, which provides an effective complement to the false negative results from NAT for SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rui Liu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xinghui Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Gongli Hospital, the Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Huan Han","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Adnan Shereen","author_inst":"Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhili Niu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Dong Li","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Fang Liu","author_inst":"Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Kailang Wu","author_inst":"Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhen Luo","author_inst":"Jinan University"},{"author_name":"Chengliang Zhu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yangbo Fu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yanwen Jin","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Kaitong Li","author_inst":"Beijing Key Laboratory of Bio-products Safety Assessment, Joinn Laboratories (China) Co.

We formulate both a survival probability model and an associated infection duration-dependent SIR model to define individual- and population-based estimates of dynamic mortality ratios. The key parameters that affect the dynamics of the different mortality estimates are the incubation period and the length of time individuals were infected before confirmation of infection. We stress that none of these ratios are accurately represented by the often misinterpreted case fatality ratio (CFR), the number of deaths to date divided by the total number of infected cases to date. Using available data on the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks and simple assumptions, we estimate and compare the different dynamic mortality ratios and highlight their differences. Informed by our modeling, we propose a more systematic method to determine mortality ratios during epidemic outbreaks and discuss sensitivity to confounding effects and errors in the data.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lucas B\u00f6ttcher","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Mingtao Xia","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Tom Chou","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Adnan Shereen","author_inst":"Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhili Niu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Dong Li","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Fang Liu","author_inst":"Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Kailang Wu","author_inst":"Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhen Luo","author_inst":"Jinan University"},{"author_name":"Chengliang Zhu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yangbo Fu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yanwen Jin","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Kaitong Li","author_inst":"Beijing Key Laboratory of Bio-products Safety Assessment, Joinn Laboratories (China) Co.

However, evidence regarding its effects in patients is limited. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Main methods: From February 4 to February 28, 2020, 62 patients suffering from COVID-19 were diagnosed and admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. All participants were randomized in a parallel-group trial, 31 patients were assigned to receive an additional 5-day HCQ (400 mg\/d) treatment, Time to clinical recovery (TTCR), clinical characteristics, and radiological results were assessed at baseline and 5 days after treatment to evaluate the effect of HCQ. Key findings: For the 62 COVID-19 patients, 46.8% (29 of 62) were male and 53.2% (33 of 62) were female, the mean age was 44.7 (15.3) years. No difference in the age and sex distribution between the control group and the HCQ group. But for TTCR, the body temperature recovery time and the cough remission time were significantly shortened in the HCQ treatment group. Besides, a larger proportion of patients with improved pneumonia in the HCQ treatment group (80.6%, 25 of 31) compared with the control group (54.8%, 17 of 31). Notably, all 4 patients progressed to severe illness that occurred in the control group. However, there were 2 patients with mild adverse reactions in the HCQ treatment group. Significance: Among patients with COVID-19, the use of HCQ could significantly shorten TTCR and promote the absorption of pneumonia.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhaowei Chen","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Jijia Hu","author_inst":"Renmin hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zongwei Zhang","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Shan Jiang","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Shoumeng Han","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University,"},{"author_name":"Dandan Yan","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Ruhong Zhuang","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Ben Hu","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology"},{"author_name":"Zhan Zhang","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Chengliang Zhu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yangbo Fu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yanwen Jin","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Kaitong Li","author_inst":"Beijing Key Laboratory of Bio-products Safety Assessment, Joinn Laboratories (China) Co.

This study aimed to explore the prevalence and factors linked to anxiety and depression in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods: A total of 144 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in this study. We assessed depression and anxiety symptoms using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and social support using the Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS) among patients at admission. Multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression. Results: Of the 144 participants, 34.72% and 28.47% patients with COVID-19 had symptoms of anxiety or depression, respectively. The bivariate correlations showed that less social support was correlated with more anxious (r=-0.196, p<0.05) and depressive (r=-0.360p<0.05) symptoms among patients with COVID-19. The multiple linear regression analysis showed that gender ({beta}=1.446, p=0.034), age ({beta}=0.074, p=0.003), oxygen saturation ({beta} =-2.140, p=0.049), and social support ({beta} =-1.545, p=0.017) were associated with anxiety for COVID-19 patients.

We implement one of the first nationally representative surveys about this unprecedented public health crisis and use it to evaluate the Italian government's public health efforts and citizen responses. Findings: (1) Public health messaging is being heard. At this point, the Italian people understand how to keep themselves and others safe from the SARS-Cov-2 virus. This is true for all population groups we studied, with the partial exception of slightly lower compliance among young adults. Remarkably, even those who do not trust the government, and those who think the government has been untruthful about the crisis mostly believe the public health message and claim to be acting in accordance. (2) The quarantine is beginning to have serious negative effects on the population's mental health. Policy Recommendations: Public health messaging is being heard and understood. The focus now should move from explaining that citizens should stay at home to what they can do at home. We need interventions that make staying at home and following public health protocols more desirable, or possibly even fun. These interventions could include virtual social interactions, such as online social reading activities, classes, exercise routines, among others - all designed to reduce the boredom of being socially isolated for long periods of time and to increase the attractiveness of following public health recommendations. Interventions like these will grow in importance as the crisis wears on around the world, and staying inside wears on people.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Soubhik Barari","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Stefano Caria","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Antonio Davola","author_inst":"Luiss Guido Carli University"},{"author_name":"Paolo Falco","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Thiemo Fetzer","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Stefano Fiorin","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Lukas Hensel","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Andriy Ivchenko","author_inst":"Expilab Research"},{"author_name":"Jon Jachimowicz","author_inst":"Harvard Business School"},{"author_name":"Gary King","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Gordon Kraft-Todd","author_inst":"Boston College"},{"author_name":"Alice Ledda","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Mary MacLennan","author_inst":"London School of Economics"},{"author_name":"Lucian Mutoi","author_inst":"University of Stirling"},{"author_name":"Claudio Pagani","author_inst":"Data Rebel Consulting"},{"author_name":"Elena Reutskaja","author_inst":"IESE Business School"},{"author_name":"Federico Raimondi Slepoi","author_inst":"City of Rome"},{"author_name":"Lingfang Zhao","author_inst":"The 940th Hospital"},{"author_name":"Junli Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Huailong Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yue Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Weihong Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Jing Peng","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyu Chen","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, General Hospital of Northern Theater Command"},{"author_name":"Ping Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yaoning Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yonghong Xie","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Disease, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Air Force Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jibo Song","author_inst":"The 960th Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lu Zhang","author_inst":"The 940th Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qingjun Ma","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Xiuwu Bian","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Xuan Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Qing Mao","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Cheng Cao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.30.20047217","rel_title":"Physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses.

DESIGN: Update of a Cochrane review that included a meta-analysis of observational studies during the SARS outbreak of 2003. DATA SOURCES: Eligible trials from the previous review; search of Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, Embase and CINAHL from October 2010 up to 1 April 2020; and forward and backward citation analysis. DATA SELECTION: Randomised and cluster-randomised trials of people of any age, testing the use of eye protection, face masks, or person distancing against standard practice, or a similar physical barrier. Outcomes included any acute respiratory illness and its related consequences. DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Six authors independently assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane tool and extracted data. We used a generalised inverse variance method for pooling using a random-effects model and reported results with risk ratios and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI). RESULTS: We included 15 randomised trials investigating the effect of masks (14 trials) in healthcare workers and the general population and of quarantine (1 trial). We found no trials testing eye protection. Compared to no masks there was no reduction of influenza-like illness (ILI) cases (Risk Ratio 0.93, 95%CI 0.83 to 1.05) or influenza (Risk Ratio 0.84, 95%CI 0.61-1.17) for masks in the general population, nor in healthcare workers (Risk Ratio 0.37, 95%CI 0.05 to 2.50). There was no difference between surgical masks and N95 respirators: for ILI (Risk Ratio 0.83, 95%CI 0.63 to 1.08), for influenza (Risk Ratio 1.02, 95%CI 0.73 to 1.43). Harms were poorly reported and limited to discomfort with lower compliance. The only trial testing quarantining workers with household ILI contacts found a reduction in ILI cases, but increased risk of quarantined workers contracting influenza. All trials were conducted during seasonal ILI activity. CONCLUSIONS: Most included trials had poor design, reporting and sparse events. There was insufficient evidence to provide a recommendation on the use of facial barriers without other measures. We found insufficient evidence for a difference between surgical masks and N95 respirators and limited evidence to support effectiveness of quarantine. Based on observational evidence from the previous SARS epidemic included in the previous version of our Cochrane review we recommend the use of masks combined with other measures.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tom Jefferson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Mark Jones","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Lubna A Al Ansari","author_inst":"Kind Saud University, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Ghada Bawazeer","author_inst":"King Saud, University, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Elaine Beller","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Justin Clark","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"John Conly","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Microbiology, Immunology & Infectious Diseases, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary and Alberta Health Services , Calgary,"},{"author_name":"Chris Del Mar","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Dooley","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Eliana Ferroni","author_inst":"Regione Veneto, Italy"},{"author_name":"Paul Glasziou","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Tammy Hoffman","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Sarah Thorning","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Mieke Van Driel","author_inst":"Primary Care Clinical Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Queensland, Australia"},{"author_name":"Claudio Pagani","author_inst":"Data Rebel Consulting"},{"author_name":"Elena Reutskaja","author_inst":"IESE Business School"},{"author_name":"Federico Raimondi Slepoi","author_inst":"City of Rome"},{"author_name":"Lingfang Zhao","author_inst":"The 940th Hospital"},{"author_name":"Junli Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Huailong Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yue Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Weihong Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Jing Peng","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyu Chen","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, General Hospital of Northern Theater Command"},{"author_name":"Ping Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yaoning Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yonghong Xie","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Disease, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Air Force Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jibo Song","author_inst":"The 960th Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lu Zhang","author_inst":"The 940th Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qingjun Ma","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Xiuwu Bian","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Xuan Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Qing Mao","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Cheng Cao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.28.20045955","rel_title":"Medical treatment of 55 patients with COVID-19 from seven cities in northeast China who fully recovered: a single-center, retrospective, observational study","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.28.20045955","rel_abs":"Background: COVID-19 is an emerging disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus; no specific medication has been identified to date. We aimed to investigate the administered medications and intervention times for patients who completely recovered from COVID-19. Methods: This single-center, retrospective, and observational study included 55 patients with COVID-19 who were transferred to Shenyang Sixth People's Hospital between January 20 and March 15, 2020. Demographic information, symptoms, laboratory indicators, treatment processes, and clinical outcomes were collected. Administered drugs and intervention times were compared in 47 and eight patients with mild and severe symptoms, respectively. Findings: All 55 patients recovered. Fifty-three patients (96.36%) received antiviral therapy, including 45 in the mild group (median treatment: 14 days; 17 received umifenovir) and all eight severe-group patients (median treatment: 17.5 days; four received lopinavir\/ritonavir). Twenty-nine patients (52.72%) were administered antibiotics, including 21 in the mild group (median treatment: 13.5 days; 15 received moxifloxacin) and all eight in the severe group (median treatment: 9 days; two received linezolid). Moreover, seven patients (12.72%) were treated with glucocorticoids and nine (16.36%) with immunomodulators. Interpretation: Given the 100% recovery rate, early administration of antiviral drugs can be considered. Umifenovir may benefit patients with mild symptoms, while lopinavir\/ritonavir may benefit those with severe symptoms. Prophylactic administration of common antibiotics may reduce the risk of co-infection. The use of glucocorticoids is usually not necessary.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lichao Fan","author_inst":"Shenyang Chest Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"Shenyang Chest Hospital,"},{"author_name":"Na Li","author_inst":"Shenyang Chest Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huan Liu","author_inst":"Shenyang Chest Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ye Gu","author_inst":"Shenyang Sixth People's Hospita"},{"author_name":"Yongyu Liu","author_inst":"Shenyang Chest Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"Shenyang Chest Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chris Del Mar","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Dooley","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Eliana Ferroni","author_inst":"Regione Veneto, Italy"},{"author_name":"Paul Glasziou","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Tammy Hoffman","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Sarah Thorning","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Mieke Van Driel","author_inst":"Primary Care Clinical Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Queensland, Australia"},{"author_name":"Claudio Pagani","author_inst":"Data Rebel Consulting"},{"author_name":"Elena Reutskaja","author_inst":"IESE Business School"},{"author_name":"Federico Raimondi Slepoi","author_inst":"City of Rome"},{"author_name":"Lingfang Zhao","author_inst":"The 940th Hospital"},{"author_name":"Junli Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Huailong Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yue Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Weihong Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Jing Peng","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyu Chen","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, General Hospital of Northern Theater Command"},{"author_name":"Ping Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yaoning Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yonghong Xie","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Disease, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Air Force Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jibo Song","author_inst":"The 960th Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lu Zhang","author_inst":"The 940th Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qingjun Ma","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Xiuwu Bian","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Xuan Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Qing Mao","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Cheng Cao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.29.20045880","rel_title":"Presence of SARS-Coronavirus-2 in sewage","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.29.20045880","rel_abs":"In the current COVID-19 pandemic, a significant proportion of cases shed SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) with their faeces.

So accurate evaluation of these measures helps to maximize the effectiveness of prevention and control while minimizing social costs. In this paper, we develop the model in Dirk Brockmann and Dirk Helbing (2013) to theoretically explain the impact mechanism of traffic control and social distancing measures on the spread of the epidemic, and empirically tests the effect of the two measures in China at the present stage using econometric approach. We found that both traffic control and social distancing measures have played a very good role in controlling the development of the epidemic. Nationally, social distancing measures are better than traffic control measures; the two measures are complementary and their combined action will play a better epidemic prevention effect; Traffic control and social distancing do not work everywhere. Traffic control only works in cities with higher GDP per capita and population size, while fails in cities with lower GDP per capita and population size. In cities with lower population size, social distancing becomes inoperative; the rapid and accurate transmission of information, a higher protection awareness of the public, and a stronger confidence of residents in epidemic prevention can promote the realization of the measure effects. The findings above verify the effectiveness and correctness of the measures implemented in China at present, at the same time, we propose that it is necessary to fully consider the respective characteristics of the two measures, cooperating and complementing each other; what's more, measures should be formulated according to the city's own situation, achieving precise epidemic prevention; Finally, we should increase the transparency of information, improve protection awareness of the public, guide emotions of the public in a proper way, enhancing public confidence.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shanlang Lin","author_inst":"Tongji University"},{"author_name":"Junpei Huang","author_inst":"Tongji University"},{"author_name":"Ziwen He","author_inst":"School of economics and management, tongji university"},{"author_name":"Dandan Zhan","author_inst":"251227468@qq.com"},{"author_name":"Anke Brouwer","author_inst":"KWR Water Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Yongyu Liu","author_inst":"Shenyang Chest Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"Shenyang Chest Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chris Del Mar","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Dooley","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Eliana Ferroni","author_inst":"Regione Veneto, Italy"},{"author_name":"Paul Glasziou","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Tammy Hoffman","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Sarah Thorning","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Mieke Van Driel","author_inst":"Primary Care Clinical Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Queensland, Australia"},{"author_name":"Claudio Pagani","author_inst":"Data Rebel Consulting"},{"author_name":"Elena Reutskaja","author_inst":"IESE Business School"},{"author_name":"Federico Raimondi Slepoi","author_inst":"City of Rome"},{"author_name":"Lingfang Zhao","author_inst":"The 940th Hospital"},{"author_name":"Junli Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Huailong Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yue Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Weihong Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Jing Peng","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyu Chen","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, General Hospital of Northern Theater Command"},{"author_name":"Ping Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yaoning Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yonghong Xie","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Disease, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Air Force Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jibo Song","author_inst":"The 960th Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lu Zhang","author_inst":"The 940th Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qingjun Ma","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Xiuwu Bian","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Xuan Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Qing Mao","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Cheng Cao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health economics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.29.20045187","rel_title":"How to evaluate the success of the COVID-19 measures implemented by the Norwegian government by analyzing changes in doubling time","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.29.20045187","rel_abs":"Doubling Time (DT) is typically calculated for growth curves that show exponential growth, such as the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases day by day.

The initial set of results following the shutdown are encouraging, demonstrating a trend towards slower growth; however, this could be reversed if the measures that are in place now are abandoned too early. Premature optimism can be very costly. This paper explains how to monitor growth in real time and evaluate whether the implemented measures are successful.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Biljana Stangeland","author_inst":"Mindshift AS"},{"author_name":"Junpei Huang","author_inst":"Tongji University"},{"author_name":"Ziwen He","author_inst":"School of economics and management, tongji university"},{"author_name":"Dandan Zhan","author_inst":"251227468@qq.com"},{"author_name":"Anke Brouwer","author_inst":"KWR Water Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Yongyu Liu","author_inst":"Shenyang Chest Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"Shenyang Chest Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chris Del Mar","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Dooley","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Eliana Ferroni","author_inst":"Regione Veneto, Italy"},{"author_name":"Paul Glasziou","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Tammy Hoffman","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Sarah Thorning","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Mieke Van Driel","author_inst":"Primary Care Clinical Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Queensland, Australia"},{"author_name":"Claudio Pagani","author_inst":"Data Rebel Consulting"},{"author_name":"Elena Reutskaja","author_inst":"IESE Business School"},{"author_name":"Federico Raimondi Slepoi","author_inst":"City of Rome"},{"author_name":"Lingfang Zhao","author_inst":"The 940th Hospital"},{"author_name":"Junli Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Huailong Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yue Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Weihong Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Jing Peng","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyu Chen","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, General Hospital of Northern Theater Command"},{"author_name":"Ping Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yaoning Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yonghong Xie","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Disease, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Air Force Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jibo Song","author_inst":"The 960th Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lu Zhang","author_inst":"The 940th Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qingjun Ma","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Xiuwu Bian","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Xuan Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Qing Mao","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Cheng Cao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.26.20044263","rel_title":"An Evaluation of the Vulnerable Physician Workforce in the United States During the Coronavirus Disease-19 Pandemic","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.26.20044263","rel_abs":"Background: The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic threatens to overwhelm the healthcare resources of the country, but also poses a personal hazard to healthcare workers, including physicians. To address the potential impact of excluding physicians with a high risk of adverse outcomes based on age, we evaluated the current patterns of age of licensed physicians across the United States. Methods: We compiled information from the 2018 database of actively licensed physicians in the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) across the US. Both at a national- and the state-level, we assessed the number and proportion of physicians who would be at an elevated risk due to age over 60 years. Results: Of the 985,026 licensed physicians in the US, 235857 or 23.9% were aged 25-40 years, 447052 or 45.4% are 40-60 years, 191794 or 19.5% were 60-70 years, and 106121 or 10.8% were 70 years or older. Age was not reported in 4202 or 0.4% of physicians. Overall, 297915 or 30.2% of physicians were 60 years of age or older, 246167 (25.0%) 65 years and older, and 106121 (10.8%) 70 years or older. States in the US reported that a median 5470 licensed physicians (interquartile range [IQR], 2394 to 10108) were 60 years of age or older. Notably, states of North Dakota (n=1180) and Vermont (n = 1215) had the lowest and California (n=50786) and New York (n=31582) the highest number of physicians over the age of 60 years (Figure 1). Across states, the median proportion of physicians aged 60 years and older was 28.9% (IQR, 27.2%, 31.4%), and ranged between 25.9% for Nebraska to 32.6% for New Mexico (Figure 2). Discussion: Older physicians represent a large proportion of the US physician workforce, particularly in states with the worst COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, their exclusion from patient care will be impractical. Optimizing care practices by limiting direct patient contact of physicians vulnerable to adverse outcomes from COVID-19, potentially by expanding their participation in telehealth may be a strategy to protect them.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rohan Khera","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Lovedeep Singh Dhingra","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Snigdha Jain","author_inst":"University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Harlan Krumholz","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Anke Brouwer","author_inst":"KWR Water Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Yongyu Liu","author_inst":"Shenyang Chest Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"Shenyang Chest Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chris Del Mar","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Dooley","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Eliana Ferroni","author_inst":"Regione Veneto, Italy"},{"author_name":"Paul Glasziou","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Tammy Hoffman","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Sarah Thorning","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Mieke Van Driel","author_inst":"Primary Care Clinical Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Queensland, Australia"},{"author_name":"Claudio Pagani","author_inst":"Data Rebel Consulting"},{"author_name":"Elena Reutskaja","author_inst":"IESE Business School"},{"author_name":"Federico Raimondi Slepoi","author_inst":"City of Rome"},{"author_name":"Lingfang Zhao","author_inst":"The 940th Hospital"},{"author_name":"Junli Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Huailong Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yue Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Weihong Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Jing Peng","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyu Chen","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, General Hospital of Northern Theater Command"},{"author_name":"Ping Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yaoning Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yonghong Xie","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Disease, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Air Force Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jibo Song","author_inst":"The 960th Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lu Zhang","author_inst":"The 940th Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qingjun Ma","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Xiuwu Bian","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Xuan Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Qing Mao","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Cheng Cao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.25.20043331","rel_title":"A Machine Learning Model Reveals Older Age and Delayed Hospitalization as Predictors of Mortality in Patients with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.25.20043331","rel_abs":"Objective: The recent pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is increasingly causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and significant mortality.

Results: The Area under the ROC curve obtained during model validation on the test dataset was 0.97. Age was the most important variable in predicting mortality followed by the time gap between symptom onset and hospitalization. Conclusions: Patients aged beyond 62 years are at higher risk of fatality whereas hospitalization within 2 days of the onset of symptoms could reduce mortality in COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jit Sarkar","author_inst":"CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology"},{"author_name":"Partha Chakrabarti","author_inst":"CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology"},{"author_name":"Snigdha Jain","author_inst":"University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Harlan Krumholz","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Anke Brouwer","author_inst":"KWR Water Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Yongyu Liu","author_inst":"Shenyang Chest Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"Shenyang Chest Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chris Del Mar","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Dooley","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Eliana Ferroni","author_inst":"Regione Veneto, Italy"},{"author_name":"Paul Glasziou","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Tammy Hoffman","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Sarah Thorning","author_inst":"Bond University, Australia"},{"author_name":"Mieke Van Driel","author_inst":"Primary Care Clinical Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Queensland, Australia"},{"author_name":"Claudio Pagani","author_inst":"Data Rebel Consulting"},{"author_name":"Elena Reutskaja","author_inst":"IESE Business School"},{"author_name":"Federico Raimondi Slepoi","author_inst":"City of Rome"},{"author_name":"Lingfang Zhao","author_inst":"The 940th Hospital"},{"author_name":"Junli Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Huailong Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yue Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Weihong Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Jing Peng","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyu Chen","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, General Hospital of Northern Theater Command"},{"author_name":"Ping Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yaoning Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yonghong Xie","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Disease, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Air Force Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jibo Song","author_inst":"The 960th Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lu Zhang","author_inst":"The 940th Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qingjun Ma","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Xiuwu Bian","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Xuan Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Qing Mao","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Cheng Cao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.25.006213","rel_title":"Comparative Genomic Analysis of Rapidly Evolving SARS CoV-2 Viruses Reveal Mosaic Pattern of Phylogeographical Distribution","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.25.006213","rel_abs":"The Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) that started in Wuhan, China in December 2019 has spread worldwide emerging as a global pandemic. The severe respiratory pneumonia caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 has so far claimed more than 60,000 lives and has impacted human lives worldwide. However, as the novel SARS-CoV-2 displays high transmission rates, their underlying genomic severity is required to be fully understood. We studied the complete genomes of 95 SARS-CoV-2 strains from different geographical regions worldwide to uncover the pattern of the spread of the virus. We show that there is no direct transmission pattern of the virus among neighboring countries suggesting that the outbreak is a result of travel of infected humans to different countries. We revealed unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in nsp13-16 (ORF1b polyprotein) and S-Protein within 10 viral isolates from the USA. These viral proteins are involved in RNA replication, indicating highly evolved viral strains circulating in the population of USA than other countries. Furthermore, we found an amino acid addition in nsp16 (mRNA cap-1 methyltransferase) of the USA isolate (MT188341) leading to shift in amino acid frame from position 2540 onwards. Through the construction of SARS-CoV-2-human interactome, we further revealed that multiple host proteins (PHB, PPP1CA, TGF-{beta}, SOCS3, STAT3, JAK1\/2, SMAD3, BCL2, CAV1 & SPECC1) are manipulated by the viral proteins (nsp2, PL-PRO, N-protein, ORF7a, M-S-ORF3a complex, nsp7-nsp8-nsp9-RdRp complex) for mediating host immune evasion. Thus, the replicative machinery of SARS-CoV-2 is fast evolving to evade host challenges which need to be considered for developing effective treatment strategies.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Roshan Kumar","author_inst":"P.G.

The development of quantitative approaches to advance comprehension of the current outbreak is urgently needed to tackle this severe disease. In this work, several mathematical models are proposed to represent SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in infected patients. Considering different starting times of infection, parameters sets that represent infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 are computed and compared with other viral infections that can also cause pandemics. Based on the target cell model, SARS-CoV-2 infecting time between susceptible cells (mean of 30 days approximately) is much slower than those reported for Ebola (about 3 times slower) and influenza (60 times slower). The within-host reproductive number for SARS-CoV-2 is consistent to the values of influenza infection (1.7-5.35). The best model to fit the data was including immune responses, which suggest a slow cell response peaking between 5 to 10 days post onset of symptoms. The model with eclipse phase, time in a latent phase before becoming productively infected cells, was not supported. Interestingly, both, the target cell model and the model with immune responses, predict that virus may replicate very slowly in the first days after infection, and it could be below detection levels during the first 4 days post infection. A quantitative comprehension of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics and the estimation of standard parameters of viral infections is the key contribution of this pioneering work.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Esteban Abelardo Hernandez Vargas","author_inst":"Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies"},{"author_name":"Jorge X.

It has been hypothesized that if COVID-19 exhibits seasonality, changing temperatures in the coming months will shift transmission patterns around the world. Such projections, however, require an estimate of the relationship between COVID-19 and temperature at a global scale, and one that isolates the role of temperature from confounding factors, such as public health capacity. This paper provides the first plausibly causal estimates of the relationship between COVID-19 transmission and local temperature using a global sample comprising of 166,686 confirmed new COVID-19 cases from 134 countries from January 22, 2020 to March 15, 2020. We find robust statistical evidence that a 1{degrees}C increase in local temperature reduces transmission by 13% [-21%, -4%, 95%CI]. In contrast, we do not find that specific humidity or precipitation influence transmission. Our statistical approach separates effects of climate variation on COVID-19 transmission from other potentially correlated factors, such as differences in public health responses across countries and heterogeneous population densities. Using constructions of expected seasonal temperatures, we project that changing temperatures between March 2020 and July 2020 will cause COVID-19 transmission to fall by 43% on average for Northern Hemisphere countries and to rise by 71% on average for Southern Hemisphere countries. However, these patterns reverse as the boreal winter approaches, with seasonal temperatures in January 2021 increasing average COVID-19 transmission by 59% relative to March 2020 in northern countries and lowering transmission by 2% in southern countries. These findings suggest that Southern Hemisphere countries should expect greater transmission in the coming months. Moreover, Northern Hemisphere countries face a crucial window of opportunity: if contagion-containing policy interventions can dramatically reduce COVID-19 cases with the aid of the approaching warmer months, it may be possible to avoid a second wave of COVID-19 next winter.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tamma Carleton","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Kyle C.

While bat genomic sequencing studies have revealed characteristic adaptations of the innate immune system, functional genomic studies are urgently needed to provide a foundation for the molecular dissection of the tolerance of viral infections in bats. Here we report the establishment and screening of genome-wide RNAi library and CRISPR library for the model megabat, Pteropus Alecto. We used the complementary RNAi and CRISPR libraries to interrogate Pteropus Alecto cells for infection with two different viruses, mumps virus and Influenza A virus, respectively. Screening results converged on the endocytosis pathway and the protein secretory pathway as required for both viral infections. Additionally, we revealed a general dependence of the C-1-tetrahydrofolate synthase gene, MTHFD1, for viral replication in bat cells as well as in human cells. MTHFD1 inhibitor carolacton potently blocked replication of several RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2. Our studies provide a resource for systematic inquiry into the genetic underpinnings of bat biology and a potential target for developing broad spectrum antiviral therapy.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Danielle E Anderson","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Jin Cui","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Qian Ye","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Baoying Huang","author_inst":"National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC"},{"author_name":"Wenhong Zu","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Jing Gong","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Weiqiang Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Science"},{"author_name":"So Young Kim","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Biao Guo Yan","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Kristmundur Sigmundsson","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Xiao Fang Lim","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Fei Ye","author_inst":"National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC"},{"author_name":"Peihua Niu","author_inst":"National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC"},{"author_name":"Xuming Zhou","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Science"},{"author_name":"Wenjie Tan","author_inst":"National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC"},{"author_name":"Lin-Fa Wang","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Xu Tan","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Lingfang Zhao","author_inst":"The 940th Hospital"},{"author_name":"Junli Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Huailong Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yue Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Weihong Yang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Jing Peng","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyu Chen","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, General Hospital of Northern Theater Command"},{"author_name":"Ping Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yaoning Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yonghong Xie","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Disease, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Air Force Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jibo Song","author_inst":"The 960th Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lu Zhang","author_inst":"The 940th Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qingjun Ma","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Xiuwu Bian","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Xuan Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Qing Mao","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Cheng Cao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.26.20043042","rel_title":"Analysis and Prediction of False Negative Results for SARS-CoV-2 Detection with Pharyngeal Swab Specimen in COVID-19 Patients: A Retrospective Study","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.26.20043042","rel_abs":"Background: False negative results of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection pose threats to COVID-19 patients and medical workers alike. Objective: To develop multivariate models to determine clinical characteristics that contribute to false negative results of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection, and use them to predict false negative results as well as time windows for testing positive. Design: Retrospective Cohort Study (Ethics number of Tongji Hospital: No. IRBID: TJ-20200320) Setting: A database of outpatients in Tongji Hospital (University Hospital) from 15 January 2020 to 19 February 2020. Patients: 1,324 outpatients with COVID-19 Measurements: Clinical information on CT imaging reports, blood routine tests, and clinic symptoms were collected. A multivariate logistic regression was used to explain and predict false negative testing results of SARS-CoV-2 detection. A multivariate accelerated failure model was used to analyze and predict delayed time windows for testing positive. Results: Of the 1,324 outpatients who diagnosed of COVID-19, 633 patients tested positive in their first SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test (47.8%), with a mean age of 51 years (SD=14.9); the rest, which had a mean age of 47 years (SD=15.4), tested negative in the first test. Ground glass opacity in a CT imaging report was associated with a lower chance of false negatives (aOR, 0.56), and reduced the length of time window for testing positive by 26%. Consolidation was associated with a higher chance of false negatives (aOR, 1.57), and extended the length of time window for testing positive by 44%. In blood routine tests, basophils (aOR, 1.28) and eosinophils (aOR, 1.29) were associated with a higher chance of false negatives, and were found to extend the time window for testing positive by 23% and 41%, respectively. Age and gender also affected the significantly. Limitation: Data were generated in a large single-center study. Conclusion: Testing outcome and positive window of SARS-CoV-2 detection for COVID-19 patients were associated with CT imaging results, blood routine tests, and clinical symptoms. Taking into account relevant information in CT imaging reports, blood routine tests, and clinical symptoms helped reduce a false negative testing outcome. The predictive AFT model, what we believe to be one of the first statistical models for predicting time window of SARS-CoV-2 detection, could help clinicians improve the accuracy and efficiency of the diagnosis, and hence, optimizes the timing of nucleic acid detection and alleviates the shortage of nucleic acid detection kits around the world.
