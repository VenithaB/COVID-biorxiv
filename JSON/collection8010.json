Recent evidence suggests blood type may affect risk of severe COVID-19. We used observational healthcare data on 14,112 individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 with known blood type in the New York Presbyterian (NYP) hospital system to assess the association between ABO and Rh blood types and infection, intubation, and death. We found slightly increased infection prevalence among non-O types. Risk of intubation was decreased among A and increased among AB and B types, compared with type O, while risk of death was increased for type AB and decreased for types A and B. We estimated Rh-negative blood type to have a protective effect for all three outcomes. Our results add to the growing body of evidence suggesting blood type may play a role in COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael Zietz","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Jason E.

Self-collected swabs offer many advantages provided detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses is not compromised. METHODS In a prospective study, patients attending dedicated COVID-19 collection clinics were offered the option to first self-collect (SC) nasal and throat swabs prior to health worker collection (HC). Two different laboratory services participated, with HC at Site 1 collecting nasal and throat swabs and at Site 2 nasopharyngeal (NP) and throat swabs. Samples were analysed for SARS-CoV-2 as well as common respiratory viruses. Concordance of results between methods was assessed using Cohens kappa ({kappa}). RESULTS Of 236 patients sampled by HC and SC, 25 had COVID-19 (24 by HC and 25 by SC) and 63 had other respiratory viruses (56 by HC and 58 by SC). SC was highly concordant with HC ({kappa} = 0.890) for all viruses including SARS-CoV-2 and more concordant than HC to positive results by any method ({kappa} = 0.959 vs 0.933). CONCLUSIONS Self-collection of throat and nasal swabs offers a reliable alternative to health worker collection for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and other common respiratory viruses. High viral load of SARS-CoV-2 throughout the respiratory tract and sensitive molecular methods may explain these findings. Self-collection also provides patients with easier access to testing, reduces the exposure of the community and health workers to those undergoing testing and reduces the requirement for PPE.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael C Wehrhahn","author_inst":"Douglass Hanly Moir Pathology"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Robson","author_inst":"Sullivan Nicolaides Pathology"},{"author_name":"Suzanne Brown","author_inst":"Department of Endocrinology & Diabetes, Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital"},{"author_name":"Evan Bursle","author_inst":"Sullivan Nicolaides Pathology"},{"author_name":"Shane Byrne","author_inst":"Sullivan Nicolaides Pathology"},{"author_name":"David New","author_inst":"Clinipath Pathology"},{"author_name":"Smathi Chong","author_inst":"Clinipath Pathology"},{"author_name":"James P Newcombe","author_inst":"Douglass Hanly Moir Pathology"},{"author_name":"Terri Sivertsen","author_inst":"Douglass Hanly Moir Pathology"},{"author_name":"Narelle Hadlow","author_inst":"Clinipath Pathology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.08.20057794","rel_title":"Factors associated with hospitalization and critical illness among 4,103 patients with COVID-19 disease in New York City","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.08.20057794","rel_abs":"Background: Little is known about factors associated with hospitalization and critical illness in Covid-19 positive patients. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of all patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 treated at a single academic health system in New York City between March 1, 2020 and April 2, 2020, with follow up through April 7, 2020. Primary outcomes were hospitalization and critical illness (intensive care, mechanical ventilation, hospice and\/or death). We conducted multivariable logistic regression to identify risk factors for adverse outcomes, and maximum information gain decision tree classifications to identify key splitters. Results: Among 4,103 Covid-19 patients, 1,999 (48.7%) were hospitalized, of whom 981\/1,999 (49.1%) have been discharged home, and 292\/1,999 (14.6%) have died or were discharged to hospice. Of 445 patients requiring mechanical ventilation, 162\/445 (36.4%) have died. Strongest hospitalization risks were age [&ge;]75 years (OR 66.8, 95% CI, 44.7-102.6), age 65-74 (OR 10.9, 95% CI, 8.35-14.34), BMI>40 (OR 6.2, 95% CI, 4.2-9.3), and heart failure (OR 4.3 95% CI, 1.9-11.2). Strongest critical illness risks were admission oxygen saturation <88% (OR 6.99, 95% CI 4.5-11.0), d-dimer>2500 (OR 6.9, 95% CI, 3.2-15.2), ferritin >2500 (OR 6.9, 95% CI, 3.2-15.2), and C-reactive protein (CRP) >200 (OR 5.78, 95% CI, 2.6-13.8). In the decision tree for admission, the most important features were age >65 and obesity; for critical illness, the most important was SpO2<88, followed by procalcitonin >0.5, troponin <0.1 (protective), age >64 and CRP>200. Conclusions: Age and comorbidities are powerful predictors of hospitalization; however, admission oxygen impairment and markers of inflammation are most strongly associated with critical illness.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christopher M.

We used the estimated parameters to predict the disease burden in these countries with special emphasis on India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. Our analysis revealed that the lockdown and recommended individual hygiene can slow down the outbreak but unable to eradicate the disease from the society. With the current human-to-human transmission rate and existing level of personal precautionary, the number of infected individuals in India will be increasing at least for the next 3 months and the peak will come in 5 months. We can, however, reduce the epidemic size and prolong the time to arrive epidemic peak by seriously following the measures suggested by the authorities. We need to wait for another one month to obtain more data and epidemiological parameters for giving a better prediction about the pandemic.

It was followed by a bigger wave mainly from local transmissions resulting in 651 cases. The following wave saw unexpectedly three digit number of daily cases following a mass gathering urged the government to choose a more stringent measure. A limited lock-down approach called Movement Control Order (MCO) was immediately initiated to the whole country as a way to suppress the epidemic trajectory. The lock-down causes a major socio-economic disruption thus the ability to forecast the infection dynamic is urgently required to assist the government on timely decisions. Limited testing capacity and limited epidemiological data complicate the understanding of the future infection dynamic of the COVID-19 epidemic. Three different epidemic forecasting models was used to generate forecasts of COVID-19 cases in Malaysia using daily reported cumulative case data up until 1st April 2020 from the Malaysia Ministry of Health. The forecasts were generated using a Curve Fitting Model with Probability Density Function and Skewness Effect, the SIR Model, and a System Dynamic Model. Method one based on curve fitting with probability density function estimated that the peak will be on 19th April 2020 with an estimation of 5,637 infected persons. Method two based on SIR Model estimated that the peak will be on 20th - 31st May 2020 if Movement Contro (MCO) is in place with an estimation of 630,000 to 800,000 infected persons. Method three based on System Dynamic Model estimated that the peak will be on 17th May 2020 with an estimation of 22,421 infected persons.

Subsequently, research on COVID-19 has focused on number of cases and deaths and predicted projections have focused on these parameters. We propose that the number of tests performed is a very important denominator in understanding the COVID-19 data. We analysed the number of diagnostic tests performed in proportion to the number of cases and subsequently deaths across different countries and projected pandemic outcomes. We obtained real time COVID-19 data from the reference website Worldometer at 0900 BST on Saturday 4th April, 2020 and collated the information obtained on the top 50 countries with the highest number of COVID 19 cases. We analysed this data according to the number of tests performed as the main denominator. Country wise population level pandemic projections were extrapolated utilising three models - 1) inherent case per test and death per test rates at the time of obtaining the data (4\/4\/2020 0900 BST) for each country; 2) rates adjusted according to the countries who conducted at least 100000 tests and 3) rates adjusted according to South Korea. We showed that testing rates impact on the number of cases and deaths and ultimately on future projections for the pandemic across different countries. We found that countries with the highest testing rates per population have the lowest death rates and give us an early indication of an eventual COVID-19 mortality rate. It is only by continued testing on a large scale that will enable us to know if the increasing number of patients who are seriously unwell in hospitals across the world are the tip of the iceberg or not. Accordingly, obtaining this information through a rapid increase in testing globally is the only way which will enable us to exit the COVID-19 pandemic and reduce economic and social instability.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rahul Potluri","author_inst":"ACALM Big Data Research Group"},{"author_name":"Deepthi Lavu","author_inst":"ACALM Big Data Research Group"},{"author_name":"Shuhaimi Mansor","author_inst":"Universiti Teknologi Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Nor Erne Nazira Bazin","author_inst":"Universiti Teknologi Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Safiya Amaran","author_inst":"Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin"},{"author_name":"Ahmad Athif Mohd Faudzi","author_inst":"Universiti Teknologi Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Anazida Zainal","author_inst":"Universiti Teknologi Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Sharin Hazlin Huspi","author_inst":"Universiti Teknologi Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Eric Jiun Hooi Khoo","author_inst":"Universiti Teknologi Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Shaekh Mohammad Shithil","author_inst":"Universiti Teknologi Malaysia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.09.20056903","rel_title":"BCG protects against COVID-19?

We assessed the US publics early experience with the COVID-19 crisis during the period when shelter-in-place orders were widely implemented to understand non-compliance with those orders, sentiment about the crisis, and to compare across age categories associated with different levels of risk. We posted our survey on Twitter, Facebook, and NextDoor on March 14th to March 23rd that included 21 questions including demographics, impact on daily life, actions taken, and difficulties faced. We analyzed the free-text responses to the impact question using LIWC, a computational natural language processing tool, and performed a thematic content analysis of the reasons people gave for non-compliance with social distancing orders. Stanford Universitys IRB approved the study. In 9 days, we collected a total of 20,734 responses. 6,573 individuals provided a response ([&ge;]30 words) to the question, Tell us how the coronavirus crisis is impacting your life. Our data (Figure 1) show that younger people (18-31) are more emotionally negative, self-centered, and less concerned with family, while middle-aged people are group-oriented (32-44) and focused on family (32-64) (all p values < .05 corrected for multiple comparisons). Unsurprisingly, the oldest and most at-risk group (65+) are more focused on biological terms (e.g., health-related topics), but were surprisingly low in anxiety and high in emotionally positive terms relative to those at lower risk. We also content-analyzed 7,355 responses (kappas > .75) to the question, What are the reasons you are not self-isolating more? Of these participants, 39.8% reported not being compliant, with the youngest group (18-31) having the lowest compliance rate (52.4%) compared to the other age groups (all > 60%; all p values < .01). Table 1 describes the seven primary themes for non-compliance. Non-essential work requirements, concerns about mental and physical health, and the belief that other precautions were sufficient were the most common reasons, although other rationales included wanting to continue everyday activities and beliefs that society is over-reacting. Childcare was an important concern for a subset of respondents. Overall, our findings suggest that public health messages should focus on young people and 1) address their negative affect, 2) refocus their self-orientation by emphasizing the importance of individual behavior to group-level health outcomes, and 3) target the specific rationales that different people have regarding the pandemic to maximize compliance with social distancing.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ryan C Moore","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Angela Lee","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey T Hancock","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Meghan Halley","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Eleni Linos","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Afonso Delgado","author_inst":"In Loco"},{"author_name":"S\u00e9rgio M Oliva","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Sharin Hazlin Huspi","author_inst":"Universiti Teknologi Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Eric Jiun Hooi Khoo","author_inst":"Universiti Teknologi Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Shaekh Mohammad Shithil","author_inst":"Universiti Teknologi Malaysia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.09.20049288","rel_title":"Know Your Epidemic, Know Your Response: Covid-19 in the United States","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.09.20049288","rel_abs":"We document that during the week of March 10-16, the Covid-19 pandemic fundamentally affected the perceptions of U.S. residents about the health risks and socioeconomic consequences entailed by the pandemic. During this week, it seems, \"everything changed.\" Not only did the pandemic progress rapidly across the United States, but U.S. residents started to realize that the threat was real: increasing Covid-19 caseloads heightened perceptions of infection risks and excess mortality risks, concerns about the economic implications increased substantially, and behavioral responses became widespread as the pandemic expanded rapidly in the U.S. In early to mid-March 2020, average perceptions about the coronavirus infection risks are broadly consistent with projections about the pandemic, while expectations about dying conditional on infection and expectations about Covid-19-related excess mortality during the next months are possibly too pessimistic. However, some aspects of Covid-19 perceptions are disconcerting from the perspective of implementing and sustaining an effective societal response to the pandemic. For instance, the education gradient in expected infection risks entails the possibility of having different perceptions of the reality of the pandemic between people with and without a college education, potentially resulting in two different levels of behavioral and policy-responses across individuals and regions. Unless addressed by effective health communication that reaches individuals across all social strata, some of the misperceptions about Covid-19 epidemic raise concerns about the ability of the United States to implement and sustain the widespread and harsh policies that are required to curtail the pandemic. Our analyses also reveal perceptions of becoming infected with the virus, and dying from Covid-19, were driven upwards by a rapidly increasing national caseload, and perceptions of the economic consequences and the adaptation of social distancing were affected by both national and state-level cases.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alberto Ciancio","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Fabrice K\u00e4mpfen","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Iliana V.

Because the clinically diagnosed cases in Hubei province were reported for the first time on February 13, 2020, a very high peak of new cases in China was observed. The reason why so many clinically diagnosed cases appeared was not clear. Methods: All data of new cases in China were acquired from WHO situation reports. Linear fitting was used to infer the ability to detect COVID-19 infections. Primer-BLAST and nucleotide blast were applied to check the specificity of primers. Expression data of human mRNA in different tissues was obtained from Human Protein Atlas. Finding: Based on the data and analysis of changes of new laboratory-confirmed cases and new clinically diagnosed cases, it was inferred that there were many false-negative results in all clinically diagnosed cases in Hubei province. There were eight non-specific primers in dozens of primers used in clinical or research detection of COVID-19. Among them, a pair of primer for the ORF1ab regions of SARS-CoV-2 genome, which widely applied to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus in China, well matched some human mRNAs such as Cathepsin C transcripts. Compared to other transcripts, Cathepsin C mRNA had a high abundance in tonsil, lung and small intestine. Interpretation: Some non-specific RT-PCR primers could cause the serious interference during RT-PCR amplification so as to increase the risk of false-negative diagnoses for COVID-19 infections.

Methods: We proposed to use a retrospective case-control study to give a comparison between suspected patients and confirmed patients in the clinical characteristics. Results: (56%) patients were confirmed for COVID-19 from suspected 167 patients. We find that elder people were more likely to be infected by COVID-19. Among the confirmed 94 patients, 2 (2%) patients were admitted to an intensive care unit, and 0 (0%) patients died during the study period. We find that images of CT scan of patients with a COVID-19 are significantly different from patients without a COVID-19. Conclusions: To our best knowledge, it is the first time to use the case-control design to study the coronavirus disease, since it is particularly appropriate for investigating infectious disease outbreaks. The clinical treatment experience in this study can supply a guideline for treating COVID-19 as the number of the infected patients is increasing in the world. Compared with other studies, we find that the mortality rate and the intensive care unit rate can be reduced if patients can be treated timely in the right identification and detection with nucleic acid testing and chest CT scan. Therefore, we recommend nucleic acid testing and chest CT scan for the clinical treatment practice from this successful clinical treatment study.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jianghu Dong","author_inst":"College of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Lianpin Wu","author_inst":"Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"QIKE Jin","author_inst":"Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jie Chen","author_inst":"Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jiawei He","author_inst":"Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jill Darling","author_inst":"University of Southern California"},{"author_name":"Arie Kapteyn","author_inst":"University of Southern California"},{"author_name":"J\u00e4rgen Maurer","author_inst":"University of Lausanne"},{"author_name":"Hans-Peter Kohler","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Shaekh Mohammad Shithil","author_inst":"Universiti Teknologi Malaysia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.07.20053744","rel_title":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Infection During Pregnancy In China: A Retrospective Cohort Study","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.07.20053744","rel_abs":"Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as the cause of the ongoing worldwide epidemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China and worldwide. However, there were few studies about the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on pregnant women. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, we enrolled 31 pregnant women and 35 non-pregnant women from Jan 28 to Feb 28, 2020 to evaluate the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. Inflammatory indices were used to assess the severity of COVID-19. Evidence of vertical transmission was determined by laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, placenta, neonatal throat and anal swab and breastmilk samples. Findings Compared with non-pregnant women, pregnant women had a significantly lower proportion of fever (54.8% vs. 87.5%, p= 0.006), a shorter average interval from onset to hospitalization, and a higher proportion of severe or critical COVID-19 (32.3% vs. 11.4%, p=0.039). Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and systematic immune-inflammation-based prognostic index (SII) were significantly higher on admission in severe\/critical pneumonia group than moderate pneumonia group. We could not detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR in amniotic fluid, placenta, neonatal throat and anal swab and breastmilk samples. Conclusions The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 in pregnant women were insidious and atypical, compared with those in non-pregnant patients. SII and NLR could be a useful marker to evaluate the severity of COVID-19. There was no evidence of vertical transmission during pregnancy with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mingzhu Yin","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Lijuan Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China"},{"author_name":"Guangtong Deng","author_inst":"Xiangya hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Chaofei Han","author_inst":"Department of Burn and Plastic Surgery, The Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China."},{"author_name":"Minxue Shen","author_inst":"Department of Dermatology, Hunan Engineering Research Center of Skin Heath and Disease, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China;"},{"author_name":"Hongyin Sun","author_inst":"Department of Dermatology, Hunan Engineering Research Center of Skin Heath and Disease, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China;"},{"author_name":"Furong Zeng","author_inst":"Department of Dermatology, Hunan Engineering Research Center of Skin Heath and Disease, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China;"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China"},{"author_name":"Lan Chen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Qingqing Luo","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Dujuan Yao","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Min Wu","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Shihuan Yu","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China;"},{"author_name":"Hui Chen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"David Baud","author_inst":"Materno-fetal and Obstetrics Research Unit, Department of Femme-Mere-Enfant, University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland."},{"author_name":"Xiang Chen","author_inst":"Department of Dermatology, Hunan Engineering Research Center of Skin Heath and Disease, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China;"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.06.20055749","rel_title":"Infoveillance based on Social Sensors to Analyze the impact of Covid19 in South American Population","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.06.20055749","rel_abs":"Infoveillance is an application from Infodemiology field with the aim to monitor public health and create public policies.

In this way, the wavelengths of the outbreaks can be calculated, ensuring that the outbreaks are valid, reliable and easy to follow at the national and international level. Wavelength models consist of approved case, death, recovered case and net wavelength models. Thus, the size of the outbreak can be measured both individually and as a whole. COVID-19 cases of 181 countries were used to demonstrate the application of the models. The prominent findings in the applied wavelength models are as follows: the countries with the highest case wavelength are USA, Italy, Spain and Germany, respectively. However, Italy ranks first in the death wavelength, followed by Spain, the USA and France. On the other hand, China has taken the first place in the recovered case wavelength. This country was followed by Spain and Germany and Italy, respectively. Based on all these wavelength models mentioned, net wavelength lengths are calculated. According to the findings of net wavelengths obtained, Canada ranked first, followed by United Kingdom, USA and Italy, respectively.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tevfik Bulut","author_inst":"The Ministry of Industry and Technology"},{"author_name":"Lijuan Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China"},{"author_name":"Guangtong Deng","author_inst":"Xiangya hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Chaofei Han","author_inst":"Department of Burn and Plastic Surgery, The Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China."},{"author_name":"Minxue Shen","author_inst":"Department of Dermatology, Hunan Engineering Research Center of Skin Heath and Disease, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China;"},{"author_name":"Hongyin Sun","author_inst":"Department of Dermatology, Hunan Engineering Research Center of Skin Heath and Disease, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China;"},{"author_name":"Furong Zeng","author_inst":"Department of Dermatology, Hunan Engineering Research Center of Skin Heath and Disease, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China;"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China"},{"author_name":"Lan Chen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Qingqing Luo","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Dujuan Yao","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Min Wu","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"Shihuan Yu","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China;"},{"author_name":"Hui Chen","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"},{"author_name":"David Baud","author_inst":"Materno-fetal and Obstetrics Research Unit, Department of Femme-Mere-Enfant, University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland."},{"author_name":"Xiang Chen","author_inst":"Department of Dermatology, Hunan Engineering Research Center of Skin Heath and Disease, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China;"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.07.20056887","rel_title":"A secure and rapid query-software for COVID-19 test results that can easily be integrated into the clinical workflow to avoid communication overload","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.07.20056887","rel_abs":"Overcoming the COVID-19 crisis requires new ideas and strategies. Rapid testing of a large number of subjects is essential to monitor, and delay, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to mitigate the consequences of the pandemic. People not knowing that they are infected may not stay in quarantine and, thus, are a risk for infecting others. Unfortunately, the massive number of COVID-19 tests performed is challenging for both laboratories and the units that take the throat swab and have to communicate test results. Here, we present a secure tracking system (CTest) to report COVID-19 test results online as soon as they become available. The system can be integrated into the clinical workflow with very modest effort and avoids excessive load to telephone hotlines. With this open-source and browser-based online tracking system, we aim to minimize the time required to inform the tested person but also the test units, e.g. hospitals or the public healthcare system. Instead of personal calls, CTest updates the status of the test automatically when the test results are available. Test reports are published on a secured web-page enabling regular status checks also by patients not using smartphones with dedicated mobile apps which has some importance as smartphone usage diminishes with age. The source code, as well as further information to integrate CTest into the IT environment of other clinics or test-centres, are freely available from https:\/\/github.com\/sysbio-bioinf\/CTest under the Eclipse Public License v2.0 (EPL2).","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gunnar Voelkel","author_inst":"Ulm University"},{"author_name":"Axel Fuerstberger","author_inst":"Ulm University"},{"author_name":"Julian D.

Risk factors for mortality have not been well summarized. Current meta-analysis of retrospective cohort studies was done to summarize available findings on the association between age, gender, comorbidities and risk of death from COVID-19 infection. Methods: Online databases including Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library and Google scholar were searched to detect relevant publications up to 1 May 2020, using relevant keywords. To pool data, random-effects model was used. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis and publication bias test were also done. Results: In total, 14 studies with 29,909 COVID-19 infected patients and 1,445 cases of death were included in the current meta-analysis. Significant associations were found between older age ([&ge;]65 vs <65 years old) (pooled ORs=4.59, 95% CIs=2.61-8.04, p<0.001), gender (male vs female) (pooled ORs=1.50, 95% CIs=1.06-2.12, p=0.021) and risk of death from COVID-19 infection. In addition, hypertension (pooled ORs=2.70, 95% CIs=1.40-5.24, p=0.003), cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) (pooled ORs=3.72, 95% CIs=1.77-7.83, p=0.001), diabetes (pooled ORs=2.41, 95% CIs=1.05-5.51, p=0.037), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (pooled ORs=3.53, 95% CIs=1.79-6.96, p<0.001) and cancer (pooled ORs=3.04, 95% CIs=1.80-5.14, p<0.001), were associated with higher risk of mortality. Conclusion: Older age ([&ge;]65 years old), male gender, hypertension, CVDs, diabetes, COPD and malignancies were associated with greater risk of death from COVID-19 infection. These findings could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammad Parohan","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sajad Yaghoubi","author_inst":"Iranshahr University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Asal Seraji","author_inst":"Islamic Azad University, Damavand Branch"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Hassan Javanbakht","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Payam Sarraf","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mahmoud Djalali","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Alexander Gross","author_inst":"Ulm University"},{"author_name":"Florian Kohlmayer","author_inst":"TU Munich"},{"author_name":"Peter Kuhn","author_inst":"University Hospital Ulm"},{"author_name":"Klaus A.

The first case of COVID-19 was confirmed at the Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre on March 1st, a large public hospital with 1200 beds, covering an area over 400000 inhabitants in southern Madrid. During March 2020 highly active circulation of SARS-CoV-2 was experienced in Madrid with 24090 cases officially reported by March 29th. Methods Since the beginning of the epidemics the Occupational Health and Safety Service (OHSS) organized the consulting and testing of the hospital personnel with confirmed exposure and also those presenting symptoms suggestive of viral respiratory infection. For molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection both nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were obtained from suspected cases and processed at the Microbiology Laboratory by automatized specific PCR methods that was operative from February 25th as part of the preparedness. Results From a total of 6800 employees of the hospital, 2085 (30,6 %) were tested during the period 1-29 March 2020, some of them repeatedly (2286 total samples). The first HCW infected was confirmed on March 9th. A total of 791 HCW and personnel were confirmed to be infected by March 29th, representing 38% of those tested and 11,6 % of all the hospital workers. The proportion of infected individuals was estimated among the different groups of occupational exposure and the evolution of the cases during the expansive epidemic wave was compared between HCW and those patients attending at the Emergency Department (ER) during the same period and adjusted by the same age range. There were no statistically significant differences in the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR detection between HCW from high risk areas involved in close contact with COVID-19 patients in comparison with clerical, administrative or laboratory personnel without direct contact with patients. The curves of evolution of accumulated cases between patients and HCW during March 2020 showed an almost parallel shape. Discussion The recommendation from our OHSS did not include testing of asymptomatic cases but was highly proactive in testing even patients with minor symptoms therefore, a high proportion of HCW and non-sanitary personnel was tested in March 2020 during the rapid period of expansion of the epidemics in Madrid, accounting for a total of 30,6 % of the hospital employees. Most of the COVID-19 cases among the hospital HCW and personnel were mild and managed at home under self-isolation measures, however 23 (3%) required hospitalization mostly due to severe bilateral interstitial pneumonia, two of those cases required mechanical ventilation at the ICU. No fatalities occurred during the study period. Although there were some cases of highly probable transmission from COVID-19 patients to HCWs, mainly at the first phase of the epidemics, there were no significant differences on the infection rates of HCW and hospital personnel that can be related to working in areas of high exposure risk. Furthermore, the evolution of cases during the same time period (March 2020) between patients attending the ER and hospital staff suggests that both groups were driven by the same dynamics. This experience is similar to the communicated from Wuhan verified by the WHO Joint Mission and also from recent experiences at hospital in the Netherlands, where most of the infections of HCW were related to household or community contacts. Significance Since the collective of hospital HCW are exhaustively screened in specific centers, their rate of infection for SARS-CoV-2 could be an indicator of the epidemic dynamics in the community. There appears to be a close connection between HCW infection and the driving forces of transmission in the community. Although we cannot exclude an additional risk factor of infection by SARS-CoV-2 due to the fact of the hospital environment, the similar proportions of positive cases among all the areas of the hospital and the evolutive wave of infection, as compared with the community, are clear arguments against a major factor of occupational risk. Exhaustive testing, such as the one carried out in our institution, covering over one third of all the workers, could be used as a reference of the population infected in the community. Since a significant proportion of COVID-19 cases can be asymptomatic and not all the hospital employees were actually tested, it is highly likely that this 11,6 % is a minimum estimation of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 circulation in Madrid during the first 4 weeks of the epidemics. This is in high and clear contrast with the official figures circulating at national and international levels. This has important implications to more precisely estimate the actual number of cases in the community and to develop public health policies for containment, treatment and recovery.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria Dolores Folgueira","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Carmen Munoz-Ruiperez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Miguel Angel Alonso-Lopez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Rafael Delgado","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Payam Sarraf","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mahmoud Djalali","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Alexander Gross","author_inst":"Ulm University"},{"author_name":"Florian Kohlmayer","author_inst":"TU Munich"},{"author_name":"Peter Kuhn","author_inst":"University Hospital Ulm"},{"author_name":"Klaus A.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is viral infection that generates a severe acute respiratory syndrome with serious pneumonia that may result in progressive respiratory failure and death. What are the goals of this investigation? This study explains the geo-environmental determinants of the accelerated diffusion of COVID-19 in Italy that is generating a high level of deaths and suggests general lessons learned for a strategy to cope with future epidemics similar to COVID-19 to reduce viral infectivity and negative impacts in economic systems and society. What are the results of this study? The main results are: o The accelerate and vast diffusion of COVID-19 in North Italy has a high association with air pollution. o Hinterland cities have average days of exceeding the limits set for PM10 (particulate matter 10 micrometers or less in diameter) equal to 80 days, and an average number of infected more than 2,000 individuals as of April 1st, 2020, coastal cities have days of exceeding the limits set for PM10 equal to 60 days and have about 700 infected in average. o Cities that average number of 125 days exceeding the limits set for PM10, last year, they have an average number of infected individual higher than 3,200 units, whereas cities having less than 100 days (average number of 48 days) exceeding the limits set for PM10, they have an average number of about 900 infected individuals. o The results reveal that accelerated transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in specific environments is due to two mechanisms given by: air pollution-to-human transmission and human-to-human transmission; in particular, the mechanisms of air pollution-to-human transmission play a critical role rather than human-to-human transmission. o The finding here suggests that to minimize future epidemic similar to COVID-19, the max number of days per year in which cities can exceed the limits set for PM10 or for ozone, considering their meteorological condition, is less than 50 days. After this critical threshold, the analytical output here suggests that environmental inconsistencies because of the combination between air pollution and meteorological conditions (with high moisture%, low wind speed and fog) trigger a take-off of viral infectivity (accelerated epidemic diffusion) with damages for health of population, economy and society. What is a socioeconomic strategy to prevent future epidemics similar to COVID-19? Considering the complex interaction between air pollution, meteorological conditions and biological characteristics of viral infectivity, lessons learned for COVID-19 have to be applied for a proactive socioeconomic strategy to cope with future epidemics, especially an environmental policy based on reduction of air pollution mainly in hinterland zones of countries, having low wind speed, high percentage of moisture and fog that create an environment that can damage immune system of people and foster a fast transmission of viral infectivity similar to the COVID-19. This study must conclude that a strategy to prevent future epidemics similar to COVID 19 has also to be designed in environmental and sustainability science and not only in terms of biology.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mario Coccia","author_inst":"National Research Council of Italy"},{"author_name":"Carmen Munoz-Ruiperez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Miguel Angel Alonso-Lopez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Rafael Delgado","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Payam Sarraf","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mahmoud Djalali","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Alexander Gross","author_inst":"Ulm University"},{"author_name":"Florian Kohlmayer","author_inst":"TU Munich"},{"author_name":"Peter Kuhn","author_inst":"University Hospital Ulm"},{"author_name":"Klaus A.

This was the first signal of ongoing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the country. The outbreak rapidly escalated to a national level epidemic, amid the WHO declaration of a pandemic. Methods We analysed data from the national case-based integrated surveillance system of all RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infections as of March 24th 2020, collected from all Italian regions and autonomous provinces. Here we provide a descriptive epidemiological summary on the first 62,843 COVID-19 cases in Italy as well as estimates of the basic and net reproductive numbers by region. Findings Of the 62,843 cases of COVID-19 analysed, 71.6% were reported from three Regions (Lombardia, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna). All cases reported after February 20th were locally acquired. Estimates of R0 varied between 2.5 (95%CI: 2.18-2.83) in Toscana and 3 (95%CI: 2.68-3.33) in Lazio, with epidemic doubling time of 3.2 days (95%CI: 2.3-5.2) and 2.9 days (95%CI: 2.2-4.3), respectively. The net reproduction number showed a decreasing trend starting around February 20-25, 2020 in northern regions. Notably, 5,760 cases were reported among health care workers. Of the 5,541 reported COVID-19 associated deaths, 49% occurred in people aged 80 years or above with an overall crude CFR of 8.8%. Male sex and age were independent risk factors for COVID-19 death. Interpretation The COVID-19 infection in Italy emerged with a clustering onset similar to the one described in Wuhan, China and likewise showed worse outcomes in older males with comorbidities. Initial R0 at 2.96 in Lombardia, explains the high case-load and rapid geographical spread observed. Overall Rt in Italian regions is currently decreasing albeit with large diversities across the country, supporting the importance of combined non-pharmacological control measures.","rel_num_authors":29,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Flavia Riccardo","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Xanthi Andrianou","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita; Cyprus University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Antonino Bella","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Martina Del Manso","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Massimo Fabiani","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Stefania Bellino","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Stefano Boros","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Alberto Mateo Urdiales","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Valentina Marziano","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Maria Cristina Rota","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Antonietta Filia","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Fortunato (Paolo) D'Ancona","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Andrea Siddu","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Ornella Punzo","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Filippo Trentini","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Guzzetta","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Piero Poletti","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Paola Stefanelli","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Maria Rita Castrucci","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Ciervo","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Corrado Di Benedetto","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Marco Tallon","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Andrea Piccioli","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Silvio Brusaferro","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Rezza","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Stefano Merler","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Patrizio Pezzotti","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"COVID-19 working group","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.07.20055772","rel_title":"A Very Flat Peak: Exponential growth phase of COVID-19 is mostly followed by a prolonged linear growth phase, not an immediate saturation","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.07.20055772","rel_abs":"Innumerable variants of the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model predicted the course of COVID-19 infections for different countries, along with the peaks and the subsequent decline of infections. One thing these models could not have predicted prospectively in January or did not adapt to in the following months is that the peak is rather a plateau for many countries. For example, USA and UK have been persisting at the same high peak of approximately 30,000 and 5,000 daily new infections respectively, for more than a month. Other countries had shorter plateaus of about 3 weeks (6,400 cases in Spain). We establish that this plateau is not an artifact, and the persistence number describing the decline needs an equally important attention as the reproduction number. The solution lies in including the specific epidemiological role of asymptomatics and pre-symptomatics in COVID-19 transmission, different from SARS and influenza. We identify the minimal changes that can be made to any SEIR model to capture this plateau while studying seasonal effects, mitigation strategies, or the second wave of infections etc.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Santosh Ansumali","author_inst":"Jawaharlal Nehru Center for Advanced Scientific Research"},{"author_name":"Meher K Prakash","author_inst":"Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research"},{"author_name":"Xanthi Andrianou","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita; Cyprus University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Antonino Bella","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Martina Del Manso","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Massimo Fabiani","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Stefania Bellino","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Stefano Boros","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Alberto Mateo Urdiales","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Valentina Marziano","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Maria Cristina Rota","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Antonietta Filia","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Fortunato (Paolo) D'Ancona","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Andrea Siddu","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Ornella Punzo","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Filippo Trentini","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Guzzetta","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Piero Poletti","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Paola Stefanelli","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Maria Rita Castrucci","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Ciervo","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Corrado Di Benedetto","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Marco Tallon","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Andrea Piccioli","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Silvio Brusaferro","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Rezza","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Stefano Merler","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Patrizio Pezzotti","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"COVID-19 working group","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"}]}
