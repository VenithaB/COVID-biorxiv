Whether the transmissibility and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 is actively evolving, and driven by adaptation to the new host and environments is still unknown. Understanding the evolutionary mechanism underlying epidemiological and pathological characteristics of COVID-19 is essential for predicting the epidemic trend, and providing guidance for disease control and treatments. Interrogating 22,078 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences of 84 countries, we demonstrate with convincing evidence that (i) SARS-CoV-2 genomes are overall conserved under purifying selection. (ii) Ongoing positive selection is actively driving the evolution of specific genes. Notably, genes related to coronavirus infection and host immune system defense are under adaptive evolution while genes related to viral RNA replication, transcription and translation are under purifying selection. A spatial and temporal landscape of 54 critical mutants is constructed based on their divergence among viral haplotype clusters, of which multiple mutants potentially conferring viral transmissibility, infectivity and virulence of SARS-CoV-2 are highlighted.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qi Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Genomics, CAS"},{"author_name":"Shilei Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Genomics, CAS"},{"author_name":"Yali Hou","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Genomics, CAS"},{"author_name":"Wenmin Zhao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Genomics, CAS"},{"author_name":"Yimin Bao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Genomics, CAS"},{"author_name":"Yongbiao Xue","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Genomics, CAS"},{"author_name":"Hua Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Genomics"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.07.20189597","rel_title":"COVID-19 control across urban-rural gradients","rel_date":"2020-09-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.07.20189597","rel_abs":"Controlling the regional re-emergence of SARS-CoV-2 after its initial spread in ever-changing personal contact networks and disease landscapes is a challenging task. In a landscape context, contact opportunities within and between populations are changing rapidly as lockdown measures are relaxed and a number of social activities re-activated. Using an individual-based metapopulation model, we explored the efficacy of different control strategies across an urban-rural gradient in Wales, UK. Our model shows that isolation of symptomatic cases, or regional lockdowns in response to local outbreaks, have limited efficacy unless the overall transmission rate is kept persistently low. Additional isolation of non-symptomatic infected individuals, who may be detected by effective test and trace strategies, is pivotal to reduce the overall epidemic size over a wider range of transmission scenarios. We define an urban-rural gradient in epidemic size as a correlation between regional epidemic size and connectivity within the region, with more highly connected urban populations experiencing relatively larger outbreaks. For interventions focused on regional lockdowns, the strength of such gradients in epidemic size increased with higher travel frequencies, indicating a reduced efficacy of the control measure in the urban regions under these conditions. When both non-symptomatic and symptomatic individuals are isolated or regional lockdown strategies are enforced, we further found the strongest urban-rural epidemic gradients at high transmission rates. This effect was reversed for strategies targeted at symptomatics only. Our results emphasise the importance of test-and-tracing strategies and maintaining low transmission rates for efficiently controlling COVID19 spread, both at landscape scale and in urban areas.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Konstans Wells","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Miguel Lurgi","author_inst":"Swansea University"},{"author_name":"Brendan Collins","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Policy, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3GB, UK"},{"author_name":"Biagio Lucini","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, Swansea University, Swansea SA2 8PP, Wales, UK"},{"author_name":"Rowland Raymond Kao","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Alun L.

Available resource dynamics is governed by the well-known logistic growth model, in which the reproduction coefficient depends on the disease outbreak spreading dynamics. We further investigate the feedback interaction of the disease spread dynamics and resource growth dynamics with the premise that the quality of treatment depends on the current economic situation. The very inclusion of mortality rates and economic considerations in the same model may be incongruous under certain positions, but in this model, we take a 'realpolitik' approach by exploring all of these factors together as it is done in reality.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"S.

Methods: A public dataset of 1110 COVID-19 patients (1 CT\/patient) was used. Using CTs and clinical data, each patient was classified into mild, moderate, and severe by two observers: (1) dataset provider and (2) a board-certified radiologist. For each CT, 107 radiomic features were extracted. The dataset was randomly divided into a training (60%) and holdout validation (40%) set. During training, features were selected and combined into a logistic regression model for predicting severe cases from mild and moderate cases. The models were trained and validated on the classifications by both observers. AUC quantified the predictive power of models. To determine model robustness, the trained models was cross-validated on the inter-observer classifications. Results: A single feature alone was sufficient to predict mild from severe COVID-19 with AUC_valid^provider=0.85 and AUC_valid^radiologist=0.74 (p<<0.01). The most predictive features were the distribution of small size-zones (GLSZM-SmallAreaEmphasis) for provider classification and linear dependency of neighboring voxels (GLCM-Correlation) for radiologist classification. Cross-validation showed that both AUC_valid^ {approx}0.80 (p<<0.01). In predicting moderate from severe COVID-19, first-order-Median alone had sufficient predictive power of AUC_valid^provider=0.65 (p=0.01). For radiologist classification, the predictive power of the model increased to AUC_valid^radiologist=0.66 (p<<0.01) as the number of features grew from 1 to 5. Cross-validation yielded AUC_valid^radiologist=0.63 (p=0.002) and AUC_valid^provider=0.60 (p=0.09). Conclusions: Radiomics significantly predicted different levels of COVID-19 severity. The prediction was moderately sensitive to inter-observer classifications, and thus need to be used with caution.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stephen S.F.

When the COVID-19 pandemic let to closure of medical schools in these countries, the Bhutanese medical students were repatriated in March-April 2020. Upon return, they were kept in government-sponsored facility quarantine for 21 days. This study assessed their knowledge on COVID-19 as a part of self-learning and attitude as part of preparedness towards participation in government's health response to COVID-19. Method: This was a cross-sectional study among medical students who had returned to the country. This survey was conducted through an online questionnaire while the students were in 21-day facility quarantine. The sample size calculated was 129 and a convenient sampling was used. Knowledge was assessed using 20 questions, each scored 1\/20. Cumulative score of score of >=80% was categorized as \"good knowledge\", score of >=60-79% was considered \"satisfactory knowledge\", and score <60% was considered \"poor knowledge.\" Correlation between knowledge score and duration of clinical clerkship was tested using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Attitude of students towards their willingness to participate in the national COVID-19 response were tested using rating scales. Data were analysed using Stata 13.1. Results: 120 medical students responded to this survey (response rate = 93%). Eighty-eight (74%) had good knowledge, 28 (23%) had satisfactory knowledge and only four (3%) had poor knowledge on COVID-19. The students scored high on the symptomatology, mode of transmission, prevention and treatment options and on local epidemiology; and scored low on the forms of mechanical ventilations and on the home-management of non-critical cases. The knowledge score correlated with duration of clinical clerkship (r = 0.326, p = 0.001). The primary source of information were social media sites (102, 85%), television (94, 78%) and newspapers (76, 63%). The majority (78, 65%) were willing to participate in the government's COVID-19 response but could not identify what roles they could play. The fear of contracting COVID-19 was reported in only in 8.7%. Conclusions: The medical students had good knowledge on COVID-19 and were self-learned through social media, television and newspapers. The students held positive attitude towards participation in the government's COVID-19 response.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thinley Dorji","author_inst":"Jigme Dorji Wangchuck National Referral Hospital"},{"author_name":"Saran Tenzin Tamang","author_inst":"Faculty of Postgraduate Medicine, Khesar Gyalpo University of Medical Sciences of Bhutan, Thimphu"},{"author_name":"TVSVGK Tilak","author_inst":"Armed Forces Medical College, Maharashtra University of Health Sciences, India"},{"author_name":"John Kim","author_inst":"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor"},{"author_name":"Andrej Studen","author_inst":"University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia"},{"author_name":"Luciano Rivetti","author_inst":"FUESMEN-FADESA, Mendoza, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Robert Jeraj","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin, Madison"},{"author_name":"Mike B.

Using quantitative methods, we examined the advance of published research on ten of the vaccine technologies incorporated in the 165 candidate vaccines entering development through July 2020 as well as the NIH funding that supported this research. Live, attenuated virus, inactivated virus, and adjuvant technologies have been used in successful products since the 1950s and continue to exhibit steady advance. Synthetic (recombinant) vaccines, viral vectors, DNA, and TLR9 agonists as adjuvants emerged since the 1980s, and exhibit a logistic, \"S-curve\" pattern of growth characteristic of emerging technologies that have passed an analytically-defined established point. In contrast, mRNA, virus-like particle, and nanoparticle technologies show exponential growth characteristic of technologies short of their established points. The body of research and NIH funding for established and emerging vaccine technologies exhibited sustained growth through the late 2010s, supported by >16,000 thousand project years of NIH funding totaling over $17.2 billion (2000-2019), the majority through cooperative agreements and intramural programs. NIH funding for published research on vaccines for recognized zoonotic threats including coronavirus, Zika, Ebola, and dengue, however, has been inconsistent and reactive to disease outbreaks. These data are considered in the context of the high failure rate for candidate vaccines and evidence that technological maturity is a significant factor in the efficiency of product development. Sustained funding for both enabling technologies and vaccine development is essential to ensure a rapid response to COVID and future pandemic threats.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anthony E Kiszewski","author_inst":"Bentley University"},{"author_name":"Ekaterina I Galkina Cleary","author_inst":"Bentley University"},{"author_name":"Matthew J Jackson","author_inst":"Bentley University"},{"author_name":"Fred D Ledley","author_inst":"Bentley University"},{"author_name":"Andrej Studen","author_inst":"University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia"},{"author_name":"Luciano Rivetti","author_inst":"FUESMEN-FADESA, Mendoza, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Robert Jeraj","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin, Madison"},{"author_name":"Mike B.

Methods: We evaluated three LFAs (Alltest, One Step and SeroFlash), one ELISA (Dia.Pro) and two CLIAs (Elecsys and COV2T). To assess the specificity, 60 pre-pandemic sera were used. To evaluate the sensitivity, we used 80 serum samples from patients with positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Agreement between techniques was evaluated using the kappa score (k). Results: All immunoassays showed a specificity of 100% except for SeroFlash (96.7%). Overall sensitivity was 61.3%, 73.8%, 67.5%, 85.9%, 88.0% and 92.0% for Alltest, One Step, SeroFlash, Dia.Pro, Elecsys and COV2T, respectively.

We reviewed the current evidence on the air contamination with SARS-CoV-2 in hospital settings, and the factors associated to the contamination including the viral load and the particles size. Methods The MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science databases were systematically interrogated for original English-language articles detailing COVID-19 air contamination in hospital settings between 1 December 2019 and 21 July 2020. This study was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. The positivity rate of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA and culture were described and compared according to the setting, clinical context, air ventilation system, and distance from patient. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in copies per m3 of air were pooled and their distribution were described by hospital areas. Particle sizes and SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in copies or TCID50 per m3 were analysed after categorization of sizes in <1 micrometers, 1-4 micrometers, and >4 micrometers. Results Among 2,034 records identified, 17 articles were included in the review. Overall, 27.5% (68\/247) of air sampled from close patients environment were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, without difference according to the setting (ICU: 27\/97, 27.8%; non-ICU: 41\/150, 27.3%; p=0.93), the distance from patients (<1 meter: 1\/64, 1.5%; 1-5 meters: 4\/67, 6%; p=0.4). In other areas, the positivity rate was 23.8% (5\/21) in toilets, 9.5% (20\/221) in clinical areas, 12.4% (15\/121) in staff areas, and 34.1% (14\/41) in public areas. A total of 78 viral cultures were performed in three studies, and 3 (4%) were positive, all from close patients environment. The median SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations varied from 1.103 copies per m3 (IQR: 0.4.103-9.103) in clinical areas to 9.7.103 (5.1.103-14.3.103) in the air of toilets or bathrooms. The protective equipment removal and patients rooms had high concentrations\/titre of SARS-CoV-2 with aerosol size distributions that showed peaks in the <1 micrometers region, and staff offices in the >4 micrometers region. Conclusion In hospital, the air near and away from COVID-19 patients is frequently contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 RNA, with however, rare proofs of their viability. High viral loads found in toilet\/bathrooms, staff and public hallways suggests to carefully consider these areas.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"GABRIEL BIRGAND","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Nathan PEIFFER-SMADJA","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Sandra Fournier","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Solen Kerneis","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Francois Xavier Lescure","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Jean-Christophe Lucet","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Rosa Gonzalez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Principe de Asturias"},{"author_name":"Juan Cuadros-Gonzalez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Principe de Asturias"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.07.20180448","rel_title":"EARLY VIRAL CLEARANCE AMONG COVID-19 PATIENTS WHEN GARGLING WITH POVIDONE-IODINE AND ESSENTIAL OILS: A PILOT CLINICAL TRIAL","rel_date":"2020-09-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.07.20180448","rel_abs":"Background: Gargling had been reported to have significant roles in the prevention and treatment of respiratory tract infections.

To investigate whether abnormal fibrinolysis is a culprit or protector or both, we associated elevated plasma D-dimer with clinical variables to identify a panoramic view of the derangements of fibrinolysis that contribute to the pathogenesis of COVID-19 based on studies available in the literature. Methods We performed this systematic review based on both meta-analysis and meta-regression to compute the correlation of D-dimer at admission with clinical features of COVID-19 patients in retrospective studies or case series. We searched the databases until Aug 18, 2020, with no limitations by language. The first hits were screened, data extracted, and analyzed in duplicate. We did the random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regressions (both univariate and multivariate). D-dimer associated clinical variables and potential mechanisms were schematically reasoned and graphed. Findings Our search identified 42 observational, or retrospective, or case series from six countries (n=14,862 patients) with all races and ages from 1 to 98-year-old. The weighted mean difference of D-dimer was 0.97 g\/mL (95% CI 0.65, 1.29) between relatively mild (or healthy control) and severely affected groups with significant publication bias. Univariate meta-regression identified 58 of 106 clinical variables were associated with plasma D-dimer levels, including 3 demographics, 5 comorbidies, 22 laboratory tests, 18 organ injury biomarkers, 8 severe complications, and 2 outcomes (discharge and death). Of these, 11 readouts were negatively associated with the level of plasma D-dimer. Further, age and gender were confounding factors for the identified D-dimer associated variables. There were 22 variables independently correlated with the D-dimer level, including respiratory rate, dyspnea plasma K+, glucose, SpO2, BUN, bilirubin, ALT, AST, systolic blood pressure, and CK. We thus propose that \"insufficient hyperfibrinolysis (fibrinolysis is accelerated but unable to prevent adverse clinical impact for clinical deterioration COVID-19)\" as a peculiar mechanism. Interpretation The findings of this meta-analysis- and meta-regression-based systematic review supports elevated D-dimer as an independent predictor for mortality and severe complications. D-dimer-associated clinical variables draw a landscape integrating the aggregate effects of systemically suppressive and locally (i.e., in the lung) hyperactive derangements of fibrinolysis. D-dimer and associated clinical biomarkers and conceptually parameters could be combined for risk stratification, potentially for tracking thrombolytic therapy or alternative interventions.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hong-Long J Ji","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler"},{"author_name":"Zhenlei Su","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Xinxiang Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Runzhen Zhao","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler"},{"author_name":"Andrey A Komissarov","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler"},{"author_name":"Guohua Yi","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler"},{"author_name":"Shan-Lu Liu","author_inst":"The Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Steven Idell","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler"},{"author_name":"Michael A Matthay","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"NAJMA KORI","author_inst":"UNIVERSITI KEBANGSAAN MALAYSIA"},{"author_name":"PETRICK PERIYASAMY","author_inst":"UNIVERSITI KEBANGSAAN MALAYSIA"},{"author_name":"NOR AZIZAN ZAKARIA","author_inst":"UNIVERSITI KEBANGSAAN MALAYSIA"},{"author_name":"AGNI NHIRMAL KUMAR SUGUMAR","author_inst":"UNIVERSITI KEBANGSAAN MALAYSIA"},{"author_name":"NUR EZZATY MOHAMMAD KAZMIN","author_inst":"UNIVERSITI SAINS ISLAM MALAYSIA"},{"author_name":"XIONG KHEE CHEONG","author_inst":"UNIVERSITI KEBANGSAAN MALAYSIA"},{"author_name":"SITI MARIYAM SANIMAN","author_inst":"UNIVERSITI KEBANGSAAN MALAYSIA"},{"author_name":"ILINA ISAHAK","author_inst":"UNIVERSITI SAINS ISLAM MALAYSIA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.07.20190066","rel_title":"Understanding SARSCOV-2 propagation, impacting factors to derive possible scenarios and simulations","rel_date":"2020-09-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.07.20190066","rel_abs":"We aimed to analyze factors impacting the Covid-19 epidemic on a macro level, comparing multiple countries across the world and verifying the occurrence at a micro level through cluster analysis. The severity of the epidemic was most strongly related to exposure to ultraviolet light and extrapolated levels of vitamin D and to the health of the population, especially with regards to obesity. We found no county with an obesity level < 8% with a severe epidemic. We also found that countries where the population benefited from sun exposure or vitamin D supplementation and spent time outside fared well. Factors related to increased propagation of the virus included the use of heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), population density, poorly aerated gatherings, relative humidity, timely policies of closing clustering places until aeration was improved, and daily amount of ridership on public transportation, especially subways. Population lockdowns, masks, and blood type did not provide much explanatory power. Contact tracing was not analyzed as very few countries applied it for long enough. The excess mortality observed is within the ranges of severe past influenza epidemics of 2016\/2017 or 1999\/2000 and lower than older severe influenza epidemics of the 1940s or 1970s. We estimated that COVID mortality death counts in European countries is over estimated when taking into account excess mortality further confirming the important role of comorbidities independently of lockdown policy. A few countries observed an under-mortality despite of some deaths counts attributed to COVID-19. Treatments or vaccines should protect the fraction of the population that is not suffering from severe comorbidities. Our study suggested that prevention measures should be directed to improving aeration systems, enhancing diets and exercise, and ensuring adequate levels of vitamin D. Prevention measures and attention should be paid to anxiety resulting from this episode which may be associated with increases in obesity, addictions, vitamin D deficiency, depression, suicide, and hunger ultimately weakening population resiliency.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lewis E.

Smell loss has been associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, but it is unknown whether monitoring for smell loss can be used to identify asymptomatic infection among high risk individuals, like HCW. Methods: We performed a prospective cohort study, tracking 473 HCW across three months to determine if smell loss could predict SARS-CoV-2 infection in this high-risk group. HCW subjects completed a longitudinal, novel behavioral at-home assessment of smell function with household items, as well as detailed symptom surveys that included a parosmia screening questionnaire, and RT-qPCR testing to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: SARS-CoV-2 was identified in 17 (3.6%) of 473 HCW. Among the 17 infected HCW, 53% reported smell loss, and were more likely to report smell loss than COVID-negative HCW on both the at-home assessment and the screening questionnaire (P < .01). 67% reported smell loss prior to having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, and smell loss was reported a median of two days before testing positive. Neurological symptoms were reported more frequently among COVID-positive HCW who reported smell loss (P < .01). Conclusions: In this prospective study of HCW, self-reported changes in smell using two different measures were predictive of COVID-19 infection. Smell loss frequently preceded a positive test and was associated with neurological symptoms.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julian J Weiss","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tuki N Attuquayefio","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth B White","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Fangyong Li","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Rachel S Herz","author_inst":"Alpert Medical School of Brown University"},{"author_name":"Theresa L White","author_inst":"Le Moyne College, SUNY Upstate Medical University"},{"author_name":"Melissa Campbell","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bertie Geng","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rupak Datta","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Anne L Wyllie","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Nathan D Grubaugh","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Arnau Casanovas-Massana","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"M Catherine Muenker","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Ryan Handoko","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Akiko Iwasaki","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"- The Yale IMPACT Research Team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Richard A Martinello","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Albert I Ko","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Dana M Small","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Shelli F Farhadian","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.09.20190389","rel_title":"Passive, open access data measures movement and predicts COVID-19 cases","rel_date":"2020-09-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.09.20190389","rel_abs":"Background. In the months following the global spread of SARS-CoV-2, the lack of effective pharmaceutical interventions led to widespread implementation of behavioral interventions aimed at reducing contacts and transmission. In the US, state and local governments introduced and enforced the bulk of interventions, including university closures. As universities closed, student departures decreased the total population size of college towns while state-level interventions decreased contacts among remaining residents. Though the pandemic continues without pharmaceutical interventions, businesses have begun to reopen, and many universities have resumed operations. These actions have increased contacts and population sizes in college towns. Monitoring movement to implement adaptive policies will be critical for outbreak management. Methods. We use publicly available remotely-sensed nighttime lights and traffic cameras to measure the impact of restriction policies on movement and activities in the university town of State College, and the surrounding areas of Centre County, Pennsylvania, USA. Results. At the county level, nighttime radiance did not differ significantly across restriction phases and largely reflected seasonal fluctuations seen in previous years. Throughout the county, traffic volumes were lowest during the most severe period of restrictions ('Red phase' in Pennsylvania). As restrictions eased, traffic volumes grew, indicating increased movement within and between population centers. We show that real-time, publicly available traffic data captured behavioral responses and compliance to different restrictions phases. We also demonstrate that these increases in activity levels precede increases in reported COVID-19 cases. Conclusion. Passively collected data can measure population-level movement in response to restrictions and changes in these measured movements are reflected in observed SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Measuring these changes in movements and contacts in near real time can inform local adaptive interventions to curtail outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christina L.

We developed a population-based model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, combined with mortality incidence data in four European countries, to test a range of assumptions about the impact of influenza. We found consistent evidence for a 2-2.5-fold population-level increase in SARS-CoV-2 transmission associated with influenza during the period of co-circulation.

Data were collected from a self-administered questionnaire and a blood sample for antibody identification. The COVIDAR IgG and IgM test were used. RESULTS: 738 health workers were included; the overall response rate was 73.80%. 71.83% of that were women; age showed a normal distribution. Nurses and doctors accounted for more than half of the staff. 75.86% of people claimed to always use Personal Protective Equipment. 5.61% of people had close contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19. 4.60% of people had previously had a nasopharyngeal swab with a negative result. Five workers had positive IgG for SARS-CoV-2 (four women and one man) with negative IgM. The mean age of the cases was 35 years old; two of them were asymptomatic; neither of them had a swab sample taken. The overall seroprevalence was 0.75%, with no significant differences between strata.

To explore risk factors associated with COVID-19 susceptibility and survival in this patient group, we conducted a single-centre retrospective cohort study. Design We interrogated linked electronic health records for patients diagnosed with HPB diseases in East London since 2008 (n=15 586), and identified 212 confirmed COVID-19 cases between February 12 and June 12, 2020. We conducted risk analyses to identify the effect of demographics, comorbidities and associated medication use, and lifestyle factors and with appropriate adjustment for gender, ethnicity, age group and HPB diagnoses on COVID-19 incidence and mortality. Results We observed an increased risk of COVID-19 for men (Relative Risk, RR=1.59; 95% CI 1.21 to 2.09) and Black ethnicity (RR=2.2; 95% CI 1.5 to 3.18). Substance mis-users were at more risk of infection, so were patients on Vitamin D treatment. The higher risks associated with South Asian ethnicity, patients with pre-existing non-malignant pancreatic or liver conditions, age>70, and past smokers were due to co-existing comorbidities; surprisingly current smokers were associated with a lower risk. Increased mortality risk was observed for Black ethnicity (RR=2.4; 95% CI 1.35 to 3.48), and patients with a pre-existing kidney condition (RR=2.13; 95% CI 1.16 to 3.55) - particularly when accompanied with an acute episode of renal complications (RR=2.74; 95% CI 1.32 to 5.13). Conclusions This large multi-ethnic population-based study of HPB patients shows a higher risk of acquiring COVID-19 for male gender, Black ethnicity, medical co-morbidities, and substance mis-users. Particular attention should be paid to patients with a pre-existing kidney disease for further renal insult to prevent fatality.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abu Z M Dayem Ullah","author_inst":"Barts Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Lavanya Sivapalan","author_inst":"Barts Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Claude Chelala","author_inst":"Barts Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Hemant M Kocher","author_inst":"Barts Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"ANDREA GAMARNIK","author_inst":"FUNDACION INSTITUTO LELOIR"},{"author_name":"Gaston Vargas","author_inst":"Sanitary Region VIII, Mar del Plata, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Marina Pifano","author_inst":"Ministry of Health of Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Teresa Varela","author_inst":"Ministry of Health of Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Enio Garcia","author_inst":"Ministry of Health of Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Alicia Lawrynowicz","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Epidemiologia \"Dr. Juan H Jara\" (Administracion Nacional de Laboratorios e Institutos de Salud -ANLIS-), Mar del Plata, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Osvaldo Uez","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Epidemiologia \"Dr. Juan H Jara\" (Administracion Nacional de Laboratorios e Institutos de Salud -ANLIS-), Mar del Plata, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Irene Pagano","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Epidemiologia \"Dr. Juan H Jara\" (Administracion Nacional de Laboratorios e Institutos de Salud -ANLIS-), Mar del Plata, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Anastasija Caica","author_inst":"Centrala Laboratorija, Ltd, Sarlotes 1B, Riga, Latvia, LV-1001"},{"author_name":"Mikus Gavars","author_inst":"E.

The purpose of this study was to assess the psychological and lifestyle impact of the pandemic on Australian adolescents, using an online survey, administered during and after the peak of the outbreak (June-July 2020). Method: Self-report surveys were administered online to a sample of 760 Australian adolescents aged 12-18 years old. Surveys assessed worry about contracting COVID-19, behavioral change in response to the pandemic, impact on education, peer and family relationships, lifestyle factors including exercise, technology use and sleep, as well as mental health outcomes including psychological distress, loneliness, health anxiety and wellbeing. Results: Overall, young people expressed significant concern and worry about contracting the virus, and most (>85%) engaged in behaviors to reduce the risk of transmission. Three quarters of the sample reported a worsening of their mental health since the pandemic began, with negative impacts reported by most respondents on learning, friendships and family relationships. More than 40% of young people reported a decrease in exercise and 70% reported an increase in technology use since the outbreak. There were high levels of uncertainty about the future reported by respondents, and their scores on validated measures indicated higher levels of sleep disturbance, psychological distress and health anxiety, and lower levels of wellbeing, relative to normative samples. Reponses on the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale indicated that 48.3% of the sample were experiencing distress consistent with a probable mental illness, which is much higher than pre-pandemic prevalence rates. Effects on mental health were worse among those who reported a previous diagnosis of depression and\/or anxiety relative to those without a history of depression and\/or anxiety. Conclusion: These results indicate high levels of disruption and psychological distress experienced by adolescents during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Adolescents are already vulnerable to the onset of mental illness at this developmental stage, and the current research underscores the need to find rapid and accessible ways to support adolescent mental health during times of crisis. There is a need for longitudinal research to evaluate the enduring effects of the pandemic on adolescents.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sophie Li","author_inst":"Black Dog Institute, UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Joanne Beames","author_inst":"Black Dog Institute, UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Jill Newby","author_inst":"Black Dog Institute & School of Psychology, UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Kate Maston","author_inst":"Black Dog Institute, UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Helen Christensen","author_inst":"Black Dog Institute, UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Aliza Werner-Seidler","author_inst":"Black Dog Institute, UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Marina Pifano","author_inst":"Ministry of Health of Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Teresa Varela","author_inst":"Ministry of Health of Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Enio Garcia","author_inst":"Ministry of Health of Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Alicia Lawrynowicz","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Epidemiologia \"Dr. Juan H Jara\" (Administracion Nacional de Laboratorios e Institutos de Salud -ANLIS-), Mar del Plata, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Osvaldo Uez","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Epidemiologia \"Dr. Juan H Jara\" (Administracion Nacional de Laboratorios e Institutos de Salud -ANLIS-), Mar del Plata, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Irene Pagano","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Epidemiologia \"Dr. Juan H Jara\" (Administracion Nacional de Laboratorios e Institutos de Salud -ANLIS-), Mar del Plata, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Anastasija Caica","author_inst":"Centrala Laboratorija, Ltd, Sarlotes 1B, Riga, Latvia, LV-1001"},{"author_name":"Mikus Gavars","author_inst":"E.

However, recent US polls indicate a concerning level of hesitancy that will likely lead to suboptimal uptake if such a vaccine becomes available. This study investigated demographic differences regarding US adults' intent, uncertainty, and refusal to receive a potential coronavirus vaccine and specific reasons for intention to receive it. Methods and findings: Multivariable analysis of Associated Press (AP)-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research cross-sectional survey data collected in May 2020 from a US nationally representative panel of adults (n=1000). Respondents were asked if they would receive a coronavirus vaccine (yes, unsure, no). Among those answering yes, the specific reasons were: to protect self, family, and community; chronic health condition; and having a doctor who recommends vaccines. Multinomial logistic regression models indicated numerous subgroup differences between participants who indicating (1) uncertainty versus refusal, (2) intent versus refusal, and (3) intent versus uncertainty, with the highest number of significant differences observed in the third comparison. Overall, higher likelihood of intention to receive the vaccine versus uncertainty and refusal were mostly observed among respondents with a college education or greater, White, non-Hispanic racial-ethnic identity, ages 60 or older, and more liberal (versus conservative) ideology. Despite variation in endorsement across the five reasons for wanting to receive the vaccine, subgroup differences were fairly consistent across these specific reasons when comparing respondents endorsing such intentions versus, respectively, refusal and uncertainty in separate analyses. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the approval of a vaccine will potentially face problems with overall uptake due to uncertainty or refusal and contribute to creating significant demographic disparities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality risk. Ongoing assessment of such attitudes are needed as Phase III trials proceed, but the findings highlight need for measuring uncertainty and its underlying reasons, as well as multiple types of education and outreach efforts for those who are uncertain as well as avoidant.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Richard M.

We model the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in the city during the pandemic and estimate the effectiveness of public health interventions (overall and for each major intervention separately) for the entire population and by age group. We estimate that the overall effective reproductive number was 2.99 at the beginning of the pandemic wave and reduced to 0.93 one week after the stay-at-home mandate. Most age groups experienced similar reductions in transmission. Interventions reducing contact rates were associated with a 70.7% (95% CI: 65.0 - 76.4%) reduction of transmission overall and >50% for all age groups during the pandemic. Face covering was associated with a 6.6% (95% CI: 0.8 - 12.4%) reduction of transmission overall and up to 20% for 65+ year-olds during the first month of implementation. Accounting for the amount of time masks are in use (i.e. mainly outside homes), these findings indicate universal masking could reduce transmission by up to 28-32% when lockdown-like measures are lifted, if the high effectiveness estimated for older adults were achieved for all ages. These estimates are verified by out-of-fit projections and support the need for implementing multiple interventions simultaneously in order to effectively mitigate the spread of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wan Yang","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Jaimie Shaff","author_inst":"New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Shaman","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Kate Maston","author_inst":"Black Dog Institute, UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Helen Christensen","author_inst":"Black Dog Institute, UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Aliza Werner-Seidler","author_inst":"Black Dog Institute, UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Marina Pifano","author_inst":"Ministry of Health of Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Teresa Varela","author_inst":"Ministry of Health of Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Enio Garcia","author_inst":"Ministry of Health of Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Alicia Lawrynowicz","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Epidemiologia \"Dr. Juan H Jara\" (Administracion Nacional de Laboratorios e Institutos de Salud -ANLIS-), Mar del Plata, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Osvaldo Uez","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Epidemiologia \"Dr. Juan H Jara\" (Administracion Nacional de Laboratorios e Institutos de Salud -ANLIS-), Mar del Plata, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Irene Pagano","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Epidemiologia \"Dr. Juan H Jara\" (Administracion Nacional de Laboratorios e Institutos de Salud -ANLIS-), Mar del Plata, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Anastasija Caica","author_inst":"Centrala Laboratorija, Ltd, Sarlotes 1B, Riga, Latvia, LV-1001"},{"author_name":"Mikus Gavars","author_inst":"E.

We expect that the ensuing reduction in social contacts led to increased loneliness among older adults (60+). Methods: We conducted three analyses to assess the association between COVID-19 public health restriction measures and loneliness: (1) A comparison between pre-pandemic (SHARE: 2013-2017) and pandemic (May 2020) levels of loneliness (UCLA-3 scale), (2) an analysis of the correlation between being affected by COVID-19 restriction measures and loneliness based on cross-sectional survey data from early May 2020, and (3) a longitudinal analysis of weekly changes in loneliness (Corona panel data) from late March to early June 2020. Results: We found (1) loneliness levels to have increased in 2020 in comparison with previous years, (2) an association between the number of restriction measures older adults reported to be affected from and loneliness, and (3) that loneliness was higher during shut-down compared to the subsequent re-opening phase, particularly among those who live alone. Discussion: Our results provide evidence that COVID-19 restriction measures in Austria have indeed resulted in increased levels of loneliness among older adults. However, these effects seem to be short-lived, and thus we do not expect strong negative consequences for older adults mental health downstream. Nonetheless, effects of longer and\/or repeated future restriction measures aiming at social distancing should be closely monitored.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Erwin Stolz","author_inst":"Medical University of Graz"},{"author_name":"Hannes Mayerl","author_inst":"Medical University of Graz"},{"author_name":"Wolfgang Freidl","author_inst":"Medical University of Graz"},{"author_name":"Ruth Moir","author_inst":"Epidemiology and Risk Policy Advice, Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), UK"},{"author_name":"Louise Kelly","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK"},{"author_name":"Emma Snary","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiological Sciences, Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), UK"},{"author_name":"Marina Pifano","author_inst":"Ministry of Health of Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Teresa Varela","author_inst":"Ministry of Health of Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Enio Garcia","author_inst":"Ministry of Health of Buenos Aires, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Alicia Lawrynowicz","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Epidemiologia \"Dr. Juan H Jara\" (Administracion Nacional de Laboratorios e Institutos de Salud -ANLIS-), Mar del Plata, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Osvaldo Uez","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Epidemiologia \"Dr. Juan H Jara\" (Administracion Nacional de Laboratorios e Institutos de Salud -ANLIS-), Mar del Plata, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Irene Pagano","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Epidemiologia \"Dr. Juan H Jara\" (Administracion Nacional de Laboratorios e Institutos de Salud -ANLIS-), Mar del Plata, Argentina"},{"author_name":"Anastasija Caica","author_inst":"Centrala Laboratorija, Ltd, Sarlotes 1B, Riga, Latvia, LV-1001"},{"author_name":"Mikus Gavars","author_inst":"E.

In the present study we apply a mathematical growth model, known as the generalized Richards model, to describe the time evolution of the cumulative number of COVID-19 related preprints. This mathematical approach allows us to infer several important aspects concerning the underlying growth dynamics, such as its current stage and its possible evolution in the near future. We also analyze the rank-frequency distribution of preprints servers, ordered by the number of COVID-19 preprints they host, and find that it follows a power-law decay.

The objective of this paper was to determine the initial impact of COVID-19 pandemic on reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health (RMNCAH) services in Kenya. Methods: Data for the first four months (March-June) of the pandemic and the equivalent period in 2019 were extracted from Kenya Health Information System. Two-sample test of proportions for hospital attendance for select RMNCAH services between the two periods were computed. Results: There were no differences in monthly mean ({+\/-}SD) attendance between March-June 2019 vs 2020 for antenatal care (400,191.2{+\/-}12,700.0 vs 384,697.3{+\/-}20,838.6), hospital births (98,713.0{+\/-}4,117.0 vs 99,634.5{+\/-}3,215.5), family planning attendance (431,930.5{+\/-}19,059.9 vs 448,168.3{+\/-}31,559.8), post-abortion care (3,206.5{+\/-}111.7 vs 448,168.3{+\/-}31,559.8) and pentavalent 1 immunisation (114,701.0{+\/-}3,701.1 vs 110,915.8{+\/-}7,209.4), p>0.05. However, there were increasing trends for adolescent pregnancy rate, significant increases in FP utilization among young people (25.7% to 27.0%), injectable (short-term) FP method uptake (58.2% to 62.3%), caesarean section rate (14.6% to 15.8%), adolescent maternal deaths (6.2% to 10.9%) and fresh stillbirths (0.9% to 1.0%) with a reduction in implants (long-term) uptake (16.5% to 13.0%) (p<0.05). No significant change in maternal mortality ratio between the two periods (96.6 vs 105.8\/100,000 live births, p=0.1023) although the trend was increasing. Conclusion: COVID-19 may have contributed to increased adolescent pregnancy, adolescent maternal death and stillbirth rates in Kenya. If this trend persists, recent gains achieved in maternal and perinatal health in Kenya will be lost. With uncertainty around the duration of the pandemic, strategies to mitigate against catastrophic indirect maternal health outcomes are urgently needed.

Monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSC) are T cell suppressors that expand in inflammatory conditions, but their role in acute respiratory infections remains unclear. We studied blood and airways of COVID-19 patients across disease severity at multiple timepoints. M-MDSC frequencies were elevated in blood but not in nasopharyngeal or endotracheal aspirates of COVID-19 patients compared to controls. M-MDSCs isolated from COVID-19 patients suppressed T cell proliferation and IFN{gamma} production partly via an arginase-1 (Arg-1) dependent mechanism. Furthermore, patients showed increased Arg-1 and IL-6 plasma levels. COVID-19 patients had fewer T cells, and displayed downregulated expression of the CD3{zeta} chain. Ordinal regression showed that early M-MDSC frequency predicted subsequent disease severity. In conclusion, M-MDSCs expand in blood of COVID-19 patients, suppress T cells and strongly associate with disease severity, suggesting a role for M-MDSCs in the dysregulated COVID-19 immune response.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sara Falck-Jones","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Sindhu Vangeti","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Meng Yu","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Ryan Falck-Jones","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Alberto Cagigi","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Isabella Badolati","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Bjorn Osterberg","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Maximilian Julius Lautenbach","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Eric Ahlberg","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Ang Lin","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Inga Szurgot","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Klara Lenart","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Fredrika Hellgren","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Jorgen Salde","author_inst":"Health Care Services Stockholm County (SLSO)"},{"author_name":"Jan Albert","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Niclas Johansson","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Max Bell","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Karin Lore","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Anna Farnert","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Anna Smed-Sorensen","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.07.20189415","rel_title":"Blood neurofilament light concentration at admittance: a potential prognostic marker in COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-09-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.07.20189415","rel_abs":"Objective To test the hypotheses that serum concentrations of neurofilament light chain protein (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAp) can serve as biomarkers for disease severity in COVID-19 patients. Methods Forty-seven inpatients with confirmed COVID-19 had blood samples drawn on admission for assessing serum biomarkers of CNS injury by Single molecule array (Simoa), NfL and GFAp. Concentrations of NfL and GFAp were analyzed in relation to symptoms, clinical signs, inflammatory biomarkers and clinical outcomes. We used multivariate linear models to test for differences in biomarker concentrations in the subgroups, accounting for confounding effects. Results In total, 21 % (n=10) of the patients were admitted to an intensive care unit, whereas the overall mortality rate was 13 % (n=6). Non-survivors had higher serum concentrations of NfL (p<0.001) than patients who were discharged alive both in adjusted analyses (p=2.6 x 10-7) and unadjusted analyses (p=0.001). The concentrations of NfL in non-survivors increased over repeated measurements whereas the concentrations in survivors were stable. Significantly higher concentrations of NfL were found in patients reporting fatigue, while reduced concentrations were found in patients experiencing cough, myalgia and joint pain. The GFAp concentration was also significantly higher in non-survivors than survivors (p=0.02). Conclusion Increased concentrations of NfL and GFAp in COVID-19 patients on admission may indicate increased mortality risk. Measurement of blood biomarkers for nervous system injury can be useful to detect and monitor CNS injury in COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anne Hege Aamodt","author_inst":"Oslo University Hospital, Department of Neurology, Oslo, Norway"},{"author_name":"Einar August H\u00f8gest\u00f8l","author_inst":"Oslo University Hospital, Department of Neurology, Oslo, Norway"},{"author_name":"Trine Haug Popperud","author_inst":"Oslo University Hospital, Department of Neurology, Oslo, Norway"},{"author_name":"Jan Cato Holter","author_inst":"Oslo University Hospital, Department of Microbiology, Oslo, Norway"},{"author_name":"Anne Margarita Dyrhol-Riise","author_inst":"Oslo University Hospital Department of Infectious Diseases, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway"},{"author_name":"Kristian Tonby","author_inst":"Oslo University Hospital Department of Infectious Diseases, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway"},{"author_name":"Birgitte Stiksrud","author_inst":"Oslo University Hospital Department of Infectious Diseases, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway"},{"author_name":"Else Qvist-Paulsen","author_inst":"Oslo University Hospital, Department of Microbiology, Oslo, Norway"},{"author_name":"Tone Berge","author_inst":"Oslo Metropolitan University, Department of Mechanichal, Elerctronic and Chemical Engineering, Oslo, Norway"},{"author_name":"Andreas Barratt-Due","author_inst":"Oslo University Hospital, Division of Emergencies and Critical Care, Rikshospitalet, Oslo, Norway"},{"author_name":"P\u00e5l Aukrust","author_inst":"Oslo University Hospital, Department of Immunology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway"},{"author_name":"Lars Heggelund","author_inst":"Drammen Hospital, Department of Internal Medicine, Vestre Viken Hospital Trust, Drammen, Norway."},{"author_name":"Kaj Blennow","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience & Physiology, the Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, M\u00f6lndal, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Henrik Zetterberg","author_inst":"Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, M\u00f6lndal, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Hanne Flinstad Harbo","author_inst":"Oslo University Hospital, Department of Neurology, Oslo, Norway"},{"author_name":"Niclas Johansson","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Max Bell","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Karin Lore","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Anna Farnert","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Anna Smed-Sorensen","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.07.20190074","rel_title":"Clinical Outcomes of Critically Ill Patients with COVID-19 by Race","rel_date":"2020-09-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.07.20190074","rel_abs":"Background: Studies of COVID-19 have shown that African Americans have been affected by the virus at a higher rate compared to other races. This cohort study investigated comorbidities and clinical outcomes by race among COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit.

The study included all critically ill hospitalized patients between March 6, 2020 and May 5, 2020. Clinical outcomes during hospitalization included mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy and mortality stratified by race. Results Of 288 patients included (mean age, 63 +\/- 16 years; 45% female), 210 (73%) were African American. African Americans had significantly higher rates of comorbidities compared to other races, including hypertension (80% vs 59%, p=0.001), diabetes (49% vs 34%, p=0.026) and mean BMI (33 kg\/m2vs 28 kg\/m2, p<0.001).

Conclusion This racially diverse series of critically ill COVID-19 patients shows that despite higher rates of comorbidities at hospital admission in African Americans compared with other races, there was no significant difference in mortality.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fahad Marmarchi","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Michael Liu","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Srikant Rangaraju","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Sara C Auld","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Maria Christina Creel-Bulos","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Christine L Kempton","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Milad Sharifpour","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Manila Gaddh","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Roman Sniecinski","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Cheryl L Maier","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Fadi Nahab","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Lars Heggelund","author_inst":"Drammen Hospital, Department of Internal Medicine, Vestre Viken Hospital Trust, Drammen, Norway."},{"author_name":"Kaj Blennow","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience & Physiology, the Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, M\u00f6lndal, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Henrik Zetterberg","author_inst":"Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, M\u00f6lndal, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Hanne Flinstad Harbo","author_inst":"Oslo University Hospital, Department of Neurology, Oslo, Norway"},{"author_name":"Niclas Johansson","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Max Bell","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Karin Lore","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Anna Farnert","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Anna Smed-Sorensen","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.07.20190173","rel_title":"Functionalized TiO2 nanotube-based Electrochemical Biosensor for Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-09-09","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.07.20190173","rel_abs":"The COronaVIrus Disease (COVID-19) is a newly emerging viral disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Rapid increase in the number of COVID-19 cases worldwide led the WHO declare pandemic within a few month after the first case of infection. Due to the lack of a prophylactic measure to control the virus infection and spread, early diagnosis and quarantining of infected as well as the asymptomatic individuals are necessary for the containment of this pandemic. However, the current methods for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis are expensive and time consuming although some promising and inexpensive technologies are coming out for emergency use. In this work, we report the synthesis of a cheap yet highly sensitive cobalt-functionalized TiO2 nanotubes (Co-TNTs)-based electrochemical biosensor and its efficacy for rapid detection of spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 by examining S-RBD protein as the reference material. A simple, low-cost, and one-step electrochemical anodization route was used to synthesize TNTs, followed by an incipient wetting method for cobalt functionalization of the TNTs platform, which is connected to a potentiostat for data collection. This sensor specifically detected the S-RBD protein of SARS-CoV-2 even at very low concentration (range of 14 nM to 1400 nM). Additionally, our sensor showed a linear response in the detection of viral protein with concentration range. In summary, our Co-TNT sensor is highly effective in detecting SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD protein in approximately 30 seconds, which can be explored for developing a point of care diagnostics for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasal secretions and saliva samples.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bhaskar Sravan Vadlamani","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno"},{"author_name":"Timsy Uppal","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno"},{"author_name":"Subhash C Verma","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Manoranjan Misra","author_inst":"University of Nevada, Reno"},{"author_name":"Maria Christina Creel-Bulos","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Christine L Kempton","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Milad Sharifpour","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Manila Gaddh","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Roman Sniecinski","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Cheryl L Maier","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Fadi Nahab","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Lars Heggelund","author_inst":"Drammen Hospital, Department of Internal Medicine, Vestre Viken Hospital Trust, Drammen, Norway."},{"author_name":"Kaj Blennow","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience & Physiology, the Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, M\u00f6lndal, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Henrik Zetterberg","author_inst":"Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, M\u00f6lndal, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Hanne Flinstad Harbo","author_inst":"Oslo University Hospital, Department of Neurology, Oslo, Norway"},{"author_name":"Niclas Johansson","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Max Bell","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Karin Lore","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Anna Farnert","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Anna Smed-Sorensen","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"}]}
