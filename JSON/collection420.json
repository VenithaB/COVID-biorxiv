We assessed change in alcohol-use and hazardous drinking during the first lockdown, and tested the hypothesis that variation would be predicted by stress and inhibitory-control. Methods: We interrogated cross-sectional data from the first sweep of the COVID-19 longitudinal survey, comprising 4 national cohorts (13 453 respondents, 19-62 years). Respondents self-reported their alcohol use, stress, and inhibitory control. We regressed change in drinking and alcohol misuse on stress and inhibitory control, adjusting for covariates to account for demographics. Findings: 29.08% 30-year-olds increased alcohol use post-COVID-19. Stress was a major contributing factor to increased alcohol use in 30-year olds (adjusted OR 3.92, 95% CI 1.17 - 13.15), as was inhibitory control in 19-year-olds (adjusted OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.05 - 1.23), 30-year-olds (adjusted OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.05 - 1.33) and 50-year-olds (adjusted OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01 - 1.12). We identified several interactions between stress and inhibitory control in all age groups, suggesting a complex age-specific relationship between the risk factors and alcohol use and misuse during the pandemic. Interpretation: In the UK, alcohol use increased in up to 30% of the population during COVID-19, resulting from a combination of factors including poor inhibitory control and stress. It is critical in future lockdowns that clinicians and public health officials are aware of the challenges faced by different age groups, and prioritise and personalise interventions and prevention measures appropriately.

Due to limited availability of testing, only a non-random subset of the population can get tested. Hence, the reported test counts are subject to a large degree of selection bias. We consider an extension of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model under both selection bias and misclassification. We derive closed form expression for the basic reproduction number under such data anomalies using the next generation matrix method. We conduct extensive simulation studies to quantify the effect of misclassification and selection on the resultant estimation and prediction of future case counts. Finally we apply the methods to reported case-death-recovery count data from India, a nation with more than 5 million cases reported over the last seven months. We show that correcting for misclassification and selection can lead to more accurate prediction of case-counts (and death counts) using the observed data as a beta tester. The model also provides an estimate of undetected infections and thus an under-reporting factor. For India, the estimated under-reporting factor for cases is around 21 and for deaths is around 6.

However, there is very little research on the behaviours and behavioural barriers involved in getting tested, both in Australia and worldwide, despite there being some evidence that these barriers do exist. Methods: The Sydney Health Literacy Lab (SHeLL) has been conducting a national longitudinal survey in Australia since April 2020. A list of testing barriers was included in Wave 3 in June 2020 (n=1369), along with intentions to test and self-isolate if symptomatic. Open responses were also collected. The test barriers identified were categorised using the COM-B framework. Results: Only 49% of people strongly agreed they would get tested if they had COVID-19 symptoms, but most people agreed to some extent that they would get tested (96%). The most common barriers selected from the list provided were that testing is painful (11%), not knowing how to get tested (7%), and worry about getting infected at the testing centre (5%). Many participants (10%) indicated other reasons, and open responses included many additional barriers to testing than those provided in the initial list. These covered all components of the COM-B model. Conclusion: We identified a wide range of barriers using both quantitative and qualitative methods, which need to be addressed in order to increase COVID-19 testing behaviour.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carissa Bonner","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Carys Batcup","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Julie Ayre","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Kristen Pickles","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Rachael Dodd","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Tessa Copp","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Samuel Cornell","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Erin Cvejic","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Thomas Dakin","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Isautier","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Brooke Nickel","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Kirsten J McCaffery","author_inst":"University of Sydney"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.24.20201301","rel_title":"Psychological preparedness for pandemic (COVID-19) management: Perceptions of nurses and nursing students in India","rel_date":"2020-09-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.24.20201301","rel_abs":"Introduction: The growing COVID-19 pandemic has posed a great threat to millions of people worldwide. Nurses and nursing students are an important group of health professionals who are most likely to face many challenges in this unprecedented scenario. The present study aimed at exploring the perception of nurses and nursing students regarding psychological preparedness for the pandemic (COVID-19) management. Materials & Methods: The study employed a quantitative cross-sectional online survey research design. Purposive sampling was used with an attempt to represent the entire nurses (i.e. nursing officers, nurse administrators and nursing teachers) and nursing students group of India. The survey link was shared to their email ID and they were invited to participate in the study. Data were collected using Psychological Preparedness for Disaster Threat Scale (PPDTS)-Modified, General Self Efficacy (GSE) Scale, Optimism Scale and Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRS). Totally 685 responses were received and 676 forms were completed which were analyzed using SPSS software (version 24). Results: The mean age of the subjects was 31.72 (SD=9.58) years. Around 20% of the subjects previously had some kind of psychological training and 4% of the subjects had taken care of persons with COVID-19. Findings revealed that mean score for PPDTS, GSE, BRCS and Optimism was 73.44 (SD=10.82, 33.19 (SD=5.23), 16.79 (SD=2.73) and 9.61 (SD=2.26) respectively indicating that the subjects had moderate level of psychological preparedness, self-efficacy and resilience but higher level of optimism. Psychological preparedness, self-efficacy, optimism and resilience were positively correlated to each other. Self- efficacy, optimism, and resilience emerged as predictors of psychological preparedness. Conclusion: The findings suggested that self-efficacy, optimism and resilience can be considered as predictors for psychological preparedness in pandemic management. Appropriate training could influence self-efficacy while programs addressing resilience and coping may strengthen psychological preparedness which can help in further management of ongoing pandemic.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sailaxmi Gandhi","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences"},{"author_name":"Maya Sahu","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health & Neuro Sciences"},{"author_name":"Radhakrishnan Govindan","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences"},{"author_name":"Prasanthi Nattala","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences"},{"author_name":"Paulomi M Sudhir","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences"},{"author_name":"Rathi Balachandran","author_inst":"Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India"},{"author_name":"Samuel Cornell","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Erin Cvejic","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Thomas Dakin","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Isautier","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Brooke Nickel","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Kirsten J McCaffery","author_inst":"University of Sydney"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"nursing"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.24.20201228","rel_title":"Outcomes associated with SARS-CoV-2 viral clades in COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-09-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.24.20201228","rel_abs":"Background The COVID-19 epidemic of 2019-20 is due to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Following first case description in December, 2019 this virus has infected over 10 million individuals and resulted in at least 500,000 deaths world-wide. The virus is undergoing rapid mutation, with two major clades of sequence variants emerging. This study sought to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 sequence variants are associated with differing outcomes among COVID-19 patients in a single medical system. Methods Whole genome SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequence was obtained from isolates collected from patients registered in the University of Washington Medicine health system between March 1 and April 15, 2020. Demographic and baseline medical data along with outcomes of hospitalization and death were collected. Statistical and machine learning models were applied to determine if viral genetic variants were associated with specific outcomes of hospitalization or death. Findings Full length SARS-CoV-2 sequence was obtained 190 subjects with clinical outcome data. 35 (18.4%) were hospitalized and 14 (7.4%) died from complications of infection. A total of 289 single nucleotide variants were identified. Clustering methods demonstrated two major viral clades, which could be readily distinguished by 12 polymorphisms in 5 genes. A trend toward higher rates of hospitalization of patients with Clade 2 was observed (p=0.06). Machine learning models utilizing patient demographics and co-morbidities achieved area-under-the-curve (AUC) values of 0.93 for predicting hospitalization. Addition of viral clade or sequence information did not significantly improve models for outcome prediction. Conclusion SARS-CoV-2 shows substantial sequence diversity in a community-based sample. Two dominant clades of virus are in circulation. Among patients sufficiently ill to warrant testing for virus, no significant difference in outcomes of hospitalization or death could be discerned between clades in this sample. Major risk factors for hospitalization and death for either major clade of virus include patient age and comorbid conditions.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kenji Nakamichi","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jolie Zhu Shen","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Cecilia S Lee","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Aaron Y Lee","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Emma Adaline Roberts","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Paul D Simonson","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Pavitra Roychoudhury","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jessica G Andriesen","author_inst":"jandries@fredhutch.org"},{"author_name":"April K Randhawa","author_inst":"arandhaw@fredhutch.org"},{"author_name":"Patrick C Mathias","author_inst":"University of Washington School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alex Greninger","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Keith R Jerome","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Russell N Van Gelder","author_inst":"University of Washington"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.22.20192443","rel_title":"Reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 and Failure of Humoral Immunity: a case report.","rel_date":"2020-09-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.22.20192443","rel_abs":"Recovery from COVID-19 is associated with production of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, but it is uncertain whether these confer immunity.

Considerable research have been devoted to the development of neutralizing antibodies, including llama-derived single-chain nanobodies, to target the receptor-binding motif (RBM) and to block ACE2-RBD binding. Simple and effective strategies to increase potency are desirable for such studies when antibodies are only modestly effective. Here, we identify and characterize a high-affinity synthetic nanobody (sybody, SR31) as a fusion partner to improve the potency of RBM-antibodies. Crystallographic studies reveal that SR31 binds to RBD at a conserved and  greasy site distal to RBM. Although SR31 distorts RBD at the interface, it does not perturb the RBM conformation, hence displaying no neutralizing activities itself. However, fusing SR31 to two modestly neutralizing sybodies dramatically increases their affinity for RBD and neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. Our work presents a tool protein and an efficient strategy to improve nanobody potency.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hebang Yao","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology"},{"author_name":"Hongmin Cai","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology"},{"author_name":"Tingting Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology"},{"author_name":"Bingjie Zhou","author_inst":"Institute Pasteur of Shanghai, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wenming Qin","author_inst":"Shanghai Advanced Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Dimitri Lavillette","author_inst":"Institute Pasteur of Shanghai, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Dianfan Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology"},{"author_name":"Oliver F.

Within two months of its discovery, COVID-19 became a pandemic causing widespread morbidity and mortality.\n\nMethodologyWhole genome sequence data of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from Nigerian COVID-19 cases were retrieved by downloading from GISAID database. A total of 18 sequences that satisfied quality assurance (length [&ge;] 29700 nts and number of unknown bases denoted as  N [&le;] 5%) were used for the study. Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was done in MAFFT (Version 7.471) while SNP calling was implemented in DnaSP (Version 6.12.03) respectively and then visualized in Jalview (Version 2.11.1.0). Phylogenetic analysis was with MEGA X software.\n\nResultsNigerian SARS-CoV-2 had 99.9% genomic similarity with four large conserved genomic regions. A total of 66 SNPs were identified out of which 31 were informative. Nucleotide diversity assessment gave Pi = 0.00048 and average SNP frequency of 2.22 SNPs per 1000 nts. Non-coding genomic regions particularly 5UTR and 3UTR had a SNP density of 3.77 and 35.4 respectively. The region with the highest SNP density was ORF10 with a frequency of 8.55 SNPs\/1000 nts). Majority (72.2%) of viruses in Nigeria are of L lineage with preponderance of D614G mutation which accounted for 11 (61.1%) out of the 18 viral sequences. Nigeria SARS-CoV-2 revealed 3 major clades namely Oyo, Ekiti and Osun on a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree.\n\nConclusion and RecommendationNigerian SARS-CoV-2 reveals high mutation rate together with preponderance of L lineage and D614G mutants. Implication of these mutations for SARS-CoV-2 virulence and the need for more aggressive testing and treatment of COVID-19 in Nigeria is discussed. Additionally, attempt to produce testing kits for COVID-19 in Nigeria should consider the conserved regions identified in this study. Strict adherence to COVID-19 preventive measure is recommended in view of Nigerian SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic clustering pattern, which suggests intensive community transmission possibly rooted in communal culture characteristic of many ethnicities in Nigeria.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Idowu A.

Rapid spread of virus through populations poses an enormous challenge for outbreak control. Like all respiratory viruses, the most recent novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, initiates infection in the upper respiratory tract (URT). Infected individuals are often asymptomatic, yet highly infectious and readily transmit virus. A therapy that restricts initial replication in the URT has the potential to prevent progression of severe lower respiratory tract disease as well as limiting person-to-person transmission.\n\nWe show that prophylactic intra-nasal administration of the TLR2\/6 agonist INNA-051 in a SARS-CoV-2 ferret infection model effectively reduces levels of viral RNA in the nose and throat. The results of our study support clinical development of a therapy based on prophylactic TLR2\/6 innate immune activation in the URT to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission and provide protection against COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pamela C Proud","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Daphne Tsitoura","author_inst":"Ena Respiratory"},{"author_name":"Robert J Watson","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Brendon  Y.

SARS-CoV-2 readily infects patient-derived nasal epithelial cells and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived alveolar type 2 cells(iAT2) and cardiomyocytes(iCM). Robust activation of interferons or RNase L is not observed, while PKR activation is evident in iAT2 and iCM. In SARS-CoV-2 infected Calu-3 and A549ACE2 lung derived cell lines, activation of all pathways is observed, similar to a mutant MERS-CoV lacking innate immune antagonists. Moreover, increased replication in RNASEL knockout A549ACE2 cells, implicates RNase L in restricting SARS-CoV-2. Finally, while SARS-CoV-2 is less adept at antagonizing these host defense pathways compared to other coronaviruses, the innate immune response is still generally weak.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are frequently used for the relief of pain and inflammation, could modulate both SARS-CoV-2 infection and the host response to the virus. NSAIDs inhibit the enzymes cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which mediate the production of prostaglandins (PGs). PGE2, one of the most abundant PGs, has diverse biological roles in homeostasis and inflammatory responses. Previous studies have shown that NSAID treatment or inhibition of PGE2 receptor signaling leads to upregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cell entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, thus raising concerns that NSAIDs could increase susceptibility to infection. COX\/PGE2 signaling has also been shown to regulate the replication of many viruses, but it is not yet known whether it plays a role in SARS-CoV-2 replication. The purpose of this study was to dissect the effect of NSAIDs on COVID-19 in terms of SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced COX-2 upregulation in diverse human cell culture and mouse systems. However, suppression of COX-2\/PGE2 signaling by two commonly used NSAIDs, ibuprofen and meloxicam, had no effect on ACE2 expression, viral entry, or viral replication. Our findings suggest that COX-2 signaling driven by SARS-CoV-2 may instead play a role in regulating the lung inflammation and injury observed in COVID-19 patients.\n\nImportancePublic health officials have raised concerns about the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for treating symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). NSAIDs function by inhibiting the enzymes cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). These enzymes are critical for the generation of prostaglandins, lipid molecules with diverse roles in maintaining homeostasis as well as regulating the inflammatory response. While COX-1\/COX-2 signaling pathways have been shown to affect the replication of many viruses, their effect on SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unknown. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced COX-2 expression in both human cell culture systems and mouse models. However, inhibition of COX-2 activity with NSAIDs did not affect SARS-CoV-2 entry or replication. Our findings suggest that COX-2 signaling may instead regulate the lung inflammation observed in COVID-19 patients, which is an important area for future studies.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jennifer S.

We identified a panel of human monoclonal antibody clones from a yeast display library with specificity to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain that neutralized the virus in vitro. Administration of the lead antibody clone to Syrian hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV-2 significantly reduced viral load and histopathology score in the lungs.

Here we present for the first time that SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and GX_P2V could infect lung progenitor and even anterior foregut endoderm cells causing these cells death, which differentiated from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). The infection and replication of SARS-CoV-2 and GX_P2V were inhibited when treated with whey protein of breastmilk and Remdesivir, confirming that these two viruses could infect lung progenitor and even anterior foregut endoderm. Moreover, we found that SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus could infect endoderm and ectoderm. We found that whey protein blocked SARS-CoV-2 infecting these cells. In line with the SARS-CoV-2 results, GX_P2V could also infected endoderm and ectoderm, and also was inhibited by Remdesivir treatment. Although expressing coronavirus related receptor such as ACE2 and TMPRSS2, mesoderm cells are not permissive for SARS-CoV-2 and GX_P2V infection, which needed further to study the mechanisms. Interestingly, we also found that hESCs, which also express ACE2 and TMPRSS2 markers, are permissive for GX_P2V but not SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection and replication, indicating the widespread cell types for GX_P2V infection. Heparin treatment blocked efficiently viral infection. These results provided insight that these stem cells maybe provided a stable repository of coronavirus function or genome. The potential consequence of SARS-CoV-2 and animal coronavirus such as GX_P2V infection in hESCs, germ layer and induced progenitors should be closely monitored.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kuanhui Xiang","author_inst":"Peking University Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Bixia Hong","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Xinyuan Lai","author_inst":"Peking University Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Yangzhen Chen","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Tianming Luo","author_inst":"Peking University Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Xiaoping An","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Lihua Song","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Hui Zhuang","author_inst":"Peking University Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Huahao Fan","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Tong Li","author_inst":"Peking University Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Yi-Gang Tong","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing 100071, P.

However, it is still poorly understood how animals can cope with and adapt to these rapid and dramatic transformations of natural environments. The COVID-19 pandemic provides us with a unique opportunity to unveil the adaptive mechanisms involved in this process. Lockdown measures imposed in most countries are causing an unprecedented reduction of human activities giving us an experimental setting to assess the effects of our lifestyle on biodiversity. We studied the birds response to the Spanish population lockdown by using more than 200,000 bird records collected by a citizen science project. We compared the occurrence and detectability of birds during the spring 2020 lockdown with baseline data from previous years in the same urban areas and dates. We found that birds did not increase their probability of occurrence in urban areas during the lockdown, refuting the hypothesis that nature has recovered its space in human emptied urban areas. However, we found an increase in bird detectability, especially during early morning, suggesting a rapid change in the birds daily routines in response to quitter and less crowded cities. In conclusion, urban birds show high behavioral plasticity to rapidly adapt to novel environmental conditions, as those imposed by the COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Oscar Gordo","author_inst":"Catalan Ornithological Institute"},{"author_name":"Lluis Brotons","author_inst":"CTFC-CSIC"},{"author_name":"Sergi Herrando","author_inst":"Catalan Ornithological Institute"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Gargallo","author_inst":"Catalan Ornithological Institute"},{"author_name":"Tianming Luo","author_inst":"Peking University Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Xiaoping An","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Lihua Song","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Hui Zhuang","author_inst":"Peking University Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Huahao Fan","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Tong Li","author_inst":"Peking University Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Yi-Gang Tong","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing 100071, P.

Design Retrospective cohort study. Patients were randomly assigned to either training (80%) or test (20%) sets. The training set was used to fit a multivariable logistic regression. Predictors were ranked using variable importance metrics. Models were assessed by C-indices, Brier scores, and calibration plots in the test set. Setting Optum de-identified COVID-19 Electronic Health Record dataset. Participants 17,086 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 between February 20, 2020 and June 5, 2020. Main outcome measure All-cause mortality during hospital stay. Results The full model that included information on demographics, comorbidities, laboratory results and vital signs had good discrimination (C-index = 0.87) and was well calibrated, with some overpredictions for the most at-risk patients. Results were generally similar on the training and test sets, suggesting that there was little overfitting. Age was the most important risk factor. The performance of models that included all demographics and comorbidities (C-index = 0.79) was only slightly better than a model that only included age (C-index = 0.76). Across the study period, predicted mortality was 1.2% for 18-year olds, 8.4% for 55-year olds, and 28.6% for 85-year olds. Predicted mortality across all ages declined over the study period from 21.7% by March to 13.3% by May. Conclusion Age was the most important predictor of all-cause mortality although vital signs and laboratory results added considerable prognostic information with oxygen saturation, temperature, respiratory rate, lactate dehydrogenase, and white blood cell count being among the most important predictors. Demographic and comorbidity factors did not improve model performance appreciably. The model had good discrimination and was reasonably well calibrated, suggesting that it may be useful for assessment of prognosis.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Devin Incerti","author_inst":"Genentech"},{"author_name":"Shemra Rizzo","author_inst":"Genentech"},{"author_name":"Xiao Li","author_inst":"Genentech"},{"author_name":"Lisa Lindsay","author_inst":"Genentech"},{"author_name":"Vince Yau","author_inst":"Genentech"},{"author_name":"Dan Keebler","author_inst":"Genentech"},{"author_name":"Jenny Chia","author_inst":"Genentech"},{"author_name":"Larry Tsai","author_inst":"Genentech"},{"author_name":"Huahao Fan","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Tong Li","author_inst":"Peking University Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Yi-Gang Tong","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing 100071, P.

Saliva samples have advantages regarding ease and painlessness of collection, which does not require trained staff and may allow self-sampling. We enrolled 776 persons at various field-testing sites and collected nasopharyngeal and pooled saliva samples. 162 had a positive COVID-19 RT-PCR, 61% were mildly symptomatic and 39% asymptomatic. The sensitivity of RT-PCR on saliva samples versus nasopharygeal swabs varied depending on the patient groups considered or on Ct thresholds. There were 10 (6.2%) patients with a positive saliva sample and a negative nasopharyngeal swab, all of whom had Ct values<25. For symptomatic patients for whom the interval between symptoms onset and sampling was <10 days sensitivity was 77% but when excluding persons with isolated Ngen positivity (54\/162), sensitivity was 90%. In asymptomatic patients, the sensitivity was only 24%. When we looked at patients with Cts <30, sensitivity was 83% or 88.9% when considering 2 genes. The relatively good performance for patients with low Cts suggests that Saliva testing could be a useful and acceptable tool to identify infectious persons in mass screening contexts, a strategically important task for contact tracing and isolation in the community.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"- COVISAL Guyane","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"mathieu nacher","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier Andree Rosemon"},{"author_name":"magalie demar","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier Andree Rosemon"},{"author_name":"Lisa Lindsay","author_inst":"Genentech"},{"author_name":"Vince Yau","author_inst":"Genentech"},{"author_name":"Dan Keebler","author_inst":"Genentech"},{"author_name":"Jenny Chia","author_inst":"Genentech"},{"author_name":"Larry Tsai","author_inst":"Genentech"},{"author_name":"Huahao Fan","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Tong Li","author_inst":"Peking University Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Yi-Gang Tong","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing 100071, P.

During the course of the epidemic, it has been very likely that not all infectious people have been identified, which lead to incomplete case-detection. Apart from asymptomatic infections, possible reasons for incomplete case-detection are availability of test kits and changes in test policies during the course of the epidemic. So far, it has not been examined how biased the reported epidemiological measures are in the presence of incomplete case detection. In this work, we assess the four frequently used measures with respect to incomplete case-detection: 1) cumulative case-count, 2) incidence rate, 3) effective reproduction number and 4) doubling time. We apply an age-structured SIR model to simulate a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak followed by a lockdown in a hypothetical population. Different scenarios about temporal variations in case-detection are applied to the four measures during outbreak and lockdown. The biases resulting from incomplete case-detection on the four measures are compared. It turns out that the most frequently used epidemiological measure, the cumulative case count is most prone to bias in all of our settings. The effective reproduction number is the least biased measure. With a view to future reporting about this or other epidemics, we recommend to use of the effective reproduction number for informing the general public and policy makers.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ralph Brinks","author_inst":"Department of Statistics, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet Munich, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Helmut Kuechenhoff","author_inst":"Department of Statistics, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet Munich, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Joerg Timm","author_inst":"Medical Faculty, Institute of Virology, University Hospital Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany"},{"author_name":"Tobias Kurth","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Annika Hoyer","author_inst":"Department of Statistics, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet Munich, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Dan Keebler","author_inst":"Genentech"},{"author_name":"Jenny Chia","author_inst":"Genentech"},{"author_name":"Larry Tsai","author_inst":"Genentech"},{"author_name":"Huahao Fan","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Tong Li","author_inst":"Peking University Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Yi-Gang Tong","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing 100071, P.

We compared the incidence of COVID-19 outcomes (i.e., death; and death or intensive services use) among hospitalized famotidine users vs. proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) users, hydroxychloroquine users or famotidine non-users separately. Methods: We constructed a retrospective cohort study using data from COVID-19 Premier Hospital electronic health records. Study population were COVID-19 hospitalized patients aged 18 years or older. Famotidine, PPI and hydroxychloroquine exposure groups were defined as patients dispensed any medication containing one of the three drugs on the day of admission. The famotidine non-user group was derived from the same source population with no history of exposure to any drug with famotidine as an active ingredient prior to or on the day of admission. Time-at-risk was defined based on the intention-to-treat principle starting 1 day after admission to 30 days after admission. For each study comparison group, we fit a propensity score (PS) model through large-scale regularized logistic regression. The outcome was modeled using a survival model. Results: We identified 2193 users of PPI, 5950 users of the hydroxychloroquine, 1816 users of famotidine and 26,820 non-famotidine users. After PS stratification, the hazard ratios for death were as follows: famotidine vs no famotidine HR 1.03 (0.89-1.18); vs PPIs: HR 1.14 (0.94-1.39); vs hydroxychloroquine:1.03 (0.85-1.24).

We aim to assess the clinical and analytical performance of three commercial serological assays of SARS-CoV-2, comparing three anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG ELISA and identifying the seroconversion and seroprevalence in our population. A cross sectional study conducted from April 2020 to July 2020 at National Institute of Blood disease and Bone Marrow Transplantation Karachi, Pakistan with sample size of 404, enrolled consecutively. Participants were categorized into four groups namely convalescent plasmadonors (CPDs n=239), health care professionals (HCPs n=44), healthy blood donors (HBDs n=70) and from community (n=51). We evaluated the performance of Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 electrochemiluminescence (ECLIA) assay on Cobas-e411 by Roche, three qualitative anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG enzyme linked imunosorbant assay (ELISA) by (Generic assays, Euroimmun & Omega diagnostics) ,one quantitative ELISA assay by AESKU Diagnostics and two immune chromatography(ICT) kits namely InstaTestTM by CORTEZ and TEST IT by TURKLAB. From total 404 subjects, 322 (83.5%) were males. Mean age was 36.79 plus minus 11.95 years. Among 239 in CPDs group, 202(84.5%) showed positive antibodies by ECLIA. The qualitative anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA was positive in 174 (72.8%) and quantitative IgG in 180(75.3%) with mean titer of 56.7 plus minus 39.7 U\/ml. Sensitivity and specificity of ECLIA were 97.44& 99%, ELISA by Generic assays were 67.85% and 89.9%; Euroimmun had 90.38% and 94.9%; Omega Diagnostics 96.4% and 95% and the AESKULISA 93.75% and 100% respectively. Seroconversion was found to be 53.8% and 77.77% within 7 -8 days and 12 to 14 days post onset of symptoms respectively. ICT had more specificity but less sensitivity. Seroprevalence was found to be 84.5%, 40.9% and 21.4% in CPDs, HCPs and HBDs respectively. The Roche ECLIA, qualitative ELISA by Omega Diagnostics & Euroimmun showed higher sensitivity as well as higher specificity. Quantitative ELISA has higher specificity and relatively high sensitivity. Significant numbers of COVID patients do not have detectable antibodies by all assays.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tahir S Shamsi","author_inst":"National Institute of Blood Diseases and Bone Marrow Transplantation"},{"author_name":"Mehjabeen Imam","author_inst":"National Institute of Blood Diseases and Bone Marrow Transplantation"},{"author_name":"Shabnum Khawaja","author_inst":"National Institute of Blood Diseases and Bone Marrow Transplantation"},{"author_name":"Arshi Naz","author_inst":"National Institute of Blood Diseases and Bone Marrow Transplantation"},{"author_name":"Ahson Q Siddiqi","author_inst":"Hilton Pharma Pvt Ltd"},{"author_name":"Tehmina S Nafees","author_inst":"National Institute of Blood disease and Bone Marrow Transplantation"},{"author_name":"Amber Younas","author_inst":"National Institute of Blood disease and Bone Marrow Transplantation"},{"author_name":"Usama Shamsi","author_inst":"National Institute of Blood disease and Bone Marrow Transplantation"},{"author_name":"Imran Shabir","author_inst":"National Institute of Blood Diseases and Bone Marrow Transplantation"},{"author_name":"Shakir Ahmed","author_inst":"National Institute of Blood disease and Bone Marrow Transplantation"},{"author_name":"Naveen Tariq","author_inst":"National Institute of Blood disease and Bone Marrow Transplantation"},{"author_name":"Salman Tariq","author_inst":"National Institute of Blood disease and Bone Marrow Transplantation"},{"author_name":"Yongxiang Zhao","author_inst":"Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hinissan Pascaline Kohio","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Gaopeng Hou","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Baochao Fan","author_inst":"Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences"},{"author_name":"Beibei Niu","author_inst":"Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences"},{"author_name":"Rongli Guo","author_inst":"Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences"},{"author_name":"Paul W.

Then, this study aimed to model and forecast of COVID-19 new cases in these top 10 infected African countries. Methods: In this study, the COVID 19 new cases data have been modeled and forecasted using curve estimation regression and time series models for these top 10 infected African countries from Feb 14 to Sep 6, 2020. Results: From July to August, the prevalence of COVID-19 cumulative cases was declined in South Africa, Cote d'Ivoire, Egypt, Ghana, Cameron, Nigeria, and Algeria by 31%, 26%, 22%, 20%, 14%, 12%, and 4%, respectively. But, it was highly raised in Ethiopia and Morocco by 41%, and 38% in this period, respectively. In Kenya, it was raised only by 1%. In this study, the cubic regression models for the ln(COVID-19 new cases) data were relatively the best fit for Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria and South Africa. And, the quadratic regression models for the data were the best fit for Cameroon, Cote-dIvoire and Ghana. The Algeria data was followed the logarithmic regression model. In the time series analysis, the Algeria, Egypt, and South Africa COVID-19 new cases data have fitted the ARIMA (0,1,0), ARIMA (0,1,0), and ARIMA (0,1,14) models, respectively. The Cameroon, Cote-dIvoire, Ghana, and Nigeria data have fitted the simple exponential smoothing models. The Ethiopia, Kenya, and Morocco data have followed the Damped trend, Holt, and Brown exponential smoothing models, respectively. In the analysis, the trends of COVID-19 new cases will be declined for Algeria and Ethiopia, and the trends will be constantan for Cameroon, Cote-dIvoire, Ghana and Nigeria. But, it will be raised slightly for Egypt and Kenya, and significantly for Morocco and South Africa from September 7 to October 6, 2020. Conclusion: This study was conducted with the current measures; the forecasts and trends obtained may differ from the number of cases that occur in the future. Thus, the study finding should be useful in preparedness planning against further spread of the COVID-19 epidemic in African countries. And, the researcher recommended that as many countries continue to relax restrictions on movement and mass gatherings, and more are opening their airspaces, and the countries other public and private sectors are reopening. So, strong appropriate public health and social measures must be instituted on the grounds again.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alemayehu Argawu","author_inst":"Ambo University"},{"author_name":"Mehjabeen Imam","author_inst":"National Institute of Blood Diseases and Bone Marrow Transplantation"},{"author_name":"Shabnum Khawaja","author_inst":"National Institute of Blood Diseases and Bone Marrow Transplantation"},{"author_name":"Arshi Naz","author_inst":"National Institute of Blood Diseases and Bone Marrow Transplantation"},{"author_name":"Ahson Q Siddiqi","author_inst":"Hilton Pharma Pvt Ltd"},{"author_name":"Tehmina S Nafees","author_inst":"National Institute of Blood disease and Bone Marrow Transplantation"},{"author_name":"Amber Younas","author_inst":"National Institute of Blood disease and Bone Marrow Transplantation"},{"author_name":"Usama Shamsi","author_inst":"National Institute of Blood disease and Bone Marrow Transplantation"},{"author_name":"Imran Shabir","author_inst":"National Institute of Blood Diseases and Bone Marrow Transplantation"},{"author_name":"Shakir Ahmed","author_inst":"National Institute of Blood disease and Bone Marrow Transplantation"},{"author_name":"Naveen Tariq","author_inst":"National Institute of Blood disease and Bone Marrow Transplantation"},{"author_name":"Salman Tariq","author_inst":"National Institute of Blood disease and Bone Marrow Transplantation"},{"author_name":"Yongxiang Zhao","author_inst":"Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hinissan Pascaline Kohio","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Gaopeng Hou","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Baochao Fan","author_inst":"Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences"},{"author_name":"Beibei Niu","author_inst":"Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences"},{"author_name":"Rongli Guo","author_inst":"Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences"},{"author_name":"Paul W.

Several signs and symptoms have been described to be characteristic of the disease. However, there is a dearth of report on the description of the clinical characteristics of the disease in patients from Nigeria. This study was designed to provide a description of the clinical and demographic characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Nigeria. Methods: This study is a case series that includes patients that are evaluated between June and August 30, 2020, and diagnosed with COVID-19. Patient health records were reviewed and evaluated to describe the clinical characteristics on presentation. Results: A total of 154 COVID-19 patients were included in this study, with a mean age (S.D.) of 46.16 (13.701). Most of the patients survived (mortality rate of 2.6%), and were symptomatic (89.6%). There were more males (74.7%) than females, and the most common symptoms were fever, breathing difficulty, dry cough and malaise. Co-morbidities were also present in almost half of the study participants (49.4%). Conclusion: This study presents the most extensive description, to date, on the clinical and demographic characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Nigeria. Males are more likely than females to be infected with COVID-19 and the most occurring symptoms are fever, breathing difficulty, malaise, dry cough and chest pain. Old age and the presence of co-morbidities may also be associated with developing the severe disease.

Faced with this threat and no effective treatment, in line with many other countries, the UK adopted enforced social distancing (lockdown) to reduce transmission- successfully reducing the reproductive number, R, below one. However, given the large pool of susceptible individuals that remain, complete relaxation of controls is likely to generate a substantial second wave. Vaccination remains the only foreseeable means of both containing the infection and returning to normal interactions and behaviour. Here, we consider the optimal targeting of vaccination within the UK, with the aim of minimising future deaths or quality adjusted life year (QALY) losses. We show that, for a range of assumptions on the action and efficacy of the vaccine, targeting older age groups first is optimal and can avoid a second wave if the vaccine prevents transmission as well as disease.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sam Moore","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Edward M Hill","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Louise Dyson","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Michael Tildesley","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Matt J Keeling","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Itse Yusuf Nyam","author_inst":"Central Research Laboratory, Nigerian Institute of Medical Research, Yaba, Lagos"},{"author_name":"Bamidele Iwalokun","author_inst":"Molecular Biological and Biotechnology Department, Nigerian Institute of Medical Research, Yaba, Lagos"},{"author_name":"Chika Onwuamah","author_inst":"Centre for Human Virology and Genomics, Nigerian Institute of Medical Research, Yaba, Lagos"},{"author_name":"Mabel Uwandu","author_inst":"Centre for Human Virology and Genomics, Nigerian Institute of Medical Research, Yaba, Lagos"},{"author_name":"Babatunde Lawal Salako","author_inst":"Nigerian Institute of Medical Research, Yaba, Lagos"},{"author_name":"Akinola Abayomi","author_inst":"Lagos State Ministry of Health, Alausa, Ikeja, Lagos, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Akin Osibogun","author_inst":"College of Medicine, University of Lagos, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Abimbola Bowale","author_inst":"Mainland Infectious Disease Hospital, Yaba, Lagos"},{"author_name":"Bodunrin Osikomaiya","author_inst":"Mainland Infectious Disease Hospital, Yaba, Lagos"},{"author_name":"Babafemi Thomas","author_inst":"Mainland Infectious Disease Hospital, Yaba, Lagos"},{"author_name":"Bamidele Mutiu","author_inst":"Mainland Infectious Disease Hospital, Yaba, Lagos"},{"author_name":"Nkiruka Nnonyelum Odunukwe","author_inst":"Clinical Sciences Department, Nigerian Institute of Medical Research, Yaba, Lagos"},{"author_name":"Rongli Guo","author_inst":"Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences"},{"author_name":"Paul W.

Immunoglobulin G (IgG) targeting N protein is detectable in the serum of infected patients. The effect of high titers of IgG against N-protein on clinical outcomes of SARS-CoV2 disease has not been described. We studied 400 RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV2 patients to determine independent factors associated with poor outcomes, including MICU admission, prolonged MICU stay and hospital admissions, and in-hospital mortality. We also measured serum IgG against the N protein and correlated its concentrations with clinical outcomes. We found that several factors, including Charlson comorbidity Index (CCI), high levels of IL6, and presentation with dyspnea were associated with poor clinical outcomes. It was shown that higher CCI and higher IL6 levels were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. Anti-N protein IgG was detected in the serum of 55 (55%) patients at the time of admission. A high concentration of antibodies, defined as signal to cut off ratio (S\/Co)> 1.5 (75 percentile of all measurements), was found in 25 (25%) patients. The multivariable logistic regression models showed that between being an African American, higher CCI, lymphocyte counts, and S\/Co ratio> 1.5, only S\/Co ratio were independently associated with MICU admission and longer length of stay in hospital.

Moreover, rhesus macaques immunized with adjuvanted S-Trimer were protected from SARS-CoV-2 challenge compared to vehicle controls, based on clinical observations and reduction of viral loads in lungs. Trimer-Tag may be an important new platform technology for scalable production and rapid development of safe and effective subunit vaccines against current and future emerging RNA viruses.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joshua G.
