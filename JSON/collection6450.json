DATA: The time series of cumulative deaths due to COVID-19 produced by John Hopkins University and stored in a github repository. RESULTS: The projected total death toll will be 261680 (392520 to 183176) which represents the 0.003 % of world population. This number amounts to 0.054 deaths per 1000, while the mean in the world (all causes) is 7.7. The daily peak of deaths (7270 (+\/-500)) happened the 15 (+\/- 3) of April, meaning that we are in descending curve of the pandemic. The outbreak will end completely the 23th (+\/-3) of June. However, already on 9th (+\/- 3) of May, 2 sigma; (95.45%) of the deaths will have be occured. The projected death toll is much lower (5-10 times) than those forecasted by the Imperial College Group (ICG) even considering the best scenario of total suppression of virus transmission. Using actual mortality rates it is possible to back calculate which number of infected individuals would produce such mortality. The death toll arises from a number of infected individuals between 53 (worst case) and 3.3 million. The calculated number of infected individuals is significantly lower than that calculated by ICG (227.5 millions) with suppression.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"cesar| a barbero","author_inst":"IITEMA-UNRC"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.26.20078618","rel_title":"Nonpharmaceutical interventions for pandemic COVID-19: A cross-sectional investigation of US general public beliefs, attitudes, and actions","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.26.20078618","rel_abs":"Nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) represent the primary mitigation strategy for pandemic COVID-19. Despite this, many government agencies and members of the general public may be resistant to NPI adoption. We sought to understand public attitudes and beliefs regarding various NPIs and self-reported adoption of NPIs, and explore associations between NPI performance and the baseline characteristics of respondents. We performed a cross-sectional age-, sex-, and race- stratified survey of the general US population. Of the 1,005 respondents, 37% (95% CI 34.0, 39.9) felt that NPIs were inconvenient, while only 0.9% (95% CI 0.3, 1.5) of respondents believed that NPIs would not reduce their personal risk of illness. Respondents were most uncertain regarding the efficacy of mask and eye protection use, with 30.6% and 22.1%, respectively, unsure whether their use would slow disease spread. On univariate logistic regression analyses, NPI adherence was associated with a belief that NPIs would reduce personal risk of developing COVID-19 (OR 3.06, 95% CI [1.25, 7.48], p=0.014) and with a belief that the NPIs were not difficult to perform (OR 1.79, 95% CI [1.38, 2.31], p<0.0001). Respondents were compliant with straightforward, familiar, and heavily-encouraged NPI recommendations such as hand-washing; more onerous approaches, such as avoiding face touching, disinfecting surfaces, and wearing masks or goggles, were performed less frequently. NPI non-adherence is associated with both outcome expectations (belief that NPIs are effective) and process expectations (belief that NPIs are not overly inconvenient); these findings have important implications for designing public health outreach efforts, where the feasibility, as well as the effectiveness, of NPIs should be stressed.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bella Nichole Kantor","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Kantor","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.26.20079756","rel_title":"Racial, Economic and Health Inequality and COVID-19 Infection in the United States","rel_date":"2020-05-01","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.26.20079756","rel_abs":"Abstract Background: There is preliminary evidence of racial and social-economic disparities in the population infected by and dying from COVID-19. The goal of this study is to report the associations of COVID-19 with respect to race, health and economic inequality in the United States. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study of the associations between infection and mortality rate of COVID-19 and demographic, socioeconomic and mobility variables from 369 counties (total population: 102,178,117 [median: 73,447, IQR: 30,761-256,098]) from the seven most affected states (Michigan, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, California, Louisiana, Massachusetts). Findings: The risk factors for infection and mortality are different. Our analysis shows that counties with more diverse demographics, higher population, education, income levels, and lower disability rates were at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection. However, counties with higher disability and poverty rates had a higher death rate. African Americans were more vulnerable to COVID-19 than other ethnic groups (1,981 African American infected cases versus 658 Whites per million). Data on mobility changes corroborate the impact of social distancing. Interpretation: The observed inequality might be due to the workforce of essential services, poverty, and access to care. Counties in more urban areas are probably better equipped at providing care. The lower rate of infection, but a higher death rate in counties with higher poverty and disability could be due to lower levels of mobility, but a higher rate of comorbidities and health care access.

If social distancing is relaxed by 50% at the same time that quarterly serological screening is initiated, approximately 120,000 deaths could be averted and a quarter of the US population could be released from social distancing in the first year of the epidemic, compared to a scenario without serological testing.

This has necessitated the exploration of alternative diagnostic options to alleviate supply chain issues.\n\nAimTo establish and validate a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swabs.\n\nMethodologyWe used a commercial RT-LAMP mastermix from OptiGene Ltd in combination with a primer set designed to detect the CDC N1 region of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) gene. A single-tube, single-step fluorescence assay was implemented whereby as little as 1 L of universal transport medium (UTM) directly from a nasopharyngeal swab could be used as template, bypassing the requirement for RNA purification. Amplification and detection could be conducted in any thermocycler capable of holding 65{degrees}C for 30 minutes and measure fluorescence in the FAM channel at one-minute intervals.\n\nResultsAssay evaluation by assessment of 157 clinical specimens previously screened by E-gene RT-qPCR revealed assay sensitivity and specificity of 87% and 100%, respectively. Results were fast, with an average time-to-positive (Tp) for 93 clinical samples of 14 minutes (SD {+\/-}7 minutes). Using dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 virus spiked into UTM, we also evaluated assay performance against FDA guidelines for implementation of emergency-use diagnostics and established a limit-of-detection of 54 Tissue Culture Infectious Dose 50 per ml (TCID50 mL-1), with satisfactory assay sensitivity and specificity. A comparison of 20 clinical specimens between four laboratories showed excellent interlaboratory concordance; performing equally well on three different, commonly used thermocyclers, pointing to the robustness of the assay.\n\nConclusionWith a simplified workflow, N1-STOP-LAMP is a powerful, scalable option for specific and rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 and an additional resource in the diagnostic armamentarium against COVID-19.\n\n3.

Evidence from previous emerging infectious disease outbreaks points to the role of perceived risk, worry, media coverage, and knowledge in shaping engagement with health-protective behaviours as well as vaccination intentions. The current study examined these factors in 2,174 Australian residents. An online survey was completed between 2-9 March 2020, at an early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in Australia. Results revealed that two thirds of respondents were at least moderately worried about a widespread COVID-19 outbreak in Australia (which subsequently occurred). Worry about the outbreak and closely following media coverage were consistent predictors of health-protective behaviours (both over the previous month, and intended behaviours in the case of a widespread outbreak) as well as vaccination intentions. Health-behaviour engagement over the previous month was lower in some demographic groups, including males and younger individuals (18-29 age group). These was a substantial mismatch between respondents' expected symptoms of infection and emerging evidence that a meaningful proportion of people who contract the novel coronavirus will experience asymptomatic infection (i.e., they will not experience symptoms associated with COVID-19). Only 0.3% of those in the current study believed that they personally would not experience any symptoms if they were infected. Uncertainty and misconceptions about COVID-19 were common, including one third of respondents who reported being unsure whether people are likely have natural or existing immunity. There was also uncertainty around whether specific home remedies (e.g., vitamins, saline rinses) would offer protection, whether the virus could spread via the airborne route, and whether the virus was human made and deliberately released. Such misconceptions are likely to cause concern for members of the public. These results point to areas of uncertainty that could be usefully targeted by public education campaigns, as well as psychological and demographic factors associated with engagement with health-protective behaviours. These findings offer potential pathways for interventions to encourage health-protective behaviours to reduce the spread of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kate Faasse","author_inst":"University of New South Wales"},{"author_name":"Jill M Newby","author_inst":"UNSW"},{"author_name":"Julie L.

The feasibility of rapid clinical-grade manufacturing of virus-specific T cells from convalescent donors has not been demonstrated for this or prior pandemics. Methods One unit of whole blood was collected from each convalescent donor following standard blood bank practices. After the plasma was separated and stored separately, the leukocytes were stimulated using overlapping peptides of SARS-CoV-2, covering the immunodominant sequence domains of the S protein and the complete sequence of the N and M proteins. Thereafter, functionally reactive cells were enriched overnight using an automated device capturing IFN{gamma}-secreting cells. Findings From 1x10[9] leukocytes, 0.56 to 1.16x10[6] IFN{gamma}+ T cells were produced from each of the first two donors. Most of the T cells (64% to 71%) were IFN{gamma}+, with preferential enrichment of CD56+ T cells, effector memory T cells, and effector memory RA+ T cells. TCRV{beta} spectratyping revealed oligoclonal distribution, with over-representation of subfamilies including V{beta}3, V{beta}16 and V{beta}17. With just two donors, the probability that a recipient in the same ethnic group would share at least one donor HLA allele or one haplotype could be as high as >90% and >30%, respectively. Interpretations This study is limited by small number of donors and absence of recipient data; however, crucial first proof-of-principle data are provided demonstrating the feasibility of clinical-grade production of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells for urgent clinical use, conceivably with plasma therapy concurrently. Our data showing that virus-specific T cells can be detected easily after brief stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 specific peptides suggest that a parallel diagnostic assay can be developed alongside serology testing.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wing Leung","author_inst":"KKH, SingHealth Duke-NUS"},{"author_name":"Teck Guan Soh","author_inst":"National University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yeh Ching Linn","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jenny Guek-Hong Low","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jiashen Loh","author_inst":"Sengkang General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Marieta Chan","author_inst":"Health Sciences Authority"},{"author_name":"Wee Joo Chng","author_inst":"National University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Liang Piu Koh","author_inst":"National University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michelle Li-Mei Poon","author_inst":"National University Hospital"},{"author_name":"King Pan Ng","author_inst":"KKH"},{"author_name":"Chik Hong Kuick","author_inst":"KKH"},{"author_name":"Thuan Tong Tan","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lip Kun Tan","author_inst":"National University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michaela Su-fern Seng","author_inst":"KKH"},{"author_name":"Huanhuan L.

While the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) relationship of chloroquine is well established for malaria, there is sparse information regarding its dose-effect relationship in the context of COVID-19. Here, we explore the PK-PD relationship of chloroquine for COVID-19 by modelling both achievable systemic and pulmonary drug concentrations. Our data indicate that the standard anti-malarial treatment dose of 25mg\/kg over three days does not deliver sufficient systemic drug exposures for the inhibition of viral replication. In contrast, PK predictions of chloroquine in the lungs using in-vivo data or human physiologically-based PK models, suggest that doses as low as 3mg\/kg\/day for 3 days could deliver exposures that are significantly higher than reported antiviral-EC90s for up to a week. Moreover, if pulmonary exposure is a driver for prevention, simulations show that chronic daily dosing of chloroquine may be unnecessary for prophylaxis purposes. Instead, once weekly doses of 5mg\/kg would be sufficient to achieve a continuous cover of therapeutically active pulmonary exposures. These findings reveal a highly compartmentalised distribution of chloroquine in man that may significantly affect its therapeutic potential against COVID-19. The systemic circulation is shown as one site where chloroquine exposure is insufficient to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication.

We therefore assessed the association between ethnic composition, income deprivation and COVID19 mortality rates in England. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional ecological analysis across England's upper-tier local authorities. We assessed the association between the proportion of the population from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) backgrounds, income deprivation and COVID19 mortality rates using multivariable negative binomial regression, adjusting for population density, proportion of the population aged 50-79 and 80+ years, and the duration of the epidemic in each area. Findings: Local authorities with a greater proportion of residents from ethnic minority backgrounds had statistically significantly higher COVID19 mortality rates, as did local authorities with a greater proportion of residents experiencing deprivation relating to low income. After adjusting for income deprivation and other covariates, each percentage point increase in the proportion of the population from BAME backgrounds was associated with a 1% increase in the COVID19 mortality rate [IRR=1.01, 95%CI 1.01-1.02]. Each percentage point increase in the proportion of the population experiencing income deprivation was associated with a 2% increase in the COVID19 mortality rate [IRR=1.02, 95%CI 1.01-1.04]. Interpretation: This study provides evidence that both income deprivation and ethnicity are associated with greater COVID19 mortality. To reduce these inequalities, Government needs to target effective control and recovery measures at these disadvantaged communities, proportionate to their greater needs and vulnerabilities, during and following the pandemic.

We explored COVID-19 control strategies that could offer the greatest benefit in resource limited settings. Methods: Using an age-structured SEIR model, we explored the effects of COVID-19 control interventions--a lockdown, physical distancing measures, and active case finding (testing and isolation, contact tracing and quarantine)-- implemented individually and in combination to control a hypothetical COVID-19 epidemic in Kathmandu (population 2.6 million), Nepal. Results: A month-long lockdown that is currently in place in Nepal will delay peak demand for hospital beds by 36 days, as compared to a base scenario of no interventions (peak demand at 108 days (IQR 97-119); a 2 month long lockdown will delay it by 74 days, without any difference in annual mortality, or healthcare demand volume. Year-long physical distancing measures will reduce peak demand to 36% (IQR 23%-46%) and annual morality to 67% (IQR 48%-77%) of base scenario. Following a month long lockdown with ongoing physical distancing measures and an active case finding intervention that detects 5% of the daily infection burden could reduce projected morality and peak demand by more than 99%. Interpretation: Limited resources settings are best served by a combination of early and aggressive case finding with ongoing physical distancing measures to control the COVID-19 epidemic. A lockdown may be helpful until combination interventions can be put in place but is unlikely to reduce annual mortality or healthcare demand.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kiran Raj Pandey","author_inst":"Hospital for Advanced Medicine and Surgery"},{"author_name":"Anup Subedee","author_inst":"Hospital for Advanced Medicine and Surgery"},{"author_name":"Bishesh Khanal","author_inst":"Nepal Applied Mathematics and Informatics Institute for Research"},{"author_name":"Bhagawan Koirala","author_inst":"Hospital for Advanced Medicine and Surgery"},{"author_name":"Iain Buchan","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"David C Taylor-Robinson","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Ben Barr","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Steve Ward","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Giancarlo Biagini","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"King Pan Ng","author_inst":"KKH"},{"author_name":"Chik Hong Kuick","author_inst":"KKH"},{"author_name":"Thuan Tong Tan","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lip Kun Tan","author_inst":"National University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michaela Su-fern Seng","author_inst":"KKH"},{"author_name":"Huanhuan L.

This simple to use process allows us to identify particularly informative combinations of symptoms and traits that may help medical field analysis in general, and possibly to become a new data-driven advised approach for individual medical diagnosis, as well as for broader public policy discussion. In particular we have been motivated to develop this tool in the current environment of the pressing world crisis due to the COVID 19 pandemic.

Objective: To determine the geographic accessibility to SARS-CoV-2 testing sites in the United States, as quantified by travel time. Design: Cross-sectional analysis of SARS-CoV-2 testing sites as of April 7, 2020 in relation to travel time. Setting: United States COVID-19 pandemic. Participants: The United States, including the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia. Exposures: Population density, percent minority, percent uninsured, and median income by county from the 2018 American Community Survey demographic data. Main Outcome: SARS-CoV-2 testing sites identified in two national databases (Carbon Health and CodersAgainstCovid), geocoded by address. Median county 1 km2 gridded friction surface of travel times, as a measure of geographic accessibility to SARS-CoV-2 testing sites. Results: 6,236 unique SARS-CoV-2 testing sites in 3,108 United States counties were identified. Thirty percent of the U.S. population live in a county (N = 1,920) with a median travel time over 20 minutes. This was geographically heterogeneous; 86% of the Mountain division population versus 5% of the Middle Atlantic population lived in counties with median travel times over 20 min. Generalized Linear Models showed population density, percent minority, percent uninsured and median income were predictors of median travel time to testing sites. For example, higher percent uninsured was associated with longer travel time (B= 0.41 min\/percent, 95% confidence interval 0.3-0.53, p = 1.2x10-12), adjusting for population density. Conclusions and Relevance: Geographic accessibility to SARS-Cov-2 testing sites is reduced in counties with lower population density and higher percent of minority and uninsured, which are also risk factors for worse healthcare access and outcomes. Geographic barriers to SARS-Cov-2 testing may exacerbate health inequalities and bias county-specific transmission estimates. Geographic accessibility should be considered when planning the location of future testing sites and interpreting epidemiological data.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Benjamin Rader","author_inst":"Boston University"},{"author_name":"Christina M.

An alternative strategy that has been tentatively proposed is to shield the elderly and others at high risk of severe disease, while allowing immunity to build up in those at low risk until the entire population is protected. We examine the performance required from a classifier that uses information from medical records to assign risk status for a such a stratify-and-shield policy to be effective in limiting mortality when social distancing is relaxed. We show that under plausible assumptions about the level of immunity required for population-level immunity, the proportion shielded is constrained to be no more than 15% of the population. Under varying assumptions about the infection fatality ratio (from 0.1% to 0.4%) and the performance of the classifier (3 to 4.5 bits of information for discrimination), we calculate the expected number of deaths in the unshielded group. We show that with likely values of the performance of a classifier that uses information from age, sex and medical records, at least 80% of those who would die if unshielded would be allocated to the high-risk shielded group comprising 15% of the population. Although the proportion of deaths that would be prevented by effective shielding does not vary much with the infection fatality ratio, the absolute number of deaths in the unshielded varies from less than 10,000 if the infection fatality rate is 0.1% to more than 50,000 if the infection fatality rate is as high as 0.4%. For projecting the effect of an optimally applied stratify-and-shield policy, studies now under way should help to resolve key uncertainties: the extent to which infection confers immunity, the prevalence of immunity, the infection fatality ratio, and the performance of a classifier constructed using information from medical records. It is time to give serious consideration to a stratify-and-shield policy that could bring the COVID-19 epidemic to an end in a matter of months while restoring economic activity, avoiding overload of critical care services and limiting mortality.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paul M.

Design: Rapid scoping review. Literature review with fixed search terms, up to 1st April 2020. Central tendency and variation of the parameter estimates for infectious period in (a) asymptomatic (b) symptomatic cases from (i) virological studies (repeated testing), (ii) tracing studies (iii) modelling studies were gathered. Narrative review of viral dynamics. Information sources: Search strategies developed and the following searched: PubMed, Google Scholar, MedRxiv, BioRxiv. Additionally, the Health Information Quality Authority (Ireland) viral load synthesis was utilised, which screened literature from PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect, NHS evidence, Cochrane, medRxiv and bioRxiv, HRB open databases. Results: There was substantial variation in the estimates, and how infectious period was inferred. One study provided approximate median infectious period for asymptomatic cases of 6.5-9.5 days. Median pre-symptomatic infectious period across studies varied over <1-4 days. Estimated mean time from symptom onset to two negative RT-PCR tests was 13.4 days (95%CI: 10.9-15.8), but was shorter when studies included children or less severe cases. Estimated mean duration from symptom onset to hospital discharge or death (potential maximal infectious period) was 18.1 days (95%CI: 15.1-21.0); time to discharge was on average 4 days shorter than time-to-death. Viral dynamic data and model infectious parameters were often shorter than repeated diagnostic data. Conclusions: There are limitations of inferring infectiousness from repeated diagnosis, viral loads, and viral replication data alone, and also potential patient recall bias relevant to estimating exposure and symptom onset times. Despite this, available data provides a preliminary evidence base to inform models of central tendency for key parameters, and variation for exploring parameter space and sensitivity analysis. Some current models may be underestimating infectious period.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew W.

We developed a methodology that corrects observed positive test rates for non-random sampling to estimate population infection rates across U.S. states from March 31 to April 7. Methods We adapted a sample selection model that corrects for non-random testing to estimate population infection rates. The methodology compares how the observed positive case rate vary with changes in the size of the tested population, and applies this gradient to infer total population infection rates. Model identification requires that variation in testing rates be uncorrelated with changes in underlying disease prevalence. To this end, we relied on data on day-to-day changes in completed tests across U.S. states for the period March 31 to April 7, which were primarily influenced by immediate supply-side constraints. We used this methodology to construct predicted infection rates across each state over the sample period. We also assessed the sensitivity of the results to controls for state-specific daily trends in infection rates. Results The median population infection rate over the period March 31 to April 7 was 0.9% (IQR 0.64 1.77). The three states with the highest prevalence over the sample period were New York (8.5%), New Jersey (7.6%), and Louisiana (6.7%). Estimates from models that control for state-specific daily trends in infection rates were virtually identical to the baseline findings. The estimates imply a nationwide average of 12 population infections per diagnosed case. We found a negative bivariate relationship (corr. = -0.51) between total per capita state testing and the ratio of population infections per diagnosed case. Interpretation The effectiveness of the public health response to the coronavirus pandemic will depend on timely information on infection rates across different regions. With increasingly available high frequency data on COVID-19 testing, our methodology could be used to estimate population infection rates for a range of countries and subnational districts. In the United States, we found widespread undiagnosed COVID-19 infection. Expansion of rapid diagnostic and serological testing will be critical in preventing recurrent unobserved community transmission and identifying the large numbers individuals who may have some level of viral immunity.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Benatia","author_inst":"CREST - ENSAE"},{"author_name":"Raphael Godefroy","author_inst":"University of Montreal"},{"author_name":"Joshua Lewis","author_inst":"University of Montreal"},{"author_name":"Kevin Hunt","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Miriam Casey","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Ann Barber","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Francis Butler","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"John Griffin","author_inst":"DAFM"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Lane","author_inst":"DAFM"},{"author_name":"Conor McAloon","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Kirsty O'Brien","author_inst":"Health Information and Quality Authority"},{"author_name":"Patrick Wall","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Kieran Walsh","author_inst":"Health Information and Quality Authority"},{"author_name":"Simon More","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"J\u00f6rg Timm","author_inst":"Heinrich Heine University D\u00fcsseldorf"},{"author_name":"Klaus Pfeffer","author_inst":"Heinrich Heine University D\u00fcsseldorf"},{"author_name":"Alexander T Dilthey","author_inst":"Heinrich Heine University D\u00fcsseldorf"},{"author_name":"Arran Greenhalgh","author_inst":"GeneWorks"},{"author_name":"Jason C Kwong","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Norelle L Sherry","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Maryza Graham","author_inst":"Monash Health"},{"author_name":"Tuyet Hoang","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Marion Herisse","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Sacha J.

We approximate a 95% confidence interval (+\/- 0.0755). RESULTS An overwhelming number of EMS providers report having limited access to N95 respirators, receiving little or no benefits from COVID-19 related work, and report no institutional policy on social distancing practices despite CDC recommendations. For providers who do have access to N95 respirators, 31% report having to use the same mask for 1 week or longer. Approximately [1\/3] of the surveyed participants were unsure of when a COVID-19 patient is infectious. The data suggests regular decontamination of EMS equipment after each patient contact is not a regular practice. DISCUSSION Current practices to educate EMS providers on appropriate response to the novel coronavirus may not be sufficient, and future patients may benefit from a nationally established COVID-19 EMS response protocol. Further investigation on whether current EMS practices are contributing to the spread of infection is warranted. The data reveals concerning deficits in COVID-19 related education and administrative protocols which pose as a serious public health concern that should be urgently addressed.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christian Ventura","author_inst":"Health Advocacy and Medical Exploration Society, Bard College at Simon's Rock"},{"author_name":"Cody V Gibson","author_inst":"Health Advocacy and Medical Exploration Society, Calhoun Community College"},{"author_name":"George Donald Collier","author_inst":"Calhoun Community College"},{"author_name":"Kevin Hunt","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Miriam Casey","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Ann Barber","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Francis Butler","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"John Griffin","author_inst":"DAFM"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Lane","author_inst":"DAFM"},{"author_name":"Conor McAloon","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Kirsty O'Brien","author_inst":"Health Information and Quality Authority"},{"author_name":"Patrick Wall","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Kieran Walsh","author_inst":"Health Information and Quality Authority"},{"author_name":"Simon More","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"J\u00f6rg Timm","author_inst":"Heinrich Heine University D\u00fcsseldorf"},{"author_name":"Klaus Pfeffer","author_inst":"Heinrich Heine University D\u00fcsseldorf"},{"author_name":"Alexander T Dilthey","author_inst":"Heinrich Heine University D\u00fcsseldorf"},{"author_name":"Arran Greenhalgh","author_inst":"GeneWorks"},{"author_name":"Jason C Kwong","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Norelle L Sherry","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Maryza Graham","author_inst":"Monash Health"},{"author_name":"Tuyet Hoang","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Marion Herisse","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Sacha J.

When applied to SARS-CoV2 virus, complex conceptual queries upon VCM are able to replicate the search results of recent articles, hence demonstrating huge potential in supporting virology research.\n\nIn addition to VCM, we also illustrate the data dictionary for patients phenotype used by the COVID-19 Host Genetic Initiative. Our effort is part of a broad vision: availability of conceptual models for both human genomics and viruses will provide important opportunities for research, especially if interconnected by the same human being, playing the role of virus host as well as provider of genomic and phenotype information.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anna Bernasconi","author_inst":"Politecnico di Milano"},{"author_name":"Arif Canakoglu","author_inst":"Politecnico di Milano"},{"author_name":"Pietro Pinoli","author_inst":"Politecnico di Milano"},{"author_name":"Stefano Ceri","author_inst":"Politecnico di Milano"},{"author_name":"Ryosuke Omori","author_inst":"Hokkaido Universiry"},{"author_name":"Hiroshi Nishiura","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Eamon J Conway","author_inst":"Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory Epidemiology Unit at The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, The University of Melbourne and "},{"author_name":"Peter Dawson","author_inst":"Defence Science and Technology, Department of Defence, Australia"},{"author_name":"Deborah Cromer","author_inst":"Kirby Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia"},{"author_name":"James Wood","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Community Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia"},{"author_name":"Sam Abbott","author_inst":"Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Lon"},{"author_name":"Jodie McVernon","author_inst":"The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, The University of Melbourne and Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"James M McCaw","author_inst":"School of Mathematics and Statistics, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Simon More","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"J\u00f6rg Timm","author_inst":"Heinrich Heine University D\u00fcsseldorf"},{"author_name":"Klaus Pfeffer","author_inst":"Heinrich Heine University D\u00fcsseldorf"},{"author_name":"Alexander T Dilthey","author_inst":"Heinrich Heine University D\u00fcsseldorf"},{"author_name":"Arran Greenhalgh","author_inst":"GeneWorks"},{"author_name":"Jason C Kwong","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Norelle L Sherry","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Maryza Graham","author_inst":"Monash Health"},{"author_name":"Tuyet Hoang","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Marion Herisse","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Sacha J.

To trace back the initial temporal change of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus implicated in COVID-19, we study the limited genomic sequences that were available within the first couple of months of its spread. These samples were collected under varying circumstances and highlight wide variations in their genomic compositions. In this paper, we explore whether these variations characterize the initial temporal change of SARS-CoV-2 sequences. We observe that n-mer distributions in the SARS-CoV-2 samples, which were collected at an earlier period of time, predict its collection timeline with approximately 78% accuracy. However, such a distinctive pattern disappears with the inclusion of samples collected at a later time. We further observe that isolation sources (e.g., oronasopharynx, saliva, feces, etc.) could not be predicted by the n-mer patterns in these sequences. Finally, the phylogenetic and protein-alignment analyses highlight interesting associations between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sourav Biswas","author_inst":"Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Suparna Saha","author_inst":"Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Sanghamitra Bandyopadhyay","author_inst":"Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Malay Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Ryosuke Omori","author_inst":"Hokkaido Universiry"},{"author_name":"Hiroshi Nishiura","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Eamon J Conway","author_inst":"Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory Epidemiology Unit at The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, The University of Melbourne and "},{"author_name":"Peter Dawson","author_inst":"Defence Science and Technology, Department of Defence, Australia"},{"author_name":"Deborah Cromer","author_inst":"Kirby Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia"},{"author_name":"James Wood","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Community Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia"},{"author_name":"Sam Abbott","author_inst":"Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Lon"},{"author_name":"Jodie McVernon","author_inst":"The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, The University of Melbourne and Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"James M McCaw","author_inst":"School of Mathematics and Statistics, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Simon More","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"J\u00f6rg Timm","author_inst":"Heinrich Heine University D\u00fcsseldorf"},{"author_name":"Klaus Pfeffer","author_inst":"Heinrich Heine University D\u00fcsseldorf"},{"author_name":"Alexander T Dilthey","author_inst":"Heinrich Heine University D\u00fcsseldorf"},{"author_name":"Arran Greenhalgh","author_inst":"GeneWorks"},{"author_name":"Jason C Kwong","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Norelle L Sherry","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Maryza Graham","author_inst":"Monash Health"},{"author_name":"Tuyet Hoang","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Marion Herisse","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Sacha J.

RT-qPCR requires expensive equipment such as RNA isolation instruments and real-time PCR thermal cyclers, which are not available in many low resource settings and developing countries. As a pandemic, COVID-19 has quickly spread to the rest of the world. Many underdeveloped and developing counties do not have the means for fast and accurate COVID-19 detection to control this outbreak. Using COVID-19 positive clinical specimens, we demonstrated that RT-PCR assays can be performed in as little as 12 minutes using untreated samples, heat-inactivated samples, or extracted RNA templates. Rapid RT-PCR was achieved using thin-walled PCR tubes and a setup including sous vide immersion heaters\/circulators. Our data suggest that rapid RT-PCR can be implemented for sensitive and specific molecular diagnosis of COVID-19 in situations where sophisticated laboratory instruments are not available.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arunkumar Arumugam","author_inst":"AI Biosciences, Inc."},{"author_name":"Matthew L Faron","author_inst":"The Medical College of Wisconsin"},{"author_name":"Peter Yu","author_inst":"AI Biosciences, Inc."},{"author_name":"Cole Markham","author_inst":"AI Biosciences, Inc."},{"author_name":"Season S Wong","author_inst":"AI Biosciences, Inc."},{"author_name":"Hiroshi Nishiura","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Eamon J Conway","author_inst":"Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory Epidemiology Unit at The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, The University of Melbourne and "},{"author_name":"Peter Dawson","author_inst":"Defence Science and Technology, Department of Defence, Australia"},{"author_name":"Deborah Cromer","author_inst":"Kirby Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia"},{"author_name":"James Wood","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Community Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia"},{"author_name":"Sam Abbott","author_inst":"Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Lon"},{"author_name":"Jodie McVernon","author_inst":"The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, The University of Melbourne and Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"James M McCaw","author_inst":"School of Mathematics and Statistics, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Simon More","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"J\u00f6rg Timm","author_inst":"Heinrich Heine University D\u00fcsseldorf"},{"author_name":"Klaus Pfeffer","author_inst":"Heinrich Heine University D\u00fcsseldorf"},{"author_name":"Alexander T Dilthey","author_inst":"Heinrich Heine University D\u00fcsseldorf"},{"author_name":"Arran Greenhalgh","author_inst":"GeneWorks"},{"author_name":"Jason C Kwong","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Norelle L Sherry","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Maryza Graham","author_inst":"Monash Health"},{"author_name":"Tuyet Hoang","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Marion Herisse","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Sacha J.

Serological tests measure antibody responses against pathogens and define cutoff levels that dichotomize the quantitative test measures into sero-positives and negatives. With the imperfect tests that are currently available to test for past SARS-CoV-2 infection, the fraction of seropositive individuals in serosurveys is a biased estimator of seroprevalence and is usually corrected post-hoc to account for the sensitivity and specificity. Here we use a likelihood-based inference method -- previously called mixture models -- for the estimation of the seroprevalence that does not require to define cutoffs by integrating the quantitative test measures directly into the statistical inference procedure. We confirm that this likelihood-based method outperforms the methods based on cutoffs and post-hoc corrections leading to less variation in point-estimates of the seroprevalence and its temporal trend. We illustrate how the likelihood-based method can be used to optimize the design of serosurveys with imperfect serological tests. We also provide guidance on the number of control and case sera that are required to quantify the tests ambiguity sufficiently to enable the reliable estimation of the seroprevalence. Lastly, we show how this approach can be used to identify classes of case sera with an unknown distribution of quantitative test measures that have not been used for test validation. An R-package with the likelihood and power analysis functions is provided. Our study advocates to using serological tests without cutoffs, especially if they are used to determine parameters characterizing populations rather than individuals. This approach circumvents some of the shortcomings of cutoff-based methods with post-hoc correction at exactly the low seroprevalence levels and test accuracies that we are currently facing in COVID-19 serosurveys.\n\nAuthor SummaryAs other pathogens, SARS-CoV-2 elicits antibody responses in infected people that can be detected in their blood serum as early as a week after the infection until long after recovery. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies can therefore be used as a marker of past infection, and the prevalence of seropositive people, i.e. people with specific antibodies, is a key measure to determine the extent of the Coronavirus pandemic. The serological tests, however, are usually not perfect, yielding false positive and negative results. Here we exploit an approach that refrains from classifying people as seropositive or negative, but rather compares the antibody level to that of confirmed cases and controls. This approach leads to more reliable seroprevalence estimates, especially for the low prevalence and low test accuracies that we face during the current Coronavirus pandemic. We also show how this approach can be extended to infer the presence of cases that have not been used for validating the test, such as people that underwent a mild or even asymptomatic infection.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Judith A Bouman","author_inst":"ETH zurich"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Bonhoeffer","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Roland R Regoes","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Cole Markham","author_inst":"AI Biosciences, Inc."},{"author_name":"Season S Wong","author_inst":"AI Biosciences, Inc."},{"author_name":"Hiroshi Nishiura","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Eamon J Conway","author_inst":"Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory Epidemiology Unit at The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, The University of Melbourne and "},{"author_name":"Peter Dawson","author_inst":"Defence Science and Technology, Department of Defence, Australia"},{"author_name":"Deborah Cromer","author_inst":"Kirby Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia"},{"author_name":"James Wood","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Community Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia"},{"author_name":"Sam Abbott","author_inst":"Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Lon"},{"author_name":"Jodie McVernon","author_inst":"The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, The University of Melbourne and Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"James M McCaw","author_inst":"School of Mathematics and Statistics, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Simon More","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"J\u00f6rg Timm","author_inst":"Heinrich Heine University D\u00fcsseldorf"},{"author_name":"Klaus Pfeffer","author_inst":"Heinrich Heine University D\u00fcsseldorf"},{"author_name":"Alexander T Dilthey","author_inst":"Heinrich Heine University D\u00fcsseldorf"},{"author_name":"Arran Greenhalgh","author_inst":"GeneWorks"},{"author_name":"Jason C Kwong","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Norelle L Sherry","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Maryza Graham","author_inst":"Monash Health"},{"author_name":"Tuyet Hoang","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Marion Herisse","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Sacha J.

To date we have identified thirteen mutations in Spike that are accumulating. Mutations are considered in a broader phylogenetic context, geographically, and over time, to provide an early warning system to reveal mutations that may confer selective advantages in transmission or resistance to interventions. Each one is evaluated for evidence of positive selection, and the implications of the mutation are explored through structural modeling. The mutation Spike D614G is of urgent concern; it began spreading in Europe in early February, and when introduced to new regions it rapidly becomes the dominant form. Also, we present evidence of recombination between locally circulating strains, indicative of multiple strain infections. These finding have important implications for SARS-CoV-2 transmission, pathogenesis and immune interventions.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bette Korber","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Will Fischer","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"S.
