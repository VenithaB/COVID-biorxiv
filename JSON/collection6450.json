The Covid-19 disease is still not well characterized, and many research teams all over the world are working on either ther- apeutic or vaccination issues. Massive testing is one of the main recommendations. In addition to laboratory tests, imagery- based tools are being widely investigated. Artificial intelligence is therefore contributing to the efforts made to face this pandemic phase. Regarding patients in hospitals, it is important to monitor the evolution of lung pathologies due to the virus. A prognosis is therefore of great interest for doctors to adapt their care strategy. In this paper, we propose a method for Covid-19 prognosis based on deep learning architectures. The proposed method is based on the combination of a convolutional and recurrent neural networks to classify multi-temporal chest X-ray images and predict the evolution of the observed lung pathology. When applied to radiological time-series, promising results are obtained with an accuracy rates higher than 92%.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohamed Fakhfakh","author_inst":"University of Sfax, MIRACL laboratory"},{"author_name":"Bassem Bouaziz","author_inst":"University of Sfax, MIRACL laboratory"},{"author_name":"Faiez Gargouri","author_inst":"University of Sfax, MIRACL laboratory"},{"author_name":"Lotfi Chaari","author_inst":"Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.05.20083436","rel_title":"Extending A Chronological and Geographical Analysis of Personal Reports of COVID-19 on Twitter to England, UK","rel_date":"2020-05-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.05.20083436","rel_abs":"The rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic presents challenges for actively monitoring its transmission.

The case fatality rates (CFR) reported in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic substantially differ between countries. For SARS-CoV-2 infection with its broad clinical spectrum from asymptomatic to severe disease courses, the infection fatality rate (IFR) is the more reliable parameter to predict the consequences of the pandemic. Here we combined virus RT-PCR testing and assessment for SARS-CoV2 antibodies to determine the total number of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infections in a given population. Methods: A sero-epidemiological GCP- and GEP-compliant study was performed in a small German town which was exposed to a super-spreading event (carnival festivities) followed by strict social distancing measures causing a transient wave of infections. Questionnaire-based information and biomaterials were collected from a random, household-based study population within a seven-day period, six weeks after the outbreak. The number of present and past infections was determined by integrating results from anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG analyses in blood, PCR testing for viral RNA in pharyngeal swabs and reported previous positive PCR tests. Results: Of the 919 individuals with evaluable infection status (out of 1,007; 405 households) 15.5% (95% CI: [12.3%; 19.0%]) were infected. This is 5-fold higher than the number of officially reported cases for this community (3.1%). Infection was associated with characteristic symptoms such as loss of smell and taste. 22.2% of all infected individuals were asymptomatic. With the seven SARS-CoV-2-associated reported deaths the estimated IFR was 0.36% [0.29%; 0.45%]. Age and sex were not found to be associated with the infection rate. Participation in carnival festivities increased both the infection rate (21.3% vs. 9.5%, p<0.001) and the number of symptoms in the infected (estimated relative mean increase 1.6, p=0.007). The risk of a person being infected was not found to be associated with the number of study participants in the household this person lived in. The secondary infection risk for study participants living in the same household increased from 15.5% to 43.6%, to 35.5% and to 18.3% for households with two, three or four people respectively (p<0.001). Conclusions: While the number of infections in this high prevalence community is not representative for other parts of the world, the IFR calculated on the basis of the infection rate in this community can be utilized to estimate the percentage of infected based on the number of reported fatalities in other places with similar population characteristics. Whether the specific circumstances of a super-spreading event not only have an impact on the infection rate and number of symptoms but also on the IFR requires further investigation. The unexpectedly low secondary infection risk among persons living in the same household has important implications for measures installed to contain the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hendrik Streeck","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Bianca Schulte","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Beate Kuemmerer","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Enrico Richter","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Tobias Hoeller","author_inst":"Clinical Study Core Unit, Study Centre Bonn (SZB), University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Christine Fuhrmann","author_inst":"Clinical Study Core Unit, Study Centre Bonn (SZB), University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Eva Bartok","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ramona Dolscheid","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Moritz Berger","author_inst":"Institute for Medical Biometry, Informatics and Epidemiology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Lukas Wessendorf","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Monika Eschbach-Bludau","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Angelika Kellings","author_inst":"Clinical Study Core Unit, Study Centre Bonn (SZB), University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Astrid Schwaiger","author_inst":"Biobank Core Unit, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Martin Coenen","author_inst":"Clinical Study Core Unit, Study Centre Bonn (SZB), University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Per Hoffmann","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Markus Noethen","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Anna-Maria Eis-Huebinger","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Martin Exner","author_inst":"Institute for Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Ricarda Schmithausen","author_inst":"Institute for Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Matthias Schmid","author_inst":"Institute for Medical Biometry, Informatics and Epidemiology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Gunther Hartmann","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany; German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), partne"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.04.20090555","rel_title":"Laboratory findings associated with mechanical ventilation requirement and mortality among hospitalized individuals with Covid-19 in Eastern Massachusetts","rel_date":"2020-05-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.04.20090555","rel_abs":"Importance: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has placed unprecedented stress on health systems across the world, and reliable estimates of risk for adverse hospital outcomes are needed. Objective: To quantify admission laboratory and comorbidity features associated with critical illness and mortality risk across 6 Eastern Massachusetts hospitals. Design: Retrospective cohort study using hospital course, prior diagnoses, and laboratory values. Setting: Emergency department and inpatient settings from 2 academic medical centers and 4 community hospitals. Participants: All individuals with hospital admission and positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by PCR testing across these 6 hospitals through June 5, 2020. Exposure: Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Main Outcome Measures: Severe illness defined by ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or death. Results: Among 2,511 hospitalized individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (of whom 50.9% were male, 53.9% white, and 27.0% Hispanic, with mean age 62.6 years), 215 (8.6%) were admitted to the ICU, 164 (6.5%) required mechanical ventilation, and 292 (11.6%) died. L1-regression models developed in 3 of these hospitals yielded area under ROC curve (AUC) of 0.807 for severe illness and 0.847 for mortality in the 3 held-out hospitals. In total, 212\/292 (78%) of the deaths occurred in the highest-risk mortality quintile.

The effective control of this infectious disease requires access to diagnostic techniques, both for case finding and epidemic size estimation. The molecular technique is routinely being used worldwide. Although it is the standard case detection and management method, it has its own shortcomings. Thus, some easy-to-use rapid serological tests were developed. Methods: One hundred and fourteen positive RT-PCR-diagnosed patients were tested by VivaDiag Kit, a brand of rapid serological kits available in hospitals affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS), Tehran, Iran. Frozen serum specimens taken from healthy people in summer and autumn 2019, were also tested as negative controls. Results: The test sensitivity was 47.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 38.8-56.9) for IgM and 47.0% (95% CI: 38.0-56.0) for IgG. There was no difference between IgG and IgM seropositivity except in one case. Specificity was calculated as 99.0% (95% CI: 96.4-99.9) for IgM and of 100.0% (95% CI: 0.98.2-100.0) for IgG. Sensitivity was higher in men and older participants. Conclusion: This test can be used for epidemiological investigations especially for the estimation of the level of infection in the community, after it is properly corrected for sensitivity and specificity. The low sensitivity could be attributed to the technical limitation of the kits or low levels of antibodies after infection. The different sensitivity in age and sex groups supports the hypothesis that different people show different immune responses to this virus.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"hamid reza shamsollahi","author_inst":"Tehran university of medical sciences"},{"author_name":"Mostafa Amini","author_inst":"Tehran university of medical sciences"},{"author_name":"Shaban Alizadeh","author_inst":"Tehran university of medical sciences"},{"author_name":"Saharnaz Nedjat","author_inst":"Tehran university of medical sciences"},{"author_name":"Ali Akbari-Sari","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mehdi Rezaei","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Seyed Farshad Allameh","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Akbar Fotouhi","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Masud Yunesian","author_inst":"Tehran university of medical sciences"},{"author_name":"Lukas Wessendorf","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Monika Eschbach-Bludau","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Angelika Kellings","author_inst":"Clinical Study Core Unit, Study Centre Bonn (SZB), University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Astrid Schwaiger","author_inst":"Biobank Core Unit, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Martin Coenen","author_inst":"Clinical Study Core Unit, Study Centre Bonn (SZB), University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Per Hoffmann","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Markus Noethen","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Anna-Maria Eis-Huebinger","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Martin Exner","author_inst":"Institute for Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Ricarda Schmithausen","author_inst":"Institute for Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Matthias Schmid","author_inst":"Institute for Medical Biometry, Informatics and Epidemiology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Gunther Hartmann","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany; German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), partne"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.04.20090118","rel_title":"Multivariable prediction model of intensive care unit transfer and death: a French prospective cohort study of COVID-19 patients.","rel_date":"2020-05-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.04.20090118","rel_abs":"Background: Prognostic factors of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients among European population are lacking. Our objective was to identify early prognostic factors upon admission to optimize the management of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a medical ward. Methods: French single-center prospective cohort study of 152 patients with positive Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov2) real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, hospitalized in a medical ward. Multivariable models and a simplified scoring system assessed predictive factors of intensive care unit (ICU) transfer or death at day 14 (D14), of being discharge alive and severe status at D14 (remaining with ventilation, or death). A validation was performed on an external sample of 132 patients. Findings: At D14, the probability of ICU transfer or death was 32% (95% CI 25-40). Older age (OR 2.61, 95% CI 0.96-7.10), poorer respiratory presentation (OR 4.04 per 1-point increment on World Health Organization (WHO) clinical scale, 95% CI 1.76-9.25), higher CRP-level (OR 1.63 per 100mg\/L increment, 95% CI 0.98-2.71) and lower lymphocytes count (OR 0.36 per 1000\/mm3 increment, 95% CI 0.13-0.99) were associated with an increased risk of ICU requirement or death. A 8-point ordinal scale scoring system defined low (score 0-2), moderate (score 3-5), and high (score 6-8) risk patients, with predicted respectively 2%, 25% and 81% risk of ICU transfer or death at D14. Interpretation: In this prospective cohort study of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a medical ward in France, 32% were transferred to ICU or died.

In this study, we evaluated the performance of six CE-marked point-of-care tests (POC) and three ELISA assays for the diagnosis of COVID-19 by exploring seroconversions in hospitalized patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Both the ELISA and POC tests were able to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in at least half of the samples collected seven days or more after the onset of symptoms. After 15 days, the rate of detection rose to over 80% but without reaching 100%, irrespective of the test used. More than 90% of the samples collected after 15 days tested positive using the iSIA and Accu-Tell POC tests and the ID.Vet IgG ELISA assay. Seroconversion was observed 5 to 12 days after the onset of symptoms. Three assays suffer from a specificity below 90% (EUROIMMUN IgG and IgA, UNscience, Zhuhai Livzon). The second week of COVID-19 seems to be the best period for assessing the sensitivity of commercial serological assays.

Identifying the association between medications taken prior to the infection of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) might be useful during the current pandemic until a proven treatment is developed. We aimed to determine whether the risk of developing COVID-19 was associated with the use of various drugs that may increase or decrease susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and COVID-19. Methods and Findings: A case-control study was performed using a nationwide claims database of South Korea, where a large testing capacity has been available throughout the pandemic. Exposure was defined as the prescription of study drugs that would have been continued until 7 days before the testing for COVID-19. Adults were considered eligible if they were >=18 years old and tested for COVID-19. Among the 65,149 eligible subjects (mean age, 48.3 years; 49.4% male), 5,172 (7.9%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine was not significantly associated with the risk of COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.48; 95% CI, 0.95-2.31). In the overall population, lower risks of COVID-19 were associated with the use of camostat (aOR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.20-1.02) and amiodarone (aOR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.33-0.89), although the differences were not significant in the subgroup analyses. Angiotensin receptor blockers were also associated with a slightly increased risk of COVID-19 (aOR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01-1.26), which was also not observed in the subgroup analysis. The study limitations include potential bias regarding the controls' characteristics, inability to determine prescription compliance, and a lack of information regarding the severity of underlying conditions. Conclusions. No medications were consistently associated with increased or decreased risks of COVID-19. These findings suggest that a more cautious approach is warranted for the clinical use of re-purposed drugs until the results are available from clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kyungmin Huh","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea"},{"author_name":"Wonjun Ji","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea"},{"author_name":"Minsun Kang","author_inst":"Artificial Intelligence and Big-Data Convergence Center, Gil Medical Center, Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Jinwook Hong","author_inst":"Artificial Intelligence and Big-Data Convergence Center, Gil Medical Center, Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Gi Hwan Bae","author_inst":"Artificial Intelligence and Big-Data Convergence Center, Gil Medical Center, Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Rugyeom Lee","author_inst":"Artificial Intelligence and Big-Data Convergence Center, Gil Medical Center, Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Yewon Na","author_inst":"Artificial Intelligence and Big-Data Convergence Center, Gil Medical Center, Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Hyoseon Choi","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Seon Yeong Gong","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Jaehun Jung","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Gachon University College of Medicine; Artificial Intelligence and Big-Data Convergence Center, Gil Medical Center, Gachon Un"},{"author_name":"David Morquin","author_inst":"Montpellier University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Vincent Foulongne","author_inst":"University of Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Arnaud Bourdin","author_inst":"University of Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Vincent Le Moing","author_inst":"University of Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Philippe Van de Perre","author_inst":"University of Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Markus Noethen","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Anna-Maria Eis-Huebinger","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Martin Exner","author_inst":"Institute for Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Ricarda Schmithausen","author_inst":"Institute for Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Matthias Schmid","author_inst":"Institute for Medical Biometry, Informatics and Epidemiology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Gunther Hartmann","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany; German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), partne"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.04.20090043","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 transmission in different settings: Analysis of cases and close contacts from the Tablighi cluster in Brunei Darussalam","rel_date":"2020-05-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.04.20090043","rel_abs":"We report the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 across different settings from the initial COVID-19 cluster in Brunei, arisen from 19 attendees at the Malaysian Tablighi Jama'at gathering and resulted in 52 locally transmitted cases.

Household ARs of symptomatic cases were higher (14.4% [95%CI: 8.8,19.9]) than asymptomatic (4.4% [95%CI: 0.0,10.5]) or presymptomatic cases (6.1% [95%CI: 0.3,11.8]). Low ARs (<1%) were observed for workplace and social settings. Our analysis highlights that SARS-CoV-2 transmission varies depending on environmental, behavioural and host factors. We identify 'red flags' of potential super-spreading events, namely densely populated gatherings for prolonged periods in enclosed settings, presence of individuals with recent travel history, and group behaviours such as communal eating, sleeping and sharing of personal hygiene facilities. We propose differentiated testing strategies that account for transmission risk.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Liling Chaw","author_inst":"PAPRSB Institute of Health Sciences, Universiti Brunei Darussalam, Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Wee Chian Koh","author_inst":"Centre for Strategic and Policy Studies, Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Sirajul Adli Jamaludin","author_inst":"Environmental Health Division, Ministry of Health, Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Lin Naing","author_inst":"PAPRSB Institute of Health Sciences, Universiti Brunei Darussalam, Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Fathi Alikhan","author_inst":"Disease Control Division, Ministry of Health, Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Justin Wong","author_inst":"Disease Control Division, Ministry of Health, Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Yewon Na","author_inst":"Artificial Intelligence and Big-Data Convergence Center, Gil Medical Center, Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Hyoseon Choi","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Seon Yeong Gong","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Jaehun Jung","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Gachon University College of Medicine; Artificial Intelligence and Big-Data Convergence Center, Gil Medical Center, Gachon Un"},{"author_name":"David Morquin","author_inst":"Montpellier University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Vincent Foulongne","author_inst":"University of Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Arnaud Bourdin","author_inst":"University of Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Vincent Le Moing","author_inst":"University of Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Philippe Van de Perre","author_inst":"University of Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Markus Noethen","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Anna-Maria Eis-Huebinger","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Martin Exner","author_inst":"Institute for Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Ricarda Schmithausen","author_inst":"Institute for Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Matthias Schmid","author_inst":"Institute for Medical Biometry, Informatics and Epidemiology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Gunther Hartmann","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany; German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), partne"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.03.20089649","rel_title":"Impact of complete lock-down on total infection and death rates: A hierarchical cluster analysis","rel_date":"2020-05-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.03.20089649","rel_abs":"Introduction and Aims: Retarding the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection by preventive strategies is the first line of management. Several countries have declared a stringent lock-down in order to enforce social distancing and prevent the spread of infection. This analysis was conducted in an attempt to understand the impact of lock-down on infection and death rates over a period of time. Material and Methods: A validated database was used to generate data related to countries with declared lock-down. Simple regression analysis was conducted to assess the rate of change in infection and death rates. Subsequently, a k-means and hierarchical cluster analysis was done to identify the countries that performed similarly. Sweden and South Korea were included as counties without lock-down in a second-phase cluster analysis. Results: There was a significant 61% and 43% reduction in infection rates 1-week post lock-down in the overall and India cohorts, respectively, supporting its effectiveness. Countries with higher baseline infections and deaths fared poorly compared to those who declared lock-down early on. Sweden and South Korea fared equally well, as most lock-down countries stemmed the growth of infection and death. Conclusion: Lock-down has proven to be an effective strategy is slowing down the SARS-CoV-2 disease progression exponentially. However, lessons need to be learned from Sweden and South Korea on arresting the disease progression without imposing such stringent measures.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"SAMIT GHOSAL","author_inst":"Nightingale Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rahul Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"Private Practitioner"},{"author_name":"Milan Majumder","author_inst":"Independent Statistician"},{"author_name":"Lin Naing","author_inst":"PAPRSB Institute of Health Sciences, Universiti Brunei Darussalam, Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Fathi Alikhan","author_inst":"Disease Control Division, Ministry of Health, Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Justin Wong","author_inst":"Disease Control Division, Ministry of Health, Brunei Darussalam"},{"author_name":"Yewon Na","author_inst":"Artificial Intelligence and Big-Data Convergence Center, Gil Medical Center, Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Hyoseon Choi","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Seon Yeong Gong","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Jaehun Jung","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Gachon University College of Medicine; Artificial Intelligence and Big-Data Convergence Center, Gil Medical Center, Gachon Un"},{"author_name":"David Morquin","author_inst":"Montpellier University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Vincent Foulongne","author_inst":"University of Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Arnaud Bourdin","author_inst":"University of Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Vincent Le Moing","author_inst":"University of Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Philippe Van de Perre","author_inst":"University of Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Markus Noethen","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Anna-Maria Eis-Huebinger","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Martin Exner","author_inst":"Institute for Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Ricarda Schmithausen","author_inst":"Institute for Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Matthias Schmid","author_inst":"Institute for Medical Biometry, Informatics and Epidemiology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Gunther Hartmann","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany; German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), partne"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.03.20089342","rel_title":"Temperature and relative humidity are not major contributing factor on the occurrence of COVID-19 pandemic: An observational study in 57 countries","rel_date":"2020-05-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.03.20089342","rel_abs":"The world searching for hope has already experienced a huge loss of lives due to COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 started in Wuhan, China. There are speculations that climatic conditions can slowdown the transmission of COVID-19.Findings from the early outbreak indicated the possible association of air temperature and relative humidity in COVID-19 occurrence in China. Current study focused on whether climatic conditions(temperature and relative humidity)are having any influence in the occurrence of COVID-19 when the outbreak has been classified as pandemic. To determine the effect of daily average temperature and average relative humidity on log-transformed total daily cases of COVID-19, polynomial regression as a quadratic term and linear regression were done. Linear regression analysis was also carried out to explore the same effect on selected countries. Present study observed no correlation between the climatic conditions (the daily average temperature and relative humidity) and the number of cases of COVID-19. Similar result was found in relation between daily average temperature and average number of cases per day in country-wise analysis. However, about 93.5% cases of COVID-19 occurred between 1{degrees}C to 16{degrees}C and the average number of cases per day was lower in high temperature country than low temperature country with exceptions. The minimum effect of summer temperature may not be effective to control the pandemic rather need to apply the control measures of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Md.Abdus Sobur","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Hygiene, Faculty of Veterinary Science, Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh 2202, Bangladesh."},{"author_name":"Md.Saiful Islam","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Hygiene, Faculty of Veterinary Science, Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh 2202, Bangladesh."},{"author_name":"Md.Emdadul Haque","author_inst":"Faculty of Fisheries, Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh 2202, Bangladesh."},{"author_name":"AMM Taufiquer Rahman","author_inst":"Naogaon District Hospital, Naogaon, Bangladesh."},{"author_name":"Md.Taohidul Islam","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Science, Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh 2202, Bangladesh."},{"author_name":"Antonio Toniolo","author_inst":"Global Virus Network, University of Insubria, 21100 Varese, Italy."},{"author_name":"Md.Tanvir Rahman","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Hygiene, Faculty of Veterinary Science, Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh 2202, Bangladesh."},{"author_name":"Hyoseon Choi","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Seon Yeong Gong","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea"},{"author_name":"Jaehun Jung","author_inst":"Department of Preventive Medicine, Gachon University College of Medicine; Artificial Intelligence and Big-Data Convergence Center, Gil Medical Center, Gachon Un"},{"author_name":"David Morquin","author_inst":"Montpellier University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Vincent Foulongne","author_inst":"University of Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Arnaud Bourdin","author_inst":"University of Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Vincent Le Moing","author_inst":"University of Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Philippe Van de Perre","author_inst":"University of Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Markus Noethen","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Anna-Maria Eis-Huebinger","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Martin Exner","author_inst":"Institute for Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Ricarda Schmithausen","author_inst":"Institute for Hygiene and Public Health, University Hospital, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Matthias Schmid","author_inst":"Institute for Medical Biometry, Informatics and Epidemiology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Gunther Hartmann","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital, University of Bonn, Germany; German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), partne"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.05.20092635","rel_title":"Studies of Novel Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) Pandemic: A Global Analysis of Literature","rel_date":"2020-05-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.05.20092635","rel_abs":"An exponential growth of literature about novel coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has been observed in the last few months.

Objective: To evaluate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on public surfaces in a densely populated urban area in Brazil. Design and Setting: A total of 101 samples were collected from different surfaces in public places in the region of Belo Horizonte with the highest number of COVID-19 cases. Samples were collected near the hospital and public transportation areas using sterile swabs, and then submitted to nucleic acid extraction and genomic detection and quantification by one-step qPCR. Results: Seventeen of the 101 samples tested positive (16.8%) for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, including samples from bus stations\/terminals, public squares, and sidewalks, including those near hospitals. Conclusions and Relevance: Our data indicated the contamination of public surfaces by SARS-CoV-2, especially near hospital areas, highlighting the risk of infection for the population. Constant monitoring of the virus in urban areas is required as a strategy to fight the pandemic and prevent further infections.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jonatas Santos Abrahao","author_inst":"UFMG"},{"author_name":"Livia Sacchetto Pengo","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Izabela Mauricio Rezende","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo Rodrigues","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Ana Paula Correia Crispim","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Cesar Moura","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Diogo Correa Mendonca","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Erik Reis","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Fernanda Souza","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Gabriela Fernanda Garcia Oliveira","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Iago Jose da Silva Domingos","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Paulo Boratto","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Pedro Henrique Bastos e Silva","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Victoria Fulgencio Queiroz","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Thais Barbara de Souza Silva","author_inst":"Instituto Rene Rachou"},{"author_name":"Graziele Pereira Oliveira","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Viviane de Souza Alves","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Pedro Augusto Alves","author_inst":"Instituto Rene Rachou"},{"author_name":"Erna Geessien Kroon","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Giliane de Souza Trindade","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Betania Paiva Drumond","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.02.20088559","rel_title":"Efficacy of remdesivir in COVID-19 patients with a simulated two-arm controlled study","rel_date":"2020-05-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.02.20088559","rel_abs":"While the recent study on the compassionate use of remdesivir for COVID-19 patients has shown a 68% clinical improvement7 it is a one-arm study that renders the evaluation of the efficacy in reducing death and the length of stay of hospitalization intractable due to a lacking of the control group. We came up with a two-arm controlled study design to simulate the treated and the untreated (control group) group by applying two respective transition models to the empirical data on dynamics of the disease severity (Figure 2 of the original article7) that are classified into low- (no and low oxygen supplement), medium- (non-invasive ventilator and high oxygen supplement), and high-(ECMO and invasive ventilator) from enrolment until discharge, death or the end of follow-up. By using a simulated two-arm controlled study, the remdesivir treatment group as opposed to the control group led to a statistically significantly 29% (95% CI: 22-35%) reduction of death from COVID-19. The treated group also revealed a 33% (95% CI 28-38%) significantly higher odds of discharge than the control group. The median time to discharge for the treated group (5.5 days, 16.5 days, and 29.5 days for low-, medium-, and high-risk state, respectively) was around half of those of the control arm. Our results with a simulated two-arm controlled study have not only corroborated the efficacy of remdesivir but also made great contribution to designing a further large-scale randomized controlled trial. They have significant implications for reducing transmission probability and infectious time of COVID-19 patients when contacting with susceptible health care workers during hospitalization.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chen-Yang Hsu","author_inst":"Dachung Hospital, Miaoli, Taiwan."},{"author_name":"Chao-Chih Lai","author_inst":"Emergency Department of Taipei City Hospital, Ren-Ai Branch, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Amy Ming-Fang Yen","author_inst":"School of Oral Hygiene, College of Oral Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Sam Li-She Chen","author_inst":"School of Oral Hygiene, College of Oral Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Hsiu-Hsi Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, College of Public Health, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Cesar Moura","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Diogo Correa Mendonca","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Erik Reis","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Fernanda Souza","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Gabriela Fernanda Garcia Oliveira","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Iago Jose da Silva Domingos","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Paulo Boratto","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Pedro Henrique Bastos e Silva","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Victoria Fulgencio Queiroz","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Thais Barbara de Souza Silva","author_inst":"Instituto Rene Rachou"},{"author_name":"Graziele Pereira Oliveira","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Viviane de Souza Alves","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Pedro Augusto Alves","author_inst":"Instituto Rene Rachou"},{"author_name":"Erna Geessien Kroon","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Giliane de Souza Trindade","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Betania Paiva Drumond","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.04.20088104","rel_title":"IDentif.AI: Artificial Intelligence Pinpoints Remdesivir in Combination with Ritonavir and Lopinavir as an Optimal Regimen Against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)","rel_date":"2020-05-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.04.20088104","rel_abs":"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to the rapid initiation of urgently needed clinical trials of repurposed drug combinations and monotherapies. These regimens were primarily relying on mechanism-of-action based selection of drugs, many of which have yielded positive in vitro but largely negative clinical outcomes. To overcome this challenge, we report the use of IDentif.AI, a platform that rapidly optimizes infectious disease (ID) combination therapy design using artificial intelligence (AI). In this study, IDentif.AI was implemented on a 12-drug candidate therapy search set representing over 530,000 possible drug combinations. IDentif.AI demonstrated that the optimal combination therapy against SARS-CoV-2 was comprised of remdesivir, ritonavir, and lopinavir, which mediated a 6.5-fold improvement in efficacy over remdesivir alone. Additionally, IDentif.AI showed hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin to be relatively ineffective. The identification of a clinically actionable optimal drug combination was completed within two weeks, with a 3-order of magnitude reduction in the number of tests typically needed. IDentif.AI analysis was also able to independently confirm clinical trial outcomes to date without requiring any data from these trials. The robustness of the IDentif.AI platform suggests that it may be applicable towards rapid development of optimal drug regimens to address current and future outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Agata Blasiak","author_inst":"The N.1 Institute for Health (N.1), Institute for Digital Medicine (WisDM), and Department of Biomedical Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapor"},{"author_name":"Jhin Jieh Lim","author_inst":"Cancer Science Institute, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117599"},{"author_name":"Shirley Gek Kheng Seah","author_inst":"Defence Medical and Environmental Research Institute, DSO National Laboratories, Singapore 117510 Singapore"},{"author_name":"Theodore Kee","author_inst":"The N.1 Institute for Health (N.1), Institute for Digital Medicine (WisDM), and Department of Biomedical Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapor"},{"author_name":"Alexandria Remus","author_inst":"The N.1 Institute for Health (N.1), Institute for Digital Medicine (WisDM), and Department of Biomedical Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapor"},{"author_name":"De Hoe Chye","author_inst":"Defence Medical and Environmental Research Institute, DSO National Laboratories, Singapore 117510 Singapore"},{"author_name":"Pui San Wong","author_inst":"Defence Medical and Environmental Research Institute, DSO National Laboratories, Singapore 117510 Singapore"},{"author_name":"Lissa Hooi","author_inst":"Cancer Science Institute, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117599"},{"author_name":"Anh T.L.

Famotidine is commonly used for gastric acid suppression but has recently gained attention as an antiviral that may inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. This study tested whether famotidine use is associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 initially hospitalized to a non-intensive care setting. Methods: This was retrospective cohort study conducted among consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection from February 25 to April 13, 2020 at a single medical center. The primary exposure was famotidine, received within 24 hours of hospital admission. The primary outcome was intubation or death. Propensity score matching was used to balance the baseline characteristics of patients who did and did not use famotidine. Results: 1,620 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were identified including 84 (5.1%) who received famotidine within 24 hours of hospital admission. 340 (21%) patients met the study composite outcome of death or intubation. Use of famotidine was associated with reduced risk for death or intubation (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.42, 95% CI 0.21-0.85) and also with reduced risk for death alone (aHR 0.30, 95% CI 0.11-0.80). After balancing baseline patient characteristics using propensity score matching, these relationships were unchanged (HR for famotidine and death or intubation 0.43, 95% CI 0.21-0.88). Proton pump inhibitors, which also suppress gastric acid, were not associated with reduced risk for death or intubation. Conclusion: Famotidine use is associated with reduced risk of intubation or death in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Randomized controlled trials are warranted to determine whether famotidine therapy improves outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel E Freedberg","author_inst":"Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Joseph Conigliaro","author_inst":"Northwell Health"},{"author_name":"Magdalena E Sobieszczyk","author_inst":"Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"David D Markowitz","author_inst":"Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Aakriti Gupta","author_inst":"ddm1@cumc.columbia.edu"},{"author_name":"Max R.

These tests differ between one another in several ways. Here, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of currently available SARS-CoV-2 serological tests, and assessed their real-world performance under scenarios of varying proportion of infected individuals. We included independent studies that specified the antigen used for antibody detection and used quantitative methods. We identified nine independent studies, of which six were based on commercial ELISA or CMIA\/CLIA assays, and three on in-house tests. Test sensitivity ranged from 68% to 93% for IgM, from 65% to 100% for IgG, and from 83% to 98% for total antibodies. Random-effects models yielded a summary sensitivity of 82% (95%CI 75-88%) for IgM, and 85% for both IgG (95%CI 73-93%) and total antibodies (95%CI 74-94%). Specificity was very high for most tests, and its pooled estimate was 98% (95%CI 92-100%) for IgM and 99% (95%CI 98-100%) for both IgG and total antibodies. The heterogeneity of sensitivity and specificity across tests was generally high (I2[&le;]50%). In populations with a low prevalence ([&le;]5%) of seroconverted individuals, the positive predictive value would be [&le;]88% for most assays, except those reporting perfect specificity. Our data suggest that the use of serological tests for large-scale prevalence surveys (or to grant \"immunity passports\") are currently only justified in hard-hit regions, while they should be used with caution elsewhere.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Saverio Caini","author_inst":"Institute for Cancer Research, Prevention and Clinical Network (ISPRO)"},{"author_name":"Federica Bellerba","author_inst":"European Institute of Oncology (IEO), IRCCS, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Federica Corso","author_inst":"European Institute of Oncology (IEO), IRCCS, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Angelica Diaz-Basabe","author_inst":"European Institute of Oncology (IEO), IRCCS, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Gioacchino Natoli","author_inst":"European Institute of Oncology (IEO), IRCCS, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"John Paget","author_inst":"Netherlands Institute for Health Services Research (NIVEL), Utrecht, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Federica Facciotti","author_inst":"European Institute of Oncology (IEO), IRCCS, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Sara Raimondi","author_inst":"European Institute of Oncology (IEO), IRCCS, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Domenico Palli","author_inst":"Institute for Cancer Research, Prevention and Clinical Network (ISPRO), Florence, Italy"},{"author_name":"Luca Mazzarella","author_inst":"European Institute of Oncology (IEO), IRCCS, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Pier Giuseppe Pelicci","author_inst":"European Institute of Oncology (IEO), IRCCS, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Paolo Vineis","author_inst":"MRC Centre for Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Imperial College, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Sara Gandini","author_inst":"European Institute of Oncology (IEO), IRCCS, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Philip D.

RBD-specific IgG responses were detectable in all patients 6 days after PCR confirmation. Using a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2, neutralizing antibody titers were also detectable in all patients 6 days after PCR confirmation. The magnitude of RBD-specific IgG binding titers correlated strongly with viral neutralization. In a clinical setting, the initial analysis of the dynamics of RBD-specific IgG titers was corroborated in a larger cohort of PCR-confirmed patients (n=231).

One barrier to widespread testing has been a paucity of traditional respiratory viral swab collection kits relative to the demand. Whether other sample collection kits, such as widely available MRSA nasal swabs can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 is unknown. Methods: We compared simultaneous nasal MRSA swabs (COPAN ESwabs 480C flocked nasal swab in 1mL of liquid Amies medium) and virals wabs (BD H192(07) flexible mini-tip flocked nasopharyngeal swabs in 3mL Universal Transport Medium) for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing using Simplexa COVID-19 Direct assay on patients over a 4-day period. When the results were discordant, the viral swab sample was run again on the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay. Results: Of the 81 included samples, there were 19 positives and 62 negatives in viral media and 18 positives and 63 negative in the MRSA swabs. Amongst all included samples, there was concordance between the COPAN ESwabs 480C and the viral swabs in 78 (96.3%). Conclusion: We found a high rate of concordance in test results between COPAN ESwabs 480C in Amies solution and BD H192(07) nasopharyngeal swabs in in 3 mL of Universal Viral Transport medium viral media. Clinicians and laboratories should feel better informed and assured using COPAN ESwabs 480C to help in the diagnosis of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daneil G Federman","author_inst":"VA Connecticut Healthcare System"},{"author_name":"Shaili Gupta","author_inst":"VA Connecticut Healthcare System"},{"author_name":"Gary Stack","author_inst":"VA Connecticut Healthcare System"},{"author_name":"Sheldon M Campbell","author_inst":"VA Connecticut Healthcare System"},{"author_name":"David R Peaper","author_inst":"VA Connecticut Healthcare System"},{"author_name":"Louise M Dembry","author_inst":"VA Connecticut Healthcare System"},{"author_name":"Ann Fisher","author_inst":"VA Connecticut Healthcare System"},{"author_name":"Asim F Tarabar","author_inst":"VA Connecticut Healthcare System"},{"author_name":"Michael Kozal","author_inst":"VA Connecticut Healthcare System"},{"author_name":"Christopher B Ruser","author_inst":"VA Connecticut Healthcare System"},{"author_name":"Melanie Sherman","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Stacian Reynolds","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Hans Verkerke","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"David N Alter","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Jeannette Guarner","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Janetta Bryksin","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Michael Horwath","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Connie Arthur","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Natia Saakadze","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Geoffrey Hughes Smith","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Srilatha Edupuganti","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Erin M Scherer","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Kieffer Hellmeister","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Andrew Cheng","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Juliet A Morales","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Andrew S Neish","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Sean R Stowell","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Filipp Frank","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Eric Ortlund","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Evan Anderson","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Vineet Menachery","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Nadine Rouphael","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Aneesh Metha","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"David S Stephens","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Rafi Ahmed","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"John Roback","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Jens Wrammert","author_inst":"Emory University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc0","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20055947","rel_title":"A 5-min RNA preparation method for COVID-19 detection with RT-qPCR","rel_date":"2020-05-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20055947","rel_abs":"RNA extraction has become a bottleneck for detection of COVID-19, in part because of reagent shortages.

Methods: We collected clinical, laboratory and imaging data from 65 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection based on PCR positivity. IL-6, CRP, leukocyte and lymphocyte counts were determined in blood samples. Two radiologists evaluated the severity of imaging findings in computed tomography (CT) images on a scale from 1 (no characteristic signs of COVID-19) to 5 (confluent ground glass opacities in over 50% of the lung parenchyma). The volume of affected lung was quantified using commercially available software. Machine learning modelling was performed to estimate the risk for intensive care unit treatment. Findings: Patients with a severe course of COVID-19 had significantly increased IL-6, CRP and leukocyte counts and significantly decreased lymphocyte counts. The radiological severity grading was significantly increased in ICU patients. Multivariate random forest modelling showed a mean +\/- standard deviation sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 0.72 +\/- 0.1, 0.86 +\/- 0.16 and 0.80 +\/- 0.1 and a ROC-AUC of 0.79 +\/- 0.1.

People experiencing homelessness are vulnerable to infection and severe disease. Health and housing authorities in England have developed a residential intervention that aims to isolate those vulnerable to severe disease (COVID-PROTECT) and care for people with symptoms (COVID CARE). Methods: We used a discrete-time Markov chain model to forecast COVID-19 infections among people experiencing homelessness, given strong containment measures in the general population and some transmission among 35,817 people living in 1,065 hostels, and 11,748 people sleeping rough (the 'do nothing' scenario). We then estimated demand for beds if those eligible are offered COVID-PROTECT and COVID-CARE. We estimated the reduction in the number of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and hospital admissions that could be achieved by these interventions. We also conducted sensitivity and scenario analyses to identify programme success factors. Results: In a 'do nothing' scenario, we estimate that 34% of the homeless population could get COVID-19 between March and August 2020, with 364 deaths, 4,074 hospital admissions and 572 critical care admissions. In our 'base intervention' scenario, demand for COVID-PROTECT peaks at 9,934 beds, and demand for COVID-CARE peaks at 1,366 beds. The intervention could reduce transmission by removing symptomatic individuals from the community, and preventing vulnerable individuals from being infected. This could lead to a reduction of 164 deaths, 2,624 hospital admissions, and 248 critical care admissions over this period. Sensitivity analyses showed that the number of deaths is sensitive to transmission of COVID-19 in COVID-PROTECT.
