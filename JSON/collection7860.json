Yet, as there is no treatment nor a vaccine that was approved so far, universal safety precautions (USPs) and mitigating strategies are the only way to deal with this emergency crisis. However, knowledge and beliefs towards USPs among the general public in countries such as India with a large population are lacking. Methods: A prospective, cross-sectional, web-based online survey was conducted among the general public in India during March 2020. A 20-items self-administered survey questionnaire was developed and randomly distributed among the public using google document forms through social media networks. Descriptive statistics were used in representing the study characteristics, and the Chi-square test was used in assessing the associations among the study variables with a p-value of < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: Of 1287 participants, 1117 have given their consent of willingness and completed the questionnaire with a response rate of 86.8%. The mean age of the study participants was 28.8 {+\/-} 10.9 years, where the majority of them belong to the age category <25 years, and sex was equally distributed. Based upon the socio-demographic information, the majority were post-graduates (32.9%), professional job holders (45%) and belonged to the upper-middle (40%) economic class. Overall, the knowledge and beliefs towards USPs and mitigating strategies among participants varied between moderate to high, with statistically significant associations with their socio-demographic characteristics. Conclusions: Although the knowledge and beliefs of the general public in India towards USPs are encouraging, there is a need for long-term educational interventions as the dynamics and severity of COVID-19 have been changing day-by-day rapidly. The findings of this study could guide the public health authorities in making and implementing decisions to combat this pandemic.

Design: A cross-sectional survey Setting: Conducted with a nationally representative sample of UK adults within 48 hours of the UK Government advising the public to stop non-essential contact with others and all unnecessary travel. Participants: 2,108 adults living in the UK aged 18 years and over. Data were collected between March 17 and 18 2020. Main outcome measures: Descriptive statistics for all survey questions, including the number of respondents and the weighted percentages. Logistic regression was used to identify sociodemographic variation in: (1) adoption of social-distancing measures, (2) ability to work from home, and (3) willingness and (4) ability to self-isolate. Results Overall, 1,992 (94.2%) respondents reported taking at least one preventive measure: 85.8% washed their hands with soap more frequently; 56.5% avoided crowded areas and 54.5% avoided social events. Adoption of social-distancing measures was higher in those aged over 70 compared to younger adults aged 18 to 34 years (aOR:1.9; 95% CI:1.1 to 3.4). Those with the lowest household income were six times less likely to be able to work from home (aOR:0.16; 95% CI:0.09 to 0.26) and three times less likely to be able to self-isolate (aOR:0.31; 95% CI:0.16 to 0.58). Ability to self-isolate was also lower in black and minority ethnic groups (aOR:0.47; 95% CI:0.27 to 0.82). Willingness to self-isolate was high across all respondents. Conclusions The ability to adopt and comply with certain NPIs is lower in the most economically disadvantaged in society. Governments must implement appropriate social and economic policies to mitigate this. By incorporating these differences in NPIs among socio-economic subpopulations into mathematical models of COVID-19 transmission dynamics, our modelling of epidemic outcomes and response to COVID-19 can be improved.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christina J Atchison","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Leigh Bowman","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Vrinten","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Rozlyn Redd","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Philippa Pristera","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey W Eaton","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Helen Ward","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.01.20048561","rel_title":"Use of siltuximab in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring ventilatory support","rel_date":"2020-04-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.01.20048561","rel_abs":"Background Severe COVID-19 is characterised by interstitial pneumonia and hyperinflammation, with elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6. Effective treatments are urgently needed, and IL-6 is a rational target to reduce hyperinflammation. Methods An observational, control cohort, single-centre study initiated at the Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital in Bergamo, Italy included patients with COVID-19 confirmed by a nasopharyngeal swab positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA and interstitial pneumonia requiring ventilatory support. Patients were treated with either best supportive care and siltuximab or best supportive care alone. Propensity score matching was applied to minimise differences in baseline covariates between patient cohorts. The main outcome was mortality in siltuximab-treated patients compared with patients in the matched-control cohort. This study (Siltuximab in Severe COVID-19, SISCO) is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT04322188. Findings Thirty patients received siltuximab, while 188 control patients received only best supportive care. Siltuximab-treated patients were matched to 30 control patients using the propensity score analysis of baseline covariates. The 30-day mortality rate was significantly lower in the siltuximab-treated than the matched-control cohort patients (HR 0.462, 95% CI 0.221-0.965); p=0.0399). The mean follow-up was 33.3 days (range 7-58 days) for the siltuximab-treated patients and 22.8 days (range 2-45 days) for the control cohort. Sixteen siltuximab-treated patients were discharged from hospital, four remained on mechanical ventilation, and 10 patients died. Interpretation Patients with rapidly progressing COVID-19 respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support may benefit from treatment with siltuximab to reduce mortality and cytokine-driven hyperinflammation associated with severe disease. These findings require validation in a randomised controlled clinical trial. Funding Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital and the Italian Association for Cancer Research funded the study. EUSA Pharma supplied siltuximab, and provided funding for data collection, analysis, and development of the publication.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giuseppe Gritti","author_inst":"Hematology Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Federico Raimondi","author_inst":"Pneumology Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Diego Ripamonti","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Ivano Riva","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesco Landi","author_inst":"Hematology Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Alborghetti","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marco Frigeni","author_inst":"Hematology Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marianna Damiani","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Caterina Mic\u00f2","author_inst":"Hematology Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Stefano Fagiuoli","author_inst":"Gastroenterology Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Roberto Cosentini","author_inst":"Emergency Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Ferdinando Luca Lorini","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Lucia Gandini","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitaria Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Luca Novelli","author_inst":"Pneumology Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitaria Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Jonathan P Morgan","author_inst":"EUSA Pharma, Breakspear Park, Hemel Hempstead, UK"},{"author_name":"Benjamin M.J.

Models agree that flattening the curve without controlling the epidemic completely is insufficient and will lead to an overwhelmed health service. A recent model, calibrated for the UK and US, demonstrated this starkly. Methods: We used a simple compartmental deterministic model of COVID-19 transmission in Australia, to illustrate the dynamics resulting from shifting or flattening the curve versus completely squashing it. Results: We find that when the reproduction number is close to one, a small decrease in transmission leads to a large reduction in burden (i.e., cases, deaths and hospitalisations) but achieving this early in the epidemic through social distancing interventions also implies that the community will not reach herd immunity. Conclusions: Australia needs not just to shift and flatten the curve but to squash it by getting the reproduction number below one.

Numerical simulations show that strict suppression measures at the beginning of an epidemic can create low infectious numbers, which thereafter can be managed by mitigation measures over longer periods to flatten the epidemic curve. The stronger the suppression measure, the faster it achieves the low numbers of infections that are conducive to subsequent management. Our results on short-term strategies point to a two-step control strategy, following failed mitigation, that begins with suppression of the reproduction number, RC, below 1.0, followed by renewed mitigation measures that manage the epidemic by maintaining the effective reproduction number RCeff{approx}Rc S\/N at approximately 1.0. The objectives of the full sequence of measures observed in a number of countries, and likely to be seen in the longer term, can be symbolically represented as: R0 [-&gt;] RC<R0 [-&gt;] RC<1.0 [-&gt;] RCeff{approx}1.0.

We analyze the contribution of two key determinants of the variation in the observed CFR: the age-structure of diagnosed infection cases and age-specific case-fatality rates. We use data on diagnosed COVID-19 cases and death counts attributable to COVID-19 by age for China, Germany, Italy, South Korea, Spain, the United States, and New York City. We calculate the CFR for each population at the latest data point and also for Italy over time. We use demographic decomposition to break the difference between CFRs into unique contributions arising from the age-structure of confirmed cases and the age-specific case-fatality. In late April 2020, CFRs varied from 2.2% in South Korea to 13.0% in Italy. The age-structure of detected cases often explains more than two thirds of cross-country variation in the CFR. In Italy, the CFR increased from 4.2% to 13.0% between March 9 and April 22, 2020, and more than 90% of the change was due to increasing age-specific case-fatality rates. The importance of the age-structure of confirmed cases likely reflects several factors, including different testing regimes and differences in transmission trajectories; while increasing age-specific case-fatality rates in Italy could indicate other factors, such as the worsening health outcomes of those infected with COVID-19. Our findings lend support to recommendations for data to be disaggregated by age, and potentially other variables, to facilitate a better understanding of population-level differences in CFRs. They also show the need for well designed seroprevalence studies to ascertain the extent to which differences in testing regimes drive differences in the age-structure of detected cases.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christian Dudel","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research"},{"author_name":"Tim Riffe","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research"},{"author_name":"Enrique Acosta","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research"},{"author_name":"Alyson A. van Raalte","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research"},{"author_name":"Cosmo Strozza","author_inst":"Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Mikko Myrskyla","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research"},{"author_name":"Weibing Wang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China"},{"author_name":"Marianna Damiani","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Caterina Mic\u00f2","author_inst":"Hematology Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Stefano Fagiuoli","author_inst":"Gastroenterology Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Roberto Cosentini","author_inst":"Emergency Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Ferdinando Luca Lorini","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Lucia Gandini","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitaria Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Luca Novelli","author_inst":"Pneumology Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitaria Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Jonathan P Morgan","author_inst":"EUSA Pharma, Breakspear Park, Hemel Hempstead, UK"},{"author_name":"Benjamin M.J.

Methods: Cross-sectional online survey of 1,034 U.S. residents age 18+ conducted on March 17, 2020. Results: For every point increase in knowledge, the odds of participation in purchasing more goods (OR=0.88, 95% CI:0.81-0.95), attending large gatherings (OR=0.87, 95%CI: 0.81-0.93), and using medical masks (OR=0.56, 95% CI:0.50-0.62) decreased by 12%, 13%, and 44%, respectively. Gen X and Millennial participants had 56% to 76% higher odds, respectively, of increased purchasing behavior, compared to Baby Boomers. Results suggest politicization of response recommendations. Democrats had 30% lower odds of attending large gatherings (OR=0.70, 95% CI:0.50-0.97), and 48% lower odds of using medical masks (OR=0.52, 95% CI:0.34-0.78), compared to Republicans. Conclusions: This survey is one of the first attempts to study determinants of knowledge and behaviors in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. A national, coordinated effort at pandemic response may ensure better compliance with behavioral recommendations to address this public health emergency.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"John M.

Italy has the highest rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the highest number of deaths, and the highest mortality rate among large countries. Worldwide, a more severe course of COVID-19 is associated with older age, comorbidities, and male sex. Hence, we searched for possible genetic components of the peculiar severity of COVID-19 among Italians, by looking at expression levels and variants in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes, which are crucial for viral infection. Methods: Exome and SNP array data from a large Italian cohort representative of the country's population were used to compare the burden of rare variants and the frequency of polymorphisms with European and East Asian populations. Moreover, we looked into gene expression databases to check for sex-unbalanced expression. Results: While we found no significant evidence that ACE2 is associated with disease severity\/sex bias in the Italian population, TMPRSS2 levels and genetic variants proved to be possible candidate disease modulators, contributing to the observed epidemiological data among Italian patients. Conclusions: Our analysis suggests a role for TMPRSS2 variants and expression levels in modulating COVID-19 severity, a hypothesis that fosters a rapid experimental validation on large cohorts of patients with different clinical manifestations.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rosanna Asselta","author_inst":"Humanitas University"},{"author_name":"Elvezia Maria Paraboschi","author_inst":"Humanitas University"},{"author_name":"Alberto Mantovani","author_inst":"Humanitas University"},{"author_name":"Stefano Duga","author_inst":"Humanitas University"},{"author_name":"Cosmo Strozza","author_inst":"Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Mikko Myrskyla","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research"},{"author_name":"Weibing Wang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China"},{"author_name":"Marianna Damiani","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Caterina Mic\u00f2","author_inst":"Hematology Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Stefano Fagiuoli","author_inst":"Gastroenterology Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Roberto Cosentini","author_inst":"Emergency Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Ferdinando Luca Lorini","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Lucia Gandini","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitaria Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Luca Novelli","author_inst":"Pneumology Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitaria Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Jonathan P Morgan","author_inst":"EUSA Pharma, Breakspear Park, Hemel Hempstead, UK"},{"author_name":"Benjamin M.J.

This paper explores the mechanism of the influence of information diffusion on the spread of the novel coronavirus, develops a model of the interaction between information diffusion and disease transmission based on the SIR model, and empirically tests the role and mechanism of information diffusion in the spread of COCID-19 by using econometric method. The result shows that there was a significant negative correlation between the information diffusion and the spread of the novel coronavirus; The result of robust test shows that the spread of both epidemic information and protection information hindered the further spread of the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lin Shanlang","author_inst":"School of Economics and Management, Tongji University, China"},{"author_name":"Ma Chao","author_inst":"School of Economics and Management, Tongji University, China"},{"author_name":"Lin Ruofei","author_inst":"School of Economics and Management, Tongji University, China"},{"author_name":"Huang Junpei","author_inst":"School of Economics and Management, Tongji University, China"},{"author_name":"Xu Ruohan","author_inst":"School of Economics and Management, Tongji University, China"},{"author_name":"Yuan Aini","author_inst":"School of Economics and Management, Tongji University, China"},{"author_name":"Weibing Wang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China"},{"author_name":"Marianna Damiani","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Caterina Mic\u00f2","author_inst":"Hematology Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Stefano Fagiuoli","author_inst":"Gastroenterology Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Roberto Cosentini","author_inst":"Emergency Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Ferdinando Luca Lorini","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Lucia Gandini","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitaria Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Luca Novelli","author_inst":"Pneumology Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitaria Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Jonathan P Morgan","author_inst":"EUSA Pharma, Breakspear Park, Hemel Hempstead, UK"},{"author_name":"Benjamin M.J.

COVID-19 forecasts have played an important role in capturing the probability of infection and the basic reproduction rate. In this study, we predicted some trajectories of trajectories associated with COVID-19 in the coming days in India using an Auto-regression integrated moving average model (ARIMA) and Richards model. By the end of April 2020, the incidence of new cases is predicted to be 5200 (95% CI: 4650 to 6002) through the ARIMA model versus be 6378 (95% CI: 4904 to 7851) Richard model. We estimated that there would be a total of 197 (95% CI: 118 to 277) deaths and drop down in the recovery rates will reach around 501 (95% CI: 245 to 758) by the end of April 2020.

Following closely the growth dynamics of the disease is one of the pillars towards achieving that goal. Objective: We aimed at developing a simple framework to facilitate the analysis of the growth rate (cases\/day) and growth acceleration (cases\/day^2) of COVID-19 cases in real-time. Methods: The framework was built using the Moving Regression (MR) technique and a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The dynamics of the pandemic was initially modeled via combinations of four different growth stages: lagging (beginning of the outbreak), exponential (rapid growth), deceleration (growth decay) and stationary (near zero growth). A fifth growth behavior, namely linear growth (constant growth above zero), was further introduced to add more flexibility to the framework. An R Shiny application was developed, which can be accessed at http:\/\/www.theguarani.com.br\/covid-19 or downloaded from https:\/\/github.com\/adamtaiti\/SARS-CoV-2. The framework was applied to data from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), which comprised 853,200 cases reported worldwide as of April 2nd 2020. Results: We found that the impact of public health measures on the prevalence of COVID-19 could be perceived in seemingly real-time by monitoring growth acceleration curves. Restriction to human mobility produced detectable decline in growth acceleration within few days, deceleration within ~2 weeks and near-stationary growth within ~6 weeks. Countries exhibiting different permutations of the five growth stages indicated that the evolution of COVID-19 prevalence is more complex and dynamic than previously appreciated. Conclusions: These results corroborate that mass social isolation is a highly effective measure against the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2, as previously suggested. Apart from the analysis of prevalence partitioned by country, the proposed framework is easily applicable to city, state, region and arbitrary territory data, serving as an asset to monitor the local behavior of COVID-19 cases.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yuri Tani Utsunomiya","author_inst":"Department of Support, Production and Animal Health, School of Veterinary Medicine of Aracatuba, Sao Paulo State University (Unesp), 16050-680 R.

The peak of the epidemics has not yet been reached and it is expected to be delayed in Central and Southern Italian regions compared to Northern ones. Objective: We have modeled the Covid-19 outbreak progression in Italian Regions vs. Lombardy to assess the epidemics. Primary and Secondary Measures: In our models, we have estimated the basic reproduction number (R0) which represents the average number of people that can be infected by a person who has already acquired the infection both by fitting the exponential growth rate of the infection across a 1month period and also by using day by day assessment, based on single observations. We used the susceptible exposed infected removed (SEIR) compartment model to predict the spreading of the pandemic in Italy. Results. The two methods provide agreements of values, although the first method based on exponential fit should provide a better estimation, being computed on the entire time series. Taking into account the growth rate of the infection across a 1-month period, in Lombardy each infected person has involved other 5 people (4.94 based on data of March 22nd) compared to a value of R0=2.68 reported in the Chinese city of Whuan. According to our model and Piedmont, Veneto, Emilia Romagna, Tuscany and Marche reach an R0 value up to 4. The R0 is 3.7 for Lazio and 3.6 for Campania region, where this latter shows the highest value among the Southern Italian regions, followed by Apulia (3.5), Sicily (3.4), Abruzzo (3.4), Calabria (3.1), Basilicata (2.5) and Molise (2.4). The value of R0 is decreasing in Lombardy and Northern Regions, while it is increasing in Central and Southern Regions. Conclusion. The peak is expected by March 29th at national level.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"COSIMO DISTANTE","author_inst":"CNR ISASI, Institute of Applied Sciences and Intelligence Systems, Lecce, Italy"},{"author_name":"PRISCO PISCITELLI","author_inst":"Euro Mediterranean Scientific Biomedical Institute (ISBEM), Bruxelles, Belgium"},{"author_name":"ALESSANDRO MIANI","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Science and Policy, University of Milan, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Silvana Cassia Paulan","author_inst":"International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Collaborating Centre on Animal Genomics and Bioinformatics, 16050-680 R.

While levels of genomic variability between SARS-CoV-2 isolates are limited, to our knowledge, it is not clear whether the observed patterns of variability in viral super-clades reflect ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2, or merely genetic drift and founder effects. Here, we analyze more than 1100 complete, high quality SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, and provide evidence for the absence of distinct evolutionary patterns\/signatures in the genomes of the currently known major clades of SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses suggest that the presence of distinct viral episomes at different geographic locations are consistent with founder effects, coupled with the rapid spread of this novel virus. We observe that while cross species adaptation of the virus is associated with hypervariability of specific protein coding regions (including the RDB domain of the spike protein), the more variable genomic regions between extant SARS-CoV-2 episomes correspond with the 3 and 5 UTRs, suggesting that at present viral protein coding genes should not be subjected to different adaptive evolutionary pressures in different viral strains. Although this study can not be conclusive, we believe that the evidence presented here is strongly consistent with the notion that the biased geographic distribution of SARS-CoV-2 isolates should not be associated with adaptive evolution of this novel pathogen.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matteo Chiara","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"David Stephen Horner","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Graziano Pesole","author_inst":"University of Bari"},{"author_name":"Silvana Cassia Paulan","author_inst":"International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Collaborating Centre on Animal Genomics and Bioinformatics, 16050-680 R.

For the first feature, the similar RBD identified in SARs-like virus from pangolin suggests the RBD in SARS-CoV-2 may already exist in animal host(s) before it transmitted into human. The left puzzle is the history and function of the insertion at S1\/S2 boundary, which is uniquely identified in SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we identified two variants from the first Guangdong SARS-CoV-2 cell strain, with deletion mutations on polybasic cleavage site (PRRAR) and its flank sites. More extensive screening indicates the deletion at the flank sites of PRRAR could be detected in 3 of 68 clinical samples and half of 22 in vitro isolated viral strains. These data indicate (1) the deletion of QTQTN, at the flank of polybasic cleavage site, is likely benefit the SARS-CoV-2 replication or infection in vitro but under strong purification selection in vivo since it is rarely identified in clinical samples; (2) there could be a very efficient mechanism for deleting this region from viral genome as the variants losing 23585-23599 is commonly detected after two rounds of cell passage. The mechanistic explanation for this in vitro adaptation and in vivo purification processes (or reverse) that led to such genomic changes in SARS-CoV-2 requires further work. Nonetheless, this study has provided valuable clues to aid further investigation of spike protein function and virus evolution. The deletion mutation identified in vitro isolation should be also noted for current vaccine development.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhe Liu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institution of Public Health, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Huanying Zheng","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Runyu Yuan","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institution of Public Health, Guangzhou"},{"author_name":"Mingyue Li","author_inst":"The Third Affilated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Huifang Lin","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institution of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Jingju Peng","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institution of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Qianlin Xiong","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institution of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Jiufeng Sun","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Institution of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Baisheng Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jie Wu","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Changwen Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Ruben J.G.

We exploited an integrated proteomics approach to systematically investigate intra-viral and virus-host interactomes for the identification of unrealized SARS-CoV-2 host targets and participation of cellular proteins in the response to viral infection using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from COVID-19 patients. Using this approach, we elucidated 251 host proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2 and more than 200 host proteins that are significantly perturbed in COVID-19 derived PBMCs. From the interactome, we further identified that non-structural protein nsp9 and nsp10 interact with NKRF, a NF-[Kcy]B repressor, and may precipitate the strong IL-8\/IL-6 mediated chemotaxis of neutrophils and overexuberant host inflammatory response observed in COVID-19 patients. Our integrative study not only presents a systematic examination of SARS-CoV-2-induced perturbation of host targets and cellular networks to reflect disease etiology, but also reveals insights into the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 triggers cytokine storms and represents a powerful resource in the quest for therapeutic intervention.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qiming Liang","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jingjiao Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mingquan Guo","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University,"},{"author_name":"Xiaoxu Tian","author_inst":"Shanghai Advanced Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Chengrong Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xin Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xing Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ping Wu","author_inst":"Shanghai Advanced Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zixuan Xiao","author_inst":"University of Alberta, Canada"},{"author_name":"Yafei Qu","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yue Yin","author_inst":"Shanghai Advanced Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Joyce Fu","author_inst":"University of California, Riverside"},{"author_name":"Zhaoqin Zhu","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zhenshan Liu","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chao Peng","author_inst":"Shanghai Advanced Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Tongyu Zhu","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Manuel Rosa-Calatrava","author_inst":"Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie"},{"author_name":"Gordana Tonkovic Reljanovic","author_inst":"Ergomed PLC, Guildford, UK"},{"author_name":"Marco Rizzi","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Fabiano Di Marco","author_inst":"Pneumology Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy; Health Sciences Department, University of Milan, Milan, Ital"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Rambaldi","author_inst":"Hematology Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitario Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy; Oncology-Hematology Department, University of Milan, Milan, "}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.31.013268","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 receptor and entry genes are expressed by sustentacular cells in the human olfactory neuroepithelium","rel_date":"2020-04-02","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.31.013268","rel_abs":"Various reports indicate an association between COVID-19 and anosmia, suggesting an infection of the olfactory sensory epithelium, and thus a possible direct virus access to the brain.

Overall results revealed that, SARS-CoV-2 codon usage is slightly biased similarly to other RNA viruses. Nucleotide and dinucleotide compositions displayed a bias toward A\/U content in all codon positions and CpU-ended codons preference, respectively. Eight common putative preferred codons were identified, and all of them were A\/U-ended (U-ended: 7, A-ended: 1). In addition, natural selection was found to be the main force structuring the codon usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2. However, mutation pressure and other factors such as compositional constraints and hydrophobicity had an undeniable contribution. Two adaptation indices were utilized and indicated that SARS-CoV-2 is moderately adapted to Homo sapiens compared to other human viruses.

We present 65 peptide sequences that we expect to result in a safe and effective vaccine which can be rapidly tested in DNA, mRNA, or synthetic peptide constructs. These include epitopes that are contained within evolutionarily divergent regions of the spike protein reported to increase infectivity through increased binding to the ACE2 receptor, and within a novel furin cleavage site thought to increase membrane fusion. This vaccination strategy specifically targets unique vulnerabilities of SARS-CoV-2 and should engage a robust adaptive immune response in the vast majority of the human population.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"John M Maris","author_inst":"CHOP"},{"author_name":"Ali Mostafa Anwar","author_inst":"Cairo University"},{"author_name":"Parth Shah","author_inst":"Uka Tarsadia University"},{"author_name":"Ramar Krishnamurthy","author_inst":"Uka Tarsadia University"},{"author_name":"Chen-Da Kan","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Veronique Pauli","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Kristof Egervari","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Johannes A.

The time-delay adjusted case fatality risk (CFR) of COVID-19 in Korea is yet to be estimated. Methods: We obtained the daily series of confirmed cases and deaths in Korea reported prior to May 9, 2020. Using statistical methods, we estimated the time-delay adjusted risk for death from COVID-19 in Daegu, Gyeongsangbuk-do, other regions in Korea, as well as the entire country. Results: Our model-based crude CFR fitted the observed data well throughout the course of the epidemic except for the very early stage in Gyeongsangbuk-do; this was partially due to the reporting delay. Our estimates of the risk of death in Gyeongsangbuk-do reached 25.9% (95% CrI: 19.6%-33.6%), 20.8% (95% CrI: 18.1%-24.0%) in Daegu and 1.7% (95% CrI: 1.1%-2.5%) in other regions, whereas the national estimate was 10.2% (95% CrI: 9.0%-11.5%). Conclusions: The latest estimates of CFR of COVID-19 in Korea are considerably high, even with the early implementation of public health interventions including widespread testing, social distancing, and delayed school openings. Geographic differences in the CFR are likely influenced by clusters tied to hospitals and nursing homes.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eunha Shim","author_inst":"Soongsil University"},{"author_name":"Kenji Mizumoto","author_inst":"Graduate School of Advanced Integrated Studies in Human Survivability, Kyoto University"},{"author_name":"Wongyeong Choi","author_inst":"Soongsil University"},{"author_name":"Gerardo Chowell","author_inst":"Georgia State University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Chen-Da Kan","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Veronique Pauli","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Kristof Egervari","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Johannes A.
