Objective: To determine important drivers of decisions to obtain a SARS-CoV-2 test in the context of increasing community transmission. Design: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was used to assess the relative importance of type of SARS-CoV-2 test, specimen type, testing venue, and results turnaround time. Uptake of an optimized testing scenario was simulated relative to the current typical testing scenario of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) via nasopharyngeal (NP) swab in a provider office or urgent care clinic with results in >5 days. Setting: Online survey, embedded in an existing cohort study, conducted during July 30 - September 8, 2020. Participants: Participants (n=4,793) were enrolled in the CHASING COVID Cohort Study, a national longitudinal cohort of adults >18 years residing in the 50 US states, Washington, DC, Puerto Rico, or Guam. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Relative importance of SARS-CoV-2 testing method attributes, utilities of specific attribute levels, and probability of choosing a testing scenario based on preferences estimated from the DCE, the current typical testing option, or choosing not to test. Results: Turnaround time for test results had the highest relative importance (30.4%), followed by test type (28.3%), specimen type (26.2%), and venue (15.0%). Participants preferred fast results on both past and current infection and using a noninvasive specimen, preferably collected at home. Simulations suggested that providing immediate or same day test results, providing both PCR and serology, or collecting oral specimens would substantially increase testing uptake over the current typical testing option. Simulated uptake of a hypothetical testing scenario of PCR and serology via a saliva sample at a pharmacy with same day results was 97.7%, compared to 0.6% for the current typical testing scenario, with 1.8% opting for no test. Conclusions and Relevance: Testing strategies that offer both PCR and serology with non-invasive methods and rapid turnaround time would likely have the most uptake and engagement among residents in communities with increasing community transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rebecca Zimba","author_inst":"Institute for Implementation Science in Population Health, City University of New York"},{"author_name":"Sarah Kulkarni","author_inst":"Institute for Implementation Science in Population Health, City University of New York"},{"author_name":"Amanda Berry","author_inst":"Institute for Implementation Science in Population Health, City University of New York"},{"author_name":"William You","author_inst":"Institute for Implementation Science in Population Health, City University of New York"},{"author_name":"Chloe Mirzayi","author_inst":"Institute for Implementation Science in Population Health, City University of New York"},{"author_name":"Drew Westmoreland","author_inst":"Institute for Implementation Science in Population Health, City University of New York"},{"author_name":"Angela Parcesepe","author_inst":"Gillings School of Public Health, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Levi Waldron","author_inst":"Institute for Implementation Science in Population Health, City University of New York"},{"author_name":"Madhura Rane","author_inst":"Institute for Implementation Science in Population Health, City University of New York"},{"author_name":"Shivani Kochhar","author_inst":"Institute for Implementation Science in Population Health, City University of New York"},{"author_name":"McKaylee Robertson","author_inst":"Institute for Implementation Science in Population Health, City University of New York"},{"author_name":"Andrew R Maroko","author_inst":"Institute for Implementation Science in Population Health, City University of New York"},{"author_name":"Christian Grov","author_inst":"Institute for Implementation Science in Population Health, City University of New York"},{"author_name":"Denis Nash","author_inst":"Institute for Implementation Science in Population Health, City University of New York"},{"author_name":"- for the CHASING COVID Cohort Study Team","author_inst":"-"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.15.20195453","rel_title":"Improvement and Multi-Population Generalizability of a Deep Learning-Based Chest Radiograph Severity Score for COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-09-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.15.20195453","rel_abs":"Purpose: To improve and test the generalizability of a deep learning-based model for assessment of COVID-19 lung disease severity on chest radiographs (CXRs) from different patient populations. Materials and Methods: A published convolutional Siamese neural network-based model previously trained on hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was tuned using 250 outpatient CXRs. This model produces a quantitative measure of COVID-19 lung disease severity (pulmonary x-ray severity (PXS) score). The model was evaluated on CXRs from four test sets, including 3 from the United States (patients hospitalized at an academic medical center (N=154), patients hospitalized at a community hospital (N=113), and outpatients (N=108)) and 1 from Brazil (patients at an academic medical center emergency department (N=303)). Radiologists from both countries independently assigned reference standard CXR severity scores, which were correlated with the PXS scores as a measure of model performance (Pearson r). The Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) technique was used to visualize the neural network results. Results: Tuning the deep learning model with outpatient data improved model performance in two United States hospitalized patient datasets (r=0.88 and r=0.90, compared to baseline r=0.86). Model performance was similar, though slightly lower, when tested on the United States outpatient and Brazil emergency department datasets (r=0.86 and r=0.85, respectively). UMAP showed that the model learned disease severity information that generalized across test sets. Conclusions: Performance of a deep learning-based model that extracts a COVID-19 severity score on CXRs improved using training data from a different patient cohort (outpatient versus hospitalized) and generalized across multiple populations.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matthew D Li","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nishanth T Arun","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mehak Aggarwal","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sharut Gupta","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Praveer Singh","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Brent P Little","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dexter P Mendoza","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gustavo C.A.

The ability of G and GO to interact with and bind microorganisms as well as RNA and DNA provides an opportunity to develop engineered textiles for use in PPE. The face masks widely used in health care and other high-risk settings for COVID transmission provide only a physical barrier that decreases likelihood of infection and do not inactivate the virus. Here, we show pre-incubation of viral particles with free GO inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection of VERO cells. Highly relevant to PPE materials, when either polyurethane or cotton material was loaded with G or GO and culture medium containing SARS-CoV-2 viral particles either filtered through or incubated with the functionalized materials, the infectivity of the medium was nearly completely inhibited. The findings presented here constitute an important nanomaterials-based strategy to significantly increase face mask and other PPE efficacy in protection against the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 that may be applicable to additional anti-SARS-CoV-2 measures including water filtration, air purification, and diagnostics.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Flavio De Maio","author_inst":"Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

By performing a meta-analysis of two independent genome-wide association (GWAS) summary datasets (N = 680,128), a novel locus at 21q22.11 was identified to be associated with COVID-19 infection (rs9976829 in IFNAR2 and upstream of IL10RB, OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.09 - 1.23, P = 2.57*10-6). The rs9976829 represents a strong splicing quantitative trait locus (sQTL) for both IFNAR2 and IL10RB genes, especially in lung tissue (P = 1.8*10-24). Gene-based association analysis also found IFNAR2 was significantly associated with COVID-19 infection (P = 2.58*10-7). Integrative genomics analysis of combining GWAS with eQTL data showed the expression variations of IFNAR2 and IL10RB have prominent effects on COVID-19 in various types of tissues, especially in lung tissue. The majority of IFNAR2-expressing cells were dendritic cells (40%) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (38.5%), and IL10RB-expressing cells were mainly nonclassical monocytes (29.6%). IFNAR2 and IL10RB are targeted by several interferons-related drugs. Together, our results uncover 21q22.11 as a novel susceptibility locus for COVID-19, in which individuals with G alleles of rs9976829 have a higher probability of COVID-19 susceptibility than those with non-G alleles.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yunlong Ma","author_inst":"Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yukuan Huang","author_inst":"Institute of Biomedical Big Data, School of Ophthalmology & Optometry and Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, 325027, China"},{"author_name":"Sen Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Yinghao Yao","author_inst":"Wenzhou Institute, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wenzhou 325011, China"},{"author_name":"Yaru Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Biomedical Big Data, School of Biomedical Engineering, School of Ophthalmology & Optometry and Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 32"},{"author_name":"Jia Qu","author_inst":"Institute of Biomedical Big Data, School of Biomedical Engineering, School of Ophthalmology & Optometry and Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 32"},{"author_name":"Nan Wu","author_inst":"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Jianzhong Su","author_inst":"Institute of Biomedical Big Data, School of Biomedical Engineering, School of Ophthalmology & Optometry and Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 32"},{"author_name":"Maurizio Sanguinetti","author_inst":"Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

This paper estimates the causal effect of this measure on mortality by Covid-19 and on mobility patterns. The identification of the causal effect exploits the variation in the number of active workers across municipalities induced by the economic lockdown. The difference-in-difference empirical design compares outcomes in municipalities above and below the median variation in the share of active population before and after the lockdown within a province, also controlling for municipality-specific dynamics, daily-shocks at the provincial level and municipal unobserved characteristics. Our results show that the intensity of the economic lockdown is associated to a statistically significant reduction in mortality by Covid-19 and, in particular, for age groups between 40-64 and older. Back of the envelope calculations indicate that 4,793 deaths were avoided, in the 26 days between April 5 to April 30, in the 3,518 municipalities which experienced a more intense lockdown. Assuming linearity, a 1 percentage point reduction in the share of active population caused a 1.32 percentage points reduction in mortality by Covid-19. We also find that the economic lockdown, as expected, led to a reduction in human mobility. Several robustness checks corroborate our empirical findings.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicola Borri","author_inst":"Luiss University"},{"author_name":"Francesco Drago","author_inst":"University of Catania"},{"author_name":"Chiara Santantonio","author_inst":"Luiss University"},{"author_name":"Francesco Sobbrio","author_inst":"Luiss University"},{"author_name":"Yaru Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Biomedical Big Data, School of Biomedical Engineering, School of Ophthalmology & Optometry and Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 32"},{"author_name":"Jia Qu","author_inst":"Institute of Biomedical Big Data, School of Biomedical Engineering, School of Ophthalmology & Optometry and Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 32"},{"author_name":"Nan Wu","author_inst":"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Jianzhong Su","author_inst":"Institute of Biomedical Big Data, School of Biomedical Engineering, School of Ophthalmology & Optometry and Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 32"},{"author_name":"Maurizio Sanguinetti","author_inst":"Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

However, communities throughout the US do not yet have adequate access to tests. Pharmacies are already engaged in testing, but there is capacity to greatly increase coverage. Using a facility location optimization model and willingness-to-travel estimates from US National Household Travel Survey data, we find that if COVID-19 testing became available in all US pharmacies, an estimated 94% of the US population would be willing to travel to obtain a test, if warranted. Whereas the largest chain provides high coverage in densely populated states, like Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jersey, and Connecticut, independent pharmacies would be required for sufficient coverage in Montana, South Dakota, and Wyoming. If only 1,000 pharmacies in the US are selected to provide testing, judicious selection, using our optimization model, provides estimated access to 29 million more people than selecting pharmacies simply based on population density. COVID-19 testing through pharmacies can improve access across the US. Even if only few pharmacies offer testing, judicious selection of specific sites can simplify logistics and improve access.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Simon Risanger","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Bismark Singh","author_inst":"Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg"},{"author_name":"David Morton","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Lauren Ancel Meyers","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Yaru Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Biomedical Big Data, School of Biomedical Engineering, School of Ophthalmology & Optometry and Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 32"},{"author_name":"Jia Qu","author_inst":"Institute of Biomedical Big Data, School of Biomedical Engineering, School of Ophthalmology & Optometry and Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 32"},{"author_name":"Nan Wu","author_inst":"Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Jianzhong Su","author_inst":"Institute of Biomedical Big Data, School of Biomedical Engineering, School of Ophthalmology & Optometry and Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou 32"},{"author_name":"Maurizio Sanguinetti","author_inst":"Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

There are many COVID-19 studies in progress however, little is known about the course of COVID-19 in people living with HIV (PLWH). The aim of our study was to describe epidemiology and clinical characteristics of PLWH diagnosed with COVID-19 reported form Central and Eastern European Countries. Methods: On-line survey was sent to Euroguidelines in Central and Eastern Europe (ECEE) Network Group. Analysis included all confirmed COVID-19 cases between March 11 and June 26 2020 among PLWH in 12 countries: Albania, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland , Romania, Russia, and Serbia. Results: In total 34 cases were reported. The mean age of those patients was 42.7 years (IQR=35.8-48.5) and most of the patients were male (70.6% vs 29.4%). The mean CD4+ T-cell count prior COVID-19 diagnosis was 558 cells\/mm3 (IQR=312-719) and HIV RNA viral load (VL) was undetectable in 18 of 34 (53%) cases, the data about most recent HIV RNA VL was not available in three cases (8,8%). Comorbidities were observed in 19 (55.9%) patients, mostly cardiovascular disease (27,8%), and in 10 (29.4%) patients had coinfection, mostly chronic hepatitis C (87.5%). The clinical course of COVID-19 was asymptomatic in 4 (12%) cases, mild disease without hospitalization was reported in 11 (32%) cases. Stable patients with respiratory and\/or systemic symptoms have been documented in 14 (41%) cases; 5 (15%) patients were clinically unstable with respiratory failure. Full recovery was reported in 31 (91%) cases, two patients died. In one case the data was not available. Conclusion: This study from 12 countries in Central and Eastern Europe region indicates no alarming signals of increased morbidity or mortality from COVID-19 among HIV-positive persons there is a need for further research.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kerstin Kase","author_inst":"West Tallinn Central Hospital, Estonia"},{"author_name":"Agata Skrzat-Klapaczynska","author_inst":"Department of Adults Infectious Diseases, Hospital for Infectious Diseases, Medical University of Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Anne Vassilenko","author_inst":"Belarusian State Medical University, Minsk, Belarus"},{"author_name":"Arjan Harxhi","author_inst":"University Hospital Center of Tirana, Infectious Disease Service, Albania"},{"author_name":"Botond Lakatos","author_inst":"National Institute of Hematology and Infectious Diseases, South-Pest Central Hospital, National Center of HIV, Hungary"},{"author_name":"Gordana Dragovic Lukic","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacology, Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Medicine; University of Belgrade, Serbia"},{"author_name":"David Jilich","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Charles University in Prague and Na Bulovce Hospital, Czech Republic"},{"author_name":"Antonija Verhaz","author_inst":"Infection Diseases Clinic, University Clinical Centre of the Republic of Srpska, Centre for Biomedical Research, Faculty of Medicine, University of Banja Luka, "},{"author_name":"Nina Yancheva","author_inst":"Department for AIDS.

While it is essential to quantify risk and characterize transmission dynamics in closed populations using Susceptible-Infection-Recovered modeling, the investigation of the effect from worldwide pandemic cannot be neglected. This study proposes a network analysis to assess global pandemic risk by linking 164 countries in pandemic networks, where links between countries were specified by the level of 'co-movement' of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases. More countries showing increase in the COVID-19 cases simultaneously will signal the pandemic prevalent over the world. The network density, clustering coefficients, and assortativity in the pandemic networks provide early warning signals of the pandemic in late February 2020. We propose a preparedness pandemic risk score for prediction and a severity risk score for pandemic control. The preparedness risk score contributed by countries in Asia is between 25% to 50% most of the time after February and America contributes close to 50% recently. The high preparedness risk contribution implies the importance of travel restrictions between those countries. The severity risk score of America is greater than 50% after May and even exceeds 75% in July, signifying that the control of COVID-19 is still worrying in America. We can keep track of the pandemic situation in each country using an online dashboard to update the pandemic risk scores and contributions.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mike K.P.

Methods We conducted a diagnostic accuracy study where subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 (n=401) and healthy volunteers (n=100) were asked to self-swab from their oropharynx and mid-turbinate (OPMT), and self-collect saliva. The results of these samples were compared to an OPMT performed by a HCW in the same patient at the same session. Results In subjects confirmed to have COVID-19, the detection rates of the HCW-swab, self-swab, saliva, and combined self-swab plus saliva samples were 82.8%, 75.1%, 74.3% and 86.5% respectively. All samples obtained from healthy volunteers were tested negative. Compared to HCW-swab, the detection rates of a self-swab sample and saliva sample were inferior by 8.7% (95%CI: 2.4% to 15.0%, p=0.006) and 9.5% (95%CI: 3.1% to 15.8%, p=0.003) respectively. The combined detection rate of self-swab and saliva had a higher detection rate of 2.7% (95%CI: -2.6% to 8.0%, p=0.321). The sensitivity of both the self-collection methods are higher when the Ct value of the HCW swab is less than 30. The negative correctness of both the self-swab and saliva testing was 100% (95% CI 96.4% to 100%). Conclusion Our study provides evidence that detection rates of self-collected OPMT swab and saliva samples were inferior to a HCW swab, but they could still be useful testing tools in the appropriate clinical settings.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Seow Yen Tan","author_inst":"Changi General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hong Liang Tey","author_inst":"National Skin Centre"},{"author_name":"Ernest Tian Hong Lim","author_inst":"Woodlands Health Campus"},{"author_name":"Song Tar Toh","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yiong Huak Chan","author_inst":"National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Pei Ting Tan","author_inst":"Changi General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sing Ai Lee","author_inst":"Sheares Healthcare Group Pte Ltd"},{"author_name":"Cheryl Xiaotong Tan","author_inst":"Temasek Holdings"},{"author_name":"Gerald Choon Huat Koh","author_inst":"MOH Office for Healthcare Transformation"},{"author_name":"Thean Yen Tan","author_inst":"Changi General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chuin Siau","author_inst":"Changi General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Andrzej Horban","author_inst":"Department of Adults Infectious Diseases, Hospital for Infectious Diseases, Medical University of Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Justyna Dominika Kowalska","author_inst":"Department of Adults Infectious Diseases, Hospital for Infectious Diseases, Medical University of Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Michela Sali","author_inst":"Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

We report that Kidney Injury Molecule-1\/T cell immunoglobulin mucin domain 1 (KIM-1\/TIM-1) is expressed in lung and kidney epithelial cells in COVID-19 patients and is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Human and mouse lung and kidney epithelial cells express KIM-1 and endocytose nanoparticles displaying the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (virosomes). Uptake was inhibited both by anti-KIM-1 antibodies and by TW-37, our newly discovered inhibitor of KIM-1-mediated endocytosis. Enhanced KIM-1 expression by human kidney tubuloids increased uptake of virosomes. KIM-1 positive cells express less angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the well-known receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Using microscale thermophoresis, the EC50 for KIM-1-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and receptor binding domain (RBD) interactions, were 19 and 10 nM respectively.

Methods Observational study in a 185-bed nursing home with two consecutive testing strategies: testing of symptomatic cases only, and weekly facility-wide testing of staff and residents regardless of symptoms. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal testing with RT-PCR for SARs-CoV-2 was conducted with a standardized symptom assessment. Positive samples with a cycle threshold (CT) value below 32 were selected for sequencing. Results 185 residents and 244 staff participated. Sequencing identified one cluster. In the symptom-based test strategy period 3\/39 residents were presymptomatic versus 38\/74 residents in the period of weekly facility-wide testing (p-value<0.001). In total, 51\/59 (91.1%) of SARS-CoV-2 positive staff was symptomatic, with no difference between both testing strategies (p-value 0.763). Loss of smell and taste, sore throat, headache or myalga was hardly reported in residents compared to staff (p-value <0.001). Median Ct-value of presymptomatic residents was 21.3, which did not differ from symptomatic (20.8) or asymptomatic (20.5) residents (p-value 0.624). Conclusions The frequency of a\/presymptomatic residents compared to staff suggests that a\/presymptomatic residents could be unrecognized symptomatic cases. However, symptomatic and presymptomatic\/unrecognized symptomatic residents both have the same potential for viral shedding. The high prevalence symptomatic staff found in facility-wide testing suggests that staff has difficulty attributing their symptoms to possible SARS-CoV-2 infection. Weekly testing was an effective strategy for early identification of SARS-Cov-2 cases, resulting in fast isolation and mitigation of this outbreak.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Judith Henriette van den Besselaar","author_inst":"Amsterdam University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Reina S Sikkema","author_inst":"ErasmusMC"},{"author_name":"Fleur M.H.P.A.

This study was designed to evaluate 1) if SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in milk and on the breast of infected women, 2) concentrations of milk-borne anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and 3) the capacity of milk to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Methods: We collected 37 milk samples and 70 breast swabs (before and after breast washing) from 18 women recently diagnosed with COVID-19. Samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using RT-qPCR. Milk was also analyzed for IgA and IgG specific for the nucleocapsid protein, receptor binding domain (RBD), S2 subunit of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, as well as 2 seasonal coronaviruses using ELISA; and for its ability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Results: We did not detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in any milk sample. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected on several breast swabs, although only one was considered conclusive. All milk contained SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA and IgG, and levels of anti-RBD IgA correlated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Strong correlations between levels of IgA and IgG to SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal coronaviruses were noted. Conclusions: Our data do not support maternal-to-child transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via milk; however, risk of transmission via breast skin should be further evaluated. Importantly, milk produced by infected mothers is a source of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG and neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 activity. These results support recommendations to continue breastfeeding during mild-to-moderate maternal COVID-19 illness.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ryan M Pace","author_inst":"University of Idaho"},{"author_name":"Janet E Williams","author_inst":"University of Idaho"},{"author_name":"Kirsi M J\u00e4rvinen","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Mandy B Belfort","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Christina DW Pace","author_inst":"University of Idaho"},{"author_name":"Kimberly A Lackey","author_inst":"University of Idaho"},{"author_name":"Alexandra C Gogel","author_inst":"University of Idaho"},{"author_name":"Phuong Nguyen-Contant","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Preshetha Kanagaiah","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Theresa Fitzgerald","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Rita Ferri","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Bridget Young","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Casey Rosen-Carole","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Nichole Diaz","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Courtney Meehan","author_inst":"Washington State University"},{"author_name":"Beatrice Caffe","author_inst":"Washington State University"},{"author_name":"Mark Y Sangster","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"David  J Topham","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Mark A McGuire","author_inst":"University of Idaho"},{"author_name":"Antti Seppo","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Michelle K McGuire","author_inst":"University of Idaho"},{"author_name":"Margaret E Ackerman","author_inst":"Dartmouth College"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.16.20195446","rel_title":"High-throughput quantitation of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a single-dilution homogeneous assay","rel_date":"2020-09-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.16.20195446","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2019 and has since spread around the world, causing a pandemic of the respiratory disease COVID-19. Detecting antibodies against the virus is an essential tool for tracking infections and developing vaccines. Such tests, primarily utilizing the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) principle, can be either qualitative (reporting positive\/negative results) or quantitative (reporting a value representing the quantity of specific antibodies). Quantitation is vital for determining stability or decline of antibody titers in convalescence, efficacy of different vaccination regimens, and detection of asymptomatic infections. Quantitation typically requires two-step ELISA testing, in which samples are first screened in a qualitative assay and positive samples are subsequently analyzed as a dilution series. To overcome the throughput limitations of this approach, we developed a simpler and faster system that is highly automatable and achieves quantitation in a single-dilution screening format with sensitivity and specificity comparable to those of ELISA.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Markus H Kainulainen","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Eric Bergeron","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Payel Chatterjee","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Asheley P Chapman","author_inst":"School of Chemistry and Biochemistry, School of Biological Sciences, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Joo Lee","author_inst":"Reagent and Diagnostic Services Branch, Division of Scientific Resources, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Asiya Chida","author_inst":"Reagent and Diagnostic Services Branch, Division of Scientific Resources, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Xiaoling Tang","author_inst":"Reagent and Diagnostic Services Branch, Division of Scientific Resources, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Rebekah E Wharton","author_inst":"Emergency Response Branch, Division of Laboratory Sciences, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Kristina B Mercer","author_inst":"Newborn Screening & Molecular Biology Branch, Division of Laboratory Sciences, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Marla Petway","author_inst":"Reagent and Diagnostic Services Branch, Division of Scientific Resources, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Harley M Jenks","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Timothy D Flietstra","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Amy J Schuh","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Panayampalli S Satheshkumar","author_inst":"Poxvirus and Rabies Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Jasmine M Chaitram","author_inst":"Division of Laboratory Systems, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"S Michele Owen","author_inst":"National Center for HIV\/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"M G Finn","author_inst":"School of Chemistry and Biochemistry, School of Biological Sciences, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Jason M Goldstein","author_inst":"Reagent and Diagnostic Services Branch, Division of Scientific Resources, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Joel M Montgomery","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Christina F Spiropoulou","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Michelle K McGuire","author_inst":"University of Idaho"},{"author_name":"Margaret E Ackerman","author_inst":"Dartmouth College"}],"version":"1","license":"cc0","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.16.20193466","rel_title":"Inexpensive, versatile and open-source methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection","rel_date":"2020-09-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.16.20193466","rel_abs":"Re-opening of communities in the midst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has ignited a second wave of infections in many places around the world. Mitigating the risk of reopening will require widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing, which would be greatly facilitated by simple, rapid, and inexpensive testing methods. To this end, we evaluated several protocols for RNA extraction and RT-qPCR that are simpler and less expensive than prevailing methods. First, we show that isopropanol precipitation provides an effective means of RNA extraction from nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples. Second, we evaluate direct addition of NP swab samples to RT-qPCR reactions without an RNA extraction step. We describe a simple, inexpensive swab collection solution suitable for direct addition, which we validate using contrived swab samples. Third, we describe an open-source master mix for RT-qPCR and show that it permits detection of viral RNA in NP swab samples. Lastly, we show that an end-point fluorescence measurement provides an accurate diagnostic readout without requiring a qPCR thermocycler. Adoption of these simple, inexpensive methods has the potential to significantly reduce the time and expense of COVID-19 testing.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas G.W.

With the current pandemic, it is essential that SARS-CoV-2 viruses are sequenced regularly to determine mutations and genomic modifications in different geographical locations. In this study we sequenced SARS-CoV-2 from 5 clinical samples obtained in Oklahoma, USA during different time points of pandemic presence in the state. One sample from the initial days of the pandemic in the state and 4 during the peak in Oklahoma were sequenced. Previously reported mutations including D614G in S gene, P4715L in ORF1ab, S194L, R203K and G204R in N gene were identified in the genomes sequenced in this study. Possible novel mutations were also detected such as G1167V in S gene, A6269S and P3371S in ORF1ab, T28I in ORF7b, G96R in ORF8. Phylogenetic analysis of the genomes showed similarity to viruses from across the globe. These novel mutations and phylogenetic analysis emphasize the contagious nature of the virus.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sai Narayanan","author_inst":"Oklahoma State University"},{"author_name":"John Corban Ritchey","author_inst":"Oklahoma Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Girish Patil","author_inst":"Oklahoma State University"},{"author_name":"Narasaraju Teluguakula","author_inst":"Oklahoma State University"},{"author_name":"Sunil More","author_inst":"Oklahoma State University"},{"author_name":"Jerry Malayer","author_inst":"Oklahoma State University"},{"author_name":"Jeremiah Saliki","author_inst":"Oklahoma State University"},{"author_name":"Anil Kaul","author_inst":"Oklahoma State University"},{"author_name":"Akhilesh Ramachandran","author_inst":"Oklahoma State University"},{"author_name":"Robert Tjian","author_inst":"University of California Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Harley M Jenks","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Timothy D Flietstra","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Amy J Schuh","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Panayampalli S Satheshkumar","author_inst":"Poxvirus and Rabies Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Jasmine M Chaitram","author_inst":"Division of Laboratory Systems, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"S Michele Owen","author_inst":"National Center for HIV\/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"M G Finn","author_inst":"School of Chemistry and Biochemistry, School of Biological Sciences, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Jason M Goldstein","author_inst":"Reagent and Diagnostic Services Branch, Division of Scientific Resources, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Joel M Montgomery","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Christina F Spiropoulou","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Michelle K McGuire","author_inst":"University of Idaho"},{"author_name":"Margaret E Ackerman","author_inst":"Dartmouth College"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.15.20195313","rel_title":"Seroprevalence and seroconversion rates to SARS-CoV-2 in interns, residents, and medical doctors in a University Hospital in Bogota, Colombia","rel_date":"2020-09-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.15.20195313","rel_abs":"Objectives To determine the prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and the incidence of seroconversion in the first month of follow-up among interns, residents, and medical doctors attending patients at a University Hospital, to explore for associations of seroprevalence and seroconversion with risk factors and symptoms compatible with COVID-19, and to explore the concordance of CLA, LFA, and ELFA. Design or methods We conducted a cross-sectional and a prospective study among medical doctors and medical trainees at Hospital Universitario San Ignacio in Bogota (Colombia) during June, July, and August to assess seroprevalence and seroconversion rates in this population was performed using CLA IgG for SARS-CoV-2. LFA IgG and IgM and ELFA IgM were also determined to explore concordance with CLA IgG. Results At baseline, 8 (2.28% 95%CI 1.16-4.43%) individuals were IgG positive for SARS-CoV-2 by CLA. At the end of the study, 21 (5.98% 95%CI 3.94-8.97%) individuals seroconverted by CLA IgG. In all, 29 individuals had IgG by CLA and of these 11 (3.13% 95%CI 1.76-5.52%) were asymptomatic. No associations with risk factors for infection were identified. CLA had moderate concordance with LFA IgG and ELFA, but minimal with LFA IgM. Conclusions Our report is one of the first in Latina America on seroprevalence and seroconversion rates in medical healthcare workers. It emphasizes the importance of avoiding focusing only on symptomatic individuals to screen this population for SARS-CoV-2 infection, since of all individuals that have evidence of previous infection many (37.93%) may be pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic and may contribute to infection\/disease spread.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Beatriz Elena Ariza","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario San Ignacio"},{"author_name":"Yulieth Ximena Torres","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Javeriana"},{"author_name":"Diana Salgado","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario San Ignacio"},{"author_name":"Magda Cepeda","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Javeriana"},{"author_name":"Carlos Gomez","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Javeriana"},{"author_name":"Julio Cesar Castellanos","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario San Ignacio"},{"author_name":"Fernando Suarez","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Javeriana"},{"author_name":"Adriana Cuellar","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Javeriana"},{"author_name":"Claudia Cecilia Cardozo","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario San Ignacio"},{"author_name":"Juana Angel","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Javeriana"},{"author_name":"Manuel Antonio Franco","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Javeriana"},{"author_name":"Timothy D Flietstra","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Amy J Schuh","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Panayampalli S Satheshkumar","author_inst":"Poxvirus and Rabies Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Jasmine M Chaitram","author_inst":"Division of Laboratory Systems, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"S Michele Owen","author_inst":"National Center for HIV\/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"M G Finn","author_inst":"School of Chemistry and Biochemistry, School of Biological Sciences, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Jason M Goldstein","author_inst":"Reagent and Diagnostic Services Branch, Division of Scientific Resources, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Joel M Montgomery","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Christina F Spiropoulou","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Michelle K McGuire","author_inst":"University of Idaho"},{"author_name":"Margaret E Ackerman","author_inst":"Dartmouth College"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.16.20195958","rel_title":"Physiological Effect of Prone Positioning in Mechanically Ventilated SARS- CoV-2 Infected Patients with Severe ARDS: Preliminary Analysis of an Observational Study","rel_date":"2020-09-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.16.20195958","rel_abs":"Prone position ventilation has been shown to decrease mortality and improve oxygenation in ARDS patients.

In this scenario, Italy has been one of the most affected countries. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated significant correlations between COVID-19 cases and demographic, geographical, and environmental statistics of each Italian region from February 26 to August 12, 2020. We further investigated the link between the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and particulate matter (PM) 2.5 and 10 concentrations before the lockdown in Lombardy. METHODS: All demographic data were obtained from the AdminStat Italia website, and geographic data were from the Il Meteo website. The collection frequency was one week. Data on PM2.5 and PM10 average daily concentrations were collected from previously published articles. We used Pearson's coefficients to correlate the quantities that followed a normal distribution, and Spearman's coefficient to correlate quantities that did not follow a normal distribution. RESULTS: We found significant strong correlations between COVID-19 cases and population number in 60.0% of the regions. We also found a significant strong correlation between the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the various regions and their latitude, and with the historical averages (last 30 years) of their minimum temperatures. We identified a significant strong correlation between the number of COVID-19 cases until August 12 and the average daily concentrations of PM2.5 in Lombardy until February 29, 2020. No significant correlation with PM10 was found in the same periods. However, we found that 40 g\/m^3 for PM2.5 and 50 g\/m^3 PM10 are plausible thresholds beyond which particulate pollution clearly favors the spread of SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: Since SARS-CoV-2 is correlated with historical minimum temperatures and PM10 and 2.5, health authorities are urged to monitor pollution levels and to invest in precautions for the arrival of autumn. Furthermore, we suggest creating awareness campaigns for the recirculation of air in enclosed places and to avoid exposure to the cold.

Infection Fatality Rates (IFR) for individual year classes calculated from seroprevalence data and the ages of those dying in England show a very strong log-linear relationship with age, and allow us to predict fatality rates for those testing positive on each day based on their ages. Since the peak of the epidemic, reductions in the ages of cases account for an eight fold fall in fatality rates. Over the same period, increased testing intensity appears to have increased infections detected amongst the most vulnerable by a factor of at least five, and between 15 and 24 fold in the population as a whole. Together these two factors are sufficient to explain the large observed change in the ratio of deaths to reported cases. We can also use these methods to give a more precise early warning system of future increases in mortality rates than raw case numbers. Although case numbers are currently increasing markedly, a continuing reduction in numbers of older individuals being infected means that the predicted increase in mortality rates is much slower.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alastair Grant","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Lucia Castaldo","author_inst":"Mensana srls, Via Moro Aldo 5, Brescia (IT)"},{"author_name":"Aparna Pande","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anirban Bhattacharjee","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Amrita Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Dalim Kumar Baidya","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Rahul Kumar Anand","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Bikash Ranjan Ray","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Rajeshwari Subramaniam","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Souvik Maitra","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Manuel Antonio Franco","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Javeriana"},{"author_name":"Timothy D Flietstra","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Amy J Schuh","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Panayampalli S Satheshkumar","author_inst":"Poxvirus and Rabies Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Jasmine M Chaitram","author_inst":"Division of Laboratory Systems, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"S Michele Owen","author_inst":"National Center for HIV\/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"M G Finn","author_inst":"School of Chemistry and Biochemistry, School of Biological Sciences, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Jason M Goldstein","author_inst":"Reagent and Diagnostic Services Branch, Division of Scientific Resources, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Joel M Montgomery","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Christina F Spiropoulou","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Michelle K McGuire","author_inst":"University of Idaho"},{"author_name":"Margaret E Ackerman","author_inst":"Dartmouth College"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.18.20197194","rel_title":"Detectability of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection and rates of mortality for COVID-19 in different regions of the Russian Federation","rel_date":"2020-09-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.18.20197194","rel_abs":"Background: Laboratory diagnosis of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection combined with tracing\/quarantine for contacts of infected individuals affects the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the community and the levels of related mortality. Moreover, not all cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population are detected (laboratory diagnosed). Here, we examine the relation between detectability of SARS-CoV-2 infection (i.e. the percent of detected COVID-19 cases among all cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population) and levels of mortality for COVID-19 for the 85 different regions (federal subjects) of the Russian Federation. Methods: Lower case-fatality rate (CFR, the proportion of deaths among reported COVID-19 cases in the population) corresponds to higher detectability of the SARS-COV-2 infection. We used data from the Russian Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing (Rospotrebnadzor) on the number of detected COVID-19 cases and the number of deaths from COVID-19 in the 85 different regions of the Russian Federation to examine the correlation between case-fatality rates and rates of mortality for COVID-19 in different regions of the Russian Federation. Results: The correlation between case-fatality rates for cases\/deaths reported by Sep. 17, 2020 and rates of mortality for COVID-19 per 100,000 for deaths reported by Sep. 17, 2020 in different regions of the Russian Federation is 0.68 (0.55,0.78). The region with both the highest COVID-19 mortality rate per 100,000 and the highest CFR (lowest detectability of SARS-CoV-2 infection) is the city of St. Petersburg.

The benefits of in-person learning are numerous, in terms of education quality, mental health, emotional well-being, equity and access to food and shelter. Early reports suggested that children might have reduced susceptibility to COVID-19, and children have been shown to experience fewer complications than older adults. Over the past few months, our understanding of COVID-19 has been further shaped by emerging data, and it is now understood that children are as susceptible to infection as adults and have a similar viral load during infection. While the higher prevalence of asymptomatic disease among children makes symptom-based isolation strategies ineffective, asymptomatic patients do not in fact carry a reduced viral load. Based on this updated understanding of the disease, we have used epidemiological modeling to explore the feasibility and consequences of school reopening in the face of differing rates of COVID-19 prevalence and transmission. Our findings indicate that, regardless of the initial prevalence of the disease, and in the absence of systematic surveillance testing, most schools in the United States can expect to remain open for 20-60 days. At this point, one or more large disease clusters can be expected to be detected, forcing schools to close again. These disease clusters, in turn, can be expected to propagate through the community, with potentially hundreds to thousands of additional cases resulting from each individual school cluster. Thus, our findings suggest that the debate between the risks to student safety and benefits of in-person learning frames a false dual choice. Given the current circumstances in the United States, the most likely outcome in the late fall is that students will be deprived of the benefits of in-person learning while having incurred a significant risk to themselves and their communities.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kaitlyn E Johnson","author_inst":"The University of Texas at Austin"},{"author_name":"Madison Stoddard","author_inst":"Fractal Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Ryan P Nolan","author_inst":"Halozyme Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Douglas E White","author_inst":"Independent Researcher"},{"author_name":"Natasha S Hochberg","author_inst":"Boston University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Arijit Chakravarty","author_inst":"Fractal Therapeutics"},{"author_name":"Rahul Kumar Anand","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Bikash Ranjan Ray","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Rajeshwari Subramaniam","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Souvik Maitra","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Manuel Antonio Franco","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Javeriana"},{"author_name":"Timothy D Flietstra","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Amy J Schuh","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Panayampalli S Satheshkumar","author_inst":"Poxvirus and Rabies Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Jasmine M Chaitram","author_inst":"Division of Laboratory Systems, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"S Michele Owen","author_inst":"National Center for HIV\/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"M G Finn","author_inst":"School of Chemistry and Biochemistry, School of Biological Sciences, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Jason M Goldstein","author_inst":"Reagent and Diagnostic Services Branch, Division of Scientific Resources, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Joel M Montgomery","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Christina F Spiropoulou","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Michelle K McGuire","author_inst":"University of Idaho"},{"author_name":"Margaret E Ackerman","author_inst":"Dartmouth College"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.15.20194712","rel_title":"Genomic epidemiology of the Los Angeles COVID-19 outbreak","rel_date":"2020-09-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.15.20194712","rel_abs":"Los Angeles (LA) County has sustained a large outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To learn about the transmission history of SARS-CoV-2 in LA County, we sequenced 142 viral genomes from unique patients seeking care at UCLA Health System. 86 of these genomes are from samples collected before April 19, 2020. We found that the early outbreak in LA, as in other international air travel hubs, was seeded by multiple introductions of strains from Asia and Europe. We identified a US-specific strain, B.1.43, which has been found predominantly in California and Washington State. While samples from LA County carry the ancestral B.1.43 genome, viral genomes from neighbouring counties in California and from counties in Washington State carry additional mutations, suggesting a potential origin of B.1.43 in Southern California. We quantified the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 over time, and found evidence that the public health measures put in place in LA County to control the virus were effective at preventing transmission, but may have been undermined by the many introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the region. Our work demonstrates that genome sequencing can be a powerful tool for investigating outbreaks and informing the public health response. Our results reinforce the critical need for the U.S. to have coordinated inter-state responses to the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Longhua Guo","author_inst":"Department of Human Genetics, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA"},{"author_name":"James Boocock","author_inst":"Department of Human Genetics, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA"},{"author_name":"Evann Hilt","author_inst":"Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA"},{"author_name":"Sukantha Chandrasekaran","author_inst":"Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA"},{"author_name":"Yi Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Human Genetics, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA"},{"author_name":"Chetan Munugala","author_inst":"Department of Human Genetics, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA"},{"author_name":"Laila Sathe","author_inst":"Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA"},{"author_name":"Noah Alexander","author_inst":"Department of Human Genetics, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA"},{"author_name":"Valerie A.

Methods: The study included all the cases reported from March 8 to May 31, 2020 in the state. Any person with history of international or domestic travel from high burden states, those presenting with Influenza-like or Severe Acute Respiratory Illness and high-risk contacts of COVID19 cases, who were SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive were included. Detailed analysis based on contact tracing data available from line-list of the state surveillance unit was performed using cluster analysis software package. Findings: Amongst the 3404 COVID-19 positive cases, 3096 (91%) were asymptomatic while 308 (9%) were symptomatic. Majority of the asymptomatic cases were in the age range of 16-50 years while symptomatic cases were between 31-65 years. Most of those affected were males. Cluster analysis of 822 cases indicated that the secondary attack rate, size of the cluster (dispersion) and occurrence of overt clinical illness is significantly higher when the index case in a cluster was symptomatic compared to an asymptomatic. Interpretation: Our findings indicate that both asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 cases transmit the infection; however, the main driving force behind the spread of infection within the state was significantly higher from symptomatic cases. This has major implications for policies related to testing. Active search for symptomatic cases, subjecting them to testing and treatment should be prioritized for containing the spread of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Narendra Kumar","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences"},{"author_name":"Shafeeq K S Hameed","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences"},{"author_name":"Giridhara R Babu","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Public Health, Bengaluru, Public Health Foundation of India"},{"author_name":"Manjunatha M Venkataswamy","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences"},{"author_name":"Prameela Dinesh","author_inst":"State Surveillance Unit, Directorate of Health and Family Welfare, Government of Karnataka"},{"author_name":"Prakash B G Kumar","author_inst":"State Surveillance Unit, Directorate of Health and Family Welfare, Government of Karnataka"},{"author_name":"Daisy A John","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Public Health, Bengaluru, Public Health Foundation of India"},{"author_name":"Anita Desai","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences"},{"author_name":"Ravi Vasanthapuram","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Flint","author_inst":"Department of Human Genetics, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA"},{"author_name":"Eleazar Eskin","author_inst":"Department of Human Genetics, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA"},{"author_name":"Chongyuan Luo","author_inst":"Department of Human Genetics, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA"},{"author_name":"Shangxin Yang","author_inst":"UCLA Health System"},{"author_name":"Omai B Garner","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Yi Yin","author_inst":"Department of Human Genetics, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA"},{"author_name":"Joshua S Bloom","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Leonid Kruglyak","author_inst":"Department of Human Genetics, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA"},{"author_name":"Jason M Goldstein","author_inst":"Reagent and Diagnostic Services Branch, Division of Scientific Resources, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Joel M Montgomery","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Christina F Spiropoulou","author_inst":"Viral Special Pathogens Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA"},{"author_name":"Michelle K McGuire","author_inst":"University of Idaho"},{"author_name":"Margaret E Ackerman","author_inst":"Dartmouth College"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.18.20197095","rel_title":"The COVID-19 Spread in the State of Assam, India","rel_date":"2020-09-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.18.20197095","rel_abs":"We have studied the current COVID-19 spread situation in Assam, a State of India.

Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses were applied to identify functional categories and biochemical pathways. KEGG and GO results suggested that biological pathways such as Cancer pathways and Insulin pathways were mostly affected in the development of COVID-19. Moreover, we identified several genes including EP300, CREBBP, and POLR2A were involved in the virus activities in COVID-19 patients.

Elevation and air quality are believed to be significant factors in the current development of the pandemic, but the influence of additional environmental factors remain unclear. In this study, we explored the relationship between the cumulative number of infections and mortality cases with climate (temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, water vapor pressure, wind), environmental data (elevation, NDVI, PM2.5 and NO2 concentration), and population density in Peru. Using the data from confirmed cases of infection from 1287 districts and confirmed cases of mortality in 479 districts, we used Spearman's correlations to assess the correlation between environmental and climatic factors with cumulative infection cases, cumulative mortality and case-fatality rate. We also explored district cases by the ecozones of coast, sierra, high montane forest and lowland rainforest. Multiple linear regression models indicate elevation, mean solar radiation, air quality, population density and green cover are influential factors in the distribution of infection and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 in Peru. The case-fatality rate was weakly associated with elevation. Our results also strongly suggest that exposure to poor air quality is a significant factor in the mortality of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 below the age of 30. We conclude that environmental and climatic factors do play a significant role in the transmission and case-fatality rates in Peru, however further study is required to see if these relationships are maintained over time.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Victor J.

To better understand factors associated with incidence, mortality and lethality heterogeneity across the 96 administrative departments of metropolitan France, we thus conducted a geoepidemiological analysis based on publicly available data, using hierarchical ascendant classification (HAC) on principal component analysis (PCA) of multidimensional variables, and multivariate analyses with generalized additive models (GAM). Our results confirm a marked spatial heterogeneity of in-hospital COVID 19 incidence and mortality, following the North East \/ South West diffusion of the epidemic. The delay elapsed between the first COVID-19 associated death and the onset of the national lockdown on March 17th, 2020, appeared positively associated with in-hospital incidence, mortality and lethality. Mortality was also strongly associated with incidence. Mortality and lethality rates were significantly higher in departments with older population, but they were not significantly associated with the number of intensive-care beds available in 2018.
