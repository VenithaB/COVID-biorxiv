Serologic tests can be an important complementary approach. Objective: Assess the practical performance of RT-PCR based surveillance protocols, and the extent of undetected SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Shenzhen, China. Design: Cohort study nested in a public health response. Setting: Shenzhen, China; January-May 2020. Participants: 880 PCR-negative close-contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases and 400 residents without known exposure (main analysis). Fifty-seven PCR-positive case contacts (timing analysis). Measurements: Virological testing by RT-PCR. Measurement of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in PCR-negative contacts 2-15 weeks after initial testing using total Ab ELISA. Rates of undetected infection, performance of RT-PCR over the course of infection, and characteristics of seropositive but PCR-negative individuals were assessed. Results: The adjusted seropositivity rate for total Ab among 880 PCR-negative close-contacts was 4.1% (95%CI, 2.9% to 5.7%), significantly higher than among residents without known exposure to cases (0.0%, 95%CI, 0.0% to 1.0%). PCR-positive cases were 8.0 times (RR; 95% CI, 5.3 to 12.7) more likely to report symptoms than the PCR-negative individuals who were seropositive, but otherwise similar. RT-PCR missed 36% (95%CI, 28% to 44%) of infected close-contacts, and false negative rates appear to be highly dependent on stage of infection. Limitations: No serological data were available on PCR-positive cases. Sample size was limited, and only 20% of PCR-negative contacts met inclusion criteria. Conclusion: Even rigorous RT-PCR testing protocols may miss a significant proportion of infections, perhaps in part due to difficulties timing testing of asymptomatics for optimal sensitivity. Surveillance and control protocols relying on RT-PCR were, nevertheless, able to contain community spread in Shenzhen.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhen Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Public Health Information, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Qifang Bi","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, USA"},{"author_name":"Shisong Fang","author_inst":"Department of Pathogenic Biology, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Lan Wei","author_inst":"Department of Public Health Information, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xin Wang","author_inst":"Department of Pathogenic Biology, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Jianfan He","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Yongsheng Wu","author_inst":"Department of Public Health Information, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaojian Liu","author_inst":"Department of Public Health Information, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Gao","author_inst":"Department of Communicable Diseases Control and Prevention, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Renli Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Pathogenic Biology, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Wenfeng Gong","author_inst":"The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation"},{"author_name":"Qiru Su","author_inst":"Pediatric Research Institute, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Andrew Azman","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, USA"},{"author_name":"Justin Lessler","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, USA"},{"author_name":"Xuan Zou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.30.20184697","rel_title":"Prevalence and predictors of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms among pregnant women during COVID-19-related lockdown in Abakaliki, Nigeria","rel_date":"2020-09-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.30.20184697","rel_abs":"Introduction: Several studies on COVID-19 and pregnancy have been published recently, but few studies have evaluated the impact of this pandemic on maternal mental health particularly in low-resource setting. Aim: To determine the prevalence and predictors of COVID-19-related depression, anxiety and stress symptoms among pregnant women. Materials and methods: This was a questionnaire-based cross-sectional study conducted among 456 pregnant women attending prenatal care at Abakaliki, Nigeria during COVID-19-related lockdown. They were screened for psychological morbidities using DASS 21 (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale). Results: Severe and extremely severe depression were reported in 33 (7.2%) and 29 (6.4%) participants respectively. 15 (3.3%) and 35 (7.7%) women had severe and extremely severe anxiety respectively. 105 (23%) had severe anxiety whereas 76 (16.7%) reported extremely severe stress. Multiparity (2 - 4) and occupations such as trading and farming were predictors of depression whereas grandmultiparity, urban residence and trading were identified as predictors of anxiety and stress. Conclusion: Depression, anxiety and stress symptoms were relatively common among pregnant women during COVID-19-related lockdown in Abakaliki, Nigeria. There is a need to integrate screening for depression, anxiety and stress in existing antenatal care programs so as to identify and prevent long term adverse psychological outcome related to COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Johnbosco Ifunanya Nwafor","author_inst":"Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki, Ebonyi State, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Ijeoma Nkem Okedo-Alex","author_inst":"Department of Community Medicine, Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital"},{"author_name":"Arinze Chidiebere Ikeotuonye","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lan Wei","author_inst":"Department of Public Health Information, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xin Wang","author_inst":"Department of Pathogenic Biology, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Jianfan He","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Yongsheng Wu","author_inst":"Department of Public Health Information, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaojian Liu","author_inst":"Department of Public Health Information, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Gao","author_inst":"Department of Communicable Diseases Control and Prevention, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Renli Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Pathogenic Biology, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Wenfeng Gong","author_inst":"The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation"},{"author_name":"Qiru Su","author_inst":"Pediatric Research Institute, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Andrew Azman","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, USA"},{"author_name":"Justin Lessler","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, USA"},{"author_name":"Xuan Zou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"obstetrics and gynecology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.30.20184739","rel_title":"Test Sensitivity for Infection versus Infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-09-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.30.20184739","rel_abs":"The most commonly used test for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 is a PCR test that is able to detect very low viral loads and inform on treatment decisions.

Knowing whether an individual is infectious is the critical piece of information for a decision to isolate an individual or not. This paper examines the value of different tests from an information-theoretic approach and shows that applying treatment-based approval standards for tests for infection will lower the value of those tests and likely causes decisions based on them to have too many false positives (i.e., individuals isolated who are not infectious).

Given the lack of an effective pharmaceutical treatment for COVID-19, the high contagiousness of the disease and its varied clinical outcomes, identifying patients at risk of progressing to severe disease is crucial for the allocation of valuable healthcare resources during this pandemic. Current research has shown that there is a higher prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities amongst patients with severe COVID-19 or COVID-19-related deaths, but the link between cardiovascular disease and poorer prognosis is poorly understood. We believe that pre-existing immune dysregulation that accompanies cardiovascular disease predisposes patients to a harmful inflammatory immune response, leading to their higher risk of severe disease. Thus, in this project, we aim to characterize immune dysregulation in patients with cardiomyopathy, venous thromboembolism and COVID-19 patients by looking at immune-associated gene dysregulation, immune infiltration and dysregulated immunological pathways and gene signatures.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Grant E Castaneda","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Abby C Lee","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Wei Tse Li","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Chengyu Chen","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Jaideep Chakladar","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Eric Chang","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Weg Ongkeko","author_inst":"University of California, San Diego"},{"author_name":"Xiaojian Liu","author_inst":"Department of Public Health Information, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Gao","author_inst":"Department of Communicable Diseases Control and Prevention, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Renli Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Pathogenic Biology, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Wenfeng Gong","author_inst":"The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation"},{"author_name":"Qiru Su","author_inst":"Pediatric Research Institute, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Andrew Azman","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, USA"},{"author_name":"Justin Lessler","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, USA"},{"author_name":"Xuan Zou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.29.20184127","rel_title":"The evolution of Covid-19 in Italy during the Summer 2020: analysis and interpretation of an unpredicted rest period","rel_date":"2020-09-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.29.20184127","rel_abs":"The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic was particularly invasive in Italy during the period of March to the end of April 2020, then displayed a significant decrease both in the number of infections and in the seriousness of illness throughout the summer of 2020.

We also use the ratio between the number of Deaths (D) and the number of Active Cases. What clearly emerges, from rigorous statistical analysis, is a progressive decrease of both the ratios, indicating progressive mitigation of the disease. This is particularly evident when comparing March-April with July-August; during the summer period the two ratios have become roughly 18 times lower. We test such sharp decreases against possible bias in counting active cases, and we confirm their statistical significance. We then interpret such evidence in terms of the well-known seasonality of the human immune system and the virus-inactivating effect of stronger UV rays in the summer. Our results can also shed light on related effects observed worldwide.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giuseppe De Natale","author_inst":"INGV, Osservatorio Vesuviano, 80124 Naples, Italy"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo De Natale","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Universita' degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Naples, Italy"},{"author_name":"Claudia Troise","author_inst":"INGV, Osservatorio Vesuviano, 80124 Naples, Italy"},{"author_name":"Renato Somma","author_inst":"INGV, Osservatorio Vesuviano, 80124 Naples, Italy"},{"author_name":"Vito Marchitelli","author_inst":"Department of Mobility, Public Works, Ecology, Env, Puglia Region Government, 70100 Bari, Italy"},{"author_name":"Antonio Coviello","author_inst":"CNR-IRISS, 80134 Naples, Italy"},{"author_name":"Karen Holmberg","author_inst":"Gallatin School of Individualized Study, New York University, USA"},{"author_name":"Xiaojian Liu","author_inst":"Department of Public Health Information, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Gao","author_inst":"Department of Communicable Diseases Control and Prevention, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Renli Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Pathogenic Biology, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Wenfeng Gong","author_inst":"The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation"},{"author_name":"Qiru Su","author_inst":"Pediatric Research Institute, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Andrew Azman","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, USA"},{"author_name":"Justin Lessler","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, USA"},{"author_name":"Xuan Zou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.28.20184077","rel_title":"The methodological quality of COVID-19 systematic reviews is low, except for Cochrane reviews: a meta-epidemiological study","rel_date":"2020-09-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.28.20184077","rel_abs":"Objectives: The objective of this study was to investigate the methodological quality of COVID-19 systematic reviews (SRs) indexed in medRxiv and PubMed, compared with Cochrane COVID Reviews.

We evaluated the methodological quality using A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) checklists. The maximum AMSTAR score is 11, and minimum is 0. Higher score means better quality. Results: We included 9 Cochrane reviews as well as randomly selected 100 non-Cochrane reviews in medRxiv and PubMed. Compared with Cochrane reviews (mean 9.33, standard deviation 1.32), the mean AMSTAR scores of the articles in medRxiv were lower (mean difference -2.85, 95%confidence intervals (CI): -0.96 to -4.74) and those in PubMed was also lower (mean difference -3.28, 95% CI: -1.40 to -5.15), with no difference between the latter two. Conclusions: It should be noted that AMSTAR is not a perfect tool of assessing quality SRs other than intervention.

We aimed to analyze how these effects can bias key epidemiological metrics used to track and monitor SARS-CoV-2 epidemics. Methods: An age-structured mathematical model was constructed to simulate progression of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics in populations. PCR testing to diagnose infection and cross-sectional surveys to measure seroprevalence were also simulated. Analyses were conducted on simulated outcomes assuming a natural epidemic time course and an epidemic in presence of interventions. Results: The prolonged PCR positivity biased the epidemiological measures. There was a lag of 10 days between the true epidemic peak and the actually-observed peak. Prior to epidemic peak, PCR positivity rate was 2-fold higher than that based only on current active infection, and half of those tested positive by PCR were in the prolonged PCR positivity stage after infection clearance. Post epidemic peak, PCR positivity rate poorly predicted true trend in active infection. Meanwhile, the prolonged PCR positivity did not appreciably bias estimation of the basic reproduction number R0. The time delay in development of detectable antibodies biased measured seroprevalence. The actually-observed seroprevalence substantially underestimated true prevalence of ever infection, with the underestimation being most pronounced around epidemic peak. Conclusions: Caution is warranted in interpreting PCR and serological testing data, and any drawn inferences need to factor the effects of the investigated biases for an accurate assessment of epidemic dynamics.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Monia Makhoul","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Epidemiology Group, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, Cornell University, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Farah Abou-Hijleh","author_inst":"Department of Public Health, College of Health Sciences, Academic Quality Affairs Office, QU Health, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Shaheen Seedat","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Epidemiology Group, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, Cornell University, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Ghina R Mumtaz","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon"},{"author_name":"Hiam Chemaitelly","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Epidemiology Group, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, Cornell University, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Houssein Ayoub","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Physics, College of Arts and Sciences, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Laith J Abu-Raddad","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Epidemiology Group, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, Cornell University, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Xiaojian Liu","author_inst":"Department of Public Health Information, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Gao","author_inst":"Department of Communicable Diseases Control and Prevention, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Renli Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Pathogenic Biology, Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Wenfeng Gong","author_inst":"The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation"},{"author_name":"Qiru Su","author_inst":"Pediatric Research Institute, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Andrew Azman","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, USA"},{"author_name":"Justin Lessler","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, USA"},{"author_name":"Xuan Zou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.29.20184135","rel_title":"Modeling the combined effect of digital exposure notification and non-pharmaceutical interventions on the COVID-19 epidemic in Washington state","rel_date":"2020-09-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.29.20184135","rel_abs":"Contact tracing is increasingly being used to combat COVID-19, and digital implementations are now being deployed, many of them based on Apple and Google's Exposure Notification System.

In this work, we use individual-based computational models to explore how digital exposure notifications can be used in conjunction with non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as traditional contact tracing and social distancing, to influence COVID-19 disease spread in a population. Specifically, we use a representative model of the household and occupational structure of three counties in the state of Washington together with a proposed digital exposure notifications deployment to quantify impacts under a range of scenarios of adoption, compliance, and mobility. In a model in which 15% of the population participated, we found that digital exposure notification systems could reduce infections and deaths by approximately 8% and 6%, effectively complementing traditional contact tracing. We believe this can serve as guidance to health authorities in Washington state and beyond on how exposure notification systems can complement traditional public health interventions to suppress the spread of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matthew Abueg","author_inst":"Google Research"},{"author_name":"Robert Hinch","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Neo Wu","author_inst":"Google Research"},{"author_name":"Luyang Liu","author_inst":"Google Research"},{"author_name":"William J M Probert","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Austin Wu","author_inst":"Google LLC"},{"author_name":"Paul Eastham","author_inst":"Google Research"},{"author_name":"Yusef Shafi","author_inst":"Google Research"},{"author_name":"Matt Rosencrantz","author_inst":"Google Research"},{"author_name":"Michael Dikovsky","author_inst":"Google Research"},{"author_name":"Zhao Cheng","author_inst":"Google Research"},{"author_name":"Anel Nurtay","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Lucie Abeler-D\u00f6rner","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David G Bonsall","author_inst":"Big Data Institute"},{"author_name":"Michael V McConnell","author_inst":"Google LLC"},{"author_name":"Shawn O'Banion","author_inst":"Google Research"},{"author_name":"Christophe Fraser","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.29.20184465","rel_title":"One Study of COVID-19 Spreading at The United States - Brazil - Colombia","rel_date":"2020-09-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.29.20184465","rel_abs":"The present work concerns the COVID-19's spread over The United States, Brazil and Colombia.

Thus, we used a database on WHO Coronavirus, Mathematical Modeling and Numerical Simulations to describe the most recent COVID-19 development patterns in these countries, which we saw.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eliandro Rodrigues Cirilo","author_inst":"Universidade Estadual de Londrina"},{"author_name":"Miguel Candezano","author_inst":"Universidad del Atlantico"},{"author_name":"Paulo Natti","author_inst":"Universidade Estadual de Londrina"},{"author_name":"Neyva Romeiro","author_inst":"Universidade Estadual de Londrina"},{"author_name":"Jeinny Polo","author_inst":"Universidad Nacional Abierta y a Distancia"},{"author_name":"Austin Wu","author_inst":"Google LLC"},{"author_name":"Paul Eastham","author_inst":"Google Research"},{"author_name":"Yusef Shafi","author_inst":"Google Research"},{"author_name":"Matt Rosencrantz","author_inst":"Google Research"},{"author_name":"Michael Dikovsky","author_inst":"Google Research"},{"author_name":"Zhao Cheng","author_inst":"Google Research"},{"author_name":"Anel Nurtay","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Lucie Abeler-D\u00f6rner","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David G Bonsall","author_inst":"Big Data Institute"},{"author_name":"Michael V McConnell","author_inst":"Google LLC"},{"author_name":"Shawn O'Banion","author_inst":"Google Research"},{"author_name":"Christophe Fraser","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.30.20184671","rel_title":"Seroprevalence and immunity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and adolescents in schools in Switzerland: design for a longitudinal, school-based prospective cohort study","rel_date":"2020-09-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.30.20184671","rel_abs":"Introduction Seroprevalence and transmission routes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in children and adolescents, especially in school setting, are not clear. Resulting uncertainty is reflected in very different decisions on school closures and reopenings across countries. The aim of this longitudinal cohort study is to assess the extent and patterns of seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in school-attending children repeatedly. It will examine risk factors for infection, relationship between seropositivity and symptoms, and temporal persistence of antibodies. Additionally, it will include testing of school personnel and parents. Methods and analysis The study (Ciao Corona) will enroll a regionally representative, random sample of schools in the canton of Zurich, where 18% of the Swiss population live. Children aged 5 to 16 years, attending classes in primary and secondary schools are invited. Venous blood and saliva samples are collected for SARS-CoV-2 serological testing after the first wave of infections (June\/July 2020), in fall (October\/November 2020), and after winter (March\/April 2021). Venous blood is also collected for serological testing of parents and school personnel. Bi-monthly questionnaires to children, parents and school personnel cover SARS-CoV-2 symptoms and tests, health, preventive behavior, lifestyle and quality of life information. Total seroprevalence and cumulative incidence will be calculated. Hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression models will account for sensitivity and specificity of the serological test in the analyses and for the complex sampling structure, i.e., clustering within classes and schools. Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland (2020-01336). The results of this study will be published in peer-reviewed journals and will be made available to study participants and participating schools, the Federal Office of Public Health, and the Educational Department of the canton of Zurich.

(2) Will this initial bump in cases be containable using the mitigation steps being undertaken at UIUC? Our answers are: (1) Assuming that there are approximately 45,000 students returning to campus in the week beginning August 15, 2020, our most conservative estimate predicts that a median of 270 {+\/-} 90 (minimum-maximum range) COVID-19 positive cases will be detected by entry screening. The earliest estimate for entry screening that we report was made on July 24th and predicted 198 {+\/-} 90 (68% CI) positive cases. (2) If the number of returning students is less, then our estimate just needs to be scaled proportionately. (3) This initial bump will be contained by entry screening initiated isolation and contact tracing, and once the semester is underway, by universal masking, a hybrid teaching model, twice-weekly testing, isolation, contact tracing, quarantining and the use of the Safer Illinois exposure notification app.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ahmed Elbanna","author_inst":"University of Illinois Urbana Champaign"},{"author_name":"George N.

For statistical analysis, we have considered the total number of cases for 60 consecutive days, from June 23 to August 21. We have seen that instead of taking data of all 60 days together, a better picture of uncertainty can be observed if we consider the data separately in three equal parts from June 23 to July 12, from July 13 to August 1, and from August 2 to August 21. For that we would first need to ascertain that the current spread pattern in India is almost exponential. Thereafter we shall show that the data regarding the total number of cases in India are not really behaving in an expected way, making forecasting the time to peak very difficult. We have found that the pandemic would perhaps change its pattern of growth from nearly exponential to nearly logarithmic, which we have earlier observed in the case of Italy, in less than 78 days starting from August 2.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hemanta Kumar Baruah","author_inst":"The Assam Royal Global University, Guwahati, Assam, India"},{"author_name":"George N.

The aim of this study was to formalize indicators for measuring the fulfillment of assumptions for appropriate proximity tracing app functioning. Six indicators were developed to monitor the SwissCovid app functioning and effectiveness in the Swiss population. Using official statistics and survey data, we calculated indicator values and examined socio-demographic factors associated with the SwissCovid app utilization. Indicators show that 1 in 3 adults in Switzerland have downloaded the app. However, only 15% of new cases also triggered DPT-app notifications, and indicators also reveal ignored app notifications. In the full survey sample (n=2098), higher monthly household income or being a non-smoker were associated with higher SwissCovid app uptake; older age or having a non-Swiss nationality with a lower uptake. In a subsample including more detailed information (n=701), high trust in health authorities was associated with higher SwissCovid app uptake. The indicators help to monitor key drivers of DPT-apps effectiveness and hint to non-compliance issues. Streamlining procedures, removing technical hurdles, and communicating the usefulness of DPT-apps are crucial to promote uptake, compliance, and ultimately effectiveness of DPT-apps for pandemic mitigation.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Viktor von Wyl","author_inst":"University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Marc Hoeglinger","author_inst":"Zurich University of Applied Sciences"},{"author_name":"Chloe Sieber","author_inst":"University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Marco Kaufmann","author_inst":"University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Andre Moser","author_inst":"University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Miquel Serra-Burriel","author_inst":"University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Tala Ballouz","author_inst":"University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Dominik Menges","author_inst":"University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Anja Frei","author_inst":"University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Milo Puhan","author_inst":"University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Susi Kriemler","author_inst":"University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Anel Nurtay","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Lucie Abeler-D\u00f6rner","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David G Bonsall","author_inst":"Big Data Institute"},{"author_name":"Michael V McConnell","author_inst":"Google LLC"},{"author_name":"Shawn O'Banion","author_inst":"Google Research"},{"author_name":"Christophe Fraser","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.29.20184283","rel_title":"Relation of Doubling Time and Reproduction Number with Testing Rate for Corona Infections in India","rel_date":"2020-09-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.29.20184283","rel_abs":"There is a general feeling that increased testing has a salutary effect on the course of the current coronavirus epidemic.

This study aims to assess COVID-19 and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS C) in Latin American children, in order to appropriately plan and allocate resources to face the pandemic on a local and International lever Methods Ambispective multicentre cohort study from five Latin American countries. Children aged 18 years or younger with microbiologically confirmed SARS CoV 2 infection were included. Findings 409 children were included, with a median age of 53.0 years (IQR 0.6 9.0). Of these, 95 191 (23.2%) were diagnosed with MIS C. 191 (46.7%) children were admitted to hospital and 52 (12.7%) required admission to a Pediatric Intensive Care Unite (PICU). 92 (22.5%) patients required oxygen support: 8 (2%) were started on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and 29 (7%) on mechanical ventilation. 35 (8.5%) patients required inotropic support. The following factors were associated with PICU admission: pre-existing medical condition (P < 0.0001), immunodeficiency (P = 0.01), lower respiratory tract infection (P< 0.0001), gastrointestinal symptoms (P = 0.006), radiological changes suggestive of pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (P< 0.0001), low socioeconomic conditions (P 0.009). Conclusions This study shows a generally more severe form of COVID 19 and a high number of MIS C in Latin American children, compared with studies from China, Europe and North America, and support current evidence of a more severe disease in Latin\/Hyspanic children or in people of lower socioeconomic level. The findings highlight an urgent need of more data of COVID 19 in South America.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Omar Yassef Antunez-Montes","author_inst":"Instituto Latinoamericano de Ecografia en Medicina, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico."},{"author_name":"Maria Isabel Escamilla","author_inst":"Fundacion Neumologica Colombiana, Bogota, Colombia."},{"author_name":"Augusto Flavio Figueroa-Uribe","author_inst":"Hospital Pediatrico Peralvillo.

Objectives: To investigate meta-analytic global levels of depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic and how implementation of mitigation strategies (i.e. public transportation closures, stay-at-home orders, etc.) impacted such disorders. Data sources: Pubmed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, BIOSIS Citation Index, Current Content Connect, PsycINFO, CINAHL, medRxiv, and PsyArXiv databases for depression and anxiety prevalences; Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker for the containment and closure policies indexes; Global Burden of Disease Study for previous levels of depression and anxiety. Study eligibility criteria: Original studies conducted during COVID-19 pandemic, which assessed categorical depression and anxiety, using PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scales (cutoff [&ge;] 10). Participants and interventions: General population, healthcare providers, students, and patients. National physical distancing measures. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Meta-analysis and meta-regresssion. Results: In total, 226,638 individuals were assessed within the 60 included studies. Global prevalence of both depression and anxiety during COVID-19 pandemic were 24.0% and 21.3%, respectively. There was a wide variance in the prevalence of both anxiety and depression reported in different regions of the world and countries. Asia, and China particularly, had the lowest prevalence of both disorders. Regarding the impact of mitigation strategies on mental health, only public transportation closures increased anxiety prevalence. Limitations: Country-level data on physical distancing measures and previous anxiety\/depression may not necessarily reflect local (i.e., city-specific) contexts. Conclusions and implications of key findings: Mental health concerns should not be viewed only as a delayed consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, but also as a concurrent epidemic. Our data provides support for policy-makers to consider real-time enhanced mental health services, and increase initiatives to foster positive mental health outcomes.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joao M.

Little also is known about the effects on-campus students may have on local higher-risk communities. We aimed to estimate potential community and campus Covid-19 exposures, infections, and mortality due to various university reopening and precaution plans under current ranges of assumptions and uncertainties. Methods: We developed and calibrated campus-only, community-only, and campus-x-community epidemic differential equation and agent-based models. Input parameters for campus and surrounding communities were estimated via published and grey literature, scenario development, expert opinion, accuracy optimization algorithms, and Monte Carlo simulation; models were cross-validated against each other using February-June 2020 data from heterogeneous U.S. counties and states. Campus opening plans (spanning various fully open, hybrid, and fully virtual approaches) were identified from websites and publications. All scenarios were simulated assuming 16-week semesters and estimated ranges for Covid-19 prevalence among community residents and arriving students, precaution compliance, contact frequency, virus attack rates, and tracing and isolation effectiveness. Additional student and community exposures, infections, and mortality were estimated under each scenario, with 10% trimmed medians, standard deviations, and probability intervals computed to omit extreme outlier scenarios. Factorial analyses were conducted to identify intervention inputs with largest and smallest effects. Results: As a base case with no precautions (or no compliance), predicted 16-week student infections and mortality under normal operations ranged significantly from 471 to 9,495 (median: 2,286, SD: 2,627) and 0 to 123 (median: 9, SD: 14) per 10,000 students, respectively. The maximum active exposures across a semester was 15.76% of all students warranting tracing. Total additional community exposures, infections, and mortality ranged from 1 to 187, 13 to 820, and 1 to 21 per 10,000 residents, respectively. 1% and 5% of on-campus students were infected after a mean (SD) of 11 (3) and 76 (17) days, respectively; >10% students infected by the end of a semester in 34.8% of scenarios, with the greatest increase (first inflection point) occurring on aver-age on day 84 (SD: 10.2 days). Common reopening precautions reduced infections by 24% to 26% and mortality by 36% to 50% in both populations. Uncertainties in many factors, however, produced tremendous variability in all results, ranging from medians by -67% to +342%. Conclusions: Consequences on community and student Covid-19 exposures, infections, and mortality of reopening physical campuses are very highly unpredictable, depending on a combination of random chance, controllable (e.g. physical layouts), and uncontrollable (e.g. human behavior) factors. Implications include needs for criteria to adapt campus operations mid-semester, methods to detect when necessary, and contingency plans for doing so.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"James C Benneyan","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Christopher Gehrke","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Iulian Ilies","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Nicole Nehls","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Gro Jamtvedt","author_inst":"Oslo Metropolitan University"},{"author_name":"Borghild Loyland","author_inst":"Oslo Metropolitan University"},{"author_name":"Ida Hellum Sandbekken","author_inst":"Oslo Metropolitan University"},{"author_name":"Alexander Schjoll","author_inst":"Oslo Metropolitan University"},{"author_name":"Kjetil Telle","author_inst":"Norwegian Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Sara Sofie Viksmoen Watle","author_inst":"Norwegian Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Laura Vanessa Montes Fontalvo","author_inst":"Hospital Infantil Napoleon Franco Pareja, Botota, Colombia"},{"author_name":"Roger Hernandez","author_inst":"Peruvian University Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Peru"},{"author_name":"Carolin Chavez","author_inst":"Unidad de Investigacion de Pediatria, Hospital Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Peru"},{"author_name":"Francisco Eduardo Campos","author_inst":"Unidad de Infectologia Pediatric; Hospital San Bartolome"},{"author_name":"Fadia Uribe","author_inst":"Hospital San Bartolome, Lima.

The isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from patients feces on human cell line raised concerns of possible transmission through human feces including exposure to aerosols generated by toilet flushing and through the indoor drainage system. Currently, routes of transmission, other than the close contact droplet transmission, are still not well understood. A quantitative microbial risk assessment was conducted to estimate the health risks associated with two aerosol exposure scenarios: 1) toilet flushing, and 2) faulty connection of a floor drain with the building main sewer pipe. SARS-CoV-2 data were collected from the emerging literature. The infectivity of the virus in feces was estimated based on a range of assumption between viral genome equivalence and infectious unit. The human exposure dose was calculated using Monte Carlo simulation of viral concentrations in aerosols under each scenario and human breathing rates. The probability of COVID-19 illness was generated using the dose-response model for SARS-CoV-1, a close relative of SARS-CoV-2, that was responsible for the SARS outbreak in 2003. The results indicate the median risks of developing COVID-19 for a single day exposure is 1.11 x 10-10 and 3.52 x 10-11 for toilet flushing and faulty drain scenario, respectively. The worst case scenario predicted the high end of COVID-19 risk for the toilet flushing scenario was 5.78 x 10-4 (at 95th percentile). The infectious viral loads in human feces are the most sensitive input parameter and contribute significantly to model uncertainty.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kuang-wei Shi","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Yen-Hsiang Huang","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Hunter Quon","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Zi-Lu Ou-Yang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Chengwen Wang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Sunny Jiang","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Ida Hellum Sandbekken","author_inst":"Oslo Metropolitan University"},{"author_name":"Alexander Schjoll","author_inst":"Oslo Metropolitan University"},{"author_name":"Kjetil Telle","author_inst":"Norwegian Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Sara Sofie Viksmoen Watle","author_inst":"Norwegian Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Laura Vanessa Montes Fontalvo","author_inst":"Hospital Infantil Napoleon Franco Pareja, Botota, Colombia"},{"author_name":"Roger Hernandez","author_inst":"Peruvian University Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Peru"},{"author_name":"Carolin Chavez","author_inst":"Unidad de Investigacion de Pediatria, Hospital Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Peru"},{"author_name":"Francisco Eduardo Campos","author_inst":"Unidad de Infectologia Pediatric; Hospital San Bartolome"},{"author_name":"Fadia Uribe","author_inst":"Hospital San Bartolome, Lima.

At the same time, bleeding complications have been observed in some patients. Better understanding the balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis will help inform optimal approaches to thrombosis prophylaxis and potential utility of fibrinolytic-targeted therapies. Methods: 118 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 30 healthy controls were included in the study. We measured plasma antigen levels of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and performed spontaneous clot lysis assays. Findings: We found markedly elevated levels of tPA and PAI-1 among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Both factors demonstrated a strong correlation with neutrophil counts and markers of neutrophil activation. High levels of tPA and PAI-1 were associated with worse respiratory status. High levels of tPA, in particular, were also strongly correlated with mortality and with a significant enhancement in spontaneous ex vivo clot lysis. Interpretation: While both tPA and PAI-1 are elevated among COVID-19 patients, extremely high levels of tPA enhance spontaneous fibrinolysis and are significantly associated with mortality in some patients. These data indicate that fibrinolytic homeostasis in COVID-19 is complex with a subset of patients expressing a balance of factors that may favor fibrinolysis, and suggest that further study of tPA as a potential biomarker is warranted.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yu Zuo","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Mark Warnock","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Alyssa Harbaugh","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Srilakshmi Yalavarthi","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Kelsey Gockman","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Melanie Zuo","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline A.

Reagent shortages may limit the expansion of testing required to scale back isolation measures. AIM To investigate the viability of sample pooling as a strategy for increasing test throughput and conserving PCR reagents; to report our early experience with pooling of clinical samples. METHODS A pre-implementation study was performed to assess the sensitivity and theoretical efficiency of two, four, and eight-sample pools in a real-time reverse transcription PCR-based workflow. A standard operating procedure was developed and implemented in two laboratories during periods of peak demand, inclusive of over 29,000 clinical samples processed in our laboratory. RESULTS Sensitivity decreased (mean absolute increase in cycle threshold value of 0.6, 2.3, and 3.0 for pools of two, four, and eight samples respectively) and efficiency increased as pool size increased. Gains from pooling diminished at high disease prevalence. Our standard operating procedure was successfully implemented across two laboratories. Increased workflow complexity imparts a higher risk of errors, and requires risk mitigation strategies. Turnaround time for individual samples increased, hence urgent samples should not be pooled. CONCLUSIONS Pooling is a viable strategy for high-throughput testing of SARS-CoV-2 in low-prevalence settings.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brian SW Chong","author_inst":"Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Thomas Tran","author_inst":"Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Julian Druce","author_inst":"Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Susan A Ballard","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity"},{"author_name":"Julie A Simpson","author_inst":"Centre for Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Mike Catton","author_inst":"Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline A.

Objective To assess the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on CVD-related hospitalizations and mortality. Design Community-based prospective cohort study. Setting the UK Biobank population. Participants 421,717 UK Biobank participants who were registered in England and alive on December 1st 2019. Main outcomes and measures The primary outcome of interest was CVD death, as deaths with CVD as a cause of death according to the death registers. We retrieved information on hospitalizations with CVD as the primary diagnosis based on the UK Biobank hospital inpatient data. The study period was between December 1st 2019 and May 30th 2020, and we used the same calendar period of the three preceding years as the reference period. Standardized mortality\/incidence ratios (SMRs\/SIRs) with 95% confidence intervals were used to estimate the relative risk of CVD outcomes during the study period, compared with the reference period, to control for seasonal variations and aging of the study population. Results We observed a distinct increase in CVD-related deaths in March and April 2020 as compared to the corresponding months of the three preceding years. The observed number of CVD death (n=217) was almost doubled in April, compared with the expected number (n=120), corresponding to an SMR of 1.81 (95% CI 1.58-2.06). We observed a sharp decline of CVD hospitalization in March (n=841) and April (n=454), compared with the expected number (n=1208 for March and 1026 for April), leading to an SIR of 0.70 (95% CI 0.65-0.74) for March and 0.44 (95% CI 0.40-0.48) for April. There was also a clear increase of death, but a clear decrease of hospitalization, in March and April for all the five major subtypes of CVD. Conclusions We observed a distinct excess in CVD deaths in the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in the UK Biobank population. In addition to CVD complications of SARS-CoV-2 infections, the reduced hospital capacity might have contributed to the observed excess CVD deaths.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Junren Wang","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Jianwei Zhu","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Huazhen Yang","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yao Hu","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yajing Sun","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Zhiye Ying","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yuanyuan Qu","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Unnur A Valdimarsdottir","author_inst":"University of Iceland"},{"author_name":"Fang Fang","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Huan Song","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Laura Vanessa Montes Fontalvo","author_inst":"Hospital Infantil Napoleon Franco Pareja, Botota, Colombia"},{"author_name":"Roger Hernandez","author_inst":"Peruvian University Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Peru"},{"author_name":"Carolin Chavez","author_inst":"Unidad de Investigacion de Pediatria, Hospital Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Peru"},{"author_name":"Francisco Eduardo Campos","author_inst":"Unidad de Infectologia Pediatric; Hospital San Bartolome"},{"author_name":"Fadia Uribe","author_inst":"Hospital San Bartolome, Lima.

We define a MIS-C transcriptional signature partially shared with the transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and with the signature of Kawasaki disease, a clinically similar condition. By projecting the MIS-C signature onto a co-expression network, we identified disease gene modules and found genes downregulated in MIS-C clustered in a module enriched for the transcriptional signatures of exhausted CD8+ T-cells and CD56dimCD57+ NK cells. Bayesian network analyses revealed nine key regulators of this module, including TBX21, a central coordinator of exhausted CD8+ T-cell differentiation. Together, these findings suggest dysregulated cytotoxic lymphocyte response to SARS-Cov-2 infection in MIS-C.","rel_num_authors":84,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Noam D.

Although the viral infection originates in the respiratory system, it is unclear how the virus can overcome the alveolar barrier, which is observed in severe COVID-19 disease courses.\n\nTo elucidate the viral effects on the barrier integrity and immune reactions, we used mono-cell culture systems and a complex human alveolus-on-a-chip model composed of epithelial, endothelial, and mononuclear cells.\n\nOur data show that SARS-CoV-2 efficiently infected epithelial cells with high viral loads and inflammatory response, including the interferon expression. By contrast, the adjacent endothelial layer was no infected and did neither show productive virus replication or interferon release. With prolonged infection, both cell types are damaged, and the barrier function is deteriorated, allowing the viral particles to overbear.\n\nIn our study, we demonstrate that although SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on the epithelium for efficient replication, the neighboring endothelial cells are affected, e.g., by the epithelial cytokine release, which results in the damage of the alveolar barrier function and viral dissemination.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stefanie Deinhardt-Emmer","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sarah B\u00f6ttcher","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Clio H\u00e4ring","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Liane Giebeler","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Andreas Henke","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Roland Zell","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital, Friedrich Schiller University"},{"author_name":"Franziska Hornung","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christian Brandt","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mike Marquet","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alexander S.

To understand the continuing spread of the virus, to detect those who are and were infected, and to follow the immune response longitudinally, reliable and robust assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection and immunological monitoring are needed and have been setup around the world. We quantified immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgG and IgA antibodies recognizing the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) or the Spike (S) protein over a period of five months following COVID-19 disease onset or in previously SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive volunteers. We report the detailed setup to monitor the humoral immune response from over 300 COVID-19 hospital patients and healthcare workers, 2500 University staff and 187 post-COVID19 volunteers, and assessing titres for IgM, IgG and IgA. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses followed a classic pattern with a rapid increase within the first three weeks after symptoms. Although titres reduce from approximately four weeks, the ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies remained robust for five months in a large proportion of previously virus-positive screened subjects. Our work provides detailed information for the assays used, facilitating further and longitudinal analysis of protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, it highlights a continued level of circulating neutralising antibodies in most people with confirmed SARS-CoV-2, at least up to five months after infection.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patricia Figueiredo-Campos","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Birte Blankenhaus","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Catarina Mota","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa; Centro Hospitalar Universitario Lisboa Norte EPE"},{"author_name":"Andreia Gomes","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Marta Serrano","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Silvia Ariotti","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Catarina Costa","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Helena Nunes-Cabaco","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Antonio M Mendes","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Pedro Gaspar","author_inst":"Centro Hospitalar Universitario Lisboa Norte EPE"},{"author_name":"Conceicao M Pereira-Santos","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Fabiana Rodrigues","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Jorge Condeco","author_inst":"Instituto Portugues do Sangue e Transplantacao"},{"author_name":"Antonia M Escoval","author_inst":"Instituto Portugues do Sangue e Transplantacao"},{"author_name":"Matilde Santos","author_inst":"Instituto Portugues do Sangue e Transplantacao"},{"author_name":"Mario Ramirez","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Jose Melo-Cristino","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Pedro J Simas","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto de Ciencias de Saude, Universidade Catolica Port"},{"author_name":"Eugenia Vasconcelos","author_inst":"Instituto Portugues do Sangue e Transplantacao"},{"author_name":"Angela Afonso","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Marc Veldhoen","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Matthew Harnett","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Melody Eaton","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sandra Hatem","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Hajra Jamal","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alara Akyatan","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Tabachnikova","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Lora E.

The reproduction number R of the virus could be counted directly, and was roughly, but not precisely, exponentially distributed. The number of secondary infections was greater for an infection which was itself one of many secondary infections because of environmental heterogeneity, which created variance of R among sites and could drive the spread of infection, even when global R < 1. Different kinds of intervention were deployed to curtail the spread of infection. Measures applied to the general population, such as closing down sites and services or regulating individual behaviour, did not reduce the total number of individuals infected during the epidemic unless they were maintained until the virus became extinct. This was primarily because measures taken to reduce indirect transmission tended to increase direct transmission, and vice versa. Consequently, the overall effect of any combination of interventions was much less than the sum of their separate effects. On the other hand, the quarantine of infected or exposed individuals was effective in driving the virus to extinction and caused a permanent and substantial reduction in the number of cases.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Graham Bell","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Birte Blankenhaus","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Catarina Mota","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa; Centro Hospitalar Universitario Lisboa Norte EPE"},{"author_name":"Andreia Gomes","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Marta Serrano","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Silvia Ariotti","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Catarina Costa","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Helena Nunes-Cabaco","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Antonio M Mendes","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Pedro Gaspar","author_inst":"Centro Hospitalar Universitario Lisboa Norte EPE"},{"author_name":"Conceicao M Pereira-Santos","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Fabiana Rodrigues","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Jorge Condeco","author_inst":"Instituto Portugues do Sangue e Transplantacao"},{"author_name":"Antonia M Escoval","author_inst":"Instituto Portugues do Sangue e Transplantacao"},{"author_name":"Matilde Santos","author_inst":"Instituto Portugues do Sangue e Transplantacao"},{"author_name":"Mario Ramirez","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Jose Melo-Cristino","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Pedro J Simas","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto de Ciencias de Saude, Universidade Catolica Port"},{"author_name":"Eugenia Vasconcelos","author_inst":"Instituto Portugues do Sangue e Transplantacao"},{"author_name":"Angela Afonso","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Marc Veldhoen","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Matthew Harnett","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Melody Eaton","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sandra Hatem","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Hajra Jamal","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alara Akyatan","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Tabachnikova","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Lora E.

The most convenient explanation is that some, external factor changed the value of the basic reproduction number, r0; and there certainly are arguments for this. Other factors could, nonetheless, have played a role. This research attempts to reconcile the observed peak with the thresholds predicted by lockdown regimes similar to the one in force at the time. It contemplates the effect of two, different, hypothetical errors in the data: The first is that the true level of infection has been underestimated by a multiplicative factor, while the second is that of an imperceptible, pre-existing, immune fraction of the population. While it is shown that it certainly is possible to manufacture the perception of an early peak as extreme as the one observed, solely by way of these two phenomena, the values need to be fairly high. The phenomena would not, by any measure, be insignificant. It also remains an inescapable fact that the early peak in infections coincided with a fairly profound change in r0; in all the contemplated scenarios of data-deficiency.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Simon John Childs","author_inst":"University of Fort Hare"},{"author_name":"Birte Blankenhaus","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Catarina Mota","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa; Centro Hospitalar Universitario Lisboa Norte EPE"},{"author_name":"Andreia Gomes","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Marta Serrano","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Silvia Ariotti","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Catarina Costa","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Helena Nunes-Cabaco","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Antonio M Mendes","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Pedro Gaspar","author_inst":"Centro Hospitalar Universitario Lisboa Norte EPE"},{"author_name":"Conceicao M Pereira-Santos","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Fabiana Rodrigues","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Jorge Condeco","author_inst":"Instituto Portugues do Sangue e Transplantacao"},{"author_name":"Antonia M Escoval","author_inst":"Instituto Portugues do Sangue e Transplantacao"},{"author_name":"Matilde Santos","author_inst":"Instituto Portugues do Sangue e Transplantacao"},{"author_name":"Mario Ramirez","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Jose Melo-Cristino","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Pedro J Simas","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto de Ciencias de Saude, Universidade Catolica Port"},{"author_name":"Eugenia Vasconcelos","author_inst":"Instituto Portugues do Sangue e Transplantacao"},{"author_name":"Angela Afonso","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Marc Veldhoen","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Matthew Harnett","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Melody Eaton","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sandra Hatem","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Hajra Jamal","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alara Akyatan","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Tabachnikova","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Lora E.

The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) releases weekly numbers of deaths attributed to a set of 'select causes', including deaths from COVID-19 in the entire United States (US), by state, and cumulatively for individual counties. Comparing US and state level deaths from select causes recorded in 2020 with values from 2014-2019 identifies a number of differences that exceeded 95% confidence limits on historical mean values, including three states with deaths possibly from COVID-19 in December 2019. Comparing county-level NCHS datasets with county-level data on deaths from COVID-19 compiled by four public pandemic tracking sites suggests that a large number of COVID-19 deaths have not yet been reported to the NCHS. Dividing the numbers of COVID-19 deaths counted by the public tracking sites by the percentage of COVID-19 deaths reported to the NCHS suggests that approximately 20% of all US deaths from Natural Causes, as many as 200,000, may not yet have been reported to the NCHS. Evaluating changes in the fractions of deaths attributed to COVID-19 and other specific causes or nonspecific outcomes during the epidemic, relative to 2020 totals or historical mean values, can provide a valuable perspective on the public health consequences of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Benjamin Stear","author_inst":"The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Kyle Hernandez","author_inst":"University of Chicago,"},{"author_name":"Vidya Manian","author_inst":"University of Puerto Rico"},{"author_name":"Deanne Taylor","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania Perelman Medical School"},{"author_name":"Catharine Conley","author_inst":"NASA Ames Research Center"},{"author_name":"Silvia Ariotti","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Catarina Costa","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Helena Nunes-Cabaco","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Antonio M Mendes","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Pedro Gaspar","author_inst":"Centro Hospitalar Universitario Lisboa Norte EPE"},{"author_name":"Conceicao M Pereira-Santos","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Fabiana Rodrigues","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Jorge Condeco","author_inst":"Instituto Portugues do Sangue e Transplantacao"},{"author_name":"Antonia M Escoval","author_inst":"Instituto Portugues do Sangue e Transplantacao"},{"author_name":"Matilde Santos","author_inst":"Instituto Portugues do Sangue e Transplantacao"},{"author_name":"Mario Ramirez","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Jose Melo-Cristino","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Pedro J Simas","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto de Ciencias de Saude, Universidade Catolica Port"},{"author_name":"Eugenia Vasconcelos","author_inst":"Instituto Portugues do Sangue e Transplantacao"},{"author_name":"Angela Afonso","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Marc Veldhoen","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Matthew Harnett","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Melody Eaton","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sandra Hatem","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Hajra Jamal","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alara Akyatan","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Tabachnikova","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Lora E.
