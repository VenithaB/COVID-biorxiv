Much of the dialogue around testing has concentrated on how countries can scale up capacity, but the uncertainty in testing has not received nearly as much attention beyond asking if a test is accurate enough to be used. Even for highly accurate tests, false positives and false negatives will accumulate as mass testing strategies are employed under pressure, and these misdiagnoses could have major implications on the ability of governments to suppress the virus. The present analysis uses a modified SIR model to understand the implication and magnitude of misdiagnosis in the context of ending lockdown measures. The results indicate that increased testing capacity alone will not provide a solution to lockdown measures. The progression of the epidemic and peak infections is shown to depend heavily on test characteristics, test targeting, and prevalence of the infection. Antibody based immunity passports are rejected as a solution to ending lockdown, as they can put the population at risk if poorly targeted. Similarly, mass screening for active viral infection may only be beneficial if it can be sufficiently well targeted, otherwise reliance on this approach for protection of the population can again put them at risk. A well targeted active viral test combined with a slow release rate is a viable strategy for continuous suppression of the virus.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicholas Gray","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Dominic Calleja","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Alexander Wimbush","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Enrique Miralles-Dolz","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Ander Gray","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Marco De-Angelis","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Elfride Derrer-Merk","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Bright Uchenna Oparaji","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Vladimir Stepanov","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Louis Clearkin","author_inst":"Wirral & Liverpool University Teaching Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Scott Ferson","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.16.20068379","rel_title":"Prioritisation of potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug repurposing opportunities based on ability to achieve adequate target site concentrations derived from their established human pharmacokinetics","rel_date":"2020-04-22","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.16.20068379","rel_abs":"Many papers are emerging that describe the in vitro antiviral activity of drugs that may be repurposed for therapy or chemoprophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2. However, no comprehensive evaluation of these molecules in the context of the achievable plasma pharmacokinetics after administration of approved doses and schedules to humans has been conducted. Moreover, most publications have focussed on 50% maximum effective concentrations (EC50), which may be an insufficiently robust indicator of antiviral activity because of marked differences in the slope of the concentration-response curve between drugs. Accordingly, in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity data was digitised from all available publications up to 13th April 2020 and used to recalculate an EC90 value for each drug. EC90 values were then expressed as a ratio to the achievable maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) reported for each drug after administration of the approved dose to humans (Cmax\/EC90 ratio). Only 14 of the analysed drugs achieved a Cmax\/EC90 ratio above 1 meaning that plasma Cmax concentrations exceeded those necessary to inhibit 90% of SARS-CoV-2 replication. A more in-depth assessment of these drugs demonstrated that only nitazoxanide, nelfinavir, tipranavir (boosted with ritonavir) and sulfadoxine achieved plasma concentrations above their anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity across their entire approved dosing interval at their approved human dose. For all drugs reported, the unbound lung to plasma tissue partition coefficient (KpUlung) was also simulated and used along with reported Cmax and fraction unbound in plasma to derive a lung Cmax\/EC50 as a better indicator of potential human efficacy (lung Cmax\/EC90 ratio was also calculable for a limited number of drugs). Using this parameter hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, mefloquine, atazanavir (boosted with ritonavir), tipranavir (boosted with ritonavir), ivermectin, azithromycin and lopinavir (boosted with ritonavir) were all predicted to achieve lung concentrations over 10-fold higher than their reported EC50. This analysis was not possible for nelfinavir because insufficient data were available to calculate KpUlung but nitozoxanide and sulfadoxine were also predicted to exceed their reported EC50 by 3.1- and 1.5-fold in lung, respectively. The antiviral activity data reported to date is of variable quality and conducted under different conditions by different investigators. However, this analysis has prioritised candidates with the best chance for success in therapy or chemoprevention of Covid-19 based upon the currently available in vitro activity and human plasma pharmacokinetic data. Future studies should focus on EC90 values and discuss findings in the context of achievable exposures in humans, especially within target compartments such as the lung, in order to maximise the potential for success of proposed human clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Usman Arshad","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Henry Pertinez","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Helen Box","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Lee Tatham","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Rajith KR Rajoli","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Paul Curley","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Megan Neary","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Joanne Sharp","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Neill J Liptrott","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Anthony Valentijn","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Christopher David","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Steve P Rannard","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69 3BX, UK"},{"author_name":"Paul O'Neill","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69 3BX, UK"},{"author_name":"Ghaith Aljayyoussi","author_inst":"Centre for Drugs and Diagnostics.

With vaccine and novel drug development in early clinical trials, repurposing of existing drugs takes the center stage. Objective: A potential drug discussed in global scientific community is hydroxychloroquine. We intend to systematically explore, analyze, rate the existing evidence of hydroxychloroquine in the light of published, unpublished and clinical trial data. Evidence review: PubMed Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google scholar databases, pre-proof article repositories, clinical trial registries were comprehensively searched with focused question of use of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients. The literature was systematically explored as per PRISMA guidelines. Findings: Total 156 articles were available as of 7th May 2020; of which 11 articles of relevance were analyzed. Three in-vitro studies were reviewed. Two open label non-randomized trials, two open label randomized control trials, one large observational study, one follow-up study and two retrospective cohort studies were systematically analyzed and rated by oxford CEBM and GRADE framework for quality and strength of evidence. Also 27 clinical trials registered in three clinical trial registries were analyzed and summarized. Hydroxychloroquine seems to be efficient in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in in-vitro cell lines. However, there is lack of strong evidence from human studies. It was found that overall quality of available evidence ranges from \"very low\" to \"low\". Conclusions and relevance: The in-vitro cell culture based data of viral inhibition does not suffice for the use of hydroxychloroquine in the patients with COVID-19. Current literature shows inadequate, low level evidence in human studies. Scarcity of safety and efficacy data warrants medical communities, health care agencies and governments across the world against the widespread use of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 prophylaxis and treatment, until robust evidence becomes available.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Umesh Devappa Suranagi","author_inst":"Lady Hardinge Medical College"},{"author_name":"Harmeet Singh Rehan","author_inst":"Lady Hardinge Medical College"},{"author_name":"Nitesh Goyal","author_inst":"Lady Hardinge Medical College"},{"author_name":"Lee Tatham","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Rajith KR Rajoli","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Paul Curley","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Megan Neary","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Joanne Sharp","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Neill J Liptrott","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Anthony Valentijn","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Christopher David","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Steve P Rannard","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69 3BX, UK"},{"author_name":"Paul O'Neill","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69 3BX, UK"},{"author_name":"Ghaith Aljayyoussi","author_inst":"Centre for Drugs and Diagnostics.

The present study examined this hypothesis using statistical approaches based on the public data. Three approaches were utilized: 1) comparing the infection and mortality ratio of people on the cruise ship Diamond Princess, 2) comparing the number of mortalities among nations, and 3) comparing the maximum daily increase rate of total mortalities among nations. The result of 1) showed that there is no significant difference in infection per person onboard and mortality-infection between Japanese citizens vs. other nationalities and BCG obligatory nations vs. non-BCG obligatory nations on the Diamond Princess. The result of 2) showed that the number of mortalities among nations is similar to the previous studies, but this analysis also considered the timing of COVID-19 arrival in each nation. After correcting for arrival time, previously reported effect of BCG vaccination on decreasing total mortality disappeared. This is because nations that lack BCG vaccination are concentrated in Western Europe, which is near an epicenter of COVID-19. Therefore some previous reports are now considered to be affected by this artifact; the result may have been flawed by dispersal from an epicenter. However, some results showed weakly significant differences in the number of deaths at a particular time among BCG obligatory and non-BCG nations (especially the use of Japanese BCG strain Tokyo 172). However, these results are affected by the results of three countries and the effect of BCG vaccination remains inconclusive. The result of 3) showed that the maximum daily increasing rate in death among nations showed no significant difference among BCG vaccination policies. In the present study, although some results showed statistically significant differences among BCG vaccination policies, they may be affected by the impact of various other factors, such as national infection-control policies, social distancing, behavioral changes of people, possible previous local epidemics of closely related viruses, or inter-population differences in ACE2 or other genetic polymorphism. Further research is needed to better understand the underlying cause of the observed differences in infection and mortality of the disease among nations. Nevertheless, our results show that the effect of past BCG vaccination, if any, can be masked by many other factors. Therefore, the possible effect might be relatively small. In fact, in Japan, where almost all citizens have been vaccinated, COVID-19 cases are constantly increasing. Given the importance of peoples behavior in preventing viral propagation, the spread of optimism triggered by this hypothesis would be harmful to BCG vaccination nations.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Masakazu Asahara","author_inst":"Aichi Gakuin University"},{"author_name":"Valentina Socci","author_inst":"University of L'Aquila"},{"author_name":"Francesca Pacitti","author_inst":"University of L'Aquila"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Di Lorenzo","author_inst":"University of Rome Tor Vergata"},{"author_name":"Antinisca Di Marco","author_inst":"University of L'Aquila"},{"author_name":"Alberto Siracusano","author_inst":"University of Rome Tor Vergata"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Rossi","author_inst":"University of L'Aquila"},{"author_name":"Joanne Sharp","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Neill J Liptrott","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Anthony Valentijn","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Christopher David","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Steve P Rannard","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69 3BX, UK"},{"author_name":"Paul O'Neill","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69 3BX, UK"},{"author_name":"Ghaith Aljayyoussi","author_inst":"Centre for Drugs and Diagnostics.

Methods: We used years of life lost (YLL) as the main outcome measure as applied to Switzerland as an exemplar. We focused on suicide, depression, alcohol use disorder, childhood trauma due to domestic violence, changes in marital status and social isolation as these are known to increase YLL in the context of imposed restriction in social contact and freedom of movement. We stipulated a minimum duration of mitigation of 3 months based on current public health plans. Results: The study projects that the average person would suffer 0.205 YLL due to psychosocial consequence of COVID-19 mitigation measures. However, this loss would be entirely borne by 2.1% of the population, who will suffer an average 9.79 YLL. Conclusions: The results presented here are likely to underestimate the true impact of the mitigation strategies on YLL.

Italy is one of the European countries most affected by the COVID-19 disease, and it has registered high COVID-19 death rates and the death toll. In this article, we analyzed different Italian COVID-19 data at the regional level for the period February 24 to March 29, 2020. The analysis pipeline includes the following steps. After individuating groups of similar or dissimilar regions with respect to the ten types of available COVID-19 data using statistical test, we built several similarity matrices (reported in Supplementary file). Then, we mapped those similarity matrices into networks where nodes represent Italian regions and edges represent similarity relationships (edge length is inversely proportional to similarity). Then, network-based analysis was performed mainly discovering communities of regions that show similar behaviour. Then, network-based analysis was performed by running several community detection algorithms on those networks and by underlying communities of regions that show similar behaviour. The network-based analysis of Italian COVID-19 data is able to elegantly show how regions form communities, i.e. how they join and leave them, along time and how community consistency changes along time and with respect to the different available data.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marianna Milano","author_inst":"University Magna Graecia of Catanzaro"},{"author_name":"Mario Cannataro","author_inst":"University Magna Graecia of Catanzaro"},{"author_name":"Karen O'Connor","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Haitao Cai","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Davy Weissenbacher","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Graciela Gonzalez-Hernandez","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Rossi","author_inst":"University of L'Aquila"},{"author_name":"Joanne Sharp","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Neill J Liptrott","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Anthony Valentijn","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Christopher David","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L7 3NY, UK"},{"author_name":"Steve P Rannard","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69 3BX, UK"},{"author_name":"Paul O'Neill","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69 3BX, UK"},{"author_name":"Ghaith Aljayyoussi","author_inst":"Centre for Drugs and Diagnostics.

To help limit the spread in Massachusetts, the Department of Public Health required that all healthcare workers must be screened for symptoms daily - individuals with symptoms may not work. We rapidly created a digital COVID-19 symptom screening tool for a large, academic, integrated healthcare delivery system, Partners HealthCare, in Boston, Massachusetts. Objective: We describe the design and development of the COVID-19 symptom screening application and report on aggregate usage data from the first week of use across the organization. Methods: Using agile principles, we designed, tested and implemented a solution over the span of a week using progressively custom development approaches as the requirements and use case become more solidified. We developed the minimum viable product (MVP) of a mobile responsive, web-based self-service application using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture). For employees without access to a computer or mobile device to use the self-service application, we established a manual process where in-person, socially distanced screeners asked employees entering the site if they have symptoms and then manually recorded the responses in an Office 365 Form. A custom .NET Framework application was developed solution as COVID Pass was scaled. We collected log data from the .NET application, REDCap and Office 365 from the first week of full enterprise deployment (March 30, 2020 - April 5, 2020). Aggregate descriptive statistics including overall employee attestations by day and site, employee attestations by application method (COVID Pass automatic screening vs. manual screening), employee attestations by time of day, and percentage of employees reporting COVID-19 symptoms Results: We rapidly created the MVP and gradually deployed it across the hospitals in our organization. By the end of the first week of enterprise deployment, the screening application was being used by over 25,000 employees each weekday. Over the first full week of deployment, 154,730 employee attestation logs were processed across the system. Over this 7-day period, 558 (0.36%) employees reported positive symptoms. In most clinical locations, the majority of employees (~80-90%) used the self-service application, with a smaller percentage (~10-20%) using manual attestation. Hospital staff continued to work around the clock, but as expected, staff attestations peaked during shift changes between 7-8am, 2-3pm, 4-6pm, and 11pm-midnight. Conclusions: Using rapid, agile development, we quickly created and deployed a dedicated employee attestation application that gained widespread adoption and use within our health system. Further, we have identified over 500 symptomatic employees that otherwise would have possibly come to work, potentially putting others at risk. We share the story of our implementation, lessons learned, and source code (via GitHub) for other institutions who may want to implement similar solutions.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Haipeng Zhang","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dimitar Dimitrov","author_inst":"Partners Healthcare"},{"author_name":"Lynn Simpson","author_inst":"Partners Healthcare"},{"author_name":"Balaji Singh","author_inst":"Partners Information Systems"},{"author_name":"Nina Plaks","author_inst":"Partners Information Systems"},{"author_name":"Stephen Penney","author_inst":"Partners Information Systems"},{"author_name":"Jo Charles","author_inst":"Partners Enterprise Data & Digital Health"},{"author_name":"Rosemary Sheehan","author_inst":"Partners Human Resources"},{"author_name":"Steven Flammini","author_inst":"Partners Information Systems"},{"author_name":"Shawn Murphy","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Adam Landman","author_inst":"Brigham and Womens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Steve P Rannard","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69 3BX, UK"},{"author_name":"Paul O'Neill","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69 3BX, UK"},{"author_name":"Ghaith Aljayyoussi","author_inst":"Centre for Drugs and Diagnostics.

Cases are clustered in the city, with certain neighborhoods experiencing more cases than others. We investigate whether potential socioeconomic factors can explain between-neighborhood variation in the number of detected COVID-19 cases. Methods: Data were collected from 177 Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA) in New York City (99.9% of the population). We fit multiple Bayesian Besag-York-Mollie (BYM) mixed models using positive COVID-19 tests as the outcome and a set of 10 representative economic, demographic, and health-care associated ZCTA-level parameters as potential predictors. The BYM model includes both spatial and nonspatial random effects to account for clustering and overdispersion. Results: Multiple different regression approaches indicated a consistent, statistically significant association between detected COVID-19 cases and dependent (under 18 or 65+ years old) population, male to female ratio, and median household income. In the final model, we found that an increase of only 1% in dependent population is associated with a 2.5% increase in detected COVID-19 cases (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.6% to 3.4%, p < 0.0005). An increase of 1 male per 100 females is associated with a 1.0% (95% CI: 0.6% to 1.5%, p < 0.0005) increases in detected cases. A decrease of $10,000 median household income is associated with a 2.5% (95% CI: 1.0% to 4.1% p = 0.002) increase in detected COVID-19 cases. Conclusions: Our findings indicate associations between neighborhoods with a large dependent population, those with a high proportion of males, and low-income neighborhoods and detected COVID-19 cases. Given the elevated mortality in aging populations, the study highlights the importance of public health management during and after the current COVID-19 pandemic. Further work is warranted to fully understand the mechanisms by which these factors may have affected the number of detected cases, either in terms of the true number of cases or access to testing.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Richard Stuart Whittle","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Ana Diaz-Artiles","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Jack Lahey","author_inst":"Skid Row Housing Trust"},{"author_name":"Isha Berry","author_inst":"Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Joanna Pineda","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto; Ontario Institute for Cancer Research"},{"author_name":"Vinyas Harish","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto; Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Andrew T Lam","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Seung Eun Yi","author_inst":"Layer 6 AI"},{"author_name":"Sophie Hu","author_inst":"Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Canadian Open Data Working Group: Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Benjamin Fine","author_inst":"Institute for Better Health, Trillium Health Partners; Department of Medical Imaging, University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Steve P Rannard","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69 3BX, UK"},{"author_name":"Paul O'Neill","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69 3BX, UK"},{"author_name":"Ghaith Aljayyoussi","author_inst":"Centre for Drugs and Diagnostics.

While vaccination remains the cornerstone of influenza prevention, common measures practiced during the COVID-19 pandemic such as social distancing, the use of protective face masks, and frequent hand washing are rarely utilized during flu season. In this investigation, we examined the effect of these preventative measures in decreasing influenza burden this year. We examined three countries with major COVID-19 outbreaks i.e. China, Italy and the United States, and compared the flu activity this year to the average of the last 4 years (2015-2019). We found that this year in China and Italy, there was a significantly steeper decline of flu cases than average, which correlated with an increase in positive COVID-19 case reports in those countries. These \"averted\" cases can be translated into a substantial decrease in morbidity and mortality. As such, we conclude that the current COVID-19 pandemic is a reminder that behavioral measures can decrease the burden of communicable respiratory infections, and these measures should be adopted to an extent during normal influenza season.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Grant M Young","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Xiaohua Peng","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Andre Rebaza","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Santos Bermejo","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"De Chang","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Lokesh Sharma","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Charles Dela Cruz","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Seung Eun Yi","author_inst":"Layer 6 AI"},{"author_name":"Sophie Hu","author_inst":"Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Canadian Open Data Working Group: Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Benjamin Fine","author_inst":"Institute for Better Health, Trillium Health Partners; Department of Medical Imaging, University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Steve P Rannard","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69 3BX, UK"},{"author_name":"Paul O'Neill","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69 3BX, UK"},{"author_name":"Ghaith Aljayyoussi","author_inst":"Centre for Drugs and Diagnostics.

Two particle counters concurrently sample ambient air and air inside the masks; mask performance is evaluated by mean particle removal efficiency and statistical variability when worn as designed and with a nylon overlayer, to independently assess fit and material. Worn as designed both commercial surgical masks and cloth masks had widely varying effectiveness (53-75% and 28-90% filtration efficiency, respectively). Most surgical-style masks improved with the nylon overlayer, indicating poor fit. This rapid testing method uses widely available hardware, requires only a few calculations from collected data, and provides both a holistic and aspect-wise evaluation of mask performance.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amy V Mueller","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Matthew J.

Among the standard models for COVID-19 global pandemic prediction, simple epidemiological and statistical models have received more attention by authorities, and they are popular in the media. Due to a high level of uncertainty and lack of essential data, standard models have shown low accuracy for long-term prediction. Although the literature includes several attempts to address this issue, the essential generalization and robustness abilities of existing models needs to be improved. This paper presents a comparative analysis of machine learning and soft computing models to predict the COVID-19 outbreak. Among a wide range of machine learning models investigated, two models showed promising results (i.e., multi-layered perceptron, MLP, and adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system, ANFIS). Based on the results reported here, and due to the highly complex nature of the COVID-19 outbreak and variation in its behavior from nation-to-nation, this study suggests machine learning as an effective tool to model the outbreak.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sina F.

It is therefore urgent to estimate the impact such measures are having. We introduce a Bayesian epidemiological model in which a proportion of individuals are willing and able to participate in distancing measures, with the timing of these measures informed by survey data on attitudes to distancing and COVID-19.We fit our model to reported COVID-19 cases in British Columbia, Canada, using an observation model that accounts for both underestimation and the delay between symptom onset and reporting. We estimate the impact that physical distancing (also known as social distancing)has had on the contact rate and examine the projected impact of relaxing distancing measures. We find that distancing has had a strong impact, consistent with declines in reported cases and in hospitalization and intensive care unit numbers. We estimate that approximately 0.78 (0.66-0.89 90% CI) of contacts have been removed for individuals in British Columbia practising physical distancing and that this fraction is above the threshold of 0.45 at which prevalence is expected to grow. However, relaxing distancing measures beyond this threshold re-starts rapid exponential growth. Because the extent of underestimation is unknown, the data are consistent with a wide range in the prevalence of COVID-19 in the population; changes to testing criteria over time introduce additional uncertainty. Our projections indicate that intermittent distancing measures - if sufficiently strong and robustly followed - could control COVID-19 transmission, but that if distancing measures are relaxed too much, the epidemic curve would grow to high prevalence.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sean C Anderson","author_inst":"Pacific Biological Station, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Nanaimo, BC, Canada"},{"author_name":"Andrew M Edwards","author_inst":"Pacific Biological Station, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Nanaimo, BC, Canada"},{"author_name":"Madi Yerlanov","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Nicola Mulberry","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Jessica Stockdale","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Sarafa A Iyaniwura","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Rebeca C Falcao","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Michael C.

We analysed an outbreak involving three non-associated families in Restaurant X in Guangzhou, China, and assessed the possibility of aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and characterize the associated environmental conditions. Methods: We collected epidemiological data, obtained a video record and a patron seating-arrangement from the restaurant, and measured the dispersion of a warm tracer gas as a surrogate for exhaled droplets from the suspected index patient. Computer simulations were performed to simulate the spread of fine exhaled droplets. We compared the in-room location of subsequently infected cases and spread of the simulated virus-laden aerosol tracer. The ventilation rate was measured using the tracer decay method. Results: Three families (A, B, C), 10 members of which were subsequently found to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 at this time, or previously, ate lunch at Restaurant X on Chinese New Year's Eve (January 24, 2020) at three neighboring tables. Subsequently, three members of family B and two members of family C became infected with SARS-CoV-2, whereas none of the waiters or 68 patrons at the remaining 15 tables became infected. During this occasion, the ventilation rate was 0.75-1.04 L\/s per person. No close contact or fomite contact was observed, aside from back-to-back sitting by some patrons. Our results show that the infection distribution is consistent with a spread pattern representative of exhaled virus-laden aerosols. Conclusions: Aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 due to poor ventilation may explain the community spread of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yuguo Li","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Hua Qian","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Jian Hang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xuguang Chen","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Ling Hong","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Peng Liang","author_inst":"Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jiansen Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Shenglan Xiao","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Jianjian Wei","author_inst":"Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Li Liu","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Min Kang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou"},{"author_name":"Caroline Colijn","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Paul O'Neill","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69 3BX, UK"},{"author_name":"Ghaith Aljayyoussi","author_inst":"Centre for Drugs and Diagnostics.

The primary aim of this review was to establish the incidence and timing of positive faecal samples for SARS-CoV-2 in patients with COVID-19. Methods A systematic literature review identified studies describing COVID-19 patients tested for faecal virus. Search terms for Medline included \"clinical\", \"faeces\", \"gastrointestinal secretions\", \"stool\", \"COVID-19\", \"SARS-CoV-2\", and \"2019-nCoV\". Additional searches were done in AJG, Gastroenterology, Gut, Lancet Gastroenterology and Hepatology, The WHO Database, CEBM, NEJM, social media and the NICE, bioRxiv and medRxiv preprints. Data were extracted concerning the type of test, number and timing of positive samples, incidence of positive faecal tests after negative nasopharyngeal swabs and evidence of viable faecal virus or faeco-oral transmission of the virus. Results There were 26 relevant articles identified. Combining study results demonstrated that 53.9% of those tested for faecal RNA were positive. Duration of faecal viral shedding ranged from 1 to 33 days after a negative nasopharyngeal swab with one result remaining positive 47 days after onset of symptoms. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that COVID-19 is transmitted via faecally shed virus. Conclusion There is a high rate of positive PCR tests with persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in faecal samples of patients with COVID-19. Further research is needed to confirm if this virus is viable and the degree of transmission through the faeco-oral route. This may have important implications on isolation, recommended precautions and protective equipment for interventional procedures involving the gastrointestinal tract.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sunnia Gupta","author_inst":"Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"Jody Parker","author_inst":"Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Smits","author_inst":"Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Underwood","author_inst":"Cardiff University and Cardiff and Vale Health Board"},{"author_name":"Sunil Dolwani","author_inst":"Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"Peng Liang","author_inst":"Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jiansen Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Shenglan Xiao","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Jianjian Wei","author_inst":"Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Li Liu","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Min Kang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangzhou"},{"author_name":"Caroline Colijn","author_inst":"Simon Fraser University"},{"author_name":"Paul O'Neill","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69 3BX, UK"},{"author_name":"Ghaith Aljayyoussi","author_inst":"Centre for Drugs and Diagnostics.

The clinical presentation of COVID-19 is fairly non-specific, and symptoms overlap with other seasonal respiratory infections concurrently circulating in the population. Further, it is estimated that up to 80% of infected individuals experience mild symptoms or are asymptomatic, confounding efforts to reliably diagnose COVID-19 empirically. To support infection control measures, there is an urgent need for rapid and accurate molecular diagnostics to identify COVID-19 positive patients. In the present study, we have evaluated the analytical sensitivity and clinical performance of four SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic assays granted Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA using nasopharyngeal swabs from symptomatic patients.

Amid the increasing number of global pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, there is a need for a quick and easy method to obtain a non-invasive sample for the detection of this novel coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2). We aimed to investigate the potential use of saliva samples as a non-invasive tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Methods. From 27 March to 4 April, 2020, we prospectively collected saliva samples and a standard nasopharyngeal and throat swab in persons seeking care at an acute respiratory infection clinic in a university hospital during the outbreak of COVID-19. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed, and the results of the two specimens were compared. Results. Two-hundred pairs of the samples were collected. Sixty-nine (34.5%) patients were male, and the median (interquartile) age was 36 (28-48) years. Using nasopharyngeal and throat swab RT-PCR as the reference standard, the prevalence of COVID-19 diagnosed by nasopharyngeal and throat swab RT-PCR was 9.5%. The sensitivity and specificity of the saliva sample RT-PCR were 84.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) 79.2%-89.3%], and 98.9% (95% CI 97.5-100.3%), respectively. An analysis of the agreement between the two specimens demonstrated 97.5% observed agreement (kappa coefficient 0.851, 95% CI 0.723-0.979; p <0.001). Conclusions. Saliva specimens can be used for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The collection method is non-invasive, and non-aerosol generating. Using a saliva sample as a specimen for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 could facilitate the diagnosis of the disease, which is one of the strategies that helps in controlling the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ekawat Pasomsub","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University"},{"author_name":"Siriorn P.

This study's aims to assess the current evidence presented in the literature regarding the potential risks of COVID-19 infection among pregnant women and consequent fetal transmission. Methods: a systematic literature review assessing papers published in the most comprehensive databases in the field of health, intended to answer the question: What are the effects of COVID-19 infection during pregnancy and what is the neonatal prognosis?. Results: 42 papers published in 2020 were eligible. Were included 19 case reports (45%), 15 cross-sectional descriptive studies (35%), 6 cross-sectional analytical studies (14%), one case-control study (3%) and one cohort study (3%), presenting low levels of evidence. A total of 650 pregnant women and 511 infants were assessed. More than half of pregnant women having cesarean deliveries (324\/64%). Only 410 (80%) infants were tested for SARS-CoV-2, of which 8 (2%) were positive, however, based on what was assessed that there is no evidence of vertical transmission so far, as there are gaps concerning the care taken during and after delivery, and biological sample proper for testing the SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions: health professionals cannot rule out a possible worsening of the clinical picture of the pregnant woman infected with SARS-CoV-2 because she is asymptomatic or does not have comorbidities related to gestation. Pregnant women and health professionals should be cautious and vigilant, as soon as their pregnancy is confirmed, with or without confirmed infection, as this review checks for infected pregnant women in all trimesters of pregnancy.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alvaro Francisco Lopes de Sousa","author_inst":"Instituto de Higiene e Medicina Tropical, Universidade Nova de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Herica Emilia Felix de Carvalho","author_inst":"Escola de Enfermagem de Ribeirao Preto da Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Layze Braz de Oliveira","author_inst":"Escola de Enfermagem de Ribeirao Preto da Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Guilherme Schneider","author_inst":"Escola de Enfermagem de Ribeirao Preto da Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Emerson Lucas Silva Camargo","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Evandro Watanabe","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Denise Andrade","author_inst":"Escola de Enfermagem de Ribeirao Preto da Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Ana Fatima Carvalho","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Ceara"},{"author_name":"Isabel Amelia Costa Mendes","author_inst":"Escola de Enfermagem de Ribeirao Preto da Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Ines Fronteira","author_inst":"Instituto de Higiene e Medicina Tropical"},{"author_name":"Asaf Gertler","author_inst":"Hadassah Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Zeev Rotstein","author_inst":"Hadassah Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Bruno Lavi","author_inst":"Hadassah Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yuval Dor","author_inst":"The Hebrew University of Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Dana G Wolf","author_inst":"Hadassah Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Maayan Salton","author_inst":"The Hebrew University of Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Yotam Drier","author_inst":"The Hebrew University of Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"- The Hebrew University-Hadassah COVID-19 diagnosis team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Patrick G Bray","author_inst":"Pat Bray Electrical, 260D Orrell Road, Orrell, Wigan, WN5 8QZ, UK"},{"author_name":"Giancarlo Biagini","author_inst":"Centre for Drugs and Diagnostics.

Staging and prognosis are especially crucial for organizational anticipation (intensive-care bed availability, patient management planning) and accelerating drug development; through rapid, reproducible and quantified response-to-treatment assessment. In this letter, we report on an artificial intelligence solution for performing automatic staging and prognosis based on imaging, clinical, comorbidities and biological data. This approach relies on automatic computed tomography (CT)-based disease quantification using deep learning, robust data-driven identification of physiologically-inspired COVID-19 holistic patient profiling, and strong, reproducible staging\/outcome prediction with good generalization properties using an ensemble of consensus methods. Highly promising results on multiple independent external evaluation cohorts along with comparisons with expert human readers demonstrate the potentials of our approach. The developed solution offers perspectives for optimal patient management, given the shortage of intensive care beds and ventilators, along with means to assess patient response to treatment.","rel_num_authors":35,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guillaume Chassagnon","author_inst":"Radiology Department, Hopital Cochin - AP-HP.Centre Universite de Paris, 27 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Jacques, 75014 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Maria Vakalopoulou","author_inst":"Universite Paris-Saclay, CentraleSupelec, Mathematiques et Informatique pour la Complexite et les Systemes, Gif-sur-Yvette, France, 3 Rue Joliot Curie, 91190 Gi"},{"author_name":"Enzo Battistella","author_inst":"Universite Paris-Saclay, CentraleSupelec, Mathematiques et Informatique pour la Complexite et les Systemes, Gif-sur-Yvette, France, 3 Rue Joliot Curie, 91190 Gi"},{"author_name":"Stergios Christodoulidis","author_inst":"Universite Paris-Saclay, Institut Gustave Roussy, Inserm 1030 Predictive Biomarkers and New Therapeutic Strategies in Oncology, 114 Rue Edouard Vaillant, 94800 "},{"author_name":"Trieu-Nghi Hoang-Thi","author_inst":"Radiology Department, Hopital Cochin - AP-HP.

In the absence of high-quality evidence, understandably the recommendations from various organizations are cautious. Several randomized controlled trials are underway but shall take time to conclude. We therefore undertook a meta-analysis to ascertain the role of CS in the management of critically ill patients with COVID-19. Data Sources: Electronic databases, including Pubmed, Cochrane library and Embase, were searched, using the keywords of interest and the PICO search technique, from inception to 12th April 2020. Study Selection: Studies highlighting the use of CS in coronavirus infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and COVID-19 were selected based on pre-determined inclusion criteria. Data extraction: Data was extracted into an excel sheet and transferred to comprehensive meta-analysis software version 3, Biostat Inc., Englewood, NJ, USA, for analysis. Data synthesis: Five studies with SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the meta-analysis. The rate ratio (RR) for mortality in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection was 1.26 (95% CI: 0.96-1.65, I2: 74.46), indicating lack of benefit of CS therapy on mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19. The RR for mortality on analysis of the three studies that particularly reported on patients with significant pulmonary compromise secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection was neutral (RR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.63-1.33, I2: 63.38). Conclusions: The use of CS in critically ill patients with COVID-19 did not improve or worsen mortality. Pending further information from controlled studies, CS can be used in critically ill patients with COVID-19 with critical illness related corticosteroid insufficiency and moderate to severe ARDS without the risk of increased mortality.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kalyan Kumar Gangopadhyay","author_inst":"Fortis and Peerless Hospital, Kolkata, India"},{"author_name":"Jagat J Mukherjee","author_inst":"Apollo Gleneagles Hospital, Kolkata, India"},{"author_name":"Binayak Sinha","author_inst":"AMRI Hospitals, Kolkata, India"},{"author_name":"SAMIT GHOSAL","author_inst":"Nightingale Hospital"},{"author_name":"Trieu-Nghi Hoang-Thi","author_inst":"Radiology Department, Hopital Cochin - AP-HP.

COVID-19 coronavirus has been global threat of the disease and infected humans rapidly. Control of the pandemi is urgently essential, and science community have continued to research treatment agents. Support therapy and intensive care units in hospitals are also efective to overcome of COVID-19. Statistic forecasting models could aid to healthcare system in preventation of COVID-19. This study aimed to compose of forecasting model that could be practical to predict the spread of COVID-19 in Italy, Spain and Turkey. For this purpose, we performed Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model on the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control COVID-19 data to predict the number of cases and deaths in COVID-19. According to the our results, while number of cases in Italy and Spain is expected to decrease as of July, in Turkey is expected to decline as of September. The number of deaths in Italy and Spain is expected to be the lowest in July. In Turkey, this number is expected to reach the highest in July. In addition, it is thought that if studies in which the sensitivity and validity of this method are tested with more cases, they will contribute to researchers working in this field.

However, little has been done to account for the potential confounding effects of these factors. Using a large multivariate analysis, this study illuminates modulators of COVID-19 incidence and mortality in U.S. counties while controlling for risk factors across multiple domains. Methods: Data on COVID-19 and various risk factors in all U.S. counties was collected from publicly available data sources through April 14, 2020. Counties with at least 50 COVID-19 cases were included in case analyses and those with at least 10 deaths were included in mortality models. The 661 counties meeting inclusion criteria for number of cases were grouped into quartiles and comparisons of risk factors were made using t-tests between the highest and lowest quartiles. Similar comparisons for 217 counties were made for above average and below average deaths\/100,000. Adjusted linear and logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the independent effects of factors that significantly impacted cases and deaths. Results: Univariate analyses demonstrated numerous significant differences between cohorts for both cases and deaths. Risk factors associated with increased cases and\/or deaths per 100,000 included increased GDP per capita, decreased social distancing, increased age, increased percent Black, decreased percent Hispanic, decreased percent Asian, decreased health, increased poverty, increased diabetes, increased coronary heart disease, increased physical inactivity, increased alcohol consumption, increased tobacco use, and decreased access to primary care. Multivariate regression analyses demonstrated Black race is a risk factor for worse COVID-19 outcome independent of comorbidities, poverty, access to health care, and other mitigating factors. Lower daily temperatures was also an independent risk factor in case load but not deaths. Conclusions: U.S. counties with a higher proportion of Black residents are associated with increased COVID-19 cases and deaths. However, the various suggested mechanisms, such as socioeconomic and healthcare predispositions, did not appear to drive the effect of race in our model. Counties with higher average daily temperatures are also associated with decreased COVID-19 cases but not deaths. Several theories are posited to explain these findings, including prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. Additional studies are needed to further understand these effects.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adam Y Li","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Theodore C Hannah","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"John Durbin","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Nickolas Dreher","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Fiona M McAuley","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Naoum Fares Marayati","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Zachary Spiera","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Ali","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alex Gometz","author_inst":"Concussion Management of New York"},{"author_name":"JT Kostman","author_inst":"ProtectedBy.AI"},{"author_name":"Tanvir F Choudhri","author_inst":"Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Florian Bompard","author_inst":"Radiology Department, Hopital Cochin - AP-HP.Centre Universite de Paris, 27 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Jacques, 75014 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Sophie Neveu","author_inst":"Radiology Department, Hopital Cochin - AP-HP.Centre Universite de Paris, 27 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Jacques, 75014 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Chahinez Hani","author_inst":"Radiology Department, Hopital Cochin - AP-HP.Centre Universite de Paris, 27 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Jacques, 75014 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Ines Saab","author_inst":"Radiology Department, Hopital Cochin - AP-HP.Centre Universite de Paris, 27 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Jacques, 75014 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Alienor Campredon","author_inst":"Radiology Department, Hopital Cochin - AP-HP.Centre Universite de Paris, 27 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Jacques, 75014 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Hasmik Koulakian","author_inst":"Radiology Department, Hopital Cochin - AP-HP.Centre Universite de Paris, 27 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Jacques, 75014 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Souhail Bennani","author_inst":"Radiology Department, Hopital Cochin - AP-HP.Centre Universite de Paris, 27 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Jacques, 75014 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Gael Freche","author_inst":"Radiology Department, Hopital Cochin - AP-HP.Centre Universite de Paris, 27 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Jacques, 75014 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Maxime Barat","author_inst":"Radiology Department, Hopital Cochin - AP-HP.Centre Universite de Paris, 27 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Jacques, 75014 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Aurelien Lombard","author_inst":"TheraPanacea, 27 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Jacques, 75014 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Laure Fournier","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, 85 boulevard Saint-Germain, 75006 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Hippolyte Monnier","author_inst":"Radiology Department, Hopital Europeen Georges Pompidou - AP-HP.Centre Universite de Paris, 20 Rue Universite Paris-Saclay, 75015 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Teodor Grand","author_inst":"Radiology Department, Hopital Europeen Georges Pompidou - AP-HP.Centre Universite de Paris, 20 Rue Universite Paris-Saclay, 75015 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Jules Gregory","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, 85 boulevard Saint-Germain, 75006 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Yann Nguyen","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Hopital Beaujon - AP-HP .Nord Universite de Paris, 100 Boulevard du General Leclerc, 92110 Clichy"},{"author_name":"Antoine Khalil","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, 85 boulevard Saint-Germain, 75006 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Elyas Mahdjoub","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, 85 boulevard Saint-Germain, 75006 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Pierre-Yves Brillet","author_inst":"Radiology Department, Hopital Avicenne - AP-HP.Hopitaux universitaires Paris Seine-Saint-Denis, 125 Rue de Stalingrad, 93000 Bobigny, France"},{"author_name":"Stephane Tran Ba","author_inst":"Radiology Department, Hopital Avicenne - AP-HP.Hopitaux universitaires Paris Seine-Saint-Denis, 125 Rue de Stalingrad, 93000 Bobigny, France"},{"author_name":"Valerie Bousson","author_inst":"Universite de Paris, 85 boulevard Saint-Germain, 75006 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Ahmed Mekki","author_inst":"Radiology Department, Hopital Ambroise Pare - AP-HP.Universite Paris Saclay, 9 Avenue Charles de Gaulle, 92100 Boulogne-Billancourt"},{"author_name":"Robert-Yves Carlier","author_inst":"Radiology Department, Hopital Ambroise Pare - AP-HP.Universite Paris Saclay, 9 Avenue Charles de Gaulle, 92100 Boulogne-Billancourt"},{"author_name":"Marie-Pierre Revel","author_inst":"Radiology Department, Hopital Cochin - AP-HP.Centre Universite de Paris, 27 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Jacques, 75014 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Nikos Paragios","author_inst":"TheraPanacea, 27 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Jacques, 75014 Paris, France"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"}]}
