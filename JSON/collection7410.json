The S protein engages ACE2 through its receptor-binding domain (RBD), an independently folded 197-amino acid fragment of the 1273-amino acid S-protein protomer. Antibodies to the RBD domain of SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-1), a closely related coronavirus which emerged in 2002-2003, have been shown to potently neutralize SARS-CoV-1 S-protein-mediated entry, and the presence of anti-RBD antibodies correlates with neutralization in SARS-CoV-2 convalescent sera. Here we show that immunization with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD elicits a robust neutralizing antibody response in rodents, comparable to 100 {micro}g\/ml of ACE2-Ig, a potent SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitor. Importantly, anti-sera from immunized animals did not mediate antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of S-protein-mediated entry under conditions in which Zika virus ADE was readily observed. These data suggest that an RBD-based vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 could be safe and effective.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brian D Quinlan","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Huihui Mou","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Lizhou Zhang","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Yan Gao","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Wenhui He","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Amrita Ojha","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Mark S Parcells","author_inst":"University of Delaware"},{"author_name":"Guangxiang Luo","author_inst":"University of Alabama"},{"author_name":"Wenhui Li","author_inst":"National Institute of Biological Sciences"},{"author_name":"Guocai Zhong","author_inst":"Scripps Research | SZBL Chemical Biology Institute, Shenzhen Bay Laboratory (SZBL)"},{"author_name":"Hyeryun Choe","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Michael Farzan","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.08.031807","rel_title":"Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 infections among 3 species of non-human primates","rel_date":"2020-04-12","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.08.031807","rel_abs":"COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, has recently been announced as a pandemic all over the world. Plenty of diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic knowledges have been enriched from clinical studies since December 2019. However, animal models, particularly non-human primate models, are urgently needed for critical questions that could not be answered in clinical patients, evaluations of anti-viral drugs and vaccines. In this study, two families of non-human primates, Old world monkeys (12 Macaca mulatta, 6 Macaca fascicularis) and New world monkeys (6 Callithrix jacchus), were experimentally inoculated with SARS-CoV-2. Clinical signs were recorded. Samples were collected for analysis of viral shedding, viremia and histopathological examination. Increased body temperature was observed in 100% (12\/12) M. mulatta, 33.3% (2\/6) M. fascicularis and none (0\/6) of C. jacchus post inoculation of SARS-CoV-2. All of M. mulatta and M. fascicularis showed chest radiographic abnormality. Viral genomes were detected in nasal swabs, throat swabs, anal swabs and blood from all 3 species of monkeys. Viral shedding from upper respiratory samples reached the peak between day 6 and day 8 post inoculation. From necropsied M. mulatta and M. fascicularis, the tissues showing virus positive were mainly lung, weasand, bronchus and spleen. No viral genome was seen in any of tissues from 2 necropsied C. jacchus. Severe gross lesions and histopathological changes were observed in lung, heart and stomach of SARS-CoV-2 infected animals. In summary, we have established a NHP model for COVID-19, which could be used to evaluate drugs and vaccines, and investigate viral pathogenesis. M. mulatta is the most susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, followed by M. fascicularis and C. jacchus.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryM. mulatta is the most susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared to

of people worldwide. There is an urgent call for developing effective drugs against the virus (SARS-CoV-2) causing this disease. The main protease of SARS-CoV-2, 3C-like protease (3CLpro), is highly conserved across coronaviruses and is essential for the maturation process of viral polyprotein. Scutellariae radix (Huangqin in Chinese), the root of Scutellaria baicalensis has been widely used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat viral infection related symptoms. The extracts of S. baicalensis have exhibited broad spectrum antiviral activities. We studied the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of S. baicalensis and its ingredient compounds. We found that the ethanol extract of S. baicalensis inhibits SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro activity in vitro and the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells with an EC50 of 0.74 g\/ml. Among the major components of S. baicalensis, baicalein strongly inhibits SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro activity with an IC50 of 0.39 M. We further identified four baicalein analogue compounds from other herbs that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro activity at microM concentration. Our study demonstrates that the extract of S. baicalensis has effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and baicalein and analogue compounds are strong SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hongbo Liu","author_inst":"College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Fei

samples from publicly available SARS-CoV-2 sequences from the sequence read archive repository. Up until March 27, 2020, we downloaded 53 illumina datasets, mostly from China, USA (Washington DC) and Australia (Victoria). Of 30 high quality datasets, 27 datasets (90%) contain at least a single founder mutation and most of the variants are missense (over 63%). Five-point mutations with clonal (founder) effect were found in USA sequencing samples. Sequencing samples from USA in GenBank present this signature with 50% allele frequencies among samples. Australian mutation signatures were more diverse than USA samples, but still, clonal events were found in those samples. Mutations in the helicase and orf1a coding regions from SARS-CoV-2 were predominant, among others, suggesting that these proteins are prone to evolve by natural selection. Finally, we firmly urge that primer sets for diagnosis be carefully designed, since rapidly occurring variants would affect the performance of the reverse transcribed quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) based viral testing.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carlos Farkas","author_inst":"Research Institute in Oncology and Hematology, CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba,

As SARS-CoV-2 spreads across the planet, speculations remain about the range of human cells that can be infected by SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we report the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from two COVID-19 patients in Toronto, Canada. We determined the genomic sequences of the two isolates and identified single nucleotide changes in representative populations of our virus stocks. More importantly, we tested a wide range of human immune cells for productive infection with SARS-CoV-2. Here we confirm that human primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are not permissive to SARS-CoV-2. As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread globally, it is essential to monitor small nucleotide polymorphisms in the virus and to continue to isolate circulating viruses to determine cell susceptibility and pathogenicity using in vitro and in vivo infection models.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arinjay Banerjee","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Jalees A.

Surface glycoprotein and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein are two important proteins of this virus facilitating its entry into host cell and genome replication. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a prospective tool of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway for the control of human viral infections by suppressing viral gene expression through hybridization and neutralization of target complementary mRNA. So, in this study, the power of RNA interference technology was harnessed to develop siRNA molecules against specific target genes namely, nucleocapsid phosphoprotein gene and surface glycoprotein gene. Conserved sequence from 139 SARS-CoV-2 strains from around the globe was collected to construct 78 siRNA that can inactivate nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and surface glycoprotein genes. Finally, based on GC content, free energy of folding, free energy of binding, melting temperature and efficacy prediction process 8 siRNA molecules were selected which are proposed to exerts the best action.

SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein is an attractive candidate for vaccine, antibodies and inhibitor development because of many roles it plays in attachment, fusion and entry into the host cell. In this study, we characterized the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein by immune-informatics techniques to put forward potential B and T cell epitopes, followed by the use of epitopes in construction of a multi-epitope peptide vaccine construct (MEPVC). The MEPVC revealed robust host immune system simulation with high production of immunoglobulins, cytokines and interleukins. Stable conformation of the MEPVC with a representative innate immune TLR3 receptor was observed involving strong hydrophobic and hydrophilic chemical interactions, along with enhanced contribution from salt-bridges towards inter-molecular stability. Molecular dynamics simulation in solution aided further in interpreting strong affinity of the MEPVC for TLR3. This stability is the attribute of several vital residues from both TLR3 and MEPVC as shown by radial distribution function (RDF) and a novel analytical tool axial frequency distribution (AFD). Comprehensive binding free energies estimation was provided at the end that concluded major domination by electrostatic and minor from van der Waals. Summing all, the designed MEPVC has tremendous potential of providing protective immunity against COVID-19 and thus has the potential to be considered in experimental studies.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Saba Ismail","author_inst":"Computational Biology Lab, National Center for Bioinformatics, Quaid-i-Azam University Islamabad, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Sajjad Ahmad","author_inst":"Computational Biology Lab, National Center for Bioinformatics, Quaid-i-Azam University Islamabad, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Syed Sikander Azam","author_inst":"Computational Biology Lab, National Center for Bioinformatics, Quaid-i-Azam University Islamabad, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Mirza Ashikul Beg","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Kawsar Sharif Siam","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Brac University, Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Ali Moni","author_inst":"The University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Devrim Gunyel","author_inst":"University of Luxembourg"},{"author_name":"Marek Ostaszewski","author_inst":"University of Luxembourg"},{"author_name":"Maria Pena-Chilet","author_inst":"Fundacion Progreso y Salud"},{"author_name":"Joaquin Dopazo","author_inst":"Fundacion Progreso y Salud"},{"author_name":"Matthew S.

The WHO, ECDC and CDC have issued conflicting guidelines on the use of respiratory filters (N95) by HCWs. Methods We searched PubMed, Embase and The Cochrane Library from the inception to March 21, 2020 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing N95 respirators versus surgical masks for prevention of COVID-19 or any other respiratory infection among HCWs. The grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) was used to evaluate the quality of evidence. Findings Four RCTs involving 8736 HCWs were included. We did not find any trial specifically on prevention of COVID-19. However, wearing N95 respirators can prevent 73 more (95% CI 46-91) clinical respiratory infections per 1000 HCWs compared to surgical masks (2 RCTs; 2594 patients; low quality of evidence). A protective effect of N95 respirators in laboratory-confirmed bacterial colonization (RR= 0.41; 95%CI 0.28-0.61) was also found. A trend in favour of N95 respirators was observed in preventing laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infections, laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, and influenza like illness. Interpretation We found no direct high quality evidence on whether N95 respirators are better than surgical masks for HCWs protection from SARS-CoV-2. However, low quality evidence suggests that N95 respirators protect HCWs from clinical respiratory infections. This finding should be contemplated to decide the best strategy to support the resilience of healthcare systems facing the potentially catastrophic SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Primiano Iannone","author_inst":"Centro Eccellenza Clinica, Qualita' e Sicurezza delle Cure, Istituto Superiore di Sanita', Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Greta Castellini","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Galeazzi, Unit of Clinical Epidemiology, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Daniela Coclite","author_inst":"Centro Eccellenza Clinica, Qualita' e Sicurezza delle Cure, Istituto Superiore di Sanita', Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Antonello Napoletano","author_inst":"Centro Eccellenza Clinica, Qualita' e Sicurezza delle Cure, Istituto Superiore di Sanita', Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alice Fauci","author_inst":"Centro Eccellenza Clinica, Qualita' e Sicurezza delle Cure, Istituto Superiore di Sanita', Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Laura Iacorossi","author_inst":"Centro Eccellenza Clinica, Qualita' e Sicurezza delle Cure, Istituto Superiore di Sanita', Rome, Italy."},{"author_name":"Daniela D'Angelo","author_inst":"Centro Eccellenza Clinica, Qualita' e Sicurezza delle Cure, Istituto Superiore di Sanita', Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Cristina Renzi","author_inst":"University College London-UCL, Institute of Epidemiology & Health Care, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe La Torre","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Claudio Mastroianni","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Silvia Gianola","author_inst":"IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Galeazzi, Unit of Clinical Epidemiology, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Allison J McGeer","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Mario  A Ostrowski","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Robert A.

One area of active inquiry is understanding the mode(s) of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. While respiratory droplets are a known mechanism of transmission, other mechanisms are possible. Of particular importance to global health is the possibility of vertical transmission from infected mothers to infants through breastfeeding or consumption of human milk. However, there is limited published literature related to vertical transmission of any human coronavirus (including SARS-CoV-2) via human milk and\/or breastfeeding. There is a single study providing some evidence of vertical transmission of human coronavirus 229E, a single study evaluating presence of SARS-CoV in human milk (it was negative), and no published data on MERS-CoV and human milk. There are 9 case studies of human milk tested for SARS-CoV-2; none detected the virus. Importantly, none of the published studies on coronaviruses and human milk report validation of their analytical methods for use in human milk.

A range of intersecting biological, demographic, and socioeconomic factors are likely to determine an individual's susceptibility to COVID-19. These factors vary significantly across counties in the United States, and often reflect the structural inequities in our society. Recognizing this vast inter-county variation in risks will be critical to mounting an adequate response strategy. Using publicly available county-specific data we identified key biological, demographic, and socioeconomic factors influencing susceptibility to COVID-19, guided by international experiences and consideration of epidemiological parameters of importance. We created bivariate county-level maps to summarize examples of key relationships across these categories, grouping age and poverty; comorbidities and lack of health insurance; proximity, density and bed capacity; and race and ethnicity, and premature death. We have also made available an interactive online tool that allows public health officials to query risk factors most relevant to their local context. Our data demonstrate significant inter-county variation in key epidemiological risk factors, with a clustering of counties in certain states, which will result in an increased demand on their public health system. While the East and West coast cities are particularly vulnerable owing to their densities (and travel routes), a large number of counties in the Southeastern states have a high proportion of at-risk populations, with high levels of poverty, comorbidities, and premature death at baseline, and low levels of health insurance coverage. The list of variables we have examined is by no means comprehensive, and several of them are interrelated and magnify underlying vulnerabilities. The online tool allows readers to explore additional combinations of risk factors, set categorical thresholds for each covariate, and filter counties above different population thresholds. COVID-19 responses and decision making in the United States remain decentralized. Both the federal and state governments will benefit from recognizing high intra-state, inter-county variation in population risks and response capacity. Many of the factors that are likely to exacerbate the burden of COVID-19 and the demand on healthcare systems are the compounded result of long-standing structural inequalities in US society. Strategies to protect those in the most vulnerable counties will require urgent measures to better support communities' attempts at social distancing and to accelerate cooperation across jurisdictions to supply personnel and equipment to counties that will experience high demand.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Taylor Chin","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

Recently, the demand for laboratory reagents has greatly increased; in particular, there is a worldwide shortage of RNA extraction kits. Here, we describe a fast, simple and inexpensive method for the detection of SARS CoV-2 RNA, which includes a pretreatment with Proteinase K and a heating-cooling cycle before the amplification. This method bypasses the RNA extraction step; it leads to a higher amount of available viral RNA compared to the automated extraction methods, and generates the same profile in the subsequent amplification phase.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stefania Marzinotto","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, ASU FC, Udine, Italy"},{"author_name":"Catia Mio","author_inst":"Department of Medicine (DAME), University of Udine, Udine, Italy"},{"author_name":"Adriana Cifu'","author_inst":"Department of Medicine (DAME), University of Udine, Udine, Italy"},{"author_name":"Roberto Verardo","author_inst":"CIB-Consorzio Interuniversitario Biotecnologie (Interuniversity Consortium for Biotechnologies), Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Corrado Pipan","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, ASU FC, Udine, Italy"},{"author_name":"Claudio Schneider","author_inst":"Department of Medicine (DAME), University of Udine, Udine, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesco Curcio","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, ASU FC, Udine, Italy"},{"author_name":"Mathew V.

In our in vitro experiments, which were severely curtailed by prevailing circumstances, we used water as a substitute on the blood side. The water was saturated rapidly indicating that the system was flow limited rather than diffusion limited for oxygen transfer. Using these findings, we estimated the expected performance with blood and the results suggest that two dialysis units operating in parallel with a pure oxygen gas supply running counter-current to the blood flow, could supply up to 40% of the total required oxygen demand rate in an adult patient. While not studied, carbon dioxide elimination is likely to be feasible as well. It is thus possible that hollow fiber dialysis units operating with suitable roller pumps in a veno-venous access configuration, could serve as a cost-effective and readily available alternative or adjunct for respiratory support in the face of severe resource constraints. Verification and extension of our study is needed by well resourced laboratories who are still able to function during this unprecedented period of restrictions. If, after further studies and clinical considerations, this approach appears feasible, then consideration may be given to clinical deployment of this tech- nique in desperate situations where no alternative exists to preserve life.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David M Rubin","author_inst":"Biomedical Engineering Research Group, School of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg"},{"author_name":"Neil T Stacey","author_inst":"School of Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg"},{"author_name":"Tonderayi Matambo","author_inst":"Institute for the Development of Energy for African Sustainability, University of South Africa"},{"author_name":"Claudia Do Vale","author_inst":"Morningside Clinic, Johannesburg and Department of Medicine, Division of Nephrology, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg"},{"author_name":"Martin Sussman","author_inst":"Cardiothoracic Surgery, Milpark Hospital, Johannesburg"},{"author_name":"Tracy Snyman","author_inst":"National Health Laboratory Service and Department of Chemical Pathology, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg"},{"author_name":"Mervyn Mer","author_inst":"Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital and Department of Medicine, Divisions of Critical Care and Pulmonology, University of the Witwatersrand, Johanne"},{"author_name":"Diane Hildebrandt","author_inst":"Institute for the Development of Energy for African Sustainability, University of South Africa"},{"author_name":"Courtney L Meehan","author_inst":"Washington State University"},{"author_name":"Mark A McGuire","author_inst":"University of Idaho"},{"author_name":"Michelle K McGuire","author_inst":"University of Idaho"},{"author_name":"Allison J McGeer","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Mario  A Ostrowski","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Robert A.

However, on March 26th the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST), along with other leading medical organizations, released a joint statement warning clinicians that attempting this technique could lead to poor outcomes and high mortality. Nevertheless, several hospitals around the United States and abroad are turning to this technique out of desperation (e.g. New York), but little data exists to guide their approach. The overall objective of this study is to utilize a computational model of mechanically ventilated lungs to assess how patient-specific lung mechanics and ventilator settings impact lung tidal volume (Vt). Methods: We developed a single compartment computational model of four patients connected to a shared ventilator and validated it against a similar experimental study. We used this model to evaluate how patient-specific lung compliance (C) and resistance (R) would impact Vt under 5 ventilator settings of pre-set PIP, PEEP, and I:E ratio (suggested by Farkas, J.D. MD as an approach by hospitals to manage multiple patients on a single ventilator). Results: Our computational model predicts Vt within 10% of experimental measurements. Using this model to perform a parametric study, we provide proof-of-concept for an algorithm to better match patients in different hypothetical scenarios of a single ventilator shared by more than one patient. Conclusions: Assigning patients to pre-set ventilators based on their lung mechanics could be used to overcome some of the legitimate concerns of placing multiple patients on a single ventilator. We emphasize that our results are currently based on a computational model that has not been validated against any pre-clinical\/clinical data. Therefore, clinicians considering this approach should not look to our study as an exact estimate of predicted patient tidal volumes.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vitaly Oleg Kheyfets","author_inst":"University of Colorado Denver|Anschutz Medical Campus - Department of Bioengineering; School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Steven Lammers","author_inst":"University of Colorado Denver|Anschutz Medical Campus - Department of Bioengineering; School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Wagner","author_inst":"University of Colorado Denver|Anschutz Medical Campus - Department of Bioengineering; School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Karsten Bartels","author_inst":"University of Colorado School of Medicine, Anesthesiology, Psychiatry, Medicine, and Surgery"},{"author_name":"Bradford Smith","author_inst":"Assistant Research Professor of Bioengineering and Pediatric Cardiology"},{"author_name":"Tracy Snyman","author_inst":"National Health Laboratory Service and Department of Chemical Pathology, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg"},{"author_name":"Mervyn Mer","author_inst":"Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital and Department of Medicine, Divisions of Critical Care and Pulmonology, University of the Witwatersrand, Johanne"},{"author_name":"Diane Hildebrandt","author_inst":"Institute for the Development of Energy for African Sustainability, University of South Africa"},{"author_name":"Courtney L Meehan","author_inst":"Washington State University"},{"author_name":"Mark A McGuire","author_inst":"University of Idaho"},{"author_name":"Michelle K McGuire","author_inst":"University of Idaho"},{"author_name":"Allison J McGeer","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Mario  A Ostrowski","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Robert A.

We attempted to deduce a formula in order to model the number of the ICU patients in France from the official data and patient turnover in the ICU. METHODS: The Covid19 ICU patient turnover was calculated using a recurrence relation from the internal data provided by Hospices Civils de Lyon. The number of new Covid19 cases detected daily was modelized to fit with the last known data in France and extrapolated for the coming days using two scenarios following the existing data in China (best scenario) and Italy (worst scenario). The number of daily admissions in ICU was calculated as the sum of 13.7% of the new Covid19 cases detected on a given day and 7.8% of the average of the total new Covid-19 cases recorded in the last week. Approximately 39.7% of patients admitted to the ICU were non-intubated with an average ICU length of stay of 4 days. Conversely, 60.3% of patients were intubated and for those who died among them (14.44%) the ICU length of stay was of 4 days for 78.3% of them and of 15 days for 21.7% of them. For the intubated patients that were discharged alive, the ICU length of stay was of 6 days for 44.4% of them and of 20 days for 55.6% of them. RESULTS: We predict a peak of between 7072 and 8043 patients for the overall French territory. CONCUSION: Despite a simplified mathematical model, the strength of our study is a narrow possible range of predicted total number of ICU patients.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrei CIVIDJIAN","author_inst":"University Claude Bernard Lyon I"},{"author_name":"Florent Wallet","author_inst":"Hospices Civils de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Celine Guichon","author_inst":"Hospices Civils de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Olivier Martin","author_inst":"Hospices Civils de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Sandrine Couray-Targe","author_inst":"Hospices Civils de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Rimmele Thomas","author_inst":"Hospices Civils de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Pierre-Francois Wey","author_inst":"Service de Sante des Armees"},{"author_name":"Diane Hildebrandt","author_inst":"Institute for the Development of Energy for African Sustainability, University of South Africa"},{"author_name":"Courtney L Meehan","author_inst":"Washington State University"},{"author_name":"Mark A McGuire","author_inst":"University of Idaho"},{"author_name":"Michelle K McGuire","author_inst":"University of Idaho"},{"author_name":"Allison J McGeer","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Mario  A Ostrowski","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Robert A.

Methods: This observational study included data from all patients with clinically confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to the Hankou Hospital, Wuhan, China between January 5 and March 8, 2020. Data were extracted from clinical and laboratory records. Follow-up was cutoff on March 8, 2020. Results: A total of 274 patients, 75 with hypertension and 199 without hypertension, were included in the analysis. Patients with hypertension were older and were more likely to have pre-existing comorbidities, including chronic renal insufficiency, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular disease than patients without hypertension. Moreover, patients with hypertension tended to have higher positive COVID-19 PCR detection rates. Patients with hypertension who had previously taken ACEI\/ARB drugs for antihypertensive treatment have an increased tendency to develop severe pneumonia after infection with SARS-COV-2 (P = 0.064). Conclusions: COVID-19 patients with hypertension were significantly older and were more likely to have underlying comorbidities, including chronic renal insufficiency, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular disease.

As a designated hospital, Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital has received over 700 COVID-19 patients. With the COVID-19 becoming a pandemic all over the world, we aim to share our epidemiological and clinical findings with the global community. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, we studied 340 confirmed COVID-19 patients from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, including 310 discharged cases and 30 death cases. We analyzed their demographic, epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data and implemented our findings into an interactive, free access web application. Findings Baseline T lymphocyte Subsets differed significantly between the discharged cases and the death cases in two-sample t-tests: Total T cells (p < 2.2e-16), Helper T cells (p < 2.2e-16), Suppressor T cells (p = 1.8-14), and TH\/TS (Helper\/Suppressor ratio, p = 0.0066). Multivariate logistic regression model with death or discharge as the outcome resulted in the following significant predictors: age (OR 1.05, p 0.04), underlying disease status (OR 3.42, p 0.02), Helper T cells on the log scale (OR 0.22, p 0.00), and TH\/TS on the log scale (OR 4.80, p 0.00). The McFadden pseudo R-squared for the logistic regression model is 0.35, suggesting the model has a fair predictive power. Interpretation While age and underlying diseases are known risk factors for poor prognosis, patients with a less damaged immune system at the time of hospitalization had higher chance of recovery. Close monitoring of the T lymphocyte subsets might provide valuable information of the patients condition change during the treatment process. Our web visualization application can be used as a supplementary tool for the evaluation.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qibin Liu","author_inst":"Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xuemin Fang","author_inst":"Graduate School of Health Innovation, Kanagawa University of Human Services"},{"author_name":"Shinichi Tokuno","author_inst":"Graduate School of Health Innovation, Kanagawa University of Human Services"},{"author_name":"Ungil Chung","author_inst":"Graduate School of Health Innovation, Kanagawa University of Human Services"},{"author_name":"Xianxiang Chen","author_inst":"Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiyong Dai","author_inst":"Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyu Liu","author_inst":"Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital"},{"author_name":"Feng Xu","author_inst":"Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bing Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital"},{"author_name":"Peng Peng","author_inst":"Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Wuhan Institute for Tuberculosis Control"},{"author_name":"Michelle K McGuire","author_inst":"University of Idaho"},{"author_name":"Allison J McGeer","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Mario  A Ostrowski","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Robert A.

The COVID-19 outbreak results from infection with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) and was declared a pandemic on March 11th, 2020. We queried whether the BCG vaccine offers protection against CoV-2 infection. We observed that countries with a current universal BCG vaccination policy have a significantly lower COVID-19 incidence than countries which never had a universal BCG policy or had one in the past. However, population density, median age, TB incidence, urban population, and, most significantly, CoV-2 testing rate, were also connected with BCG policy and could potentially confound the analysis. By limiting the analysis to countries with high CoV-2 testing rates, defined as greater than 2,500 tests per million inhabitants, these parameters were no longer statistically associated with BCG policy. When analyzing only countries with high testing rates, there was no longer a significant association between the number of COVID-19 cases per million inhabitants and the BCG vaccination policy. Although preliminary, our analyses indicate that the BCG vaccination may not offer protection against CoV-2 infection. While reporting biases may confound our observations, our findings support exercising caution in determining potential correlation between BCG vaccination and COVID-19 incidence, in part due significantly lower rates of CoV-2 testing per million inhabitants in countries with current universal BCG vaccination policy.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Janine Hensel","author_inst":"MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Daniel J McGrail","author_inst":"MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Kathleen M McAndrews","author_inst":"MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Dara Dowlatshahi","author_inst":"MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Valerie S LeBleu","author_inst":"MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Raghu Kalluri","author_inst":"MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyu Liu","author_inst":"Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital"},{"author_name":"Feng Xu","author_inst":"Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bing Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital"},{"author_name":"Peng Peng","author_inst":"Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Wuhan Institute for Tuberculosis Control"},{"author_name":"Michelle K McGuire","author_inst":"University of Idaho"},{"author_name":"Allison J McGeer","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Mario  A Ostrowski","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Robert A.

In readiness for this challenge, Australia has drawn on clinical pathway models developed over many years in preparation for influenza pandemics. These models have been used to estimate health care requirements for COVID-19 patients, in the context of broader public health measures. Methods An age and risk stratified transmission model of COVID-19 infection was used to simulate an unmitigated epidemic with parameter ranges reflecting uncertainty in current estimates of transmissibility and severity. Overlaid public health measures included case isolation and quarantine of contacts, and broadly applied social distancing. Clinical presentations and patient flows through the Australian health care system were simulated, including expansion of available intensive care capacity and alternative clinical assessment pathways. Findings An unmitigated COVID-19 epidemic would dramatically exceed the capacity of the Australian health system, over a prolonged period. Case isolation and contact quarantine alone will be insufficient to constrain case presentations within a feasible level of expansion of health sector capacity. Overlaid social restrictions will need to be applied at some level over the course of the epidemic to ensure that systems do not become overwhelmed, and that essential health sector functions, including care of COVID-19 patients, can be maintained. Attention to the full pathway of clinical care is needed to ensure access to critical care. Interpretation Reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality will rely on a combination of measures to strengthen and extend public health and clinical capacity, along with reduction of overall infection transmission in the community. Ongoing attention to maintaining and strengthening the capacity of health care systems and workers to manage cases is needed.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robert Moss","author_inst":"Modelling and Simulation Unit, Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"James Wood","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Community Medicine, UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Damien Brown","author_inst":"Victorian Infectious Diseases Laboratory Epidemiology Unit at The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity; The University of Melbourne and Royal Melb"},{"author_name":"Freya Shearer","author_inst":"Modelling and Simulation Unit, Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Andrew J Black","author_inst":"School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Adelaide"},{"author_name":"Allen Cheng","author_inst":"Infection Prevention and Healthcare Epidemiology Unit, Alfred Health; School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University"},{"author_name":"James M McCaw","author_inst":"School of Mathematics and Statistics, The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Jodie McVernon","author_inst":"The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity"},{"author_name":"Bing Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital"},{"author_name":"Peng Peng","author_inst":"Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Wuhan Institute for Tuberculosis Control"},{"author_name":"Michelle K McGuire","author_inst":"University of Idaho"},{"author_name":"Allison J McGeer","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Mario  A Ostrowski","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Robert A.

In an unprecedented collective effort, massive amounts of data are now being collected worldwide to estimate the immediate and long-term impact of this pandemic on the health system and the global economy. However, the precise timeline of the disease, its transmissibility, and the effect of mitigation strategies remain incompletely understood. Here we integrate a global network model with a local epidemic SEIR model to quantify the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 in China and the United States. For the outbreak in China, in n=30 provinces, we found a latent period of 2.56+\/-0.72 days, a contact period of 1.47+\/-0.32 days, and an infectious period of 17.82+\/-2.95 days. We assume that the latent and infectious periods are disease-specific and the contact period is behavior-specific and can vary between different communities, states, or countries. For the early stages of the outbreak in the United States, in n=50 states, we adopted the latent and infectious periods from China, and found a contact period of 3.38+\/-0.69 days. Our network model predicts that - without the massive political mitigation strategies that are in place today - the United states would have faced a basic reproduction number of 5.3+\/-0.95 and a nationwide peak of the outbreak on May 10, 2020 with 3 million infections. Our results demonstrate how mathematical modeling can help estimate outbreak dynamics and provide decision guidelines for successful outbreak control. We anticipate that our model will become a valuable tool to estimate the potential of vaccination and quantify the effect of relaxing political measures including total lock down, shelter in place, and travel restrictions for low-risk subgroups of the population or for the population as a whole.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mathias Peirlinck","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Francisco Sahli Costabal","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile"},{"author_name":"Kevin Linka","author_inst":"Hamburg University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Ellen Kuhl","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Andrew J Black","author_inst":"School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Adelaide"},{"author_name":"Allen Cheng","author_inst":"Infection Prevention and Healthcare Epidemiology Unit, Alfred Health; School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University"},{"author_name":"James M McCaw","author_inst":"School of Mathematics and Statistics, The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Jodie McVernon","author_inst":"The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity"},{"author_name":"Bing Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital"},{"author_name":"Peng Peng","author_inst":"Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Wuhan Institute for Tuberculosis Control"},{"author_name":"Michelle K McGuire","author_inst":"University of Idaho"},{"author_name":"Allison J McGeer","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Mario  A Ostrowski","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Robert A.

We propose a pragmatic model to forecast the COVID-19 epidemic by applying a mixture normal distribution to open accessible WHO data. We specified a simple joint model on data from 20 countries with number of confirmed COVID-19 infections and number of COVID-19 deaths. We found that the duration of an epidemic wave (99% of total size) was usually between 45-48 days. Using data up to April 6, 2020, we found in six of 20 counties two waves, spaced between 21 and 47 days. In China and Korea the first wave was bigger, and in Denmark, Iran, Japan, and Sweden the second wave was stronger. Lag time between time trends in confirmed infections and time trends in deaths varied between 3.1 and 9.5 days. We obtained a good fit between observed and modelled data in almost all countries. In about halve of the countries the highest peak of the COVID-19 epidemic had been reached until April 6, 2020. Among the 20 countries, it is predicted that the USA will reach the highest numbers of confirmed infections (653 683-802 205) and number of deaths (36 591-53 286). Taken together, for many countries reasonable and up-to-date forecasting seems to be feasible. This method therefore bears a high potential for assisting decision makers to adjust the measures aiming at reducing the spread of the virus appropriately.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carlos Nordt","author_inst":"Psychiatric Hospital, University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Marcus Herdener","author_inst":"Psychiatric Hospital, University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Kevin Linka","author_inst":"Hamburg University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Ellen Kuhl","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Andrew J Black","author_inst":"School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Adelaide"},{"author_name":"Allen Cheng","author_inst":"Infection Prevention and Healthcare Epidemiology Unit, Alfred Health; School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University"},{"author_name":"James M McCaw","author_inst":"School of Mathematics and Statistics, The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Jodie McVernon","author_inst":"The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity"},{"author_name":"Bing Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital"},{"author_name":"Peng Peng","author_inst":"Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Wuhan Institute for Tuberculosis Control"},{"author_name":"Michelle K McGuire","author_inst":"University of Idaho"},{"author_name":"Allison J McGeer","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Mario  A Ostrowski","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Robert A.

Currently, research groups around the globe are trying to figure out such transmission dynamics using different scientific and technological approaches. One of those is by using mathematical and computational models like the compartmental model or the agent-based models. In this paper, a general agent-based model, called INFEKTA, that combines the transmission dynamics of an infectious disease with agents (individuals) that can move on a complex network of accessible places defined over a Euclidean space representing a real town or city is proposed. The applicability of INFEKTA is shown by modeling the transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 in Bogota city, the capital of Colombia.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jonatan Gomez","author_inst":"Universidad Nacional de Colombia"},{"author_name":"Jeisson Prieto","author_inst":"Universidad Nacional de Colombia"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Leon","author_inst":"Universidad Nacional de Colombia"},{"author_name":"Arles Rodriguez","author_inst":"Fundacion Universitaria Konrad Lorenz"},{"author_name":"Andrew J Black","author_inst":"School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Adelaide"},{"author_name":"Allen Cheng","author_inst":"Infection Prevention and Healthcare Epidemiology Unit, Alfred Health; School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University"},{"author_name":"James M McCaw","author_inst":"School of Mathematics and Statistics, The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Jodie McVernon","author_inst":"The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity"},{"author_name":"Bing Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital"},{"author_name":"Peng Peng","author_inst":"Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Wuhan Institute for Tuberculosis Control"},{"author_name":"Michelle K McGuire","author_inst":"University of Idaho"},{"author_name":"Allison J McGeer","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Mario  A Ostrowski","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Robert A.

The impact of the disease, while it has been relatively low in the Sub Saharan Africa (SSA) so far, is feared to be potentially devastating given the less developed and fragmented health care system in the continent. In addition, most emergency measures practiced may not be effective due to their limited affordability as well as the communal way people in SSA live in relative isolation in clusters of large as well as smaller population centers. To address the acute need for estimates of the potential impacts of the disease once it sweeps through the region, we developed a process-based model with key parameters obtained from recent studies, taking local context into consideration. We further used the model to estimate the number of infections within a year of sustained local transmissions under a total of 216 scenarios that cover different sizes of population, urban status, effectiveness and coverage of social distancing, contact tracing and usage of cloth facemask. We showed that when implemented early, 50% coverage of contact tracing and facemask, with 33% effective social distancing policies can \"flattens the curve\" of local epidemics and even bending it enough to result in fewer cumulative infections, bringing the pandemic to a manageable level for all population sizes we assessed. In SSA countries with limited healthcare workforce, hospital resources and ICU care, a robust system of social distancing, contact tracing and facemask use could yield in outcomes that prevent several millions of infections and thousands of deaths across the continent.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amir S Siraj","author_inst":"University Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Alemayehu Worku","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, Addis Continental Institute of Public Health, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Kiros Berhane","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Yemane Berhane","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Addis Continental Institute of Public Health, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Dawd S Siraj","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Wisconsin"},{"author_name":"Allen Cheng","author_inst":"Infection Prevention and Healthcare Epidemiology Unit, Alfred Health; School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University"},{"author_name":"James M McCaw","author_inst":"School of Mathematics and Statistics, The University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Jodie McVernon","author_inst":"The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity"},{"author_name":"Bing Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital"},{"author_name":"Peng Peng","author_inst":"Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Wuhan Institute for Tuberculosis Control"},{"author_name":"Michelle K McGuire","author_inst":"University of Idaho"},{"author_name":"Allison J McGeer","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Mario  A Ostrowski","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Robert A.

This global situation may have a negative impact on the psychological well-being of individuals which in turn impacts individuals performance. Methods: A cross-sectional study using an online survey was conducted in Jordan between 22nd and 28th of March 2020 to explore the mental health status (depression and anxiety) of the general population, healthcare professionals, and university students during the COVID-19 outbreak. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) were used to assess depression and anxiety among the study participants. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of depression and anxiety. Results: The prevalence of depression and anxiety among the entire study participants was 23.8% and 13.1%, respectively. Anxiety was most prevalent across university students 21.5%, followed by healthcare professionals 11.3%, and general population 8.8%. Females among healthcare professionals and university students, divorced healthcare professionals, pulmonologists, and university students with history of chronic disease were at higher risk of developing depression. Females, divorced participants among the general population, and university students with history of chronic disease and those with high income ([&ge;]1500 JD) were at higher risk of developing anxiety. Conclusions: During outbreaks, individuals are put under extreme stressful condition resulting in higher risk of developing anxiety and depression particularly for students and healthcare professionals. Policymakers and mental healthcare providers are advised to provide further mental support to these vulnerable groups during this pandemic.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abdallah Y Naser","author_inst":"Isra University"},{"author_name":"Eman Zmaily Dahmash","author_inst":"Isra University"},{"author_name":"Rabaa Al-Rousan","author_inst":"Isra University"},{"author_name":"Hassan Alwafi","author_inst":"Umm Alqura University"},{"author_name":"Hamzeh Mohammad Alrawashdeh","author_inst":"Ibn AL Haytham Hospital"},{"author_name":"Imene Ghoul","author_inst":"Ibn AL Haytham Hospital"},{"author_name":"Anwar Abidine","author_inst":"King Abdulaziz Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mohammed A.
