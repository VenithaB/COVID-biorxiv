Shortcuts through metadata analysis (e.g., keywords) assume that studies are properly tagged. However, machine learning approaches can rapidly survey the actual text of coronavirus abstracts to identify research overlap between COVID-19 and other coronavirus diseases, research hotspots, and areas warranting exploration. We propose a fast, scalable, and reusable framework to parse novel disease literature. When applied to the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19), dimensionality reduction suggested that COVID-19 studies to date are primarily clinical-, modeling- or field-based, in contrast to the vast quantity of laboratory-driven research for other (non-COVID-19) coronavirus diseases. Topic modeling also indicated that COVID-19 publications have thus far focused primarily on public health, outbreak reporting, clinical care, and testing for coronaviruses, as opposed to the more limited number focused on basic microbiology, including pathogenesis and transmission.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anhvinh L Doanvo","author_inst":"Washington, D.C."},{"author_name":"Xiaolu Qian","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Divya Ramjee","author_inst":"Department of Justice, Law & Criminology, American University"},{"author_name":"Helen Piontkivska","author_inst":"Department of Biological Sciences, Kent State University"},{"author_name":"Angel N Desai","author_inst":"International Society for Infectious Diseases"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"scientific communication and education"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.11.147199","rel_title":"Specific viral RNA drives the SARS CoV-2 nucleocapsid to phase separate","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.11.147199","rel_abs":"A mechanistic understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 viral replication cycle is essential to develop new therapies for the COVID-19 global health crisis. In this study, we show that the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) with the viral genome, and propose a model of viral packaging through LLPS. N-protein condenses with specific RNA sequences in the first 1000 nts (5-End) under physiological conditions and is enhanced at human upper airway temperatures. N-protein condensates exclude non-packaged RNA sequences. We comprehensively map sites bound by N-protein in the 5-End and find preferences for single-stranded RNA flanked by stable structured elements. Liquid-like N-protein condensates form in mammalian cells in a concentration-dependent manner and can be altered by small molecules. Condensation of N-protein is sequence and structure specific, sensitive to human body temperature, and manipulatable with small molecules thus presenting screenable processes for identifying antiviral compounds effective against SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christiane Iserman","author_inst":"UNC Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Christine Anne Roden","author_inst":"UNC Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Mark Boerneke","author_inst":"UNC Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Rachel Sealfon","author_inst":"Flatiron Institute, Simons Foundation, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Grace McLaughlin","author_inst":"UNC Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Irwin Jungreis","author_inst":"Broad Institute, MIT, Cambridge, MA,"},{"author_name":"Christopher Y Park","author_inst":"Flatiron Institute, Simons Foundation"},{"author_name":"Avinash Boppana","author_inst":"Princeton Department of Computer Science"},{"author_name":"Ethan Fritch","author_inst":"UNC Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Yixuan Hou","author_inst":"UNC Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Chandra Theesfeld","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Olga Troyanskaya","author_inst":"Princeton University, Flatiron Institute, Simons Foundation"},{"author_name":"Ralph S.

Severe complications are observed only in a small proportion of infected patients but the cellular mechanisms underlying this progression are still unknown. Comprehensive flow cytometry of whole blood samples from 54 COVID-19 patients revealed a dramatic increase in the number of immature neutrophils. This increase strongly correlated with disease severity and was associated with elevated IL-6 and IP-10 levels, two key players in the cytokine storm. The most pronounced decrease in cell counts was observed for CD8 T-cells and VD2 {gamma}{delta} T-cells, which both exhibited increased differentiation and activation. ROC analysis revealed that the count ratio of immature neutrophils to CD8 or VD2 T-cells predicts pneumonia onset (0.9071) as well as hypoxia onset (0.8908) with high sensitivity and specificity. It would thus be a useful prognostic marker for preventive patient management and improved healthcare resource management.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guillaume Carissimo","author_inst":"Singapore Immunology Network"},{"author_name":"Weili Xu","author_inst":"SIgN"},{"author_name":"Immanuel Kwok","author_inst":"SIgN"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Yazid Abdad","author_inst":"NCID"},{"author_name":"Yi Hao Chan","author_inst":"SIgN"},{"author_name":"Siew Wai Fong","author_inst":"SIgN"},{"author_name":"Kia Joo Puan","author_inst":"SIgN"},{"author_name":"Cheryl Yi Pin Lee","author_inst":"Singapore Immunology Network (A*STAR)"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Kim-Wah Yeo","author_inst":"SIgN"},{"author_name":"Siti Naqiah Amrun","author_inst":"Singapore Immunology Network"},{"author_name":"Rhonda Sin-Ling Chee","author_inst":"SIgN"},{"author_name":"Wilson How","author_inst":"SIgN"},{"author_name":"Stephrene Chan","author_inst":"TTSH"},{"author_name":"Eugene Bingwen Fan","author_inst":"TTSH"},{"author_name":"Anand Andiappan","author_inst":"SIgN"},{"author_name":"Bernett Lee","author_inst":"SIgN"},{"author_name":"Olaf Rotzschke","author_inst":"Singapore Immunology Network"},{"author_name":"Barnaby Edward Young","author_inst":"NCID"},{"author_name":"Yee-Sin Leo","author_inst":"NCID"},{"author_name":"David C Lye","author_inst":"NCID"},{"author_name":"Laurent Renia","author_inst":"SIgN"},{"author_name":"Lai Guan Ng","author_inst":"SIgN"},{"author_name":"Anis Larbi","author_inst":"SIgN"},{"author_name":"Lisa FP Ng","author_inst":"SIgN"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.12.148692","rel_title":"Structural basis for potent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 and role of antibody affinity maturation","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.12.148692","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.

We therefore compared the functional properties of the S proteins with aspartic acid (SD614) and glycine (SG614) at residue 614. We observed that retroviruses pseudotyped with SG614 infected ACE2-expressing cells markedly more efficiently than those with SD614. This greater infectivity was correlated with less S1 shedding and greater incorporation of the S protein into the pseudovirion. Similar results were obtained using the virus-like particles produced with SARS-CoV-2 M, N, E, and S proteins. However, SG614 did not bind ACE2 more efficiently than SD614, and the pseudoviruses containing these S proteins were neutralized with comparable efficiencies by convalescent plasma. These results show SG614 is more stable than SD614, consistent with epidemiological data suggesting that viruses with SG614 transmit more efficiently.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lizhou Zhang","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Cody B Jackson","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Huihui Mou","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Amrita Ojha","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Erumbi S Rangarajan","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Tina Izard","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Michael Farzan","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Hyeryunc Choe","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Kim-Wah Yeo","author_inst":"SIgN"},{"author_name":"Siti Naqiah Amrun","author_inst":"Singapore Immunology Network"},{"author_name":"Rhonda Sin-Ling Chee","author_inst":"SIgN"},{"author_name":"Wilson How","author_inst":"SIgN"},{"author_name":"Stephrene Chan","author_inst":"TTSH"},{"author_name":"Eugene Bingwen Fan","author_inst":"TTSH"},{"author_name":"Anand Andiappan","author_inst":"SIgN"},{"author_name":"Bernett Lee","author_inst":"SIgN"},{"author_name":"Olaf Rotzschke","author_inst":"Singapore Immunology Network"},{"author_name":"Barnaby Edward Young","author_inst":"NCID"},{"author_name":"Yee-Sin Leo","author_inst":"NCID"},{"author_name":"David C Lye","author_inst":"NCID"},{"author_name":"Laurent Renia","author_inst":"SIgN"},{"author_name":"Lai Guan Ng","author_inst":"SIgN"},{"author_name":"Anis Larbi","author_inst":"SIgN"},{"author_name":"Lisa FP Ng","author_inst":"SIgN"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.11.146332","rel_title":"Validation and performance of a quantitative IgG assay for the screening of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.11.146332","rel_abs":"The current COVID-19 epidemic imposed an unpreceded challenge to the scientific community in terms of treatment, epidemiology, diagnosis, social interaction, fiscal policies and many other areas.

These assays should provide guidance to identify immune presumptive protected persons, potential plasma, and\/or B cell donors and vaccine development among others. Also, such assays will be contributory in supporting prospective and retrospective studies to identify the prevalence and incidence of COVID-19 and to characterize the dynamics of the immune response.

In this work we describe the development and validation of a quantitative IgG enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) using the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein S1 domain, containing the receptor-binding domain (RBD), showing 98% sensitivity, 98.9% specificity and positive and negative predictive values of 100% and 99.2%, respectively. The assay showed to be useful to test for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in plasma samples from COVID-19-recovered subjects as potential donors for plasmapheresis.

To identify SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, we analysed the antibody response of 12 COVID-19 patients from 8 to 69 days post diagnosis. By screening 4,313 SARS-CoV-2-reactive B cells, we isolated 255 antibodies from different time points as early as 8 days post diagnosis. Among these, 28 potently neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 (IC100 as low as 0.04 g\/ml), showing a broad spectrum of V genes and low levels of somatic mutations. Interestingly, potential precursors were identified in naive B cell repertoires from 48 healthy individuals that were sampled before the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies are readily generated from a diverse pool of precursors, fostering the hope of rapid induction of a protective immune response upon vaccination.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christoph Kreer","author_inst":"Laboratory of Experimental Immunology, Institute of Virology, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Cologne, University of Cologne, 50931 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Matthias Zehner","author_inst":"Laboratory of Experimental Immunology, Institute of Virology, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Cologne, University of Cologne, 50931 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Timm Weber","author_inst":"Laboratory of Experimental Immunology, Institute of Virology, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Cologne, University of Cologne, 50931 Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Cornelius Rohde","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Faculty of Medicine, Philipps University Marburg, 35043 Marburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Sandro Halwe","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Faculty of Medicine, Philipps University Marburg, 35043 Marburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Meryem S.

Here we analyzed the transcriptional profile (microarray and single-cell RNA-Seq) of proteins potentially interacting with coronaviruses to identify non-canonical mediators of SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in the placenta. We show that, despite low levels of the canonical cell entry mediators ACE2 and TMPRSS2, cells of the syncytiotrophoblast, villous cytotrophoblast, and extravillous trophoblast co-express high levels of the potential non-canonical cell-entry mediators DPP4 and CTSL. We also found changes in the expression of DAAM1 and PAICS genes during pregnancy, which are translated into proteins also predicted to interact with coronaviruses proteins. These results provide new insight into the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and host proteins that may act as non-canonical routes for SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in the placenta cells.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Flavia Bessi Constantino","author_inst":"Sao Paulo State University (UNESP)"},{"author_name":"Sarah Santiloni Cury","author_inst":"Sao Paulo State University (UNESP)"},{"author_name":"Celia Regina Nogueira","author_inst":"Sao Paulo State University (UNESP)"},{"author_name":"Robson Carvalho","author_inst":"Sao Paulo State University (UNESP)"},{"author_name":"Luis Justulin","author_inst":"Sao Paulo State University (UNESP)"},{"author_name":"Meryem S.

Methods: 82 studies were included in the present meta-analysis that all of them have been published before May 1, 2020 and were found by searching through the databases Scopus and MEDLINE. The selected papers were studied and analyzed by employing the version 14 of stata software. It should be noted that, we employed I2 statistics for testing and verifying heterogeneity. Results: 82 papers were finally chosen for this meta- analysis, including 74855 infected patients (35673 men, 31140 women). The mean age of the patients was 56.49. The results indicate the prevalence of fever 79.84 (95% CI: 75.22-84.13), cough 59.53 (95% CI: 55.35-63.65), fatigue or myalgia 33.46 (95% CI: 28.68-38.40), dyspnea 31.48 (95% CI: 25.75-37.49) and diarrhea 10.71 (95% CI: 8.20-13.49). The prevalence of the most common comorbidities were hypertension 25.10 (95% CI: 19.91-30.64), diabetes 13.48 (95% CI: 10.61-16.62), cardiovascular diseases 8.94 (95% CI: 6.99-11.10), and chronic kidney disease 3.27 (95% CI: 2.22-4.47).

Complications in the respiratory tract are related to bodily problems, which lead to a restriction of lung function due to reduced volume, inducing an increase in respiratory work. SARS-CoV-2 has a high potential for contamination by respiratory secretions and, therefore, obesity is one of the main risk factors for complications due to the association established between obesity, chronic inflammation and respiratory infection. The objective was to analyze the complex relationships between obesity and COVID-19 in a meta-analysis study using complex network modeling and the theoretical knockouts technique. Here, we identify and justify through a mathematical analysis the relationships between all the immunological agents added to the proposed immunological networks, considered as a simple evident interaction, relationship, influence, response, activation, based on our quantifiers. They performed the knockouts of all 52 vertices in the COVID-19 network and obesity - regardless of the environment, which would result in nonsense - and the COVID-19 infection network without considering obesity. The stationary flow vector (flow profile), for some knockouts of immunological interest in COVID-19 infections, was chosen IFN, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17 and TNF. This initial study pointed out the importance of chronic inflammation in the obese individual as an important factor in potentiating the disease caused by covid-19 and, in particular, the importance on IL-17.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giovani  Marino Favero","author_inst":"Universidade Estadual de Ponta Grossa"},{"author_name":"Luis  Paulo Gomes Mascarenhas","author_inst":"Universidade Estadual do Centro Oeste"},{"author_name":"Meirielly Furmann","author_inst":"Universidade do Centro Oeste"},{"author_name":"Juliana Berton","author_inst":"Universidade Estadual de Ponta Grossa"},{"author_name":"Pedro  Jeferson Miranda","author_inst":"Universidade Estadual de Ponta Grossa"},{"author_name":"Mostafa Rezaei-Tavirani","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Owrang Eilami","author_inst":"Shiraz University of Medical Science"},{"author_name":"Justin Yang","author_inst":"Taipei American School"},{"author_name":"Ting-Yu Yeh","author_inst":"Taipei American School"},{"author_name":"Kelly Yang","author_inst":"Taipei American School"},{"author_name":"Vera Chien","author_inst":"Taipei American School"},{"author_name":"Tiffany Huang","author_inst":"Taipei American School"},{"author_name":"Andrew Chen","author_inst":"Taipei American School"},{"author_name":"Claire Wei","author_inst":"Taipei American School"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Hsu","author_inst":"Taipei American School"},{"author_name":"Jude C.

We estimated excess mortality in specific CVDs, both direct, through infection, and indirect, through changes in healthcare. Methods: We used population-based electronic health records from 3,862,012 individuals in England to estimate pre- and post-COVID-19 mortality risk(direct effect) for people with incident and prevalent CVD. We incorporated: (i)pre-COVID-19 risk by age, sex and comorbidities, (ii)estimated population COVID-19 prevalence, and (iii)estimated relative impact of COVID-19 on mortality(relative risk, RR: 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0). For indirect effects, we analysed weekly mortality and emergency department data for England\/Wales and monthly hospital data from England(n=2), China(n=5) and Italy(n=1) for CVD referral, diagnosis and treatment until 1 May 2020. Findings: CVD service activity decreased by 60-100% compared with pre-pandemic levels in eight hospitals across China, Italy and England during the pandemic. In China, activity remained below pre-COVID-19 levels for 2-3 months even after easing lockdown, and is still reduced in Italy and England. Mortality data suggest indirect effects on CVD will be delayed rather than contemporaneous(peak RR 1.4). For total CVD(incident and prevalent), at 10% population COVID-19 rate, we estimated direct impact of 31,205 and 62,410 excess deaths in England at RR 1.5 and 2.0 respectively, and indirect effect of 49932 to 99865 excess deaths. Interpretation: Supply and demand for CVD services have dramatically reduced across countries with potential for substantial, but avoidable, excess mortality during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":29,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amitava Banerjee","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Suliang Chen","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Laura Pasea","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Alvina Lai","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Michail Katsoulis","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Spiros Denaxas","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Vahe Nafilyan","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Bryan Williams","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Wai Keong Wong","author_inst":"University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Ameet Bakhai","author_inst":"Royal Free Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Kamlesh Khunti","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Deenan Pillay","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Mahdad Noursadeghi","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Honghan Wu","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Nilesh Pareek","author_inst":"King's College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Daniel Bromage","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"Theresa Mcdonagh","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Byrne","author_inst":"Kings London NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"James T Teo","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ajay Shah","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Ben Humberstone","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Liang V Tang","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Anoop SV Shah","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Andrea Rubboli","author_inst":"Ospedale S.

During the early phase, little was known about public awareness relating to Coronavirus disease. This study was designed to determine knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) among the Iranian public towards COVID-19. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was carried out in Iran from 2 March to 8 April 2020 using a self-administered questionnaire on 1,480 people. COVID-19-related KAP questions were adapted from other internationally validated questionnaires specific to infectious diseases. Results: All participants were aware of COVID-19. When asked unprompted, 80% of respondents could correctly cite fever, difficulty breathing and cough as signs\/symptoms of COVID-19. Most of our sample population knew that by staying at home and staying isolated (95.3%, 95 % CI: 94.2-96.3) as well as constant hand washing and using disinfectants (92.5%, 95 % CI: 91.1-93.8) could prevent COVID-19. However, there was also widespread misconceptions such as the belief that COVID-19 can be transmitted by wild animals (58%, 95 % CI: 55.5-60.5) and by air (48.3%, 95 % CI: 45.7-50.8). Unprompted, self-reported actions taken to avoid COVID-19 infection included hand washing with soap and water (95.4%, 95 % CI: 94.3-96.4), avoiding crowded places (93%, 95 % CI: 91.7-94.3), cleaning hands with other disinfectants (80.9 %, 95 % CI: 78.9- 82.9), and covering mouths and noses when coughing and sneezing (76.1 %, 95 % CI: 73.9-78.2). The internet and social media (94.5%, 95 % CI: 93.3-95.6) were the main Coronavirus information sources. However, the most trusted information sources on Coronavirus were health and medical professionals (79.3%, 95 % CI: 77.2-81.3). The majority of participants (77.0%, 95 % CI: 74.8-79.1) wanted more information about Coronavirus to be available. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that people's knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19 at the time of its outbreak was of a high level. Therefore, health systems should use multiple ways, such as mass media, phone applications, electronic, print, and tele-education to increase KAP related to COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Edris Kakemam","author_inst":"Tabriz University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"DJavad Ghoddoosi-Nejad","author_inst":"Birjand University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zahra Chegini","author_inst":"Qazvin University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Khalil Momeni","author_inst":"Ilam University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hamid Salehinia","author_inst":"Birjand University of Medical sciences"},{"author_name":"Soheil Hassanipour","author_inst":"Guilan University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hosein Ameri","author_inst":"Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Morteza Arab-Zozani","author_inst":"Birjand University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wai Keong Wong","author_inst":"University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Ameet Bakhai","author_inst":"Royal Free Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Kamlesh Khunti","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Deenan Pillay","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Mahdad Noursadeghi","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Honghan Wu","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Nilesh Pareek","author_inst":"King's College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Daniel Bromage","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"Theresa Mcdonagh","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Byrne","author_inst":"Kings London NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"James T Teo","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ajay Shah","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Ben Humberstone","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Liang V Tang","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Anoop SV Shah","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Andrea Rubboli","author_inst":"Ospedale S.

Design: Observational cohort study conducted between April 17 and May 1, 2020 using a web-based questionnaire. Setting: Medical and main campuses of a university. Participants: All faculty, staff, and post-doctoral fellows. Exposures: Work factors including supervisor support and exposure to high-risk clinical settings; personal factors including demographics and family\/home stressors. Main Outcomes and Measures: Stress, anxiety, depression, work exhaustion, burnout, and decreased well-being. Results: There were 5550 respondents (overall response rate of 34.3%). 38% of faculty and 14% of staff (n=915) were providing clinical care, while 57% of faculty and 77% of staff were working from home. The prevalence of anxiety, depression, and work exhaustion were somewhat higher among clinicians than non-clinicians. Among all workers, anxiety, depression, and high work exhaustion were independently associated with community or clinical exposure to COVID-19 [Prevalence Ratios and 95% confidence intervals 1.37(1.09- 1.73), 1.28(1.03 - 1.59), and 1.24(1.13 - 1.36) respectively]. Poor family supportive behaviors by supervisors were also associated with these outcomes [1.40 (1.21 - 1.62), 1.69 (1.48 - 1.92), 1.54 (1.44 - 1.64)]. Age below 40 and a greater number of family\/home stressors were also associated with poorer outcomes. Among the subset of clinicians, caring for patients with COVID-19 and work in high-risk clinical settings were additional risk factors. Conclusions and Implications: Our findings suggest that the pandemic has had negative effects on mental health and well-being among both clinical and non-clinical employees. Prevention of exposure to COVID-19 and increased supervisor support are modifiable risk factors that may protect mental health and well-being.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bradley A Evanoff","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jaime R Strickland","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ann Marie Dale","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lisa Hayibor","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Emily Page","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Jennifer G Duncan","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Thomas Kannampallil","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Diana L Gray","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Wai Keong Wong","author_inst":"University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Ameet Bakhai","author_inst":"Royal Free Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Kamlesh Khunti","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Deenan Pillay","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Mahdad Noursadeghi","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Honghan Wu","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Nilesh Pareek","author_inst":"King's College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Daniel Bromage","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"Theresa Mcdonagh","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Byrne","author_inst":"Kings London NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"James T Teo","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ajay Shah","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Ben Humberstone","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Liang V Tang","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Anoop SV Shah","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Andrea Rubboli","author_inst":"Ospedale S.

The epidemiological data indicate that infection and mortality rates are greater in European populations in comparison with eastern Asians. To test if epidemiological patterns may be partly determined by human genetic variation, we investigated, by exomic and databank analyses, the variability found in the TMPRSS2 gene in populations from different continents, since this gene is fundamental to virus access into human cells. The functional variants revealed low diversity. The analyses of the variation in the modifiers of gene expression indicate that the European populations may have much higher levels of pulmonary expression of the TMPRSS2 gene and would be more vulnerable to infection by SARS-CoV-2. By contrast, the pulmonary expression of the TMPRSS2 may be reduced in the populations from East Asia, which implies that they are less susceptible to the virus infection and, these genetic features might also favor their better outcomes. The presented data, if confirmed, indicates a potential genetic contribution of TMPRSS2 to individual susceptibility to viral infection, and might also influence COVID-19 outcome.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ney Pereira Carneiro Santos","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Andre Salim Khayat","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Juliana Carla Gomes Rodrigues","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Pablo Carmo Pinto","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Gilderlanio Santana Araujo","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Lucas Favacho Pastana","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Jessyca Amanda Gomes Medeiros","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Marianne Rodrigues Fernandes","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Arthur Ribeiro dos Santos","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Bruna Claudia Meireles Khayat","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Fabiano Cordeiro Moreira","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Andre Mauricio Ribeiro dos Santos","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Paula Barauna Assumpcao","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Andrea Ribeiro dos Santos","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Paulo Pimentel Assumpcao","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Sidney Santos","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Theresa Mcdonagh","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Byrne","author_inst":"Kings London NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"James T Teo","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ajay Shah","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Ben Humberstone","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Liang V Tang","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Anoop SV Shah","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Andrea Rubboli","author_inst":"Ospedale S.

However, the use of large-scale population testing is unrealistic or not feasible in some countries. Based on a newly developed mathematical model, we estimated the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Latin American countries. The results show that the virus spreads unevenly across countries. For example, Ecuador and Brazil are the most affected countries, with approximately 3% of the infected population. Currently, the number of new infections is increasing in all countries examined, with the exception of some Caribbean countries as Cuba. Moreover, in these countries, the peak of newly infected patients has not yet been reached.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marcos Matabuena","author_inst":"CiTIUS (Centro Singular de Investigacion en Tecnoloxias Intelixentes)"},{"author_name":"Pablo Rodriguez Mier","author_inst":"Toxalim (Research Centre in Food Toxicology), Universite de Toulouse, INRAE, ENVT,INP-Purpan, UPS, Toulouse, France"},{"author_name":"Carlos Meijide-Garcia","author_inst":"Universidad de Santiago de Compostela"},{"author_name":"Victor Leboran","author_inst":"CiTIUS (Centro Singular de Investigacion en Tecnoloxias Intelixentes)"},{"author_name":"Francisco Gude","author_inst":"Clinical Epidemiology Unit, Hospital Clinico Universitario de Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain"},{"author_name":"Lucas Favacho Pastana","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Jessyca Amanda Gomes Medeiros","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Marianne Rodrigues Fernandes","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Arthur Ribeiro dos Santos","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Bruna Claudia Meireles Khayat","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Fabiano Cordeiro Moreira","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Andre Mauricio Ribeiro dos Santos","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Paula Barauna Assumpcao","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Andrea Ribeiro dos Santos","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Paulo Pimentel Assumpcao","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Sidney Santos","author_inst":"Federal University of Para"},{"author_name":"Theresa Mcdonagh","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Byrne","author_inst":"Kings London NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"James T Teo","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ajay Shah","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Ben Humberstone","author_inst":"Office for National Statistics"},{"author_name":"Liang V Tang","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Anoop SV Shah","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Andrea Rubboli","author_inst":"Ospedale S.

Patients with multiple myeloma have a compromised immune system, due to both the disease and anti-myeloma therapies, and may therefore be particularly susceptible to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, there is limited information to guide clinical management. Objective: To assess risk factors and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with multiple myeloma. Design: Case-series. Setting: Five large academic centers in New York City. Participants: Patients with multiple myeloma and related plasma cell disorders who were diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 10th, 2020 and April 30th, 2020. Exposures: Clinical features and risk factors were analyzed in relation to severity of COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: Descriptive statistics as well as logistic regression were used to estimate disease severity reflected in hospital admissions, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, need for mechanical ventilation, or death. Results: Of 100 multiple myeloma patients (male 58%; median age 68, range 41-91) diagnosed with COVID-19, 74 (74%) were admitted; of these 13 (18%) patients were placed on mechanical ventilation, and 18 patients (24%) expired. None of the studied risk factors were significantly associated (P>0.05) with adverse outcomes (ICU-admission, mechanical ventilation, or death): hypertension (N=56) odds ratio (OR) 2.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9-5.9); diabetes (N=18) OR 1.1 (95% CI 0.3-3.2); age >65 years (N=63) OR 2.0 (95% CI 0.8-5.3); high dose melphalan with autologous stem cell transplant <12 months (N=7) OR 1.2 (95% CI 0.2-7.4), IgG<650 mg\/dL (N=42) OR=1.2 (95% CI 0.4-3.1). In the entire series of 127 patients with plasma cell disorders, hypertension was significantly associated with the combined end-point (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.5-8.1). Conclusions and Relevance: Although multiple myeloma patients have a compromised immune system due to both the disease and therapy; in this largest disease specific cohort to date of patients with multiple myeloma and COVID-19, compared to the general population, we found risk factors for adverse outcome to be shared and mortality rates to be within the higher range of officially reported mortality rates.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Malin Hultcrantz","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Joshua Richter","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Cara Rosenbaum","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Dhwani Patel","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Eric Smith","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Neha Korde","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Sydney Lu","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Sham Mailankody","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Urvi Shah","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Alexander Lesokhin","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Hani Hassoun","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Carlyn Tan","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Francesco Maura","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Andriy Derkach","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Diamond","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Adriana Rossi","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Roger N Pearse","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Deppu Madduri","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Ajai Chari","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"David Kaminetzky","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Marc Braunstein","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Christian Gordillo","author_inst":"Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Faith Davies","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Sundar Jagannath","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Ruben Niesvizky","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Suzanne Lentzsch","author_inst":"Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Gareth Morgan","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Ola Landgren","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Harry Hemingway","author_inst":"UCL"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"hematology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.09.20126417","rel_title":"Identification of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in Japan by multiple molecular assays-implication for wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE)","rel_date":"2020-06-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.09.20126417","rel_abs":"Presence of SARS-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in wastewater sample has been documented in several countries. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is potentially effective for early warning of COVID-19 outbreak. The purpose of this study was to verify the detection limit of WBE for COVID-19. In total, 27 influent wastewater samples were collected from four wastewater treatment plants in Ishikawa and Toyama prefectures in Japan. During the study period, numbers of the confirmed COVID-19 cases in these prefectures increased from almost 0 to around 20 per 100,000 peoples. SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the samples were identified by several PCR-based assays. Among the 27 samples, 7 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by at least one out of the three quantitative RT-PCR assays. These samples were also positive by RT-nested PCR assays. The detection frequency became higher when the number of total confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in 100,000 peoples became above 10 in each prefecture. However, SARS-CoV-2 could also be detected with a low frequency when the number was below 1.0. Considering that the number of the confirmed cases does not necessarily reflect the actual prevalence of the infection at the time point, data on the relationship between the number of infection cases and concentration in wastewater needs to be accumulated further.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Akihiko Hata","author_inst":"Faculty of Engineering, Toyama Prefectural University"},{"author_name":"Ryo Honda","author_inst":"Faculty of Geosciences and Civil Engineering, Kanazawa University"},{"author_name":"Hiroe Hara-Yamamura","author_inst":"Faculty of Geosciences and Civil Engineering, Kanazawa University"},{"author_name":"Yuno Meuchi","author_inst":"Faculty of Engineering, Toyama Prefectural University"},{"author_name":"Eric Smith","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Neha Korde","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Sydney Lu","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Sham Mailankody","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Urvi Shah","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Alexander Lesokhin","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Hani Hassoun","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Carlyn Tan","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Francesco Maura","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Andriy Derkach","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Diamond","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Adriana Rossi","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Roger N Pearse","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Deppu Madduri","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Ajai Chari","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"David Kaminetzky","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Marc Braunstein","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Christian Gordillo","author_inst":"Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Faith Davies","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Sundar Jagannath","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Ruben Niesvizky","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Suzanne Lentzsch","author_inst":"Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Gareth Morgan","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Ola Landgren","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Harry Hemingway","author_inst":"UCL"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.09.20126581","rel_title":"Assessment of Experiences of Preventive Measures Practice including Vaccination History and Health Education among Umrah Pilgrims in Saudi Arabia, 1440H-2019","rel_date":"2020-06-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.09.20126581","rel_abs":"Background Annually, approximately 10 million Umrah pilgrims travel to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for Umrah from more than 180 countries. This event presents major challenges for the Kingdom public health sector, which strives to decrease the burden of infectious diseases and to adequately control its spread. Aims of the study The aims of the study were to assess the experiences of preventive measures practice, including vaccination history and health education, among Umrah pilgrims in Saudi Arabia. Methods A cross sectional survey administered to a randomly selected group of pilgrims by the research team members from February to the end of April 2019 at the departure lounge at King Abdul Aziz International airport, Jeddah city. The questionnaire was comprised of questions on the following factors: sociodemographic information, level of education, history of vaccinations and chronic illnesses, whether the pilgrim has received any health education and orientation prior to coming Saudi Arabia or on their arrival, and their experiences with preventive medicine. Results Pilgrims (n=1012) of 48 nationalities completed the survey and were reported in this study. Chronic diseases (n=230) were reported among pilgrims, with hypertension being the most reported morbidity (n=124, 53.9%). The majority of pilgrims had taken immunization prior to travel to Saudi Arabia, and the most commonly reported immunizations were meningitis (n=567, 56%), influenza (n=460, 45.5%), and Hepatitis B virus vaccinations (n=324, 32%); however, 223(22%) had not received any vaccinations prior to travel, including meningitis vaccine, which is mandatory in Saudi Arabia. 305 pilgrims (30.1%) had reported never using face masks in crowded areas; however, 63.2% reported lack of availability of these masks. The majority of participants had received health education on preventive measures, including hygienic aspects (n=799, 78.9%) mostly in their home countries (n=450, 56.3%). A positive association was found between receiving health education and practicing of preventive measures, such as wearing masks in crowded areas (P= 0.04) and other health practice scores (P= 0.02). Conclusion Although the experiences of the preventive measures among pilgrims in terms of health education, vaccinations, and hygienic practices were overall positive, this study identified several issues with the following preventive measures: immunizations particularly meningitis vaccine and using face masks in crowded areas. Further studies are required to develop a health education module to promote comprehensive preventive measures for pilgrims.

Surprisingly, early SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral responses were found to be typically dominated by antibodies of the IgA isotype. Peripheral expansion of IgA-plasmablasts with mucosal-homing potential was detected shortly after the onset of symptoms and peaked during the third week of the disease. While the specific antibody response included IgG, IgM and IgA, the latter contributed to a much larger extent to virus neutralization, as compared to IgG. However, specific IgA serum levels notably decrease after one month of evolution.

Yet, it is unknown to what degree these risk factors alone or in combination can accurately predict who is most at risk. It is also worthwhile to consider serological antibody titers to non COVID-19 infectious diseases, which may influence host immunity to COVID-19. Methods: In this retrospective study of multicenter UK Biobank participants, as of May 26th 2020, all COVID-19 testing data was collected by Public Health England for older adult in- and out-patients (69.6 {+\/-} 8.8 years). We used linear discriminant analysis with cross-validation and bootstrapping to determine the accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of baseline data from 2006-2010 to predict COVID-19 infection and presumptive severity (i.e., testing at hospital). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to derive the area under the curve (AUC). Findings: This retrospective study included 4,510 unique participants and 7,539 testing instances (i.e., test cases). Testing resulted in 5,329 negative cases and 2,210 positive cases, split into 996 mild and 1,214 severe disease outcomes. Baseline data including demographics, bioimpedance-derived body composition, vitals, serum biochemistry, self-reported illness\/disability, and complete blood count. A randomized subset of 80 participants with 124 test cases also had antibody titers for 20 common to rare infectious diseases. Among all test cases, accuracy was modest for final diagnostic models of COVID-19 infection (70.2%; AUC=0.570, CI=0.556-0.584) and severity (58.3%; AUC=0.592, CI=0.568-0.615). In the sub-group with serology, by contrast, final models predicted infection and severity with an accuracy of 93.5% (AUC=0.969, CI=0.934-1.000) and 74.4% (AUC=0.803, CI=0.663-0.943) respectively. Models included titers to common pathogens (e.g., human cytomegalovirus), age, blood cell counts, lipids, and other biochemical markers. Interpretation: Serological titers for infectious diseases and other risk factors could help policy makers and clinicians better identify who may get COVID-19 and require hospitalization.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Auriel A Willette","author_inst":"Iowa State University"},{"author_name":"Sara A Willette","author_inst":"Iowa State University"},{"author_name":"Qian Wang","author_inst":"Iowa State University"},{"author_name":"Colleen Pappas","author_inst":"Iowa State University"},{"author_name":"Brandon S Klinedinst","author_inst":"Iowa State University"},{"author_name":"Scott Le","author_inst":"Iowa State University"},{"author_name":"Brittany Larsen","author_inst":"Iowa State University"},{"author_name":"Amy Pollpeter","author_inst":"Iowa State University"},{"author_name":"Nicole Brenner","author_inst":"German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)"},{"author_name":"Tim Waterboer","author_inst":"German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)"},{"author_name":"Rick Hockett","author_inst":"Genalyte Inc."},{"author_name":"Sasi Mudumba","author_inst":"Genlayte Inc"},{"author_name":"Amelie Guihot","author_inst":"Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris"},{"author_name":"Charles-Edouard Luyt","author_inst":"Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris"},{"author_name":"Julien Mayaux","author_inst":"Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Beurton","author_inst":"Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris"},{"author_name":"Salma Fourati","author_inst":"Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris"},{"author_name":"Jean-Marc Lacorte","author_inst":"Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris"},{"author_name":"Hans Yssel","author_inst":"Centre d Immunologie et des Maladies Infectieuses"},{"author_name":"Christophe Parizot","author_inst":"Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris"},{"author_name":"Karim Dorgham","author_inst":"Centre d Immunologie et des Maladies Infectieuses"},{"author_name":"Pierre Charneau","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur Paris"},{"author_name":"Zahir Amoura","author_inst":"Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris"},{"author_name":"Guy Gorochov","author_inst":"Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris"},{"author_name":"Ruben Niesvizky","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Suzanne Lentzsch","author_inst":"Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Gareth Morgan","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Ola Landgren","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Harry Hemingway","author_inst":"UCL"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.09.20127050","rel_title":"Plasma from recovered COVID19 subjects inhibits spike protein binding to ACE2 in a microsphere-based inhibition assay","rel_date":"2020-06-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.09.20127050","rel_abs":"High throughput serological tests that can establish the presence and functional activity of anti-SARS-COV2 antibodies are urgently needed. Here we present microsphere-based Flow Cytometry assays that quantify both anti-spike IgGs in plasma, and the ability of plasma to inhibit the binding of spike protein to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). First, we detected anti-trimer IgGs in 22\/24 and anti-RBD IgGs in 21\/24 COVID+ subjects at a median of 36 (range 14-73) days following documented SARS-CoV-2 RNA (+) secretions. Next, we find that plasma from all 22\/24 subjects with anti-trimer IgGs inhibited ACE2-trimer binding to a greater degree than controls, and that the degree of inhibition correlated with anti-trimer IgG levels. Depletion of trimer-reactive Igs from plasma reduced ACE2-trimer inhibitory capacity to a greater degree than depletion of RBD-reactive Igs, suggesting that inhibitory antibodies act by binding both within and outside of the RBD. Amongst the 24 subjects, presence of fever was associated with higher levels of anti-trimer IgG and inhibition of binding to human ACE2. This inhibition assay may be broadly useful to quantify the functional antibody response of recovered COVID19 patients or vaccine recipients in a cell-free assay system.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Edward P Gniffke","author_inst":"Seattle Childrens Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Whitney E Harrington","author_inst":"Seattle Childrens Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Dambrauskas","author_inst":"Seattle Childrens Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Yonghou Jiang","author_inst":"Seattle Childrens Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Olesya Trakhimets","author_inst":"Seattle Childrens Reserach Institute"},{"author_name":"Vladimir Vigdorovich","author_inst":"Seattle Childrens Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Lisa Frenkel","author_inst":"Seattle Childrens Research Institute"},{"author_name":"D.

In this study, we demonstrate the utility of monitoring the daily number of patients with COVID-like illness (CLI) who present to the Emergency Department (ED) as a tool that can guide local response efforts. Methods Using data from two hospitals in King County, WA, we examined the daily volume of CLI visits, and compare them to confirmed COVID cases and COVID deaths in the County. A linear regression model with varying lags is used to predict the number of daily COVID deaths from the number of CLI visits. Results CLI visits appear to rise and peak well in advance of both confirmed COVID cases and deaths in King County. Our regression analysis to predict daily deaths with a lagged count of CLI visits in the ED showed that the R2 value was maximized at 14 days. Conclusions ED CLI visits are a leading indicator of the pandemic. Adopting and scaling up a CLI monitoring approach at the local level will provide needed actionable evidence to policy makers and health officials struggling to confront this health challenge.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Herbert C Duber","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington"},{"author_name":"M Kennedy Hall","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Karl D Jablonowski","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Susan A Stern","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Ali H Mokdad","author_inst":"Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Abraham D Flaxman","author_inst":"Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Lisa Frenkel","author_inst":"Seattle Childrens Research Institute"},{"author_name":"D.

Our method to estimate the reproductive number using Bayesian inference with time-dependent priors enhances previous approaches by considering a dynamic prior continuously updated as restrictive measures and comportments within the society evolve. In addition, to allow direct comparison between reproductive number and introduction of public health measures in a specific country, the infection dates are inferred from daily confirmed cases and death with the mean time between a case being declared as positive and its death estimated on 1430 cases at 10.7 days. The evolution of the reproductive rate in combination with the stringency index is analyzed on 31 European countries. We show that most countries required tough state interventions with a stringency index equal to 83.6 out of 100 to reduce the reproductive number below one and control the progression of the epidemic. In addition, we show a direct correlation between the time taken to introduce restrictive measures and the time required to contain the spread of the epidemic with a median time of 8 days. Our analysis reinforces the importance of having a fast response with a coherent and comprehensive set of confinement measures to control the epidemic. Only combinations of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have shown to be effective.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hugues Turbe","author_inst":"Department of radiology and medical informatics - University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Mina Bjelogrlic","author_inst":"Department of radiology and medical informatics - University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Arnaud Robert","author_inst":"Department of radiology and medical informatics - University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Christophe Gaudet-Blavignac","author_inst":"Department of radiology and medical informatics - University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Christian Lovis","author_inst":"Department of radiology and medical informatics - University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Jean-Philippe Goldman","author_inst":"Department of radiology and medical informatics - University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Lisa Frenkel","author_inst":"Seattle Childrens Research Institute"},{"author_name":"D.

It provides an opportunity to examine the effect of the lockdown and of other events on the dynamics of the epidemic. In particular, it has been suggested that municipal elections held just before lockdown was ordered may have helped spread the virus. In this manuscript we use Bayesian models of the number of deaths through time to study the epidemic in 13 regions of France. We found that the models accurately predict the number of deaths 2 to 3 weeks in advance, and recover estimates that are in agreement with recent models that rely on a different structure and different input data. In particular, the lockdown reduced the viral reproduction number by {approx} 80%. However, using a mixture model, we found that the lockdown had had different effectiveness depending on the region, and that it had been slightly more effective in decreasing the reproduction number in denser regions. The mixture model predicts that 2.08 (95% CI : 1.85-2.47) million people had been infected by May 11, and that there were 2567 (95% CI : 1781-5182) new infections on May 10. We found no evidence that the reproduction numbers differ between week-ends and week days, and no evidence that the reproduction numbers increased on the election day. Finally, we evaluated counterfactual scenarios showing that ordering the lockdown 1 to 7 days sooner would have resulted in 19% to 76% fewer deaths, but that ordering it 1 to 7 days later would have resulted in 21% to 266% more deaths. Overall, the predictions of the model indicate that holding the elections on March 15 did not have a detectable impact on the total number of deaths, unless it motivated a delay in imposing the lockdown.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Louis Duchemin","author_inst":"Universite de Lyon, Universite Lyon 1, CNRS, Laboratoire de Biometrie et Biologie Evolutive UMR 5558, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France"},{"author_name":"Philippe Veber","author_inst":"Universite de Lyon, Universite Lyon 1, CNRS, Laboratoire de Biometrie et Biologie Evolutive UMR 5558, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France"},{"author_name":"Bastien Boussau","author_inst":"Universite de Lyon, Universite Lyon 1, CNRS, Laboratoire de Biometrie et Biologie Evolutive UMR 5558, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France"},{"author_name":"Christophe Gaudet-Blavignac","author_inst":"Department of radiology and medical informatics - University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Christian Lovis","author_inst":"Department of radiology and medical informatics - University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Jean-Philippe Goldman","author_inst":"Department of radiology and medical informatics - University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Lisa Frenkel","author_inst":"Seattle Childrens Research Institute"},{"author_name":"D.

We include four sets of variables: socio-economic variables, county-level health variables, modes of commuting, and climate and pollution patterns. Our analysis studies daily death rates from April 4, 2020 to May 27, 2020. We estimate correlation patterns both across states, as well as within states. For both models, we find higher shares of African American residents in the county are correlated with higher death rates. However, when we restrict ourselves to correlation patterns within a given state, the statistical significance of the correlation of death rates with the share of African Americans, while remaining positive, wanes. We find similar results for the share of elderly in the county. We find that higher amounts of commuting via public transportation, relative to telecommuting, is correlated with higher death rates. The correlation between driving into work, relative to telecommuting, and death rates is also positive across both models, but statistically significant only when we look across states and counties. We also find that a higher share of people not working, and thus not commuting either because they are elderly, children or unemployed, is correlated with higher death rates. Counties with higher home values, higher summer temperatures, and lower winter temperatures have higher death rates. Contrary to past work, we do not find a correlation between pollution and death rates. Also importantly, we do not find that death rates are correlated with obesity rates, ICU beds per capita, or poverty rates. Finally, our model that looks within states yields estimates of how a given state's death rate compares to other states after controlling for the variables included in our model; this may be interpreted as a measure of how states are doing relative to others. We find that death rates in the Northeast are substantially higher compared to other states, even when we control for the four sets of variables above. Death rates are also statistically significantly higher in Michigan, Louisiana, Iowa, Indiana, and Colorado. California's death rate is the lowest across all states.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christopher R Knittel","author_inst":"MIT"},{"author_name":"Bora Ozaltun","author_inst":"MIT"},{"author_name":"Bastien Boussau","author_inst":"Universite de Lyon, Universite Lyon 1, CNRS, Laboratoire de Biometrie et Biologie Evolutive UMR 5558, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France"},{"author_name":"Christophe Gaudet-Blavignac","author_inst":"Department of radiology and medical informatics - University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Christian Lovis","author_inst":"Department of radiology and medical informatics - University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Jean-Philippe Goldman","author_inst":"Department of radiology and medical informatics - University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Lisa Frenkel","author_inst":"Seattle Childrens Research Institute"},{"author_name":"D.

We propose a simple method to calculate a figure of merit FC to provide an early characterization of the disease status in country C. METHODS We use mathematical tools to adjust a Gaussian function to the daily increase of infected patients. Maximum value and full width half maximum of the Gaussian are characteristics of the development of the development of the pandemic in each country. These parameters are supplemented by the testing volume and the mortality rate to produce just one characterizing parameter: FC. In addition, the stability of the Gaussian fits was calculated within an entire week towards the end of the study period. Seventeen different countries were fully considered, while others are considered when discussing particular properties. Data employed is publically available. FINDINGS Fitted Gaussian functions render effective information about the development of COVID-19. The number of critical days vary between 11 (South Korea) and 52 (Mexico). FC varies between 1 (Australia) and 899 (Mexico). The epidemic appears stabilized in some countries and unstable in others. Some large countries are experiencing fast development of the propagation of the disease with high FC. A correlation between low (high) values of the mortality rate (and to some extent FC) and the presence (absence) of BCG vaccination is exposed. INTERPRETATION The adjustment of a Gaussian to daily data of COVID-19 in each country reveals the different propagation dynamics, properly characterized by the parameters proposed here. Testing plays a clear role to control the spread of the disease. Mortality rate spans more than one order of magnitude and is somewhat related to permanent massive BCG vaccination. The figure of merit, FC, introduced here spans more than 2 orders of magnitude which makes it a useful indicator to quickly find out the status of the pandemics in each territory. Geography plays a role: low population density and isolated countries can be efficient in controlling the spread of the disease.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patricio Vargas","author_inst":"Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Allende","author_inst":"Universidad de Santiago de Chile"},{"author_name":"Eugenio E Vogel","author_inst":"Universidad de La Frontera"},{"author_name":"Sigismund Kobe","author_inst":"Technische Universitat Dresden"},{"author_name":"Christian Lovis","author_inst":"Department of radiology and medical informatics - University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Jean-Philippe Goldman","author_inst":"Department of radiology and medical informatics - University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Lisa Frenkel","author_inst":"Seattle Childrens Research Institute"},{"author_name":"D.

Methods: After the medical records were reviewed, the patients were assigned to one of two groups, depending on whether their lung cancer treatment schedule was delayed. We assessed the characteristics, types of histopathology and treatment, and the reason for the delay. Results: A total 15 (9.1%) patients experienced the delay of lung cancer treatment during COVID-19 pandemic. Patients with treatment delay received significantly more ICIs monotherapy than patients without treatment delay (p=0.0057). On the contrary, no patients receiving molecular target agents experienced treatment delay during COVID-19 pandemic period (p=0.0027). The treatments of most of the patients were delayed per their request. Conclusion: We revealed 9.1% lung cancer patients suffered anxiety and requested treatment delay during COVID-19 pandemic. Oncologists should keep in mind that patient with cancer have more anxiety than we expected under special occasions such as COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kohei Fujita","author_inst":"NHO Kyoto Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Takanori Ito","author_inst":"NHO Kyoto Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Zentaro Saito","author_inst":"NHO Kyoto Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Osamu Kanai","author_inst":"NHO Kyoto Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Koichi Nakatani","author_inst":"NHO Kyoto Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Tadashi Mio","author_inst":"NHO Kyoto Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Lisa Frenkel","author_inst":"Seattle Childrens Research Institute"},{"author_name":"D.

We examined self-reported changes in solo and sexual behaviors in U.S. adults during early stages of the public health response to COVID-19. Methods: We conducted an online, nationally representative, cross-sectional survey of U.S. adults (N=1010; aged 18-94 years; 62% response rate) from April 10-20, 2020. We used weighted multinomial logistic regression to examine past month self-reported changes (decreased, stable or increased) in ten solo and partnered sexual behaviors. Predictor variables included: having children at home, past month depressive symptoms, (ACHA 3-item scale), past month loneliness (UCLA 3-Item Loneliness scale), COVID-19 protection behaviors (adapted 12-item scale), perceived COVID-19 consequences (adapted 10-item scale) and COVID-19 knowledge (adapted 10-item scale). Findings: Nearly half of all adults reported some kind of change, most commonly, a decrease, in their sexual behavior in the past month. Having elementary aged children at home, past month depressive symptoms and loneliness and enacting more COVID-19 protective behaviors were associated with both reduced partnered bonding behaviors, such as hugging, cuddling, holding hands and kissing, as well as reduced partnered sexual behaviors, such as oral sex, partnered genital touching and vaginal sex. Greater COVID19 risk perception and greater COVID19 knowledge were associated with mixed effects in behavior outcomes. Interpretations: Our data illustrate the very personal ways in which different pandemic-associated factors may create or inhibit opportunities for solo and partnered sex. The centrality of sexuality to health and well-being, even during pandemics, means that a critical piece of public health prevention and management responses should is ensuring that services and resource that support positive sexual decision making remain open and available.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Devon J.

Studies suggested that obesity was a major risk factor for its hospitalization and severity of symptoms. This study investigated the associations between obesity prevalence with overall COVID-19 cases and related deaths across states in the United States. General regression and Chi-square tests were used to examine those associations. The analyses indicated that obesity prevalence (%) across states were negatively associated with COVID-19 cases (p = 0.0448) and related deaths (p = 0.0181), with a decrease of 158 cases\/100K population and 13 deaths\/100K for every 5% increase of the obesity prevalence. When the states were divided based on the median of obesity prevalence (30.9%) into a group of states with low obesity prevalence and a group with high obesity prevalence, both the cases (671 vs 416 cases\/100k population) and deaths (39 vs 21 deaths\/100k population) were significantly different (p < 0.001) across groups. These findings provided important information for the relationship between the dual pandemic threats of obesity and COVID-19. These results should not currently be considered as an indication that obesity is a protective factor for COVID-19, and would rather be used as a warning of the public advice that obese people is more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection, which may lead to a false safety message probably given to people with normal body weight.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ning Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Health Sciences, University of Massachusetts, Amherst"},{"author_name":"Lorraine S.
