The mechanism of recombination in RNA viruses is template switching. Coronavirus transcription also involves template switching at specific regions, called transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRS). It is hypothesized but not yet verified that TRS sites are prone to recombination events. Here, we developed a tool called SuPER to systematically identify TRS in coronavirus genomes and then investigated whether recombination is more common at TRS. We ran SuPER on 506 coronavirus genomes and identified 465 TRS-L and 3509 TRS-B. We found that the TRS-L core sequence (CS) and the secondary structure of the leader sequence are generally conserved within coronavirus genera but different between genera. By examining the location of recombination breakpoints with respect to TRS-B CS, we observed that recombination hotspots are more frequently co-located with TRS-B sites than expected.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yiyan Yang","author_inst":"National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Wei Yan","author_inst":"National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Brantley Hall","author_inst":"University of Maryland"},{"author_name":"Xiaofang Jiang","author_inst":"National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.21.163444","rel_title":"Characterization of 100 sequential SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma donations","rel_date":"2020-06-21","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.21.163444","rel_abs":"Transfusion of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma is a promising treatment for severe COVID-19 cases, with success of the intervention based on neutralizing antibody content.

The global outbreak of this novel coronavirus has now infected >8 million people worldwide with >2 million cases in the US (June 17th, 2020). There is an urgent need for vaccines and therapeutics to combat the spread of this coronavirus. Similarly, the development of diagnostic and research tools to determine infection and vaccine efficacy are critically needed. Molecular assays have been developed to determine viral genetic material present in patients. Serological assays have been developed to determine humoral responses to the spike protein or receptor binding domain (RBD). Detection of functional antibodies can be accomplished through neutralization of live SARS-CoV2 virus, but requires significant expertise, an infectible stable cell line, a specialized BioSafety Level 3 (BSL-3) facility. As large numbers of people return from quarantine, it is critical to have rapid diagnostics that can be widely adopted and employed to assess functional antibody levels in the returning workforce. This type of surrogate neutralization diagnostic can also be used to assess humoral immune responses induced in patients from the large number of vaccine and immunotherapy trials currently on-going. Here we describe a rapid serological diagnostic assay for determining antibody receptor blocking and demonstrate the broad utility of the assay by measuring the antibody functionality of sera from small animals and non-human primates immunized with an experimental SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and using sera from infected patients.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel W Kulp","author_inst":"The Wistar Institute"},{"author_name":"Susanne Walker","author_inst":"The Wistar Institute"},{"author_name":"Neethu Chokkalingam","author_inst":"The Wistar Institute"},{"author_name":"Emma L Reuschel","author_inst":"The Wistar Institute"},{"author_name":"Mansi Purwar","author_inst":"The Wistar Institute"},{"author_name":"Ziyang Xu","author_inst":"The Wistar Institute"},{"author_name":"Ebony Y Gary","author_inst":"The Wistar Institute"},{"author_name":"Kevin Y.

The spike (S) protein that mediates SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells is a major target for vaccines and therapeutics. Thus, insights into its sequence variations are key to understanding the infection and antigenicity of SARS-CoV-2. A dominant mutational variant at position 614 of the S protein (aspartate to glycine, D614G mutation) was observed in the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence obtained from the Nextstrain database. Using a pseudovirus-based assay, we identified that S-D614 and S-G614 protein pseudotyped viruses share a common receptor, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which could be blocked by recombinant ACE2 with the fused Fc region of human IgG1. However, S-D614 and S-G614 protein demonstrated functional differences. First, S-G614 protein could be cleaved by serine protease elastase-2 more efficiently. Second, S-G614 pseudovirus infected 293T-ACE2 cells significantly more efficiently than did the S-D614 pseudovirus, especially in the presence of elastase-2. Third, an elastase inhibitor approved for clinical use blocked elastase-enhanced S-G614 pseudovirus infection. Moreover, 93% (65\/70) convalescent sera from patients with COVID-19 could neutralize both S-D614 and S-G614 pseudoviruses with comparable efficiencies, but about 7% (5\/70) convalescent sera showed reduced neutralizing activity against the S-G614 pseudovirus.

We show that methods based on the molecular clock tend to place the root in the B clade, while methods based on outgroup rooting tend to place the root in the A clade. The results from the two approaches are statistically incompatible, possibly as a consequence of deviations from a molecular clock or excess back-mutations. We also show that none of the methods provide strong statistical support for the placement of the root in any particular edge of the tree.

TMPRSS2 gene is possibly co-expressed with SARS-CoV-2 cell receptor genes ACE2 and BSG, but only TMPRSS2 demonstrates tissue-specific expression in alveolar cells according to single cell RNA sequencing data. Our analysis of the structural variability of the TMPRSS2 gene based on genome-wide data of 76 human populations demonstrates that functionally significant missense mutation in exon 6\/7 in TMPRSS2 gene, was found in many human populations in relatively high frequency, featuring region-specific distribution patterns. The frequency of the missense mutation encoded by the rs12329760, which previously was found to be associated with prostate cancer, is ranged between 10% and 63% being significantly higher in populations of Asian origin compared to European populations. In addition to SNPs, two copy numbers variants (CNV) were detected in the TMPRSS2 gene. Number of microRNAs have been predicted to regulate TMPRSS2 and BSG expression levels, but none of them is enriched in lung or respiratory tract cells. Several well studied drugs can downregulate the expression of TMPRSS2 in human cells, including Acetaminophen (Paracetamol) and Curcumin. Thus TMPRSS2 interaction with the SARS-CoV-2, its structural variability, gene-gene interactions, and expression regulation profiles, and pharmacogenomics properties characterize this gene as a potential target for COVID-19 therapy.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aleksei Zarubin","author_inst":"Research Institute for Medical Genetics, Tomsk National Medical Research Center"},{"author_name":"Vadim Stepanov","author_inst":"Research Institute for Medical Genetics, Tomsk National Medical Research Center"},{"author_name":"Anton Markov","author_inst":"Research Institute for Medical Genetics, Tomsk National Medical Research Center"},{"author_name":"Nikita Kolesnikov","author_inst":"Research Institute for Medical Genetics, Tomsk National Medical Research Center"},{"author_name":"Andrey Marusin","author_inst":"Research Institute for Medical Genetics, Tomsk National Medical Research Center"},{"author_name":"Irina Khitrinskaya","author_inst":"Research Institute for Medical Genetics, Tomsk National Medical Research Center"},{"author_name":"Maria Swarovskaya","author_inst":"Research Institute for Medical Genetics, Tomsk National Medical Research Center"},{"author_name":"Sergey Litvinov","author_inst":"Institute of Biochemistry and Genetics, Ufa Federal Research Centre of the Russian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Natalia Ekomasova","author_inst":"Institute of Biochemistry and Genetics, Ufa Federal Research Centre of the Russian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Murat Dzhaubermezov","author_inst":"Institute of Biochemistry and Genetics, Ufa Federal Research Centre of the Russian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Nadezhda Maksimova","author_inst":"North-Eastern Federal University"},{"author_name":"Aitalina Sukhomyasova","author_inst":"North-Eastern Federal University"},{"author_name":"Olga Shtygasheva","author_inst":"Katanov State University of Khakassia"},{"author_name":"Elza Khusnutdinova","author_inst":"Institute of Biochemistry and Genetics, Ufa Federal Research Centre of the Russian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Magomed Radjabov","author_inst":"Dagestan State Medical University"},{"author_name":"Vladimir Kharkov","author_inst":"Research Institute for Medical Genetics, Tomsk National Medical Research Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.19.159970","rel_title":"Rapid Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 by Silicon Nitride, Copper, and Aluminum Nitride","rel_date":"2020-06-20","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.19.159970","rel_abs":"IntroductionViral disease spread by contaminated commonly touched surfaces is a global concern. Silicon nitride, an industrial ceramic that is also used as an implant in spine surgery, has known antibacterial activity. The mechanism of antibacterial action relates to the hydrolytic release of surface disinfectants. It is hypothesized that silicon nitride can also inactivate the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.\n\nMethodsSARS-CoV-2 virions were exposed to 15 wt.% aqueous suspensions of silicon nitride, aluminum nitride, and copper particles. The virus was titrated by the TCD50 method using VeroE6\/TMPRSS2 cells, while viral RNA was evaluated by real-time RT-PCR. Immunostaining and Raman spectroscopy were used as additional probes to investigate the cellular responses to virions exposed to the respective materials.\n\nResultsAll three tested materials showed >99% viral inactivation at one and ten minutes of exposure. Degradation of viral RNA was also observed with all materials. Immunofluorescence testing showed that silicon nitride-treated virus failed to infect VeroE6\/TMPRSS2 cells without damaging them. In contrast, the copper-treated virus suspension severely damaged the cells due to copper ion toxicity. Raman spectroscopy indicated differential biochemical cellular changes due to infection and metal toxicity for two of the three materials tested.\n\nConclusionsSilicon nitride successfully inactivated the SARS-CoV-2 in this study. The mechanism of action was the hydrolysis-mediated surface release of nitrogen-containing disinfectants. Both aluminum nitride and copper were also effective in the inactivation of the virus. However, while the former compound affected the cells, the latter compound had a cytopathic effect. Further studies are needed to validate these findings and investigate whether silicon nitride can be incorporated into personal protective equipment and commonly touched surfaces, as a strategy to discourage viral persistence and disease spread.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giuseppe Pezzotti","author_inst":"Ceramic Physics Laboratory, Materials Science Division, Kyoto Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Eriko Ohgitani","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Masaharu Shin-Ya","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tetsuya Adachi","author_inst":"Department of Dental Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Elia Marin","author_inst":"Ceramic Physics Laboratory, Materials Science Division, Kyoto Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Francesco Boschetto","author_inst":"Department of Dental Medicine, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Wenliang Zhu","author_inst":"Ceramic Physics Laboratory, Materials Science Division, Kyoto Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Osam Mazda","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Natalia Ekomasova","author_inst":"Institute of Biochemistry and Genetics, Ufa Federal Research Centre of the Russian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Murat Dzhaubermezov","author_inst":"Institute of Biochemistry and Genetics, Ufa Federal Research Centre of the Russian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Nadezhda Maksimova","author_inst":"North-Eastern Federal University"},{"author_name":"Aitalina Sukhomyasova","author_inst":"North-Eastern Federal University"},{"author_name":"Olga Shtygasheva","author_inst":"Katanov State University of Khakassia"},{"author_name":"Elza Khusnutdinova","author_inst":"Institute of Biochemistry and Genetics, Ufa Federal Research Centre of the Russian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Magomed Radjabov","author_inst":"Dagestan State Medical University"},{"author_name":"Vladimir Kharkov","author_inst":"Research Institute for Medical Genetics, Tomsk National Medical Research Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.19.154930","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 growth, furin-cleavage-site adaptation and neutralization using serum from acutely infected, hospitalized COVID-19 patients","rel_date":"2020-06-20","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.19.154930","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, emerged at the end of 2019 and by mid-June 2020, the virus has spread to at least 215 countries, caused more than 8,000,000 confirmed infections and over 450,000 deaths, and overwhelmed healthcare systems worldwide. Like SARS-CoV, which emerged in 2002 and caused a similar disease, SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus. Both viruses use human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) as a receptor to enter cells. However, the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein has a novel insertion that generates a putative furin cleavage signal and this has been postulated to expand the host range. Two low passage (P) strains of SARS-CoV-2 (Wash1: P4 and Munich: P1) were cultured twice in Vero-E6 cells and characterized virologically. Sanger and MinION sequencing demonstrated significant deletions in the furin cleavage signal of Wash1: P6 and minor variants in the Munich: P3 strain. Cleavage of the S glycoprotein in SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero-E6 cell lysates was inefficient even when an intact furin cleavage signal was present. Indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated the S glycoprotein reached the cell surface. Since the S protein is a major antigenic target for the development of neutralizing antibodies we investigated the development of neutralizing antibody titers in serial serum samples obtained from COVID-19 human patients. These were comparable regardless of the presence of an intact or deleted furin cleavage signal. These studies illustrate the need to characterize virus stocks meticulously prior to performing either in vitro or in vivo pathogenesis studies.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"William B Klimstra","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Natasha L Tilston-Lunel","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Sham Nambulli","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"James Boslett","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Cynthia M McMillen","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Theron Gilliland","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Matthew D Dunn","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Chengun Sun","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Sarah E Wheeler","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Alan Wells","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Amy L Hartman","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Anita K McElroy","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Douglas S Reed","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Linda J Rennick","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"W.

Methods Between February 22 and May 21, 2020, we conducted a case-control study at S. Anna hospital, Torino, among first trimester pregnant women, paired for last menstruation. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was compared between women with spontaneous abortion (case group, n=100) and those with ongoing pregnancy (control group, n=125). Current or past infection was determined by detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharingeal swab and SARS-CoV-2 IgG\/IgM antibodies in blood sample. Patient demographics, COVID-19-related symptoms, and the main risk factors for abortion were collected. Findings Twenty-three (10.2%) of the 225 women tested positive for COVID-19 infection. There was no difference in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 between the cases (11\/100, 11%) and the controls (12\/125, 9.6%) (p=0.73). Logistic regression analysis confirmed that COVID-19 was not an independent predictor of abortion (1.28 confidence interval 0.53-3.08).

SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic assays play a central role in diagnosis and have fixed technical performance metrics. Interpretation becomes challenging because the clinical sensitivity changes as the virus clears and the immune response emerges. Our goal was to examine the clinical sensitivity of two most common SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test modalities, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serology, over the disease course to provide insight into their clinical interpretation in patients presenting to the hospital. Methods: A single-center, retrospective study. To derive clinical sensitivity of PCR, we identified 209 PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 patients with multiple PCR test results (624 total PCR tests) and calculated daily sensitivity from date of symptom onset or first positive test. To calculate daily clinical sensitivity by serology, we utilized 157 PCR-positive patients with a total of 197 specimens tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for IgM, IgG, and IgA anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Results: Clinical sensitivity of PCR decreased with days post symptom onset with >90% clinical sensitivity during the first 5 days after symptom onset, 70-71% from days 9-11, and 30% at day 21. In contrast, serological sensitivity increased with days post symptom onset with >50% of patients seropositive by at least one antibody isotype after day 7, >80% after day 12, and 100% by day 21. Conclusion: PCR and serology are complimentary modalities that require time-dependent interpretation. Superimposition of sensitivities over time indicate that serology can function as a reliable diagnostic aid indicating recent or prior infection.","rel_num_authors":36,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tyler E Miller","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wilfredo F.

Earlier reports have suggested that COVID-19 agents can be present in the fecal and sewage samples and thus it can be a good indication of the pandemic extent in a community. However, no such studies have been reported in the Indian context so far. Since, several factors like local population physiology, the climatic conditions, sewage composition, and processing of samples could possibly affect the detection of the viral genome, it becomes absolutely necessary to check for the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 in the wastewater samples from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) serving different localities of Jaipur city, which has been under red zone (pandemic hotspots) since early April 2020. Samples from different local municipal WWTPs and hospital wastewater samples were collected and wastewater based epidemiology (WBE) studies for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 were carried out using the RT-PCR technique to confirm the presence of different COVID-19 target genes namely S gene, E gene, ORF1ab gene, RdRp gene and N gene in the viral load of wastewater samples. In the present study, the untreated wastewater samples from the municipal WWTPs and hospital wastewater samples showed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral genome, which was correlated with the increased number of COVID-19 positive patients from the concerned areas, as per reported in the publically available health data. This is the first study that investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral genome in wastewater, at higher ambient temperature (above 40{degrees}C), further validating WBE as a potential tool in predicting and mitigating outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sudipti Arora","author_inst":"Dr. B.

Scrutiny of COVID-19 mortality in Belgium over the period 8 March-9 May 2020 (Weeks 11-19), using number of deaths per million, infection fatality rates, and the relation between COVID-19 mortality and excess death rates. Data. Publicly available COVID-19 mortality (2020); overall mortality (2009-2020) data in Belgium and demographic data on the Belgian population; data on the nursing home population; results of repeated sero-prevalence surveys in March-April 2020. Statistical methods. Reweighing, missing-data handling, rate estimation, visualization. Results. Belgium has virtually no discrepancy between COVID-19 reported mortality (confirmed and possible cases) and excess mortality. There is a sharp excess death peak over the study period; the total number of excess deaths makes April 2020 the deadliest month of April since WWII, with excess deaths far larger than in early 2017 or 2018, even though influenza-induced January 1951 and February 1960 number of excess deaths were similar in magnitude. Using various sero-prevalence estimates, infection fatality rates (IFRs; fraction of deaths among infected cases) are estimated at 0.38-0.73% for males and 0.20-0.39% for females in the non-nursing home population (non-NHP), and at 0.79-1.52% for males and 0.88-1.31% for females in the entire population. Estimates for the NHP range from 38 to 73% for males and over 22 to 37% for females. The IFRs rise from nearly 0% under 45 years, to 4.3% and 13.2% for males in the non-NHP and the general population, respectively, and to 1.5% and 11.1% for females in the non-NHP and general population, respectively. The IFR and number of deaths per million is strongly influenced by extensive reporting and the fact that 66.0% of the deaths concerned NH residents. At 764 (our re-estimation of the figure 735, presented by \"Our World in Data\"), the number of COVID-19 deaths per million led the international ranking on May 9, 2020, but drops to 262 in the non-NHP. The NHP is very specific: age-related increased risk; highly prevalent comorbidities that, while non-fatal in themselves, exacerbate COVID-19; larger collective households that share inadvertent vectors such as caregivers and favor clustered outbreaks; initial lack of protective equipment, etc. High-quality health care countries have a relatively older but also more frail population [1], which is likely to contribute to this result.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Geert Molenberghs","author_inst":"Universiteit Hasselt and KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Christel Faes","author_inst":"Universiteit Hasselt"},{"author_name":"Jan Aerts","author_inst":"Universiteit Hasselt"},{"author_name":"Heidi Theeten","author_inst":"Universiteit Antwerpen"},{"author_name":"Brecht Devleesschauwer","author_inst":"Sciensano"},{"author_name":"Natalia Bustos Sierra","author_inst":"Sciensano"},{"author_name":"Toon Braeye","author_inst":"Sciensano"},{"author_name":"Francoise Renard","author_inst":"Sciensano"},{"author_name":"Sereina Herzog","author_inst":"Universiteit Antwerpen"},{"author_name":"Patrick Lusyne","author_inst":"Statistics Belgium"},{"author_name":"Johan Van der Heyden","author_inst":"Sciensano"},{"author_name":"Herman Van Oyen","author_inst":"Sciensano"},{"author_name":"Pierre Van Damme","author_inst":"Universiteit Antwerpen"},{"author_name":"Niel Hens","author_inst":"Hasselt University and University of Antwerp"},{"author_name":"Timothy M.

Study design Cross sectional analyses of UKHLS COVID-19 wave data collected in April 2020. Methods UKHLS participants completed a COVID-19 questionnaire in April 2020. 635 children who were FSM eligible with complete data were included in the analytic sample. Accessing a FSM was defined as having receiving a FSM voucher or a cooked meal at school. Multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate (i) associations between characteristics and access to FSM and (ii) associations between access to FSM and household food insecurity measures. All analyses accounted for survey design and sample weights. Results 51% of eligible children accessed a FSM. Children in junior schools or above (aged 8+ years) (OR 11.81; 95% CI 5.54,25.19), who were low income (AOR 4.81; 95% CI 2.10,11.03) or still attending schools (AOR 5.87; 95% CI 1.70,20.25) were more likely to receive FSM. Children in Wales were less likely to access FSM than those in England (AOR 0.11; 95% CI 0.03,0.43). Receiving a FSM was associated with an increased odds of recently using a food bank, but not reporting feeling hungry. Conclusions In the month following the COVID-19 lockdown, 49% of eligible children did not receive any form of FSM. The present analyses highlight that the voucher scheme did not adequately serve children who could not attend school during the lockdown. Moreover, more needs to be done to support families relying on income-related benefits, who still report needed to access a foodbank. As scheme may be continued in summer or in second wave, large improvements will be needed to improve its reach.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jennie C Parnham","author_inst":"Public Health Policy Evaluation Unit, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Anthony A Laverty","author_inst":"Public Health Policy Evaluation Unit, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Azeem Majeed","author_inst":"Department of Primary Care and Public Health, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Eszter P Vamos","author_inst":"Public Health Policy Evaluation Unit, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Guillem Lop\u00e9z Casasnovas","author_inst":"Center for Research in Health and Economics - Universitat Pompeu Fabra"},{"author_name":"Catia Nicodemo","author_inst":"Centre of Organisation, Department of Primary Economics, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tim Riffe","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research"},{"author_name":"Francoise Renard","author_inst":"Sciensano"},{"author_name":"Sereina Herzog","author_inst":"Universiteit Antwerpen"},{"author_name":"Patrick Lusyne","author_inst":"Statistics Belgium"},{"author_name":"Johan Van der Heyden","author_inst":"Sciensano"},{"author_name":"Herman Van Oyen","author_inst":"Sciensano"},{"author_name":"Pierre Van Damme","author_inst":"Universiteit Antwerpen"},{"author_name":"Niel Hens","author_inst":"Hasselt University and University of Antwerp"},{"author_name":"Timothy M.

The outbreak of COVID-19 may differentially exacerbate anxiety and stress in people subjected to the real or perceived threat of the virus. Method: An online cross-sectional survey was carried out to assess the general population's immediate psychological response during the initial state of the outbreak in Saudi Arabia. The study used brief screening tools PHQ-4 for anxiety-depression symptoms and IES-6 for posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. Results: Among the 584 respondents, 19.8% and 22.0% reported moderate to severe anxiety and depression symptoms respectively. According to the combined PHQ-4 score, 14.5% of participants showed moderate to severe anxiety or depression disorder. Overall, 64.8% met the level of clinical concern for posttraumatic stress disorder and 51.3% met the level of probable posttraumatic stress disorder diagnosis. Multivariate analyses showed that females, non-Saudi nationalities, and those who had a history of mental illness were more vulnerable to anxiety and depression disorders than their counterparts, whereas a higher prevalence of distress symptoms was reported among those who prefer Arabic over English for communication. It was found that people whose colleagues or family infected with the disease were more likely to report moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety or depression and distress. The study further showed that the higher the perceived threat, the higher the chances of exhibiting anxiety-depressive disorder symptoms and distress symptoms. Conclusion: The findings might be a matter for serious concern, and considerable attention is required from authorities and policymakers regarding early detection and treatment of these illnesses in order to reduce the burden of the pandemic related mental illness.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Royes Joseph","author_inst":"College of Clinical Pharmacy, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University"},{"author_name":"Dhfer Alshayban","author_inst":"College of Clinical Pharmacy, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University"},{"author_name":"Jisha M Lucca","author_inst":"College of Clinical Pharmacy, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University"},{"author_name":"Yasir Abdulaziz Alshehry","author_inst":"College of Clinical Pharmacy, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University"},{"author_name":"Guillem Lop\u00e9z Casasnovas","author_inst":"Center for Research in Health and Economics - Universitat Pompeu Fabra"},{"author_name":"Catia Nicodemo","author_inst":"Centre of Organisation, Department of Primary Economics, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tim Riffe","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research"},{"author_name":"Francoise Renard","author_inst":"Sciensano"},{"author_name":"Sereina Herzog","author_inst":"Universiteit Antwerpen"},{"author_name":"Patrick Lusyne","author_inst":"Statistics Belgium"},{"author_name":"Johan Van der Heyden","author_inst":"Sciensano"},{"author_name":"Herman Van Oyen","author_inst":"Sciensano"},{"author_name":"Pierre Van Damme","author_inst":"Universiteit Antwerpen"},{"author_name":"Niel Hens","author_inst":"Hasselt University and University of Antwerp"},{"author_name":"Timothy M.

Methods: We conducted cohort studies on two groups of people (COPD and asthma) using the OpenSAFELY platform to analyse data from primary care practices linked to national death registrations. People receiving an ICS were compared to those receiving alternative respiratory medications. Our primary outcome was COVID-19 related death. Findings: We identified 148,588 people with COPD and 817,973 people with asthma receiving relevant respiratory medications in the four months prior to 01 March 2020. People with COPD receiving ICS were at a greater risk of COVID-19 related death compared to those receiving a long-acting beta agonist (LABA) and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) (adjusted HR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.08 - 1.75). People with asthma receiving high dose ICS were at an increased risk of death compared to those receiving a short-acting beta agonist (SABA) only (adjusted HR = 1.52, 95%CI = 1.08 - 2.14); the adjusted HR for those receiving low-medium dose ICS was 1.10 (95% CI = 0.82 - 1.49). Quantitative bias analyses indicated that an unmeasured confounder of only moderate strength of association with exposure and outcome could explain the observed associations in both populations. Interpretation: These results do not support a major role of ICS in protecting against COVID-19 related deaths. Observed increased risks of COVID-19 related death among people with COPD and asthma receiving ICS can be plausibly explained by unmeasured confounding due to disease severity.","rel_num_authors":33,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"- The OpenSAFELY Collaborative","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Anna Schultze","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alex J Walker","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Brian MacKenna","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Caroline E Morton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Krishnan Bhaskaran","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jeremy P Brown","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher T.

Identification of the cellular response mechanisms to viral infection by SARS-CoV-2 may shed light on progress of the disease, indicate potential drug targets, and make design of new test methods possible.\n\nIn this study, we analysed transcriptomic response of normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) to SARS-CoV-2 infection and compared the response to H1N1 infection. Comparison of transcriptome of NHBE cells 24 hours after mock-infection and SARS-CoV-2 infection demonstrated that most genes that respond to infection were upregulated (320 genes) rather than being downregulated (115 genes).While upregulated genes were enriched in signalling pathways related to virus response, downregulated genes are related to kidney development. We mapped the upregulated genes on KEGG pathways to identify the mechanisms that mediate the response. We identified canonical NF{kappa}B, TNF and IL-17 pathways to be significantly upregulated and to converge to NF{kappa}B pathway via positive feedback loops. Although virus entry protein ACE2 has low expression in NHBE cells, pathogen response pathways are strongly activated within 24 hours of infection. Our results also indicate that immune response system is activated at the early stage of the infection and orchestrated by a crosstalk of signalling pathways. Finally, we compared transcriptomic SARS-CoV-2 response to H1N1 response in NHBE cells to elucidate the virus specificity of the response and virus specific extracellular proteins expressed by NHBE cells.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Enes Ak","author_inst":"Gebze Technical University"},{"author_name":"Pinar Pir","author_inst":"Gebze Technical University"},{"author_name":"Alex J Walker","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Brian MacKenna","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Caroline E Morton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Krishnan Bhaskaran","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jeremy P Brown","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher T.

The current study focuses on understanding the population specific variations attributing its high rate of infections in specific geographical regions which may help in developing appropriate treatment strategies for COVID-19 pandemic. Rigorous phylogenetic network analysis of 245 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes inferred five central clades named a (ancestral), b, c, d and e (subtype e1 & e2) showing both divergent and linear evolution types. The clade d & e2 were found exclusively comprising of USA strains with highest known mutations. Clades were distinguished by ten co-mutational combinations in proteins; Nsp3, ORF8, Nsp13, S, Nsp12, Nsp2 and Nsp6 generated by Amino Acid Variations (AAV). Our analysis revealed that only 67.46 % of SNP mutations were carried by amino acid at phenotypic level. T1103P mutation in Nsp3 was predicted to increase the protein stability in 238 strains except six strains which were marked as ancestral type; whereas com (P5731L & Y5768C) in Nsp13 were found in 64 genomes of USA highlighting its 100% co-occurrence. Docking study highlighted mutation (D7611G) caused reduction in binding of Spike proteins with ACE2, but it also showed better interaction with TMPRSS2 receptor which may contribute to its high transmissibility in USA strains. In addition, we found host proteins, MYO5A, MYO5B & MYO5C had maximum interaction with viral hub proteins (Nucleocapsid, Spike & Membrane). Thus, blocking the internalization pathway by inhibiting MYO-5 proteins which could be an effective target for COVID-19 treatment. The functional annotations of the Host-Pathogen Interaction (HPI) network were found to be highly associated with hypoxia and thrombotic conditions confirming the vulnerability and severity of infection in the patients. We also considered the presence of CpG islands in Nsp1 and N proteins which may confers the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to enter and trigger methyltransferase activity inside host cell.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vipin Gupta","author_inst":"PHIXGEN PVT.

Background: COVID-19 has had widespread implications for primary healthcare nurses. Supporting these nurses' capacity to deliver quality care ensures that ongoing health needs can be met. Methods: Primary healthcare nurses were recruited to an online survey via social media and professional organisations in April 2020. Results: Six-hundred and thirty-seven responses were included in analysis. Participants provided 1213 statements about perceived supports required to provide quality clinical care. From these, seven key categories emerged, namely; personal protective equipment, communication, funding, industrial issues, self-care, workplace factors and valuing nurses. Conclusion: A number of key issues relating to personal health and safety, care quality, and job security need to be addressed to support primary healthcare nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Addressing these support issues can assist in retaining nurses and optimising the role of primary healthcare nurses during a pandemic. Implications for nursing management: Responding to the needs of primary healthcare nurses has the potential to facilitate their role in providing community-based healthcare. This knowledge can guide the provision of support for primary healthcare nurses during the current pandemic, as well as informing planning for future health crises.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elizabeth Halcomb","author_inst":"University of Wollongong"},{"author_name":"Anna Williams","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame, Sydney"},{"author_name":"Christine Ashley","author_inst":"University of Wollongong"},{"author_name":"Susan McInnes","author_inst":"University of Wollongong"},{"author_name":"Catherine Stephen","author_inst":"University of Wollongong"},{"author_name":"Kaara Ray Calma","author_inst":"University of Wollongong"},{"author_name":"Sharon James","author_inst":"University of Wollongong"},{"author_name":"Roshan Kumar","author_inst":"Magadh University, Bodh Gaya, Bihar"},{"author_name":"Utkarsh Sood","author_inst":"The Energy and Resources Institute"},{"author_name":"Princy Hira","author_inst":"Maitreyi College, University of Delhi."},{"author_name":"Shiva Satija","author_inst":"Sri Venkateswara College, University of Delhi"},{"author_name":"Rup Lal","author_inst":"The Energy and Resources Institute"},{"author_name":"William J Hulme","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Chris Bates","author_inst":"TPP"},{"author_name":"Helen J Curtis","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Amir Mehrkar","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David Evans","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter Inglesby","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Cockburn","author_inst":"TPP"},{"author_name":"Helen I McDonald","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, NIHR Health Protection Research Unit (HPRU) in Immunisation"},{"author_name":"Laurie Tomlinson","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rohini Mathur","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kevin Wing","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Angel YS Wong","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Harriet Forbes","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Parry","author_inst":"TPP"},{"author_name":"Frank Hester","author_inst":"TPP"},{"author_name":"Sam Harper","author_inst":"TPP"},{"author_name":"Stephen JW Evans","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Quint","author_inst":"National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Liam Smeeth","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ian J Douglas","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ben Goldacre","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"A.

However, researchers have no way to describe how these quantitative traits relate to phenotype concepts in a machine-readable manner. Using the WHO clinical case report form standard for the COVID-19 pandemic, we modeled quantitative traits and developed OWL axioms to formally relate clinical measurement terms with anatomical, biomolecular entities and phenotypes annotated with the Uber-anatomy ontology (Uberon), Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) and the Phenotype and Trait Ontology (PATO) biomedical ontologies. The formal description of these relations allows interoperability between clinical and biological descriptions, and facilitates automated reasoning for analysis of patterns over quantitative and qualitative biomedical observations.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nuria Queralt-Rosinach","author_inst":"Leids Universitair Medisch Centrum"},{"author_name":"Susan Bello","author_inst":"The Jackson Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Robert Hoehndorf","author_inst":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Claus Weiland","author_inst":"Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Philippe Rocca-Serra","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Paul N Schofield","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"David Melzer","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Roshan Kumar","author_inst":"Magadh University, Bodh Gaya, Bihar"},{"author_name":"Utkarsh Sood","author_inst":"The Energy and Resources Institute"},{"author_name":"Princy Hira","author_inst":"Maitreyi College, University of Delhi."},{"author_name":"Shiva Satija","author_inst":"Sri Venkateswara College, University of Delhi"},{"author_name":"Rup Lal","author_inst":"The Energy and Resources Institute"},{"author_name":"William J Hulme","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Chris Bates","author_inst":"TPP"},{"author_name":"Helen J Curtis","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Amir Mehrkar","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David Evans","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter Inglesby","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Cockburn","author_inst":"TPP"},{"author_name":"Helen I McDonald","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, NIHR Health Protection Research Unit (HPRU) in Immunisation"},{"author_name":"Laurie Tomlinson","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rohini Mathur","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kevin Wing","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Angel YS Wong","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Harriet Forbes","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Parry","author_inst":"TPP"},{"author_name":"Frank Hester","author_inst":"TPP"},{"author_name":"Sam Harper","author_inst":"TPP"},{"author_name":"Stephen JW Evans","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Quint","author_inst":"National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Liam Smeeth","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ian J Douglas","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ben Goldacre","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"A.

Aim: To analyse the SARS CoV-2 nucleic acid RT-PCR profiles in COVID-19 patients. Design: It was a retrospective, observational study conducted at COVID facilities under AIIMS, New Delhi. Methods : Patients admitted with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 were eligible for enrolment. Patients with incomplete details, or only single PCR tests were excluded. Data regarding demographic details, comorbidities, treatment received and results of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR performed on nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, collected at different time points, was retrieved from the hospital records. Results : 298 patients were included, majority were males (75.8%) with mean age of 39.07 years (0.6-88 years). The mean duration from symptom onset to first positive RT-PCR was 4.7 days (SD 3.67), while that of symptom onset to last positive test was 17.83 days (SD 6.22). Proportions of positive RT-PCR tests were 100%, 49%, 24%, 8.7% and 20.6% in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th & >4 weeks of illness. 12 symptomatic patients had prolonged positive test results even after 3 weeks of symptom onset. Age >= 60 years was associated with prolonged RT-PCR positivity (statistically significant). Conclusion : This study showed that the average period of PCR positivity is more than 2 weeks in COVID-19 patients; elderly patients have prolonged duration of RT-PCR positivity and requires further follow up.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"bisakh bhattacharya","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Rohit Kumar","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Dr. Ved prakash Meena","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Manish Soneja","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Saurabh Vig","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Vandana Rastogi","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Sushma Bhatnagar","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anant Mohan","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Naveet Wig","author_inst":"AIIMS, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Princy Hira","author_inst":"Maitreyi College, University of Delhi."},{"author_name":"Shiva Satija","author_inst":"Sri Venkateswara College, University of Delhi"},{"author_name":"Rup Lal","author_inst":"The Energy and Resources Institute"},{"author_name":"William J Hulme","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Chris Bates","author_inst":"TPP"},{"author_name":"Helen J Curtis","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Amir Mehrkar","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David Evans","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter Inglesby","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Cockburn","author_inst":"TPP"},{"author_name":"Helen I McDonald","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, NIHR Health Protection Research Unit (HPRU) in Immunisation"},{"author_name":"Laurie Tomlinson","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rohini Mathur","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kevin Wing","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Angel YS Wong","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Harriet Forbes","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Parry","author_inst":"TPP"},{"author_name":"Frank Hester","author_inst":"TPP"},{"author_name":"Sam Harper","author_inst":"TPP"},{"author_name":"Stephen JW Evans","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Quint","author_inst":"National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Liam Smeeth","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ian J Douglas","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ben Goldacre","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"A.

We aimed to describe the diagnosed COVID-19 cases and to estimate the symptomatic and asymptomatic suspected cases among individuals with pre-existing myocardial infarction myocardial infarction and their relatives in lockdown period. Methods: We conducted a two-week cross-sectional telephone survey, from May 4 to May 15, 2020, including all households with at least one individual with pre-existing cardiovascular disease in the past two years. We defined a suspected COVID-19 case when living with at least one individual tested positive to COVID-19, or when an individual has been in contact with a suspected or confirmed case since the March 1rst, or when a relative from the same house has been hospitalized or deceased for COVID-19. Results: We observed high rates of compliance with health measures during the lockdown period, regardless of age or risk factors. Among individuals with myocardial infarction history, two were COVID-19 confirmed, 13.37% were suspected (94\/703) of whom 70.21% (66\/94) asymptomatic. Conclusions: Individuals with myocardial infarction history presented different symptoms association with more respiratory signs. This population, which is older and associated with more comorbidities, is exposed to a high risk of complication in the event of contamination.

As of June 19, 2020, there have been no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Iwate, a prefecture of Japan. Here, we analyzed the excess deaths as well as the number of patients and medical earnings due to the pandemic from prefectural hospitals located in Iwate. From January to March 2020, the excess death rates per month were not significantly higher than the past-year average. Compared to January 2020, the numbers of both outpatients and inpatients in April 2020 showed a 5.2% and 6.1% decrease, respectively. Accordingly, the amount of medical earnings of both outpatients and inpatients in April 2020 showed a 3.0% and 6.3% decrease, respectively. Present analysis demonstrated that there were no excess deaths due to \"unidentified\" COVID-19 infections in Iwate; however, hospital budgetary management has been affected by the emergency declaration. Regardless of COVID-19 infection spread, it may be difficult to maintain daily medical services if such low service activity continues in the existing hospitals. Additional longitudinal studies will be necessary to evaluate the effects of social restrictions on hospital management, but the true demand of regional medical services may emerge after this outbreak.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Noriyuki Sasaki","author_inst":"Iwate Medical University"},{"author_name":"Satoshi S Nishizuka","author_inst":"Iwate Medical University"},{"author_name":"Clement Claustre","author_inst":"RESCUe-RESUVal"},{"author_name":"Mikael Martinez","author_inst":"CH Montbrison"},{"author_name":"Abdesslam Redjaline","author_inst":"REULIAN"},{"author_name":"Patrice Serre","author_inst":"RESCUe-RESUVal"},{"author_name":"Thomas Bochaton","author_inst":"Hopital Cardiologique, Hospices Civils de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Carlos El Khoury","author_inst":"RESCUe-RESUVal"},{"author_name":"- the RESCUe-RESUVal team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Princy Hira","author_inst":"Maitreyi College, University of Delhi."},{"author_name":"Shiva Satija","author_inst":"Sri Venkateswara College, University of Delhi"},{"author_name":"Rup Lal","author_inst":"The Energy and Resources Institute"},{"author_name":"William J Hulme","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Chris Bates","author_inst":"TPP"},{"author_name":"Helen J Curtis","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Amir Mehrkar","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David Evans","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter Inglesby","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Cockburn","author_inst":"TPP"},{"author_name":"Helen I McDonald","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, NIHR Health Protection Research Unit (HPRU) in Immunisation"},{"author_name":"Laurie Tomlinson","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rohini Mathur","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kevin Wing","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Angel YS Wong","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Harriet Forbes","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Parry","author_inst":"TPP"},{"author_name":"Frank Hester","author_inst":"TPP"},{"author_name":"Sam Harper","author_inst":"TPP"},{"author_name":"Stephen JW Evans","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Quint","author_inst":"National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Liam Smeeth","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ian J Douglas","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ben Goldacre","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"A.

Methods: We searched Medline, Embase and Web of Science for case-series and observational studies of hospitalized COVID-19 patients through May 22, 2020. Data were analyzed by fixed-effects meta-analysis, using Shore adjusted confidence intervals to address heterogeneity. Results: Forty-four studies comprising 20594 hospitalized patients met inclusion criteria; 12591 from the US-Europe and 7885 from China. Pooled prevalence of death [%(95% CI)] was 18% (15-22%). Of those that died, 76% were aged>=60 years, 68% were males, and 63%, 38%, and 29% had hypertension, diabetes and heart disease, respectively. The case fatality risk [%(95% CI)] were 62% (48-78) for heart disease, 51% (36-71) for COPD, and 42% (34-50) for age>=60 years and 49% (33-71) for chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Methods: All URT RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 in NHS Lothian, Scotland, United Kingdom between the 7th of February and 19th April 2020 (inclusive) was reviewed, and hospitalised patients were identified. All URT RT-PCR tests were analysed for each patient to determine the sequence of negative and positive results. For those who were tested twice or more but never received a positive result, case records were reviewed, and a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 allocated based on clinical features, discharge diagnosis, and radiology and haematology results. For those who had negative URT RT-PCR tests but a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, respiratory samples were retested using a multiplex respiratory panel, a second SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay, and a human RNase P control. Results: Compared to the gold standard of a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, the sensitivity of an initial URT RT-PCR for COVID-19 was 82.2% (95% confidence interval 79.0-85.1%). Two consecutive URT RT-PCR tests increased sensitivity to 90.6% (CI 88.0-92.7%). A further 2.2% and 0.9% of patients who received a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 were positive on a third and fourth test. Conclusions: The sensitivity of a single RT-PCR test of an URT sample in hospitalised patients is 82.2%. Sensitivity increases to 90.6% when patients are tested twice. A proportion of cases with clinically defined COVID-19 never test positive on URT RT-PCR despite repeated testing.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas C Williams","author_inst":"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh, UK"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Wastnedge","author_inst":"Clinical Microbiology & Virology, Directorate of Laboratory Medicine, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, NHS Lothian, Edinburgh, UK"},{"author_name":"Gina McAllister","author_inst":"Clinical Microbiology & Virology, Directorate of Laboratory Medicine, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, NHS Lothian, Edinburgh, UK"},{"author_name":"Ramya Bhatia","author_inst":"Clinical Microbiology & Virology, Directorate of Laboratory Medicine, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, NHS Lothian, Edinburgh, UK"},{"author_name":"Kate Cuschieri","author_inst":"Clinical Microbiology & Virology, Directorate of Laboratory Medicine, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, NHS Lothian, Edinburgh, UK"},{"author_name":"Kallirroi Kefala","author_inst":"Edinburgh Critical Care Research Group, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"},{"author_name":"Fiona J Hamilton","author_inst":"Clinical Microbiology & Virology, Directorate of Laboratory Medicine, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, NHS Lothian, Edinburgh, UK"},{"author_name":"Ingolfur Johannessen","author_inst":"Clinical Microbiology & Virology, Directorate of Laboratory Medicine, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, NHS Lothian, Edinburgh, UK"},{"author_name":"Ian F Laurenson","author_inst":"Clinical Microbiology & Virology, Directorate of Laboratory Medicine, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, NHS Lothian, Edinburgh, UK"},{"author_name":"Jill Shepherd","author_inst":"Clinical Microbiology & Virology, Directorate of Laboratory Medicine, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, NHS Lothian, Edinburgh, UK"},{"author_name":"Alistair Stewart","author_inst":"eHealth Directorate, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, NHS Lothian, Edinburgh, UK"},{"author_name":"Donal Waters","author_inst":"Clinical Microbiology & Virology, Directorate of Laboratory Medicine, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, NHS Lothian, Edinburgh, UK"},{"author_name":"Helen Wise","author_inst":"Blood Sciences, Directorate of Laboratory Medicine, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, NHS Lothian, Edinburgh, UK"},{"author_name":"Kate Templeton","author_inst":"Clinical Microbiology & Virology, Directorate of Laboratory Medicine, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, NHS Lothian, Edinburgh, UK"},{"author_name":"Woei Shyang Loh","author_inst":"National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Kwok Seng Loh","author_inst":"National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Vincent TK Chow","author_inst":"National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"De Yun Wang","author_inst":"National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Jerry YH Fuh","author_inst":"National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Ching-Chiuan Yen","author_inst":"National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"John EL Wong","author_inst":"National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"David M Allen","author_inst":"National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Kevin Wing","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Angel YS Wong","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Harriet Forbes","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Parry","author_inst":"TPP"},{"author_name":"Frank Hester","author_inst":"TPP"},{"author_name":"Sam Harper","author_inst":"TPP"},{"author_name":"Stephen JW Evans","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Quint","author_inst":"National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Liam Smeeth","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ian J Douglas","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ben Goldacre","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"A.
