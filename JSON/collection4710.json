In this study focusing on IgG antibodies, we compare reliability of three chemiluminescent (CLIA) and two enzyme linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assays. Methods: Sera from a total of 271 subjects, including 64 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients were tested for specific Ab using Maglumi (Snibe), Liaison (Diasorin), iFlash (Yhlo), Euroimmun (Medizinische Labordiagnostika AG) and Wantai (Wantai Biological Pharmacy) assays. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios were evaluated using manufacturers' and optimized thresholds. Results: Optimized thresholds (Maglumi 2 kAU\/L, Liaison 6.2 kAU\/L and iFlash 15.0 kAU\/L) allowed us to achieve a negative likelihood ratio and an accuracy of: 0.06 and 93.5% for Maglumi; 0.03 and 93.1% for Liaison; 0.03 and 91% for iFlash. Diagnostic sensitivities and specificities were above 93.8% and 85.9%, respectively for all CLIA assays. Overall agreement was 90.3% (Cohen's kappa = 0.805 and SE = 0.041) for CLIA, and 98.4% (Cohen's kappa = 0.962 and SE = 0.126) for ELISA. Conclusions: The results obtained indicate that, for CLIA assays, it might be possible to define thresholds that improve the negative likelihood ratio. Thus, a negative test result enables the identification of subjects at risk of being infected, who should then be closely monitored over time with a view to preventing further viral spread. Redefined thresholds, in addition, improved the overall inter-assay agreement, paving the way to a better harmonization of serologic tests.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mario Plebani","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital of Padova, Department of Medicine-DIMED, University  of Padova, Italy."},{"author_name":"Andrea Padoan","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital of Padova, Department of Medicine-DIMED, University  of Padova, Italy."},{"author_name":"Davide Negrini","author_inst":"Department of Medicine-DIMED, University  of Padova, Italy."},{"author_name":"Benedetta Carpinteri","author_inst":"Department of Medicine-DIMED, University  of Padova, Italy."},{"author_name":"Laura Sciacovelli","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital of Padova."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.21.20106195","rel_title":"Multiplexed and extraction-free amplification for simplified SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.21.20106195","rel_abs":"The rapid onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic has led to multiple challenges for accurately diagnosing the infection. One of the main bottlenecks for COVID-19 detection is reagent and material shortages for sample collection, preservation, and purification prior to testing. Currently, most authorized diagnostic tests require RNA extraction from patient samples and detection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, RNA purification is expensive, time consuming, and requires technical expertise to perform. Additionally, there have been reported shortages of the RNA purification kits needed for most tests. With these challenges in mind, we report on extraction-free amplification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA directly from patient samples. In addition, we have developed a multiplex RT-PCR using the CDC singleplex targets. This multiplex has a limit of detection of 2 copies\/L. We have demonstrated these improvements to the current diagnostic workflow, which reduce complexity and cost, minimize reagent usage, expedite time to results, and increase testing capacity.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samantha A.

We evaluate potential vaccine research strategies under a range of epidemic conditions determined, in part, by the intensity of public health interventions. Methods: We constructed a compartmental epidemiological model incorporating public health interventions, vaccine efficacy trials and a post-trial population vaccination campaign. The model was used to estimate the duration and benefits of large-scale field trials in comparison with HICS accompanied by an expanded safety trial, and to assess the marginal risk faced by HICS participants. Results: Field trials may demonstrate vaccine efficacy more rapidly than a HICS strategy under epidemic conditions consistent with moderate mitigation policies. A HICS strategy is the only feasible option for testing vaccine efficacy under epidemic suppression, and maximises the benefits of post-trial vaccination. Less successful or absent mitigation results in minimal or no benefit from post-trial vaccination, irrespective of trial design. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 HICS are the optimal method of vaccine testing for populations maintained under epidemic suppression, where vaccination offers the greatest benefits to the local population.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"George S Heriot","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Euzebiusz Jamrozik","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Michael J Selgelid","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Crissa Bennett","author_inst":"Global Good\/Intellectual Ventures Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Rafael Rivera","author_inst":"Global Good\/Intellectual Ventures Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Corrie Ortega","author_inst":"Global Good\/Intellectual Ventures Laboratory"},{"author_name":"S.

Objective: We aimed to explain any ethnic differentials in COVID-19 hospitalization based on socioeconomic, lifestyle, mental and physical health factors. Design: Prospective cohort study with national registry linkage to hospitalisation for COVID-19. Setting: Community-dwelling. Participants: 340,966 men and women (mean age 56.2 (SD=8.1) years; 54.3% women) residing in England from the UK Biobank study. Exposures: Ethnicity classified as White, Black, Asian, and Others. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Cases of COVID-19 serious enough to warrant a hospital admission in England from 16-March-2020 to 26-April-2020. Results: There were 640 COVID-19 cases (571\/324,306 White, 31\/4,485 Black, 21\/5,732 Asian, 17\/5,803 Other). Compared to the White study members and after adjusting for age and sex, Black individuals had over a 4-fold increased risk of being hospitalised (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval: =4.32; 3.00-6.23), and there was a doubling of risk in the Asian group (2.12; 1.37, 3.28) and the Other non-white group (1.84; 1.13, 2.99). After controlling for 15 confounding factors which included neighbourhood deprivation, education, number in household, smoking, markers of body size, inflammation, and glycated haemoglobin, these effect estimates were attenuated by 33% for Blacks, 52% for Asians and 43% for Other, but remained raised for Blacks (2.66; 1.82, 3.91), Asian (1.43; 0.91, 2.26) and other non-white groups (1.41; 0.87, 2.31). Conclusions and Relevance: Our findings show clear ethnic differences in risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 which do not appear to be fully explained by known explanatory factors. If replicated, our results have implications for health policy, including the targeting of prevention advice and vaccination coverage.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Camille Lassale","author_inst":"Hospital del Mar Research Institute IMIM"},{"author_name":"Bamba Gaye","author_inst":"Paris Cardiovascular Research Center-INSERM U970"},{"author_name":"Mark Hamer","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Catharine R Gale","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"G David Batty","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Corrie Ortega","author_inst":"Global Good\/Intellectual Ventures Laboratory"},{"author_name":"S.

In this cross-sectional study, we primarily addressed two key issues. First, we tried to determine whether there is a significant difference in the estimated COVID-19 knowledge level from the online and phone survey methods. Second, we tried to quantify the knowledge and attitude of COVID-19 in Bangladeshi adult population. Data were collected through phone calls (April 14-23, 2020) and online survey (April 18-19, 2020) in Bangladesh. The questionnaire had 20 knowledge questions with each correct response getting one point and incorrect\/do not know response getting no point (maximum total knowledge score 20). Participants scoring >17 were categorized as having good knowledge. The percentages of good knowledge holders were 57.6%, 75.1%, and 95.8% in the phone (n=1426), online non-medical (n=1097), and online medical participants (n=382), respectively. Comparison between phone and online survey showed that, overall, online survey might overestimate knowledge level than that of phone survey, although there was no difference for elderly, poor, and rural people. Male gender, higher education, living in town\/urban areas, good financial condition, and use of internet were positively associated with good knowledge. However, higher knowledge was associated with having less confidence in the final control of COVID-19. Our adult population-level estimates showed that only 32.6% (95% CI 30.1-35.2%) had good knowledge.

Objectives: To describe the dynamics and determinants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in HCW. Design: Prospective observational study conducted from February 24th until April 10th, 2020. Setting: Comparison of a 1,500-bed adult and a 600-bed pediatric setting of a tertiary-care university hospital located in central Paris. Participants: All symptomatic HCW screened for SARS-CoV-2 on a nasopharyngeal swab. Measurements: HCW screened positive were prospectively questioned on their profession, symptoms, occupational and non-occupational exposures to SARS-CoV-2. Results: Among 1344 symptomatic HCW tested, 373 were positive (28%) and 336 (90%) corresponding questionnaires were completed. Three hospitalizations and no death were reported. Most HCW (70%) had patient-facing occupational activities (22% in COVID-19 dedicated units). The total number of HCW cases peaked on March 23rd, then decreased slowly, concomitantly with a continuous increase of compliance to preventive measures (including universal medical masking and personal protective equipment (PPE) for direct care to COVID-19 patients). Attack rates were of 3.2% and 2.3% in the adult and pediatric setting, respectively (p=0.0022). In the adult setting, HCW more frequently reported exposure to COVID-19 patients without PPE (25% versus 15%, p=0.046). Report of contacts with children attending out-of-home care facilities dramatically decreased over the study period. Limitations: Lack of COVID-19 negative controls and recall bias. Conclusion: Universal masking, reinforcement of hand hygiene, and PPE with medical masks for patients' care allowed protection of HCW and containment of the outbreak. Residual transmissions were related to persistent exposures with undiagnosed patients or colleagues and not to contacts with children attending out-of-home care facilities.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adrien CONTEJEAN","author_inst":"Equipe Mobile d'Infectiologie, AP-HP, Hopital Cochin, F-75014 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Jeremie

benefits of routine childhood immunisation against the excess risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections during the Covid-19 pandemic in Africa","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.19.20106278","rel_abs":"Background: National immunisation programmes globally are at risk of suspension due to the severe health system constraints and physical distancing measures in place to mitigate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Our aim is to compare the health benefits of sustaining routine childhood immunisation in Africa against the risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infections through visiting routine vaccination service delivery points. Methods: We used two scenarios to approximate the child deaths that may be caused by immunisation coverage reductions during COVID-19 outbreaks. First, we used previously reported country-specific child mortality impact estimates of childhood immunisation for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b, pneumococcal, rotavirus, measles, meningitis A, rubella, and yellow fever (DTP3, HepB3, Hib3, PCV3, RotaC, MCV1, MCV2, MenA, RCV, YFV) to approximate the future deaths averted before completing five years of age by routine childhood vaccination during a 6-month COVID-19 risk period without catch-up campaigns. Second, we analysed an alternative scenario that approximates the health benefits of sustaining routine childhood immunisation to only the child deaths averted from measles outbreaks during the COVID-19 risk period. The excess number of infections due to additional SARS-CoV-2 exposure during immunisation visits assumes that contact reducing interventions flatten the outbreak curve during the COVID-19 risk period, that 60% of the population will have been infected by the end of that period, that children can be infected by either vaccinators or during transport and that upon child infection the whole household would be infected. Country specific household age structure estimates and age dependent infection fatality rates are then applied to calculate the number of deaths attributable to the vaccination clinic visits. We present benefit-risk ratios for routine childhood immunisation alongside 95% uncertainty range estimates from probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Findings: For every one excess COVID-19 death attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infections acquired during routine vaccination clinic visits, there could be 84 (14-267) deaths in children prevented by sustaining routine childhood immunisation in Africa. The benefit-risk ratio for the vaccinated children, siblings, parents or adult care-givers, and older adults in the households of vaccinated children are 85,000 (4,900 - 546,000), 75,000 (4,400 - 483,000), 769 (148 - 2,700), and 96 (14 - 307) respectively. In the alternative scenario that approximates the health benefits to only the child deaths averted from measles outbreaks, the benefit-risk ratio to the households of vaccinated children is 3 (0 - 10) under these highly conservative assumptions and if the risk to only the vaccinated children is considered, the benefit-risk ratio is 3,000 (182 - 21,000). Interpretation: Our analysis suggests that the health benefits of deaths prevented by sustaining routine childhood immunisation in Africa far outweighs the excess risk of COVID-19 deaths associated with vaccination clinic visits, especially for the vaccinated children. However, there are other factors that must be considered for strategic decision making to sustain routine childhood immunisation in African countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. These include logistical constraints of vaccine supply chain problems caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, reallocation of immunisation providers to other prioritised health services, healthcare staff shortages caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections among the staff, decreased demand for vaccination arising from community reluctance to visit vaccination clinics for fear of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infections, and infection risk to healthcare staff providing immunisation services as well as to their households and onward SARS-CoV-2 transmission into the wider community.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kaja Abbas","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Simon R Procter","author_inst":"London School

outdoor PM2.5 (P) may increase the risk of influenza infection, our study examines if immediate exposure to outdoor P will modify the rate of change in the daily number of COVID-19 infections (R), for (1) 31 Chinese provincial capital cities and (2) Wuhan, China, using regression modelling. Effective public health measures for reducing R are recommended. Method: A multiple linear regression model was constructed to model the statistical relationship between P and R in China and in Wuhan, from 1 January to 20 March 2020. We carefully accounted for potential key confounders and addressed collinearity. The causal relationship between P and R, and the interaction effect between key variables were investigated. Finding: A causal relationship between P and R across 31 provincial capital cities in China was established via matching. A higher P resulted in a higher R in China. A 10 g\/m3 increase in P gave a 0.9% increase in R (p < 0.05). An interaction analysis between P and absolute humidity (AH) showed a statistically significant positive relationship between P x AH and R (p < 0.01). When AH was [&le;] 8.6 g\/m3, higher P and AH gave a higher R (p < 0.01). Interpretation: Given that P can exacerbate R, we recommend the installation of air purifiers and improving air ventilation to reduce the effect of P on R. Given that an increasing AH that falls below 8.6 g\/m3 exacerbated R, dehumidifiers can be used to reduce AH and R. Further, given the increasing discussions\/observations that COVID-19 can be airborne, surgical masks should be used to protect one from contracting the virus via the viral-particulate transmission pathway.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yang Han","author_inst":"Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline C.K.

Makkah annually receives three million pilgrims who perform Hajj. Although precautionary measures have been taken in Saudi Arabia to slow down the spread of COVID-19, such as locking down the most affected cities, practicing social distancing, and applying the infection-control precautions, the number of cases has increased. The total confirmed number of cases in Makkah was 10,709 with 127 deaths as of May 16, 2020. Aims of the study: Forecasting the COVID-19 progression in the city of Makkah will help the policymakers decide if the Hajj will be able to operate this year. Thus, to see a clear picture of the fight against COVID-19 for the economy and healthcare industry in Saudi Arabia, specifically in Makkah, the SIR model will predict COVID-19 progression in the city of Makkah. Method: The Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered (SIR) model has been used to track the transmission dynamics and growth among the city of Makkah. The growth index was calculated, according to the data from March 16 until May 9. The estimated vital epidemiological parameters, such as forecasting works and transmission rates, were done. Result: The data showed an interesting result about the peak of the disease progression. It is projected to occur around the 12th day after running the model. According to the model, the peak time will be around the 22nd of May. Then, the number of cases will start to decrease.

This reality is more accentuated especially in Ecuador, where, although many healthcare workers have been called to help in the regions most affected; the shortage of them combined with cultural and macroeconomic factors have led Ecuador to face the most aggressive outbreak in Latin America. In this context, the participation on the front line of the last year medical students are indispensable. For that reason, appropriate training on COVID-19 to last year medical students is an urgent need that universities and health systems must guarantee. We aimed to describe the knowledge, attitudes and practices in Ecuadorian last year medical students in order to identify the knowledge gaps, perceptions and behavior patterns, which could guide the design of better medical educational curricula on COVID-19. Methods: This was a cross-sectional 33-item online survey conducted between April 6 to April 20 assessing the knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward the diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and prognosis toward COVID-19 in Ecuadorian last year medical students. It was sent by email and by Facebook and WhatsApp. Results: A total of 309 students answered the survey. 88% (274\/309) of students scored high about knowledge of the disease (more than 16 points). The majority of students were pessimistic about possible government actions, which is reflected in the negative attitude towards the control of the COVID-19 in Ecuador and volunteering during the outbreak in 77% (238\/309) and 58% (179\/309) of the students, respectively. Moreover 91% (280\/309) of students said they did not have adequate protective equipment, neither training in their health facilities (49%, 152\/309). Conclusions: The high level of students knowledge is an important opportunity to strengthen, improve and advance their training toward COVID-19. Creating a national curriculum may be one of the most effective ways for all students to be trained. Hopefully with this, negative attitudes will change and students will be better qualified.

Our results, which are robust to controlling for a host of co-factors, offer strong evidence that the closure of service activities is very effective in reducing COVID-19 mortality - this was about 15% lower in municipalities with a 10 percentage points higher employment share in shut down services. Shutting down factories, instead, is much less effective, plausibly because factory workers engage in more limited physical interactions relative to those in the consumer-facing service sector. Concerning the management of the health care system, we find that mortality strongly increases with distance from the intensive care unit (ICU). Municipalities at 10 km from the closest ICU experienced up to 50% higher mortality. This effect - which is largest within the epicenter and in days of abnormally high volumes of calls to the emergency line - underscores the importance of improving pre-hospital emergency services and building ambulance capacity to ensure timely transportation of critical patients to the ICU.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gabriele Ciminelli","author_inst":"MIT Sloan School of Management"},{"author_name":"S\u00edlvia Garcia-Mandic\u00f3","author_inst":"Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development"},{"author_name":"Thomas Radulesco","author_inst":"Aix Marseille University, APHM, IUSTI, La Conception University Hospital, Department of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology Head and Neck Surgery, Marseille, France"},{"author_name":"Carlos M Chiesa-Estomba","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Donostia"},{"author_name":"Luigi A Vaira","author_inst":"Maxillofacial Surgery Unit, University Hospital of Sassari, Sassari, Italy."},{"author_name":"Giacomo De Riu","author_inst":"Maxillofacial Surgery Unit, University Hospital of Sassari, Sassari, Italy."},{"author_name":"Leigh J Sowerby","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada"},{"author_name":"Claire Hopkins","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas's Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Sven Saussez","author_inst":"University of Mons"},{"author_name":"Nataly Espinoza-Suarez","author_inst":"Knowledge and Evaluation Research Unit, Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Golembiewski","author_inst":"Knowledge and Evaluation Research Unit, Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Percy Soto-Becerra","author_inst":"Facultad de Administracion y Salud Publica, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Peru"},{"author_name":"Anne-Sophie L'HONNEUR","author_inst":"Departement de virologie, AP-HP, Hopital Cochin, F-75014 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Jean-Marc TRELUYER","author_inst":"Departement de soins intensifs pediatriques, AP-HP, Hopital Necker-Enfants malades, F-75015 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Caroline CHARLIER","author_inst":"Departement de maladies infectieuses et de medecine tropicale, AP-HP, Hopital Necker-Enfants malades, F-75015 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Anne CASETTA","author_inst":"Equipe operationnelle d'hygiene hospitaliere, AP-HP, Hopital Cochin, F-75014 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Pierre FRANGE","author_inst":"Laboratoire de microbiologie clinique, AP-HP, Hopital Necker-Enfants malades, F-75015 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Marianne LERUEZ-VILLE","author_inst":"Laboratoire de virologie, AP-HP, Hopital Necker-Enfants malades, F-75015 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Flore ROZENBERG","author_inst":"Departement de virologie, AP-HP, Hopital Cochin, F-75014 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Olivier LORTHOLARY","author_inst":"Departement de maladies infectieuses et de medecine tropicale, AP-HP, Hopital Necker-Enfants malades, F-75015 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Solen KERNEIS","author_inst":"Equipe Mobile d'Infectiologie, AP-HP, Hopital Cochin, F-75014 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Faeeqa Usaila","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Sabrina Sifat","author_inst":"Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College and Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Nishat Anjum Nourin","author_inst":"Chittagong Research Institute for Children Surgery, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Md Forhad Uddin","author_inst":"Independent Researcher, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Mrinmoy Bhowmik","author_inst":"Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Chattogram Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Tanvir Ahammed","author_inst":"Department of Statistics, Shahjalal University of Science and Technology, Sylhet, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Nabil Sharik","author_inst":"Upzila Health and Family Planning Office, Sadar, Gopalganj, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Quddus Mehnaz","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Md Nur Hossain Bhuiyan","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Chittagong Medical College and Hospital, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Tahmina Banu","author_inst":"Chittagong Research Institute for Children Surgery, Chattogram, Bangladesh"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health economics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.19.20106641","rel_title":"Study Data Element Mapping: Feasibility of Defining Common Data Elements Across COVID-19 Studies","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.19.20106641","rel_abs":"Background: Numerous clinical studies are now underway investigating aspects of COVID-19. The aim of this study was to identify a selection of national and\/or multicentre clinical COVID-19 studies in the United Kingdom to examine the feasibility and outcomes of documenting the most frequent data elements common across studies to rapidly inform future study design and demonstrate proof-of-concept for further subject-specific study data element mapping to improve research data management. Methods: 25 COVID-19 studies were included. For each, information regarding the specific data elements being collected was recorded. Data elements collated were arbitrarily divided into categories for ease of visualisation. Elements which were most frequently and consistently recorded across studies are presented in relation to their relative commonality. Results: Across the 25 studies, 261 data elements were recorded in total. The most frequently recorded 100 data elements were identified across all studies and are presented with relative frequencies. Categories with the largest numbers of common elements included demographics, admission criteria, medical history and investigations. Mortality and need for specific respiratory support were the most common outcome measures, but with specific studies including a range of other outcome measures. Conclusion: The findings of this study have demonstrated that it is feasible to collate specific data elements recorded across a range of studies investigating a specific clinical condition in order to identify those elements which are most common among studies. These data may be of value for those establishing new studies and to allow researchers to rapidly identify studies collecting data of potential use hence minimising duplication and increasing data re-use and interoperability","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Priscilla Mathewson","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Ben Gordon","author_inst":"HDRUK"},{"author_name":"Kay Snowley","author_inst":"HDRUK"},{"author_name":"Clara Fennessy","author_inst":"HDRUK"},{"author_name":"Alastair Denniston","author_inst":"HDRUK"},{"author_name":"Neil Sebire","author_inst":"Great Ormond Street Hospital and ICH London"},{"author_name":"Leigh J Sowerby","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada"},{"author_name":"Claire Hopkins","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas's Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Sven Saussez","author_inst":"University of Mons"},{"author_name":"Nataly Espinoza-Suarez","author_inst":"Knowledge and Evaluation Research Unit, Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Golembiewski","author_inst":"Knowledge and Evaluation Research Unit, Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Percy Soto-Becerra","author_inst":"Facultad de Administracion y Salud Publica, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Peru"},{"author_name":"Anne-Sophie L'HONNEUR","author_inst":"Departement de virologie, AP-HP, Hopital Cochin, F-75014 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Jean-Marc TRELUYER","author_inst":"Departement de soins intensifs pediatriques, AP-HP, Hopital Necker-Enfants malades, F-75015 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Caroline CHARLIER","author_inst":"Departement de maladies infectieuses et de medecine tropicale, AP-HP, Hopital Necker-Enfants malades, F-75015 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Anne CASETTA","author_inst":"Equipe operationnelle d'hygiene hospitaliere, AP-HP, Hopital Cochin, F-75014 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Pierre FRANGE","author_inst":"Laboratoire de microbiologie clinique, AP-HP, Hopital Necker-Enfants malades, F-75015 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Marianne LERUEZ-VILLE","author_inst":"Laboratoire de virologie, AP-HP, Hopital Necker-Enfants malades, F-75015 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Flore ROZENBERG","author_inst":"Departement de virologie, AP-HP, Hopital Cochin, F-75014 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Olivier LORTHOLARY","author_inst":"Departement de maladies infectieuses et de medecine tropicale, AP-HP, Hopital Necker-Enfants malades, F-75015 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Solen KERNEIS","author_inst":"Equipe Mobile d'Infectiologie, AP-HP, Hopital Cochin, F-75014 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Faeeqa Usaila","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Sabrina Sifat","author_inst":"Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College and Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Nishat Anjum Nourin","author_inst":"Chittagong Research Institute for Children Surgery, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Md Forhad Uddin","author_inst":"Independent Researcher, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Mrinmoy Bhowmik","author_inst":"Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Chattogram Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Tanvir Ahammed","author_inst":"Department of Statistics, Shahjalal University of Science and Technology, Sylhet, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Nabil Sharik","author_inst":"Upzila Health and Family Planning Office, Sadar, Gopalganj, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Quddus Mehnaz","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Md Nur Hossain Bhuiyan","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Chittagong Medical College and Hospital, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Tahmina Banu","author_inst":"Chittagong Research Institute for Children Surgery, Chattogram, Bangladesh"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.19.20106799","rel_title":"Use of inhibitors of the renin angiotensin system and COVID-19 prognosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.19.20106799","rel_abs":"Background: controversy has arisen in the scientific community on whether the use of renin angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors in the context of COVID-19 would be of benefit or harmful. A meta-analysis of eligible studies comparing the occurrence of severe and fatal COVID-19 in infected patients who were under treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) vs no treatment or other antihypertensives was conducted. Methods: PubMed, Google Scholar, the Cochrane Library, MedRxiv and BioRxiv were searched for relevant studies. Fixed-effect models or random-effect models were used depending on the heterogeneity between estimates. Results: a total of fifteen studies with 21,614 patients were included. The use of RAS inhibitors was associated with a non-significant 20% decreased risk of the composite outcome (death, admission to intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation requirement or progression to severe or critical pneumonia): RR 0.81 (95%CI: 0.63-1.04), p=0.10, I2=82%. In a subgroup analysis that included hypertensive subjects only, ACEI\/ARB were associated with a 27% significant decrease in the risk of the composite outcome (RR 0.73 (95%CI: 0.56-0.96), p=0.02, I2=65%). Conclusion: the results of this pooled analysis suggest that the use of ACEI\/ARB does not worsen the prognosis, and could even be protective in hypertensive subjects. Patients should continue these drugs during their COVID-19 illness.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jessica Barochiner","author_inst":"Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires"},{"author_name":"Rocio Martinez","author_inst":"Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires"},{"author_name":"Kay Snowley","author_inst":"HDRUK"},{"author_name":"Clara Fennessy","author_inst":"HDRUK"},{"author_name":"Alastair Denniston","author_inst":"HDRUK"},{"author_name":"Neil Sebire","author_inst":"Great Ormond Street Hospital and ICH London"},{"author_name":"Leigh J Sowerby","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada"},{"author_name":"Claire Hopkins","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas's Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Sven Saussez","author_inst":"University of Mons"},{"author_name":"Nataly Espinoza-Suarez","author_inst":"Knowledge and Evaluation Research Unit, Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Golembiewski","author_inst":"Knowledge and Evaluation Research Unit, Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Percy Soto-Becerra","author_inst":"Facultad de Administracion y Salud Publica, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Peru"},{"author_name":"Anne-Sophie L'HONNEUR","author_inst":"Departement de virologie, AP-HP, Hopital Cochin, F-75014 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Jean-Marc TRELUYER","author_inst":"Departement de soins intensifs pediatriques, AP-HP, Hopital Necker-Enfants malades, F-75015 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Caroline CHARLIER","author_inst":"Departement de maladies infectieuses et de medecine tropicale, AP-HP, Hopital Necker-Enfants malades, F-75015 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Anne CASETTA","author_inst":"Equipe operationnelle d'hygiene hospitaliere, AP-HP, Hopital Cochin, F-75014 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Pierre FRANGE","author_inst":"Laboratoire de microbiologie clinique, AP-HP, Hopital Necker-Enfants malades, F-75015 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Marianne LERUEZ-VILLE","author_inst":"Laboratoire de virologie, AP-HP, Hopital Necker-Enfants malades, F-75015 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Flore ROZENBERG","author_inst":"Departement de virologie, AP-HP, Hopital Cochin, F-75014 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Olivier LORTHOLARY","author_inst":"Departement de maladies infectieuses et de medecine tropicale, AP-HP, Hopital Necker-Enfants malades, F-75015 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Solen KERNEIS","author_inst":"Equipe Mobile d'Infectiologie, AP-HP, Hopital Cochin, F-75014 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Faeeqa Usaila","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Sabrina Sifat","author_inst":"Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College and Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Nishat Anjum Nourin","author_inst":"Chittagong Research Institute for Children Surgery, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Md Forhad Uddin","author_inst":"Independent Researcher, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Mrinmoy Bhowmik","author_inst":"Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Chattogram Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Tanvir Ahammed","author_inst":"Department of Statistics, Shahjalal University of Science and Technology, Sylhet, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Nabil Sharik","author_inst":"Upzila Health and Family Planning Office, Sadar, Gopalganj, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Quddus Mehnaz","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Md Nur Hossain Bhuiyan","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Chittagong Medical College and Hospital, Chattogram, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Tahmina Banu","author_inst":"Chittagong Research Institute for Children Surgery, Chattogram, Bangladesh"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.21.20106518","rel_title":"Using Artificial Intelligence for COVID-19 Chest X-ray Diagnosis","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.21.20106518","rel_abs":"Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), caused by a novel member of the coronavirus family, is a respiratory disease that rapidly reached pandemic proportions with high morbidity and mortality. It has had a dramatic impact on society and world economies in only a few months. COVID-19 presents numerous challenges to all aspects of healthcare, including reliable methods for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Initial efforts to contain the spread of the virus were hampered by the time required to develop reliable diagnostic methods. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing field of computer science with many applications to healthcare. Machine learning is a subset of AI that employs deep learning with neural network algorithms. It can recognize patterns and achieve complex computational tasks often far quicker and with increased precision than humans. In this manuscript, we explore the potential for a simple and widely available test as a chest x-ray (CXR) to be utilized with AI to diagnose COVID-19 reliably. Microsoft CustomVision is an automated image classification and object detection system that is a part of Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services. We utilized publicly available CXR images for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, pneumonia from other etiologies, and normal CXRs as a dataset to train Microsoft CustomVision. Our trained model overall demonstrated 92.9% sensitivity (recall) and positive predictive value (precision), with results for each label showing sensitivity and positive predictive value at 94.8% and 98.9% for COVID-19 pneumonia, 89% and 91.8% for non-COVID-19 pneumonia, 95% and 88.8% for normal lung. We then validated the program using CXRs of patients from our institution with confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses along with non-COVID-19 pneumonia and normal CXRs. Our model performed with 100% sensitivity, 95% specificity, 97% accuracy, 91% positive predictive value, and 100% negative predictive value. Finally, we developed and described a publicly available website to demonstrate how this technology can be made readily available in the future.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew A Borkowski","author_inst":"James A.

SARS-CoV-2 RNA has also been detected in other sample types, but there is limited understanding of the clinical or laboratory significance of its detection in blood. Methods: We undertook a systematic literature review to assimilate the evidence for the frequency of vRNA in blood, and to identify associated clinical characteristics. We performed RT-PCR in serum samples from a UK clinical cohort of acute and convalescent COVID-19 cases (n=212), together with convalescent plasma samples collected by NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) (n=111 additional samples). To determine whether PCR-positive blood samples could pose an infection risk, we attempted virus isolation from a subset of RNA-positive samples. Results: We identified 28 relevant studies, reporting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 0-76% of blood samples; pooled estimate 10% (95%CI 5-18%). Among serum samples from our clinical cohort, 27\/212 (12.7%) had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected by RT-PCR. RNA detection occurred in samples up to day 20 post symptom onset, and was associated with more severe disease (multivariable odds ratio 7.5). Across all samples collected [&ge;]28 days post symptom onset, 0\/143 (0%, 95%CI 0.0-2.5%) had vRNA detected. Among our PCR-positive samples, cycle threshold (ct) values were high (range 33.5-44.8), suggesting low vRNA copy numbers. PCR-positive sera inoculated into cell culture did not produce any cytopathic effect or yield an increase in detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Conclusions: vRNA was detectable at low viral loads in a minority of serum samples collected in acute infection, but was not associated with infectious SARS-CoV-2 (within the limitations of the assays used). This work helps to inform biosafety precautions for handling blood products from patients with current or previous COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":47,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Monique Andersson","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, OX3 9DU, UK"},{"author_name":"Carolina V Arancibia - Carcamo","author_inst":"Translational Gastroenterology Unit, University of Oxford, OX3 9DU, UK.

Approximately 20% of infected patients experience a severe manifestation of the disease, causing bilateral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Severe COVID-19 patients also have a pronounced coagulopathy with approximately 30% of patients experiencing thromboembolic complications. However, the etiology driving the coagulopathy remains unknown. Here, we explore whether the prominent neutrophilia seen in severe COVID-19 patients contributes to inflammation-associated coagulation. We found in severe patients the emergence of a CD16IntCD44lowCD11bInt low-density inflammatory band (LDIB) neutrophil population that trends over time with changes in disease status. These cells demonstrated spontaneous neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, phagocytic capacity, enhanced cytokine production, and associated clinically with D-dimer and systemic IL-6 and TNF- levels, particularly for CD40+ LDIBs. We conclude that the LDIB subset contributes to COVID-19-associated coagulopathy (CAC) and could be used as an adjunct clinical marker to monitor disease status and progression. Identifying patients who are trending towards LDIB crisis and implementing early, appropriate treatment could improve all-cause mortality rates for severe COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samantha M Morrissey","author_inst":"University of Louisville.edu"},{"author_name":"Anne E Geller","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Xiaoling Hu","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"David Tieri","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth A Cooke","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Chuanlin Ding","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Matthew Woeste","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Huang-ge Zhange","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo Cavallazi","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Sean P Clifford","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"James Chen","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Maiying Kong","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Corey T Watson","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Jiapeng Huang","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Jun Yan","author_inst":"University of Louisville School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Heli Harvala","author_inst":"NHS Blood and Transfusion, 26 Margaret St, Marylebone, London W1W 8NB"},{"author_name":"Sarah Hoosdally","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, OX3 9DU, UK"},{"author_name":"Samreen Ijaz","author_inst":"Public Health England, Porton Down, SP4 0JG, UK"},{"author_name":"Tim James","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, OX3 9DU, UK"},{"author_name":"William James","author_inst":"Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, OX1 3RE, UK"},{"author_name":"Katie Jeffery","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, OX3 9DU, UK"},{"author_name":"Anita Justice","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, OX3 9DU, UK"},{"author_name":"Paul Klenerman","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, OX3 9DU, UK.

It has been hypothesized that use of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibiting medications in patients with hypertension, increases the expression of ACE2 and thereby increases the risk of COVID-19 infection and severe outcomes or death. However, the effect of RAS-inhibition on ACE2 expression in human tissues of key relevance to blood pressure regulation and COVID-19 infection has not previously been reported. We examined how hypertension, its major metabolic co-phenotypes and antihypertensive medications relate to ACE2 renal expression using information from up to 436 patients whose kidney transcriptomes were characterised by RNA-sequencing. We further validated some of the key observations in other human tissues and\/or a controlled experimental model. Our data reveal increasing expression of ACE2 with age in both human lungs and the kidney. We show no association between renal expression of ACE2 and either hypertension or common types of RAS inhibiting drugs. We demonstrate that renal abundance of ACE2 is positively associated with a biochemical index of kidney function and show a strong enrichment for genes responsible for kidney health and disease in ACE2 co-expression analysis. Collectively, our data indicate that neither hypertension nor antihypertensive treatment are likely to alter individual risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or influence clinical outcomes in COVID-19 through changes of ACE2 expression. Our data further suggest that in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, kidney ACE2 is most likely nephro-protective but the age-related increase in its expression within lungs and kidneys may be relevant to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":32,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiao Jiang","author_inst":"University of Manchester, Manchester, UK"},{"author_name":"James M.

Low-and-middle resource countries face even larger challenges, as their resources are stretched and often insufficient under normal circumstances. A village in the Papuan highlands of Indonesia; small, isolated, accessed only by small plane or trekking has experienced an outbreak typical of COVID-19. Methodology\/Principal Findings This description was compiled from patient care records by lay healthcare workers in M20 (a pseudonym) during and after an outbreak and from medical doctors responding to online requests for help. We assume that, for reasons given, the outbreak that has been described was COVID-19. The dense social structure of the village resulted in a rapid infection of 90-95% of the population. Physical distancing and isolation measures were used, but probably implemented suboptimal and too late, and their effect on the illness course was unclear. The relatively young population, with a majority of women, probably influenced the impact of the epidemic, resulting in only two deaths so far. Conclusions\/Significance This outbreak pattern of suspected SARS-CoV-2 in a village in the highlands of Papua (Indonesia) presents a unique report of the infection of an entire village population over five weeks. The age distribution, common in Papuan highland villages may have reduced case fatality rate (CFR) in this context and that might be the case in similar remote areas since survival to old age is already very limited and CFR among younger people is lower.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elco van Burg","author_inst":"Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Wijnanda van Burg-Verhage","author_inst":"Lentera Papua"},{"author_name":"David Scannali","author_inst":"University of Manchester, Manchester, UK"},{"author_name":"Alicja Nazgiewicz","author_inst":"University of Manchester, Manchester, UK"},{"author_name":"Priscilla Prestes","author_inst":"Federation University Australia, Ballarat, Victoria, Australia"},{"author_name":"Michelle Maier","author_inst":"Federation University Australia, Ballarat, Victoria, Australia"},{"author_name":"Matthew J.

The analysis employs a two-stage SEIR model with different reproductive numbers pre- and post-lockdown. These parameters are estimated from data on the daily number of confirmed cases in a process that automatically detects the time at which the lockdown became effective. The model is evaluated by considering its predictive accuracy on current data and it is then deployed to explore partial relaxations. The results indicate that the different countries have been successful in reducing the reproductive number to values ranging from 0.67 (95% CI: 0.64 - 0.70) to 0.92 (95% CI: 0.89 - 0.95). Results also suggest that a relaxation of 25% could halt the decline in cases in all five countries, while a 50% relaxation could lead to second peaks that are higher and last longer than the earlier peaks in each country. Even though the relaxations so far may have preserved the success of the lockdowns, vigilance is still needed. A relaxation of around 10-15% is recommended if COVID-19 is to continue to decline in all five countries.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David H Glass","author_inst":"Ulster University"},{"author_name":"Wijnanda van Burg-Verhage","author_inst":"Lentera Papua"},{"author_name":"David Scannali","author_inst":"University of Manchester, Manchester, UK"},{"author_name":"Alicja Nazgiewicz","author_inst":"University of Manchester, Manchester, UK"},{"author_name":"Priscilla Prestes","author_inst":"Federation University Australia, Ballarat, Victoria, Australia"},{"author_name":"Michelle Maier","author_inst":"Federation University Australia, Ballarat, Victoria, Australia"},{"author_name":"Matthew J.

Here, we evaluated a pooling method to determine if this could improve screening efficiency and reduce costs while maintaining accuracy in Guangzhou, China. Methods We evaluated 8097 throat swap samples collected from individuals who came for a health check-up or fever clinic in The Third Affiliated Hospital, Southern Medical University between March 4, 2020 and April 26, 2020. Samples were screened for CoViD-19 infection using the WHO-approved quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) primers. The positive samples were classified into two groups (high or low) based on viral load in accordance with the CT value of COVID-19 RT-qPCR results. Each positive RNA samples were mixed with COVID-19 negative RNA or ddH2O to form RNA pools. Findings Samples with high viral load could be detected in pool negative samples (up to 1\/1000 dilution fold). In contrast, the detection of RNA sample from positive patients with low viral load in a pool was difficult and not repeatable. Interpretation Our results show that the COVID-19 viral load significantly influences in pooling efficacy. COVID-19 has distinct viral load profile which depends on the timeline of infection. Thus, application of pooling for infection surveillance may lead to false negatives and hamper infection control efforts.

We also asses the frameworks capacity in differentiating the above-mentioned signs, which are usually confused with the more usual common bacterial and viral pneumonias. Open-source chest X-ray images categorized as Normal, Non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 pneumonias were downloaded from the NIH (n=2,259), RSNA (n=600) and HM Hospitales (n=2,307). Our algorithmic framework was able to precisely detect the images with COVID19- related radiological findings (mean Accuracy: 90.5%; Sensitivity: 80.6%; Specificity: 98.0%), whilst correctly categorizing images deemed as Non-COVID-19 pneumonias (mean Accuracy: 88.4%; Sensitivity: 93.3%; Specificity: 92.0%) and normal chest X- rays (mean Accuracy 92.1%; Sensitivity: 91.8%; Specificity: 94.3%). The associated results show that our AI framework is able to classify COVID-19 accurately, making of it a potential tool to improve the diagnostic performance across primary-care centres and, to grant priority to a subset of algorithmic selected images for urgent follow-on expert review. This would sensibly accelerate diagnosis in remote locations, reduce the bottleneck on specialized centres, and\/or help to alleviate the needs on situations of scarcity in the availability of molecular tests.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maximiliano Lucius","author_inst":"Topazium Artificial Intelligence"},{"author_name":"Martin Belvisi","author_inst":"Topazium Artificial Intelligence"},{"author_name":"Carlos Maria Galmarini","author_inst":"Topazium Artificial Intelligence"},{"author_name":"Jing Huang","author_inst":"Department of laboratory medicine,The Third Affiliated Hospital, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Gang Xiao","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoming Lyu","author_inst":"The Third Affiliated Hospital, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Matthew J.

Across a range of cost-functions and model structures, commitment to intermittent and strict social distancing measures leads to better overall outcomes than temporally consistent implementation of moderate physical distancing measures. With regard to the trade-offs that policymakers may soon face, our results emphasize that economic and health outcomes do not exist in full competition.

Here, we aimed to investigate the phylogenetic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Chicago, Illinois and assess their relationship to clinical parameters. Methods We performed whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 isolates collected from COVID-19 patients in a Chicago healthcare system in mid-March, 2020. Using these and other publicly available sequences, we performed phylogenetic, phylogeographic, and phylodynamic analyses. Patient data was assessed for correlations between demographic or clinical characteristics and virologic features. Findings The 88 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences in our study separated into three distinct phylogenetic clades. Clade 1 was most closely related to viral sequences from New York, and showed evidence of rapid expansion across the US, while Clade 3 was most closely related to those in Washington state. Clade 2 was localized primarily to the Chicago area with limited evidence of expansion elsewhere. At the time of diagnosis, patients infected with Clade 1 viruses had significantly higher average viral loads in their upper airways relative to patients infected with Clade 2 viruses, independent of time to symptom onset and disease severity. Interpretation These results show that multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2 are circulating in the Chicago area that differ in their relative viral loads in patient upper airways. These data suggest that differences in virus genotype impact viral load and may in turn influence viral transmission and spread.

Methods and analysis: We describe the rationale and design of an open-label pragmatic multicentre randomised (concealed) clinical trial of 7 days of hydroxychloroquine (400 mg BID) plus azithromycin (500 mg once daily), hydroxychloroquine 400 mg BID, or standard of care for moderately severe hospitalised patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 (in-patients with up to 4L\/minute oxygen supply through nasal catheter). Patients are randomised in around 50 recruiting sites and we plan to enrol 630 patients with COVID-19. The primary endpoint is a 7-level ordinal scale measured at 15-days: 1)not hospitalised, without limitations on activities; 2)not hospitalised, with limitations on activities; 3)hospitalised, not using supplementary oxygen; 4)hospitalised, using supplementary oxygen; 5)hospitalised, using high-flow nasal cannula or non-invasive ventilation; 6)hospitalised, on mechanical ventilation; 7)death. Secondary endpoints are the ordinal scale at 7 days, need for mechanical ventilation and rescue therapies during 15 days, need of high-flow nasal cannula or non-invasive ventilation during 15 days, length of hospital stay, in-hospital mortality, thromboembolic events, occurrence of acute kidney injury, and number of days free of respiratory support at 15 days. Secondary safety outcomes include prolongation of QT interval on electrocardiogram, ventricular arrhythmias, and liver toxicity. The main analysis will consider all patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the groups they were randomly assigned.

Our objective was to systematically evaluate their efficacy and safety in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We systematically reviewed PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Medrxviv for studies of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in COVID-19 hospitalized patients on April 26, 2020. We evaluated the quality of trials and observational studies using the Jadad criteria and Newcastle Ottawa Scale, respectively. RESULTS: After a review of 175 citations, we included 5 clinical trials (total of 345 patients), 9 observational studies (n = 2529), and 6 additional studies (n = 775) reporting on the QT interval. Three studies reported treatment benefits including two studies reporting benefit on virologic outcomes, which was statistically significant in one study, and another reported significant improvement on cough symptoms. Three studies reported that treatment was potentially harmful, including an significantly increased risk of mortality in two studies and increased need for respiratory support in another. Eight studies were unable to detect improvements on virologic outcomes (n = 3) or pneumonia or transfer to ICU\/death (n = 5). The proportion of participants with critical QTc intervals of [&ge;] 500 ms or an increase of [&ge;] 60 ms from baseline ranged from 8.3% to 36% (n = 8). One clinical trial and six observational studies were of good quality. The remaining studies were of poor quality. CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic review of reported clinical studies did not identify substantial evidence to support the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and raises questions about potential harm from QT prolongation and increased mortality.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sonal Singh","author_inst":"Department of Family Medicine and Community Health, Meyers Primary Care Institute and Quantitative Health Sciences, University of Massachusetts Medical School, "},{"author_name":"Thomas J Moore","author_inst":"Center for Drug Safety and Effectiveness, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA  and  Department of Epidemiology, The George Washi"},{"author_name":"Luciani CP Azevedo","author_inst":"Hospital Sirio Libanes Research and Education Institute, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Regis G Rosa","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento, Porto Alegre,Brazil"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Avezum","author_inst":"Hospital Alemao Oswaldo Cruz, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Viviane C Veiga","author_inst":"BP - A Beneficencia Portuguesa de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Renato D Lopes","author_inst":"Duke University Medical Center - Duke Clinical Research Institute - Durham, North Carolina, USA."},{"author_name":"Leticia Kawano-Dourado","author_inst":"HCor Research Institute, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Lucas P Damiani","author_inst":"HCor Research Institute, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Adriano J Pereira","author_inst":"Academic Research Organization, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Ary Serpa Neto","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Remo Furtado","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Bruno Tomazini","author_inst":"Hospital Sirio Libanes Research and Education Institute, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Fernando A Bozza","author_inst":"Brazilian Research in Intensive Care Network (BRICNet), Sao Paulo, Brazil."},{"author_name":"Israel S Maia","author_inst":"Brazilian Research in Intensive Care Network (BRICNet), Sao Paulo, Brazil."},{"author_name":"Maicon Falavigna","author_inst":"Hospital Moinhos de Vento, Porto Alegre, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Thiago C Lisboa","author_inst":"HCor Research Institute, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Henrique Fonseca","author_inst":"Academic Research Organization, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Flavia R Machado","author_inst":"Brazilian Research in Intensive Care Network (BRICNet), Sao Paulo, Brazil."},{"author_name":"Otavio Berwanger","author_inst":"Academic Research Organization, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"COALITION COVID-19 Brazil I Investigators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Pawel Bogdanski","author_inst":"Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland"},{"author_name":"Bernard Keavney","author_inst":"University of Manchester, Manchester, UK"},{"author_name":"Andrew P.
