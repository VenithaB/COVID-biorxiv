Data suitable for this purpose are scant. We used national surveillance PCR test, serological survey and mobility data to develop and fit a county-specific transmission model for Kenya. We estimate that the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic peaked before the end of July 2020 in the major urban counties, with 34 - 41% of residents infected, and will peak elsewhere in the country within 2-3 months. Despite this penetration, reported severe cases and deaths are low. Our analysis suggests the COVID-19 disease burden in Kenya may be far less than initially feared. A similar scenario across sub-Saharan Africa would have implications for balancing the consequences of restrictions with those of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"John Ojal","author_inst":"Kenya Medical Research Institute -Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kenya and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Samuel PC Brand","author_inst":"The Zeeman Institute for Systems Biology and Infectious Disease Epidemiology Research (SBIDER), University of Warwick, UK."},{"author_name":"Vincent Were","author_inst":"Kenya Medical Research Institute -Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kenya"},{"author_name":"Emelda A Okiro","author_inst":"Kenya Medical Research Institute -Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kenya"},{"author_name":"Ivy Kadzo Kombe","author_inst":"KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Caroline Mburu","author_inst":"Kenya Medical Research Institute -Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kenya"},{"author_name":"Rabia Aziza","author_inst":"The Zeeman Institute for Systems Biology and Infectious Disease Epidemiology Research (SBIDER), University of Warwick, UK."},{"author_name":"Morris Ogero","author_inst":"Kenya Medical Research Institute -Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kenya"},{"author_name":"Ambrose Agweyu","author_inst":"Kenya Medical Research Institute -Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kenya"},{"author_name":"George M Warimwe","author_inst":"KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Sophie Uyoga","author_inst":"KEMRI Wellcome Trust Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Ifedayo M.

We aimed to describe and compare the demographics, comorbidities, and outcomes of obese patients with COVID-19 to those of non-obese patients with COVID-19, or obese patients with seasonal influenza. Methods: We conducted a cohort study based on outpatient\/inpatient care, and claims data from January to June 2020 from the US, Spain, and the UK. We used six databases standardized to the OMOP common data model. We defined two cohorts of patients diagnosed and\/or hospitalized with COVID-19. We created corresponding cohorts for patients with influenza in 2017-2018. We followed patients from index date to 30 days or death. We report the frequency of socio-demographics, prior comorbidities, and 30-days outcomes (hospitalization, events, and death) by obesity status. Findings: We included 627 044 COVID-19 (US: 502 650, Spain: 122 058, UK: 2336) and 4 549 568 influenza (US: 4 431 801, Spain: 115 224, UK: 2543) patients. The prevalence of obesity was higher among hospitalized COVID-19 (range: 38% to 54%) than diagnosed COVID-19 (30% to 47%), or diagnosed\/hospitalized influenza (15% to 48%) patients. Obese hospitalized COVID-19 patients were more often female and younger than non-obese COVID-19 patients or obese influenza patients. Obese COVID-19 patients were more likely to have prior comorbidities, present with cardiovascular and respiratory events during hospitalization, require intensive services, or die compared to non-obese COVID-19 patients. Obese COVID-19 patients were also more likely to require intensive services or die compared to obese influenza patients, despite presenting with fewer comorbidities. Interpretation: We show that obesity is more common among COVID-19 than influenza patients, and that obese patients present with more severe forms of COVID-19 with higher hospitalization, intensive services, and fatality than non-obese patients. These data are instrumental for guiding preventive strategies of COVID-19 infection and complications","rel_num_authors":38,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Martina Recalde","author_inst":"1.

Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase; data published by Johns Hopkins University; and Chinese databases CNKI, Wanfang, and Chongqing Weipu. Reports on chest CT imaging features of children with COVID-19 from January 1, 2020, to August 10, 2020, were analyzed retrospectively and a meta-analysis carried out using Stata12.0 software. Results: Thirty-seven articles (1747 children) were included in this study. The overall rate of abnormal lung CT findings was 63.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 55.8-70.6%), with a rate of 61.0% (95% CI: 50.8-71.2%) in China and 67.8% (95% CI: 57.1-78.4%) in the rest of the world in the subgroup analysis. The incidence of ground-glass opacities was 39.5% (95% CI: 30.7-48.3%), multiple lung lobe lesions 65.1% (95% CI: 55.1-67.9%), and bilateral lung lesions 61.5% (95% CI: 58.8-72.2%). Other imaging features included nodules (25.7%), patchy shadows (36.8%), halo sign (24.8%), consolidation (24.1%), air bronchogram signs (11.2%), cord-like shadows (9.7%), crazy-paving pattern (6.1%), and pleural effusion (9.1%). Two articles reported three cases of white lung, another reported two cases of pneumothorax, and another one case of bullae. CONCLUSION: The lung CT results of children with COVID-19 are usually normal or slightly atypica, with a low sensitivity and specificity compared with that in adults. The lung lesions of COVID-19 pediatric patients mostly involve both lungs or multiple lobes, and the common manifestations are patchy shadows, ground-glass opacities, consolidation, partial air bronchogram signs, nodules, and halo signs; white lung, pleural effusion, and paving stone signs are rare. CLINICAL IMPACT: Therefore, chest CT has limited value as a screening tool for children with COVID-19 and can only be used as an auxiliary assessment tool.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ji-Gan Wang Jr.","author_inst":"Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region"},{"author_name":"Yu-Fang Mo","author_inst":"Liuzhou Workers' Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yu-heng Su","author_inst":"Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region"},{"author_name":"Li-chuang Wang","author_inst":"Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region"},{"author_name":"Guang-bing Liu","author_inst":"Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region"},{"author_name":"Meng Li","author_inst":"Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region"},{"author_name":"Qian-qiu Qin","author_inst":"Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region"},{"author_name":"Thamir M Alshammari","author_inst":"Medication Safety Research Chair, King Saud University"},{"author_name":"Osaid Alser","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, 02114, Massachusetts, USA"},{"author_name":"Carlos Areia","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Edward Burn","author_inst":"1.

The effectiveness of these NPIs has been investigated with simulation studies, that rely on assumptions and by empirical studies with few countries and controversial results. However, it has not been investigated in detail how long different NPIs need to be in place to take effect, or how long they should be in place for their maximum effect to unfold. We used global data and a non-parametric machine learning model to estimate the effects of NPIs in relation to how long they have been in place. Here we show that closure and regulation of schools was the most important NPI, associated with a pronounced effect about 10 days after implementation. Restrictions of mass gatherings and restrictions and regulations of businesses were found to have a more gradual effect, and social distancing was associated with a delayed effect starting about 18 days after implementation. Generally, effects increased until about 40 to 50 days after implementation. Our results can inform political decisions regarding the choice of NPIs and how long they need to be in place to take effect.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elisabeth Lucia Zeilinger","author_inst":"Faculty of Psychology, University of Vienna"},{"author_name":"Ingo W.

N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators (N95-FFRs) provide respiratory protection against respiratory pathogens including SARS-COV-2. There is scant literature on reprocessing methods which can enable reuse of N95-FFRs. Aim: We conducted this study to evaluate research done, prior to COVID-19 pandemic, on various decontamination methods for reprocessing of N95-FFRs. Methods: We searched 5 electronic databases (Pubmed, Google Scholar, Crossref, Ovid, ScienceDirect) and 1 Grey literature database (OpenGrey). We included original studies, published prior to year 2020, which had evaluated any decontamination method on FFRs. Studies had evaluated a reprocessing method against parameters namely physical changes, user acceptability, respirator fit, filter efficiency, microbicidal efficacy and presence of chemical residues post-reprocessing. Findings and Conclusions: Overall, we found 7887 records amongst which 17 original research articles were finally included for qualitative analysis. Overall, 21 different types of decontamination or reprocessing methods for N95-FFRs were evaluated. Most commonly evaluated method for reprocessing of FFRs was Ultraviolet (Type-C) irradiation (UVGI) which was evaluated in 13\/17 (76%) studies. We found published literature is scant on this topic despite warning signs of pandemic of a respiratory illness over the years. Promising technologies requiring expeditious evaluation are UVGI, Microwave generated steam (MGS) and Hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV). Global presence of technologies, which have been given Emergency use authorisation for N95-FFR reprocessing, is extremely limited. Reprocessing of N95-FFRs by MGS should be considered for emergency implementation in resource limited settings to tackle shortage of N95-FFRs.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Diptanu Paul","author_inst":"AIIMS Bhopal"},{"author_name":"Ayush Gupta","author_inst":"AIIMS Bhopal"},{"author_name":"Anand Kumar Maurya","author_inst":"AIIMS Bhopal"},{"author_name":"Clemens Zauchner","author_inst":"IT Power Services GmbH, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Guang-bing Liu","author_inst":"Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region"},{"author_name":"Meng Li","author_inst":"Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region"},{"author_name":"Qian-qiu Qin","author_inst":"Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region"},{"author_name":"Thamir M Alshammari","author_inst":"Medication Safety Research Chair, King Saud University"},{"author_name":"Osaid Alser","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, 02114, Massachusetts, USA"},{"author_name":"Carlos Areia","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Edward Burn","author_inst":"1.

To estimate the burden of the disease with time it is important to undertake a longitudinal seroprevalence study which will also help to understand the stability of anti SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Various studies have been conducted worldwide to assess the antibody stability. However, there is very limited data available from India. Healthcare workers (HCW) are the frontline workforce and more exposed to the COVID-19 infection (SARS-CoV-2) compared to the community. This study was conceptualized with an aim to estimate the seroprevalence in hospital and general population and determine the stability of anti SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in HCW. Methods: Staff of a tertiary care hospital in Delhi and individuals visiting that hospital were recruited between April to August 2020. Venous blood sample, demographic, clinical, COVID-19 symptoms, and RT-PCR data was collected from all participants. Serological testing was performed using the electro-chemiluminescence based assay developed by Roche Diagnostics, in Cobas Elecsys 411. Seropositive participants were followed- upto 83 days to check for the presence of antibodies. Results: A total of 780 participants were included in this study, which comprised 448 HCW and 332 individuals from the general population. Among the HCW, seroprevalence rates increased from 2.3% in April to 50.6% in July. The cumulative prevalence was 16.5% in HCW and 23.5% (78\/332) in the general population with a large number of asymptomatic individuals. Out of 74 seropositive HCWs, 51 were followed-up for the duration of this study. We observed that in all seropositive cases the antibodies were sustained even up to 83 days. Conclusion: The cumulative prevalence of seropositivity was lower in HCWs than the general population. There were a large number of asymptomatic cases and the antibodies developed persisted through the duration of the study. More such longitudinal serology studies are needed to better understand the antibody response kinetics.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samreen Siddiqui","author_inst":"Institute of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism Max Healthcare, Max Super Speciality Hospital, Saket, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Salwa Naushin","author_inst":"2 CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology,New Delhi-110025,  India,Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad-201002, India"},{"author_name":"Shalini Pradhan","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology,New Delhi-110025, India"},{"author_name":"Archa Misra","author_inst":"Institute of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, Max Healthcare, Max Super Speciality      Hospital, Saket,New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Akansha Tyagi","author_inst":"Institute of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, Max Healthcare, Max Super Speciality      Hospital, Saket,New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Menka Loomba","author_inst":"Institute of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, Max Healthcare, Max Super Speciality      Hospital, Saket,New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Swati Waghdhare","author_inst":"Institute of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, Max Healthcare, Max Super Speciality  Hospital, Saket,New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Rajesh Pandey","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology,New Delhi-110025, India"},{"author_name":"Shantanu Sengupta","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology,New Delhi-110025, India"},{"author_name":"Sujeet Jha","author_inst":"Institute of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, Max Healthcare, Max Super Speciality Hospital, Saket,New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Edward Burn","author_inst":"1.

Across all HEIs it is estimated that there will be a total of approximately 700 COVID-19 cases (95% CI: 640 - 750) arriving on campus of which 380 are associated from UK students, 230 from international and 90 from staff. This assumes all students will return to campus and that student numbers and where they come from are similar to previous years. According to the current UK government guidance approximately 237,370 students arriving on campus will be required to quarantine because they come from countries outwith designated travel corridors. Assuming quarantining is 100% efficient this will potentially reduce the overall number of cases by approximately 20% to 540 (95% CI: 500 - 590). Universities must plan for COVID-19 cases to arrive on campus and facilitate mitigations to reduce the spread of disease. It is likely that the first two weeks will be crucial to stop spread of introduced cases. Following that, the risk of introduction of new cases onto campus will be from interactions between students, staff and the local community as well as students travelling off campus for personal, educational or recreational reasons.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Francisco Perez-Reche","author_inst":"University of Aberdeen"},{"author_name":"Norval Strachan","author_inst":"University of Aberdeen"},{"author_name":"Shalini Pradhan","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology,New Delhi-110025, India"},{"author_name":"Archa Misra","author_inst":"Institute of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, Max Healthcare, Max Super Speciality      Hospital, Saket,New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Akansha Tyagi","author_inst":"Institute of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, Max Healthcare, Max Super Speciality      Hospital, Saket,New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Menka Loomba","author_inst":"Institute of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, Max Healthcare, Max Super Speciality      Hospital, Saket,New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Swati Waghdhare","author_inst":"Institute of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, Max Healthcare, Max Super Speciality  Hospital, Saket,New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Rajesh Pandey","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology,New Delhi-110025, India"},{"author_name":"Shantanu Sengupta","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology,New Delhi-110025, India"},{"author_name":"Sujeet Jha","author_inst":"Institute of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, Max Healthcare, Max Super Speciality Hospital, Saket,New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Edward Burn","author_inst":"1.

Thailand is considered to be among the top countries in handling its first wave of the outbreak -- 12 January to 31 July 2020. Here, we illustrate how Thailand tackled the COVID-19 outbreak, particularly the effects of public health interventions on the epidemiological spread. This study shows how the available data from the outbreak can be analyzed and visualized to quantify the severity of the outbreak, the effectiveness of the interventions, and the level of risk of allowed activities during an easing of a \"lockdown.\" This study shows how a well-organized governmental apparatus can overcome the havoc caused by a pandemic.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sipat Dr. Triukose","author_inst":"Research group on Applied Digital Technology in Medicine (ATM) and Chulalongkorn University Big Data Analytics and IoT Center (CUBIC), Chulalongkorn University"},{"author_name":"Sirin Dr. Nitinawarat","author_inst":"International School of Engineering, Faculty of Engineering and Research group on Applied Digital Technology in Medicine (ATM), Chulalongkorn University"},{"author_name":"Ponlapat Satian","author_inst":"Lansaka Hospital, Office of the permanent secretary, Ministry of Public Health, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Anupap Dr. Somboonsavatdee","author_inst":"Greater Data Science Lab, Department of Statistics, Chulalongkorn Business School, 15 Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Ponlachart Dr. Chotikarn","author_inst":"Marine and Coastal Resources Institute, Faculty of Environmental Management, Coastal Oceanography and Climate Change Research Center, Prince of Songkla Universi"},{"author_name":"Thunchanok Thammasanya","author_inst":"TrueEye Company Limited, Bangkok, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Nasamon Wanlapakorn","author_inst":"Center of Excellence in Clinical Virology, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, 22 Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Natthinee Dr. Sudhinaraset","author_inst":"Center of Excellence in Clinical Virology, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Pitakpol Dr. Boonyamalik","author_inst":"Office of the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Public Health, Bangkok, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Bancha Kakhong","author_inst":"Department of Health, Ministry of Public Health, Bangkok, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Yong Poovorawan","author_inst":"Center of Excellence in Clinical Virology, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Paula Casajust","author_inst":"Real-World Evidence, Trial Form Support, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Dalia Dawoud","author_inst":"Cairo University, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo, Egypt"},{"author_name":"Scott L DuVall","author_inst":"1.VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure, VA Salt Lake City Health Care System, Salt Lake City, UT, USA 2.

However, it is unknown if inhaled corticosteroid use is associated with reduced morbidity of the disease. Methods In a nationwide cohort of hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 test-positive individuals in Denmark, we estimated the 30-day hazard ratio of intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death among users of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) compared with users of non-ICS inhalers ({beta}2-agonist\/muscarinic-antagonists), or non-users of ICS, with Cox regression adjusted for age, sex, and other confounders. We repeated these analyses among influenza test-positive patients during 2010-2018. Results Among 2,180 hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients, 282 were admitted to ICU and 421 died within 30 days. ICS use was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.25 (95% CI [CI], 0.60 to 2.61) for ICU admission and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.54 to 1.31) for death compared with non-ICS inhaler use. Compared with no ICS use, the hazard ratio of ICU admission or death was 1.22 (95% CI, 0.77 to 1.94) and 1.05 (95% CI, 0.75 to 1.47), respectively. Among 10,279 hospitalized influenza patients, the hazard ratios were 1.43 (95% CI, 0.89 to 2.30) and 1.11 (95% CI, 0.85 to 1.46) for ICU admission, and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.63 to 1.01) and 1.03 (95% CI, 0.87 to 1.22) for death compared with non-ICS inhaler use and no ICS use, respectively. Conclusions Our results do not support an effect of inhaled corticosteroid use on COVID-19 morbidity, however we can only rule out moderate-to-large reduced or increased risks.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anders Husby","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Anton Pottegaard","author_inst":"University of Southern Denmark"},{"author_name":"Anders Peter Hviid","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Howard Burdett","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"David Pernet","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Lisa Hull","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Dominic Murphy","author_inst":"Combat Stress"},{"author_name":"Sharon Stevelink","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Simon Wessely","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Nicola Fear","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Yong Poovorawan","author_inst":"Center of Excellence in Clinical Virology, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Paula Casajust","author_inst":"Real-World Evidence, Trial Form Support, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Dalia Dawoud","author_inst":"Cairo University, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo, Egypt"},{"author_name":"Scott L DuVall","author_inst":"1.VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure, VA Salt Lake City Health Care System, Salt Lake City, UT, USA 2.

Parameters studied were probability of diagnosis, quantification of disease severity and the time to reach the diagnosis . Methods: 107 consecutive patients of suspected Covid-19 patients were evaluated using the three AI methods labeled as AI-I,II, III alongwith visual analysis labeled as VT for predicting probability of Covid-19, determining CT severity score (CTSS) and index (CTSI) , percentage opacification (PO) and high opacification (POHO). Sensitivity, specificity along with area under curves were estimated for each method and the CTSS and CTSI correlated using Friedman test. Results: Out of 107 patients 71 patients were Covid-19 positive and 20 negative by RT-PCR while 16 did not get RT-PCR done. AI-III method showed higher sensitivity and specificity of 93% and 88% respectively to predict probability of Covid 19. It had 2 false positive patients of interstitial lung disease. AI-II method had sensitivity and specificity of 66% and 83% respectively while visual (VT) analysis showed sensitivity and specificity of 59.7% and 62% respectively. Statistically significant differences were also seen in CTSI and PO estimation between AI-I and III methods (p<0.0001) with AI-III showing fastest time to calculate results. Conclusions: AI-III method gave better results to make an accurate and quick diagnosis of the Covid-19 with AUC of 0.85 to predict probability of Covid-19 alongwith quantification of Covid-19 lesions in the form of PO, POHO as compared to other AI methods and also by visual analysis.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Atul Kapoor","author_inst":"Advanced diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Goldaa Mahajan","author_inst":"Advanced Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Aprajita Kapoor","author_inst":"Advanced Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Howard Burdett","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"David Pernet","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Lisa Hull","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Dominic Murphy","author_inst":"Combat Stress"},{"author_name":"Sharon Stevelink","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Simon Wessely","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Nicola Fear","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Yong Poovorawan","author_inst":"Center of Excellence in Clinical Virology, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Paula Casajust","author_inst":"Real-World Evidence, Trial Form Support, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Dalia Dawoud","author_inst":"Cairo University, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo, Egypt"},{"author_name":"Scott L DuVall","author_inst":"1.VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure, VA Salt Lake City Health Care System, Salt Lake City, UT, USA 2.

We have assessed the performance of serum apolipoprotein-A1, the main transporter of HDL-cholesterol, to identify the early spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) in the general population and its diagnostic performance for the Covid-19. Methods We compared the daily mean serum apolipoprotein-A1 during the first 34 weeks of 2020 in a population that is routinely followed for a risk of liver fibrosis risk in the USA (212,297 sera) and in France (20,652 sera) in relation to a local increase in confirmed cases, and in comparison to the same period in 2019 (266,976 and 28,452 sera, respectively). We prospectively assessed the sensitivity of this marker in an observational study of 136 consecutive hospitalized cases and retrospectively evaluated its specificity in 7,481 controls representing the general population. Results The mean serum apolipoprotein-A1 levels in the survey populations began decreasing in January 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. This decrease was highly correlated with the daily increase in confirmed Covid-19 cases in the following 34 weeks, both in France and USA, including the June and mid-July recovery periods in France. Apolipoprotein-A1 at the 1.25 g\/L cutoff had a sensitivity of 90.6% (95%CI84.2-95.1) and a specificity of 96.1% (95.7-96.6%) for the diagnosis of Covid-19. The area under the characteristics curve was 0.978 (0.957-0.988), and outperformed haptoglobin and liver function tests. The adjusted risk ratio of apolipoprotein-A1 for survival without transfer to intensive care unit was 5.61 (95%CI 1.02-31.0;P=0.04). Conclusion Apolipoprotein-A1 could be a sentinel of the pandemic in existing routine surveillance of the general population.

While research efforts to develop a vaccine are on-going, others have suggested the use of available vaccines to boost innate immunity. Objective: We analysed three databases: UNICEF Immunization Coverage, Worldometer Corona Virus Updates and World Bank List of Economies to establish the association, if any, between vaccination for various diseases and COVID-19 death rates and recoveries across world economies. Results: Mean percentage death rates were lower in countries that vaccinated for Hepatitis-B birth dose (2.53% vs 3.79%, p = 0.001), Bacille Calmette-Guerin Vaccine (2.93% vs 5.10%, p = 0.025) and Inactivated Polio Vaccine 1st dose (2.8% vs 4.01%, p = 0.022) than those which did not report vaccination. In high income countries, a significant negative correlation with death rates was observed with vaccination for Measles-containing vaccine 2nd dose (r = -0.290, p = 0.032), Rubella- containing vaccine 1st dose (r= -0.325, p = 0.015), Hepatitis B 3rd dose (r = -0.562, p = 3.3 x10-5), Inactivated Polio vaccine 1st dose (r = -0.720, p = 0.008). Inactivated Polio Vaccine 1st dose and Measles-containing vaccine 2nd dose also correlated with better recoveries. In Low Income countries, only Rubella-containing vaccine correlated with lower deaths while Yellow fever vaccine was associated with poorer recoveries.

However, the immune response in mild or even asymptomatic patients remains unclear. Here, we performed longitudinal single-cell transcriptome sequencing and T cell\/B cell receptor sequencing on 3 healthy donors and 10 COVID-19 patients with asymptomatic, moderate, and severe conditions. We found asymptomatic patients displayed distinct innate immune responses, including increased CD56briCD16- NK subset, which was nearly missing in severe condition and enrichment of a new Th2-like cell type\/state expressing a ciliated cell marker. Unlike that in moderate condition, asymptomatic patients lacked clonal expansion of effector CD8+ T cells but had a robust effector CD4+ T cell clonal expansion, coincide with previously detected SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cells in unexposed individuals. Moreover, NK and effector T cells in asymptomatic patients have upregulated cytokine related genes, such as IFNG and XCL2. Our data suggest early innate immune response and type I immunity may contribute to the asymptomatic phenotype in COVID-19 disease, which could in turn deepen our understanding of severe COVID-19 and guide early prediction and therapeutics.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yue You","author_inst":"Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Guo-Lin Wang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Hui-Xia Gao","author_inst":"The Fifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Ming Cui","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Li-Jun Duan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Sheng-Bo Zhang","author_inst":"The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia"},{"author_name":"Yu-Ling Wang","author_inst":"The Fifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China"},{"author_name":"Lin Yao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Li Li","author_inst":"The Fifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China"},{"author_name":"Jian-Hua Lu","author_inst":"The Fifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China"},{"author_name":"Hai-Bin Wang","author_inst":"The Fifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China"},{"author_name":"Jing-Fang Fan","author_inst":"The Fifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China"},{"author_name":"Huan-Wei Zheng","author_inst":"The Fifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China"},{"author_name":"Er-Hei Dai","author_inst":"The Fifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China"},{"author_name":"Luyi Tian","author_inst":"Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Mai-Juan Ma","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Olivier Benveniste","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Frederique Gandjbakhch","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Julien Mayaux","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Olivier Lucidarme","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Bruno Fautrel","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Vlad Ratziu","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Chantal Housset","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Dominique Thabut","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Patrice Cacoub","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Fredrik Nyberg","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Community Medicine, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Jose D Posada","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Palo Alto, California, USA"},{"author_name":"Christian G Reich","author_inst":"Real World Solutions, IQVIA, Cambridge, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Lisa M Schilling","author_inst":"Data Science to Patient Value Program, Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus"},{"author_name":"Karishma Shah","author_inst":"Botnar Research Centre, Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology, and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Nigham H Shah","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Palo Alto, California, USA"},{"author_name":"Vignesh Subbian","author_inst":"College of Engineering, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA"},{"author_name":"Lin Zhang","author_inst":"1.

There is little existing data on the mutations in SARS-CoV-2 and the impact of these polymorphisms on its transmission and viral load. In this study, the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence was analyzed to identify variants within the 3UTR region of its cis-regulatory RNA elements. A 43-nucleotide genetic element with a highly conserved stem-loop II-like motif (S2M), was discovered. The research revealed 32 G>U and 16 G>U\/A mutations located within the S2M sequence in human SARS-CoV-2 models. These polymorphisms appear to make the S2M secondary and tertiary structures in human SARS-CoV-2 models less stable when compared to the S2M structures of bat\/pangolin models. This grants the RNA structures more flexibility, which could be one of its escape mechanisms from host defenses or facilitate its entry into host proteins and enzymes. While this S2M sequence may not be omnipresent across all human SARS-CoV-2 models, when present, its sequence is always highly conserved. It may be used as a potential target for the development of vaccines and therapeutic agents.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Majid Vahed","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Vahed","author_inst":"University of Michigan-Ann Arbor"},{"author_name":"Aaron Sweeney","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Farshad H Shirazi","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mehdi Mirsaeidi","author_inst":"University of Miami"},{"author_name":"Sheng-Bo Zhang","author_inst":"The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia"},{"author_name":"Yu-Ling Wang","author_inst":"The Fifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China"},{"author_name":"Lin Yao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Li Li","author_inst":"The Fifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China"},{"author_name":"Jian-Hua Lu","author_inst":"The Fifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China"},{"author_name":"Hai-Bin Wang","author_inst":"The Fifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China"},{"author_name":"Jing-Fang Fan","author_inst":"The Fifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China"},{"author_name":"Huan-Wei Zheng","author_inst":"The Fifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China"},{"author_name":"Er-Hei Dai","author_inst":"The Fifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China"},{"author_name":"Luyi Tian","author_inst":"Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Mai-Juan Ma","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Olivier Benveniste","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Frederique Gandjbakhch","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Julien Mayaux","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Olivier Lucidarme","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Bruno Fautrel","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Vlad Ratziu","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Chantal Housset","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Dominique Thabut","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Patrice Cacoub","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Fredrik Nyberg","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Community Medicine, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Jose D Posada","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Palo Alto, California, USA"},{"author_name":"Christian G Reich","author_inst":"Real World Solutions, IQVIA, Cambridge, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Lisa M Schilling","author_inst":"Data Science to Patient Value Program, Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus"},{"author_name":"Karishma Shah","author_inst":"Botnar Research Centre, Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology, and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Nigham H Shah","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Palo Alto, California, USA"},{"author_name":"Vignesh Subbian","author_inst":"College of Engineering, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA"},{"author_name":"Lin Zhang","author_inst":"1.

To help fight COVID-19, new molecular tools specifically targeting critical components of the causative agent of COVID-19, SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), are desperately needed. The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein is a major component of the viral replication processes, integral to viral particle assembly, and is a major diagnostic marker for infection and immune protection. Currently available antibody reagents targeting the nucleocapsid protein were primarily developed against the related SARS-CoV virus and are not specific to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. Therefore, in this work we developed and characterized a series of new mouse monoclonal antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. The anti-nucleocapsid monoclonal antibodies were tested in ELISA, western blot, and immunofluorescence analyses. The variable regions from the heavy and light chains from five select clones were cloned and sequenced, and preliminary epitope mapping of the sequenced clones was performed. Overall, the new antibody reagents described here will be of significant value in the fight against COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"James S Terry","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Loran BR Anderson","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Michael S Scherman","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Carley E McAlister","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Rushika Perera","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Tony Schountz","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Brian J Geiss","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Lin Yao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Li Li","author_inst":"The Fifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China"},{"author_name":"Jian-Hua Lu","author_inst":"The Fifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China"},{"author_name":"Hai-Bin Wang","author_inst":"The Fifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China"},{"author_name":"Jing-Fang Fan","author_inst":"The Fifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China"},{"author_name":"Huan-Wei Zheng","author_inst":"The Fifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China"},{"author_name":"Er-Hei Dai","author_inst":"The Fifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China"},{"author_name":"Luyi Tian","author_inst":"Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Mai-Juan Ma","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Olivier Benveniste","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Frederique Gandjbakhch","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Julien Mayaux","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Olivier Lucidarme","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Bruno Fautrel","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Vlad Ratziu","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Chantal Housset","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Dominique Thabut","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Patrice Cacoub","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Fredrik Nyberg","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Community Medicine, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Jose D Posada","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Palo Alto, California, USA"},{"author_name":"Christian G Reich","author_inst":"Real World Solutions, IQVIA, Cambridge, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Lisa M Schilling","author_inst":"Data Science to Patient Value Program, Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus"},{"author_name":"Karishma Shah","author_inst":"Botnar Research Centre, Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology, and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Nigham H Shah","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Palo Alto, California, USA"},{"author_name":"Vignesh Subbian","author_inst":"College of Engineering, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA"},{"author_name":"Lin Zhang","author_inst":"1.

Translation of the replicon produces a replicase complex that amplifies and prolong SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein expression. A single prime vaccination in mice led to robust antibody responses, with neutralizing antibody titers increasing up to day 60. Activation of cell mediated immunity produced a strong viral antigen specific CD8+ T lymphocyte response. Assaying for intracellular cytokine staining for IFN-{gamma} and IL-4 positive CD4+ T helper lymphocytes as well as anti-spike glycoprotein IgG2a\/IgG1 ratios supported a strong Th1 dominant immune response. Finally, single LUNAR-COV19 vaccination at both 2 g and 10 g doses completely protected human ACE2 transgenic mice from both mortality and even measurable infection following wild-type SARS-CoV-2 challenge.

In the present study we constructed the phylo-geo-network of nCOV-2019 genomes from across India to understand the viral evolution in the country. A total of 611 full length genomes were extracted from different states of India from the EpiCov repository of GISAID initiative and NCBI. Their alignment uncovered 270 parsimony informative sites. Further, 339 genomes were divided into 51 haplogroups. The network revealed the core haplogroup as that of reference sequence NC_045512.2 (Haplogroup A1) with 157 identical sequences present across 16 states. The rest were having not more than ten identical sequences across not more than three locations. Interestingly, some locations with fewer samples have more haplogroups and most haplogroups (41) are localized exclusively to any one state only, suggesting the local evolution of viruses. The two most common lineages are B6 and B1 (Pangolin) whereas clade A2a (Covidex) appears to be the most predominant in India. However, since the pandemic is still emerging, the final outcome will be clear later only.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rezwanuzzaman Laskar","author_inst":"Aliah University"},{"author_name":"Safdar Ali","author_inst":"Aliah University"},{"author_name":"Shiwei Chen","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Yan Shan Leong","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Hwee Cheng Tan","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Summer L.

Studies confirmed significant genome differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, suggesting that the distinctions in pathogenicity might be related to genomic diversity. However, the relationship between genomic differences and SARS-CoV-2 fitness has not been fully explained, especially for open reading frame (ORF)-encoded accessory proteins. RNA viruses have a high mutation rate, but how SARS-CoV-2 mutations accelerate adaptation is not clear. This study shows that the host-genome similarity (HGS) of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly higher than that of SARS-CoV, especially in the ORF6 and ORF8 genes encoding proteins antagonizing innate immunity in vivo. A power law relationship was discovered between the HGS of ORF3b, ORF6, and N and the expression of interferon (IFN)-sensitive response element (ISRE)-containing promoters. This finding implies that high HGS of SARS-CoV-2 genome may further inhibit IFN I synthesis and cause delayed host innate immunity. An ORF1ab mutation, 10818G>T, which occurred in virus populations with high HGS but rarely in low-HGS populations, was identified in 2594 genomes with geolocations of China, the USA and Europe. The 10818G>T caused the amino acid mutation M37F in the transmembrane protein nsp6. The results suggest that the ORF6 and ORF8 genes and the mutation M37F may play important roles in causing COVID-19. The findings demonstrate that HGS analysis is a promising way to identify important genes and mutations in adaptive strains, which may help in searching potential targets for pharmaceutical agents.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Weitao Sun","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Safdar Ali","author_inst":"Aliah University"},{"author_name":"Shiwei Chen","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Yan Shan Leong","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Hwee Cheng Tan","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Summer L.

Using an online survey with 1669 respondents, we sought to understand why and how by querying about perceived barriers and motivators to physical activity that changed because of the pandemic, and how those changes impacted mental health. Consistent with prior reports, our respondents were less physically active (aerobic activity, -11%, p <0.05; strength-based activity, -30%, p<0.01) and more sedentary (+11%, p<0.01) during the pandemic as compared to 6-months before. The pandemic also increased psychological stress (+22%, p <0.01) and brought on moderate symptoms of anxiety and depression. Respondents whose mental health deteriorated the most were also the ones who were least active (depression r = -.21, p<0.01; anxiety r = -.12, p<0.01). The majority of respondents were unmotivated to exercise because they were too anxious (+8%, p <0.01), lacked social support (+6%, p =<0.01), or had limited access to equipment (+23%, p <0.01) or space (+41%, p <0.01). The respondents who were able to stay active reported feeling less motivated by physical health outcomes such as weight loss (-7%, p<0.01) or strength (-14%, p<0.01) and instead more motivated by mental health outcomes such as anxiety relief (+14%, p <0.01). Coupled with previous work demonstrating a direct relationship between mental health and physical activity, these results highlight the potential protective effect of physical activity on mental health and point to the need for psychological support to overcome perceived barriers so that people can continue to be physically active during stressful times like the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maryam  Yvonne Marashi","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Emma Nicholson","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Michelle Ogrodnik","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Barbara Fenesi","author_inst":"University of Western Ontario: Western University"},{"author_name":"Jennifer  J Heisz","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Summer L.

Determining antibody status against SARS-CoV-2 in candidates and recipients will be important to understand the epidemiology and clinical course of COVID-19 infection in this population. There are multiple antibody tests to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, but their performance varies according to their platforms and the antigenic targets, making interpretation of the results challenging. Additionally, currently available serological tests do not exclude the possibility that positive responses are due to cross reactive antibodies to community coronaviruses. This study describes the development and validation of a high throughput multiplex bead based antibody detection assay with the capacity to identify, simultaneously, patient responses to five distinct SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The antibody response to these proteins are SARS-CoV-2 specific as antibodies against four community coronaviruses do not cross-react. Assay configuration is essentially identical to the single antigen bead assays used in the majority of histocompatibility laboratories around the world and could easily be implemented into routine screening of transplant candidates and recipients. This new assay provides a novel tool to interrogate the spectrum of immune responses to SAR-CoV-2 and is uniquely suitable for use in the transplant setting.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robert A Bray","author_inst":"Emory University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jar-How Lee","author_inst":"terasaki Innovation Center"},{"author_name":"Peter Brescia","author_inst":"Th-ermo-Fisher Scientific"},{"author_name":"Deepali Kumar","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"},{"author_name":"Thoa Nong","author_inst":"Thermo-Fisher Scientific"},{"author_name":"Remi Shih","author_inst":"Thermo-Fisher Scientific"},{"author_name":"E Steve Woodle","author_inst":"University of Cincinnati School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jonathan S Maltzman","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine and VA Palo Alto Health Care System, Palo Alto, CA"},{"author_name":"Howard M Gebel","author_inst":"Emory University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Paula Hartman","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jenny Park","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Maher Alayyoubi","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Hari Bhaskaran","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Adrian Dukanovic","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Belle Bao","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Brenda Clemente","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jerel Vega","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Scott Roberts","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jose A.

Methods and Materials Two studies were completed to determine clinical performance. In the first study, nasal specimens and either nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal specimens from 251 participants with COVID-19 symptoms (<=7 days from symptom onset [DSO]), >=18 years of age, were utilized to compare Veritor with the Lyra SARS-CoV-2 PCR Assay (Lyra). In the second study, nasal specimens from 361 participants with COVID-19 symptoms (<=5 DSO), >=18 years of age, were utilized to compare performance of Veritor to that of the Sofia 2 SARS Antigen FIA test (Sofia 2). Positive, negative, and overall percent agreement (PPA, NPA, and OPA, respectively) were the primary outcomes. Results In study 1, PPA for Veritor, compared to Lyra, ranged from 81.8%-87.5% for 0-1 through 0-6 DSO ranges. In study 2, Veritor had a PPA, NPA, and OPA of 97.4%, 98.1%, and 98.1%, respectively, with Sofia 2. Discordant analysis showed one Lyra positive missed by Veritor and five Lyra positives missed by Sofia 2; one Veritor positive result was negative by Lyra. Conclusions Veritor met FDA-EUA acceptance criteria for SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing (>=80% PPA point estimate) for the 0-5 and 0-6 DSO ranges. Veritor and Sofia 2 showed a high degree of agreement for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The Veritor test should facilitate rapid and reliable results for COVID-19 diagnosis utilizing easy-to-collect nasal swabs.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stephen Young","author_inst":"TriCore Reference Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Taylor","author_inst":"Louisiana State University Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Catherine Cammarata","author_inst":"Louisiana State University Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Celine Roger-Dalbert","author_inst":"Becton, Dickinson and Company"},{"author_name":"Amanda Montano","author_inst":"Tricore Reference Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Christen Griego-Fullbright","author_inst":"TriCore Reference Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Cameron Burgard","author_inst":"TriCore Reference Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Catherine Fernandez","author_inst":"Becton, Dickinson and Company"},{"author_name":"Karen Eckert","author_inst":"Becton, Dickinson and Company"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey C Andrews","author_inst":"Becton, Dickinson and Company"},{"author_name":"Huimiao Ren","author_inst":"Becton, Dickinson and Company"},{"author_name":"Joseph Allen","author_inst":"STAT Research"},{"author_name":"Ronald Ackerman","author_inst":"Comprehensive Clinical Research, LLC."},{"author_name":"Devin Gary","author_inst":"Becton, Dickinson and Company"},{"author_name":"Charles Cooper","author_inst":"Becton, Dickinson and Company"},{"author_name":"Brenda Clemente","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jerel Vega","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Scott Roberts","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jose A.

Since then, collection of CCP from COVID-19 recovered patients has been implemented in several donor centers across the country. Childrens Hospital Colorado rapidly put into practice a CCP collection protocol, necessitating the development and implementation of assays to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in CCP units. We evaluated 87 separate units of CCP collected from 36 donors over two to four sequential donations using both antigen-binding assays for SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and spike antigens, and a live virus focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT50). Our data shows that the majority of donors (83 percent) had a FRNT50 titer of 1\/80 or greater, and 61 percent had a titer greater than or equal to 1\/160, which meet the FDA criteria for acceptable CCP units. Additionally, our data indicates that analysis of antibodies to a single SARS-CoV-2 antigen is likely to miss a percentage of seroconverters. These individuals, however, tend to have neutralizing antibody titers of less than 1\/80. Of note, there was considerable variability in the short term, sustained antibody response, measured by neutralizing antibody titers, among our donor population.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kyle Annen","author_inst":"University of Colorado School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Thomas E Morrison","author_inst":"University of Colorado School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Melkon G DomBourian","author_inst":"University of Colorado School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mary K McCarthy","author_inst":"University of Colorado School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Leah Huey","author_inst":"University of Colorado School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Patricia A Merkel","author_inst":"University of Colorado School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Gillian Andersen","author_inst":"Children's Hospital, Colorado"},{"author_name":"Eileen Schwartz","author_inst":"Children's Hospital, Colorado"},{"author_name":"Vijaya Knight","author_inst":"University of Colorado School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey C Andrews","author_inst":"Becton, Dickinson and Company"},{"author_name":"Huimiao Ren","author_inst":"Becton, Dickinson and Company"},{"author_name":"Joseph Allen","author_inst":"STAT Research"},{"author_name":"Ronald Ackerman","author_inst":"Comprehensive Clinical Research, LLC."},{"author_name":"Devin Gary","author_inst":"Becton, Dickinson and Company"},{"author_name":"Charles Cooper","author_inst":"Becton, Dickinson and Company"},{"author_name":"Brenda Clemente","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jerel Vega","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Scott Roberts","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jose A.

Clusters of infection occurred in staff working in wards with patients known to have COVID-19 infection. Staff infections peaked when COVID-19 infected inpatient numbers were highest, and density of patients and certain patient behaviours were noted by staff to be linked to possible transmission events. Three small outbreaks on other wards occurred but all were recognised and brought under control. Availability of rapid turn-around staff testing, and regular review of local data and obtaining feedback from staff helped identify useful interventions which were iteratively implemented. Attention to staff wellbeing was critical to the response and a comprehensive support service was implemented. Conclusion(s): A comprehensive multimodal approach to containment was instituted with iterative refinement based on frontline workers observations and ongoing analysis of local data in real time.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kirsty Buising","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Deborah Williamson","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Cowie","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jennifer MacLachlan","author_inst":"Royal Melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Liz Orr","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christopher MacIsaac","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Eloise Williams","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Katherine Bond","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Stephen Muhi","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"James McCarthy","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Andrea Maier","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lou Irving","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Denise Heinjus","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cate Kelly","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Caroline Marshall","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Brenda Clemente","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jerel Vega","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Scott Roberts","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jose A.

We conducted a study to compare the viral loads in 42 patients with COVID-19. Both NPS and saliva specimens were simultaneously obtained at a median of 6 days (range, 1-12) after symptom onset. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 34 (81%) using NPS (median Ct value [IQR]=27.4 [21.3, 35.6]) and 38 (90%) using saliva (median Ct value [IQR]= 28.9 [23.1, 33.6]). There was no significance difference between them (Wilcoxon signed rank test: P=0.79) and Kendall's W was 0.82, showing a high degree of agreement, indicating equivalent viral loads in NPS and saliva. After symptom onset, the Ct values of both NPS and saliva continued to increase over time, with no substantial difference. Self-collected saliva has a detection sensitivity comparable to that of NPS and is a useful diagnostic tool with mitigating uncomfortable process and the risk of aerosol transmission to healthcare workers.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Isao Yokota","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Takeshi Hattori","author_inst":"Hokkaido Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Peter Y Shane","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Satoshi Konno","author_inst":"Hokkaido University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Atsushi Nagasaka","author_inst":"Sapporo City General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kimihiro Takeyabu","author_inst":"Otaru Kyokai Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shinichi Fujisawa","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Mutsumi Nishida","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Takanori Teshima","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"James McCarthy","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Andrea Maier","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lou Irving","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Denise Heinjus","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cate Kelly","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Caroline Marshall","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Brenda Clemente","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jerel Vega","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Scott Roberts","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jose A.

FIB-4 is a noninvasive index of readily available laboratory measurements that represents hepatic fibrosis. The association of FIB-4 with COVID-19 outcomes has not been previously evaluated. Methods FIB-4 was evaluated at admission in a cohort of 267 patients admitted with early-stage COVID-19 confirmed through RT-PCR. Hazard of ventilator use and of high-flow oxygen was estimated using Cox regression models controlled for covariates. Risk of progress to severe cases and of death\/prolonged hospitalization (>30 days) were estimated using logistic regression models controlled for same covariates. Results Forty-one (15%) patients progressed to severe cases, 36 (14%) required high-flow oxygen support, 10 (4%) required mechanical ventilator support, and 1 died. Patients with high FIB-4 score (>3.25) were more likely to be older with pre-existing conditions. FIB-4 between 1.45-3.25 was associated with over 5-fold (95% CI: 1.2-28) increased hazard of high-flow oxygen use, over 4-fold (95% CI: 1.5-14.6) increased odds of progress to severe stage, and over 3-fold (95% CI: 1.4-7.7) increased odds of death or prolonged hospitalization. FIB-4>3.25 was associated with over 12-fold (95% CI: 2.3-68. 7) increased hazard of high-flow oxygen use and over 11-fold (95% CI: 3.1-45) increased risk of progress to severe disease. All associations were independent of sex, number of comorbidities, and inflammatory markers (D-dimer, C-reactive protein). Conclusions FIB-4 at early-stage of COVID-19 disease had an independent and dose-dependent association with adverse outcomes during hospitalization. FIB-4 provided significant prognostic value to adverse outcomes among COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fangfei Xiang","author_inst":"Guangzhou No. 8 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jing Sun","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Po-Hung Chen","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Peijin Han","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Haipeng Zheng","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shujiang Cai","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gregory D Kirk","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Mutsumi Nishida","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Takanori Teshima","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"James McCarthy","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Andrea Maier","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lou Irving","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Denise Heinjus","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cate Kelly","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Caroline Marshall","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Brenda Clemente","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jerel Vega","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Scott Roberts","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jose A.

Widespread, population level testing to detect active and past infections is critical to curb the COVID-19 pandemic. Antibody (serological) testing is the only option for detecting past infections outside the narrow window accessible to nucleic acid-based tests. However, currently available serological assays commonly lack scalability. Here, we describe the development of a rapid homogenous serological assay for the detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in patient plasma. We show that the fluorescence-based assay accurately detects seroconversion in COVID-19 patients from less than 1 microliter of plasma. Using a cohort of samples from COVID-19 infected or healthy individuals, we demonstrate detection with 100% sensitivity and specificity. This assay addresses an important need for a robust, low barrier to implementation, and scalable serological assay with complementary strengths to currently available serological platforms.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hong Yue","author_inst":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Rados\u0142aw P Nowak","author_inst":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Daan Overwijn","author_inst":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"N Connor Payne","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Fischinger","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Caroline Atyeo","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Lindsey R Baden","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Eric James Nilles","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth W Karlson","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xu G Yu","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Z Li","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Galit Alter","author_inst":"Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Ralph Mazitschek","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Eric S Fischer","author_inst":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Caroline Marshall","author_inst":"Royal melbourne Hospital"},{"author_name":"Brenda Clemente","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jerel Vega","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Scott Roberts","author_inst":"Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jose A.

Design: We used a stochastic agent-based microsimulation model to create multiple simulations of possible epidemic trajectories that could eventuate over a five-week period following prolonged low levels of community transmission. Setting: We calibrated the model to the epidemiological and policy environment in New South Wales, Australia, at the end of August 2020. Participants: None Intervention: From September 1, 2020, we ran the stochastic model with the same initial conditions (i.e., those prevailing at August 31, 2020), and analyzed the outputs of the model to determine the probability of exceeding a given number of new diagnoses and active cases within five weeks, under three assumptions about future mask usage: a baseline scenario of 30% uptake, a scenario assuming no mask usage, and a scenario assuming mandatory mask usage with near-universal uptake (95%). Main outcome measure: Probability of exceeding a given number of new diagnoses and active cases within five weeks. Results: The policy environment at the end of August is sufficient to slow the rate of epidemic growth, but may not stop the epidemic from growing: we estimate a 20% chance that NSW will be diagnosing at least 50 new cases per day within five weeks from the date of this analysis.
