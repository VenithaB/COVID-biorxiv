Considering constraints on production and shipping, most existing strategies seek to maximize the outflow of therapeutics, hence optimizing for rapid dissemination. Surprisingly, we find that this intuitive approach is counterproductive. The reason is that focusing strictly on the quantity of disseminated therapeutics, such strategies disregard their specific spreading patterns, most crucially, they overlook the interplay of these spreading patterns with those of the pathogens. This results in a discrepancy between supply and demand, that prohibits efficient mitigation even under optimal conditions of superfluous drug\/vaccine flow. Therefore, here, we design a dissemination strategy that naturally follows the predicted spreading patterns of the epidemic, optimizing not just for supply volume, but also for its congruency with the anticipated demand. Specifically, we show that epidemics spread relatively uniformly across all destinations, and hence we introduce an equality constraint into our dissemination that prioritizes supply homogeneity. This strategy may, at times, slow down the supply rate in certain locations, however, thanks to its egalitarian nature, which mimics the flow of the viral spread, it provides a dramatic leap in overall mitigation efficiency, saving more lives with orders of magnitude less resources.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adar Hacohen","author_inst":"Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel \/ Augmanity , Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Reuven Cohen","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel"},{"author_name":"Sol Efroni","author_inst":"Faculty of Life Sciences, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ido Bachelet","author_inst":"Augmanity, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Baruch Barzel","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel\/The Gonda Multidisciplinary Brain Research Center, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.15.20194985","rel_title":"Longitudinal analysis of the utility of liver biochemistry in hospitalised COVID-19 patients as prognostic markers","rel_date":"2020-09-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.15.20194985","rel_abs":"Background: COVID-19, the clinical syndrome caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, has been associated with deranged liver biochemistry in studies from China, Italy and the USA. However, the clinical utility of liver biochemistry as a prognostic marker of outcome for COVID-19 is currently debated. Methods: We extracted routinely collected clinical data from a large teaching hospital in the UK, matching 585 hospitalised SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive patients to 1165 hospitalised SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-negative patients for age, gender, ethnicity and pre-existing comorbidities. Liver biochemistry was compared between groups over time to determine whether derangement was associated with outcome. Results: 26.8% (157\/585) of COVID-19 patients died, compared to 11.9% (139\/1165) in the non-COVID-19 group (p<0.001). At presentation, a significantly higher proportion of the COVID-19 group had elevated alanine aminotransferase (20.7% vs. 14.6%, p=0.004) and hypoalbuminaemia (58.7% vs. 35.0%, p<0.001), compared to the non-COVID-19 group. Within the COVID-19 group, those with hypoalbuminaemia at presentation had 1.83-fold increased hazards of death compared to those with normal albumin (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.83, 95% CI 1.25-2.67), whilst the hazard of death was ~4-fold higher in those aged [&ge;]75 years (adjusted HR 3.96, 95% CI 2.59-6.04) and ~3-fold higher in those with pre-existing liver disease (adjusted HR 3.37, 95% CI 1.58-7.16). In the COVID-19 group, alkaline phosphatase increased (R=0.192, p<0.0001) and albumin declined (R=-0.123, p=0.0004) over time in patients who died. We did not find a significant association between other liver biochemistry and death. Conclusion: In this UK population, liver biochemistry is commonly deranged in patients with COVID-19 but only baseline low albumin and a rising alkaline phosphatase over time are prognostic markers for death.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tingyan Wang","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David A Smith","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Cori Campbell","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Steve Harris","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Hizni Salih","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kinga A Varnai","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Kerrie Woods","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Theresa Noble","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Oliver Freeman","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Zuzana Moysova","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Thomas Marjot","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Gwilym J Webb","author_inst":"Addenbrooke's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jim Davies","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Eleanor Barnes","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Philippa C Matthews","author_inst":"Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.15.20194258","rel_title":"COVID-19 epidemic severity is associated with timing of non-pharmaceutical interventions","rel_date":"2020-09-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.15.20194258","rel_abs":"Background: Unprecedented public health interventions including travel restrictions and national lockdowns have been implemented to stem the COVID-19 epidemic, but the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions is still debated. International comparisons are hampered by highly variable conditions under which epidemics spread and differences in the timing and scale of interventions. Cumulative COVID-19 morbidity and mortality are functions of both the rate of epidemic growth and the duration of uninhibited growth before interventions were implemented. Incomplete and sporadic testing during the early COVID-19 epidemic makes it difficult to identify how long SARS-CoV-2 was circulating in different places. SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences can be analyzed to provide an estimate of both the time of epidemic origin and the rate of early epidemic growth in different settings. Methods: We carried out a phylogenetic analysis of more than 29,000 publicly available whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences from 57 locations to estimate the time that the epidemic originated in different places. These estimates were cross-referenced with dates of the most stringent interventions in each location as well as the number of cumulative COVID-19 deaths following maximum intervention. Phylodynamic methods were used to estimate the rate of early epidemic growth and proxy estimates of epidemic size. Findings: The time elapsed between epidemic origin and maximum intervention is strongly associated with different measures of epidemic severity and explains 46% of variance in numbers infected at time of maximum intervention. The reproduction number is independently associated with epidemic severity. In multivariable regression models, epidemic severity was not associated with census population size. The time elapsed between detection of initial COVID-19 cases to interventions was not associated with epidemic severity, indicating that many locations experienced long periods of cryptic transmission. Interpretation: Locations where strong non-pharmaceutical interventions were implemented earlier experienced much less severe COVID-19 morbidity and mortality during the period of study.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Manon Ragonnet-Cronin","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Olivia Boyd","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Lily Geidelberg","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"David Jorgensen","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Fabricia F Nascimento","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Igor Siveroni","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Robert Johnson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Marc Baguelin","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Zulma M Cucunuba","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Elita Jauneikaite","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Swapnil Mishra","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Hayley A Thompson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Oliver J Watson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Neil Ferguson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Christl A Donnelly","author_inst":"Imperial College London; University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Erik Volz","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.14.20194589","rel_title":"Improved estimation of time-varying reproduction numbers at low case incidence and between epidemic waves","rel_date":"2020-09-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.14.20194589","rel_abs":"We construct a recursive Bayesian smoother, termed EpiFilter, for estimating the effective reproduction number, R, from the incidence of an infectious disease in real time and retrospectively. Our approach borrows from Kalman filtering theory, is quick and easy to compute, generalisable, deterministic and unlike many current methods, requires no change-point or window size assumptions. We model R as a flexible, hidden Markov state process and exactly solve forward-backward algorithms, to derive R estimates that incorporate all available incidence information. This unifies and extends two popular methods, EpiEstim, which considers past incidence, and the Wallinga-Teunis method, which looks forward in time. This combination of maximising information and minimising assumptions, makes EpiFilter more statistically robust in periods of low incidence, where existing methods can struggle. As a result, we find EpiFilter to be particularly suited for assessing the risk of second waves of infection, in real time.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kris Varun Parag","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Olivia Boyd","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Lily Geidelberg","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"David Jorgensen","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Fabricia F Nascimento","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Igor Siveroni","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Robert Johnson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Marc Baguelin","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Zulma M Cucunuba","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Elita Jauneikaite","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Swapnil Mishra","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Hayley A Thompson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Oliver J Watson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Neil Ferguson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Christl A Donnelly","author_inst":"Imperial College London; University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Erik Volz","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.14.20194308","rel_title":"Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and risk of future sickness","rel_date":"2020-09-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.14.20194308","rel_abs":"Background: The extent that antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 may protect against future virus-associated disease is unknown.

The US as a whole and the 10 States investigated continue to follow periods of linear infection growth that defines a boundary separating accelerated infection growth and infection decay. August 31 predictions (initiated July 27, 2020) for four States (NY, WA, MI and MN) are within 10% of actual data. Predictions for four other States (GA, IL, CA, and OH) agree between 10 and 20% of actual data. Predictions for two States (FL and NC) are greater than 20% different from actual data. Systematic differences between predictions and actual data are related to the impact of the June-July summer surge, and human behavior reactions (ie, increased face mask usage and distancing) to accelerated infection growth. Outdoor temperature effects and school re-opening effects are not apparent nor expected for August.

To meet the urgent and massive demand for the screening and diagnosis of infected individuals, many in vitro diagnostic assays using nucleic acid tests (NATs) have been urgently authorized by regulators worldwide. The limit of detection (LoD) is a crucial feature for a diagnostic assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples, and a reference standard with a well-characterized concentration or titer is of the utmost importance for LoD studies. Although several reference standards of plasmids or synthetic RNA carrying specific genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2 have already been announced, a reference standard for inactivated virus particles with accurate concentration is still needed to evaluate the complete procedure including nucleic acid extraction and to accommodate customized primer-probe sets targeting different genome sequences. Here, we performed a collaborative study to estimate the NAT-detectable units as viral genomic equivalent quantity (GEQ) of an inactivated whole-virus SARS-CoV-2 reference standard candidate using digital PCR (dPCR) on multiple commercialized platforms. The median of the quantification results (460000 {+\/-}65000 GEQ\/mL) was treated as the consensus true value of GEQ of virus particles in the reference standard. This reference standard was then used to challenge the LoDs of six officially approved diagnostic assays. Our study demonstrates that an inactivated whole virus quantified by dPCR can serve as a reference standard and provides a unified solution for assay development, quality control, and regulatory surveillance.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Haiwei Zhou","author_inst":"National Institutes for Food and Drug Control"},{"author_name":"Donglai Liu","author_inst":"National Institutes for Food and Drug Control"},{"author_name":"Liang Ma","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Devices, Bioland Laboratory (Guangzhou Regenerative Medicine and Health Guangdong Laboratory)"},{"author_name":"Tingting Ma","author_inst":"National Institutes for Food and Drug Control"},{"author_name":"Tingying Xu","author_inst":"National Institutes for Food and Drug Control"},{"author_name":"Lili Ren","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Liang Li","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sihong Xu","author_inst":"National Institutes for Food and Drug Control"},{"author_name":"Eni Andersson","author_inst":"KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab"},{"author_name":"August Jernbom Falk","author_inst":"KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab"},{"author_name":"Sofia Bergstr\u00f6m","author_inst":"KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab"},{"author_name":"Emilie Hultin","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Elisa Pin","author_inst":"KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab"},{"author_name":"Anna M\u00e5nberg","author_inst":"KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab"},{"author_name":"Peter Nilsson","author_inst":"KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SciLifeLab"},{"author_name":"My Hedhammar","author_inst":"KTH Royal Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Sophia Hober","author_inst":"KTH Royal Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Johan Mattsson","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Laila Sara Arroyo M\u00fchr","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Kalle Conneryd Lundgren","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pathology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.15.20195339","rel_title":"Association among income loss, financial strain and depressive symptoms during COVID-19: evidence from two longitudinal studies","rel_date":"2020-09-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.15.20195339","rel_abs":"Background. The COVID-19 pandemic has major ramifications for global health and the economy, with growing concerns about economic recession and implications for mental health. Here we investigated the associations between COVID-19 pandemic-related income loss with financial strain and mental health trajectories over a 1-month course. Methods. Two independent studies were conducted in the U.S and in Israel at the beginning of the outbreak (March-April 2020, T1; N = 4 171) and at a 1-month follow-up (T2; N = 1 559). Mixed-effects models were applied to assess associations among COVID-19-related income loss, financial strain, and pandemic-related worries about health, with anxiety and depression, controlling for multiple covariates including pre-COVID-19 income. Findings. In both studies, income loss and financial strain were associated with greater depressive symptoms at T1, above and beyond T1 anxiety, worries about health, and pre-COVID-19 income. Worsening of income loss was associated with exacerbation of depression at T2 in both studies. Worsening of subjective financial strain was associated with exacerbation of depression at T2 in one study (US). Interpretation. Income loss and financial strain were uniquely associated with depressive symptoms and the exacerbation of symptoms over time, above and beyond pandemic-related anxiety. Considering the painful dilemma of lockdown versus reopening, with the tradeoff between public health and economic wellbeing, our findings provide evidence that the economic impact of COVID-19 has negative implications for mental health.

Methods: A cross-sectional offline survey was carried out enrolling 406 slum dwellers (53.2% male; mean age=44.9 years [SD=12.1]; age range=18-85 years) between August and September, 2020. The face to face interview was conducted to collect data from 6 selected slum areas in Dhaka City using convenience sampling. The questionnaire consisted of informed consent along with questions concerning observational checklists, socio-demographics, and KAP. Results: A sizeable minority were observed without wearing face masks during the survey periods (18.2%) and a vast portion (97.5%) without any hand protection. The mean scores of KAP were 6.1plus-or-minus sign2.6 (out of 17), 12.3plus-or-minus sign1.7 (out of 14), and 9.8plus-or-minus sign1.6 (out of 12), respectively.

Findings: (1) during lockdown, rest diminished distress; without rest psychological distress would have been about 1.74 times greater; (2) an elevated sense of community reduced distress, a little, but elevated government satisfaction was inert. Thus, the psychological benefits of lockdown extended to political discontents; (3) most lockdown distress arose from dissatisfaction from personal relationships. Social captivity, more than isolation, proved challenging; (4-5) Health and business satisfaction were stable; were they challenged substantially more distress would have ensued. Thus, lockdown benefited psychological health by affording safety, yet only because income remained secure. These national longitudinal findings clarify the mental health effects of stringent infectious disease containment.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joseph A Bulbulia","author_inst":"Victoria University of Wellington"},{"author_name":"Sofia D Piven","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Fiona Kate Barlow","author_inst":"The University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Don E.

Whether the pandemic could change the association between cold temperature and mortality remains unknown. Objectives: We aimed to assess whether the association between cold temperature and all-cause mortality in the pandemic period has changed compared to non-COVID-19 period (2015-2019) in Italy. Methods: We collected daily all-cause mortality data and meteorological data for 107 Italian provinces from 1, January 2015 to 31, May 2020. A time-stratified case-crossover design with the distributed lag non-linear model was used to examine the association between cold temperature and all-cause mortality during the first three months (from March to May in 2020) of the COVID-19 outbreak and the same months in 2015-2019. Results: The relative risk (RR) of all-cause mortality at extreme cold temperature (2.5th percentile of temperature at 3 {degrees}C) in comparison with the minimum mortality temperature (24 {degrees}C) was 4.75 [95% confidence interval (CI): 3.90-5.79] in the pandemic period, which is more than triple higher than RR [1.41 (95%CI: 1.33-1.50)] in the same months during 2015-2019. The shift in cold-mortality association was particularly significant for people aged 65-74 years [RR (95%CI): 5.98 (3.78-9.46) in 2020 versus 1.29 (1.10-1.51) in 2015-2019], 75-84 years [5.25 (3.79-7.26) versus 1.40 (1.25-1.56)], and [&ge;] 85 years [5.03 (3.90-6.51) versus 1.52 (1.39-1.66)], but not significant for those aged 0-64 years [1.95 (1.17-3.24) versus 1.24 (1.05-1.48)]. Conclusion: The findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic enhanced the risk of cold temperature on mortality in Italy, particularly among the elderly people. Further studies are warranted to understand the exact mechanism when detailed data are available.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wenhua Yu","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Rongbin Xu","author_inst":"Monash Unviersity"},{"author_name":"Tingting Ye","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Chunlei Han","author_inst":"Binzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Shanshan Li","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Yuming Guo","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Carla A Houkamau","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Taciano L Milfont","author_inst":"University of Waikato"},{"author_name":"Danny Osborne","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Nickola C Overall","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"John H Shaver","author_inst":"University of Otago"},{"author_name":"Geoffrey Troughton","author_inst":"Victoria University of Wellington"},{"author_name":"Marc Wilson","author_inst":"Victoria University of Wellington"},{"author_name":"Kumar Yogeeswaran","author_inst":"University of Canterbury"},{"author_name":"Chris G Sibley","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Itai M Pessach","author_inst":"Sheba Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ran Barzilay","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Johan Mattsson","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Laila Sara Arroyo M\u00fchr","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Kalle Conneryd Lundgren","author_inst":"Karolinska University Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.15.20191957","rel_title":"Adherence to the test, trace and isolate system: results from a time series of 21 nationally representative surveys in the UK (the COVID-19 Rapid Survey of Adherence to Interventions and Responses  study)","rel_date":"2020-09-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.15.20191957","rel_abs":"Objectives: To investigate rates of adherence to the UKs test, trace and isolate system over time. Design: Time series of cross-sectional online surveys. Setting: Data were collected between 2 March and 5 August 2020. Participants: 42,127 responses from 31,787 people living in the UK, aged 16 years or over, are presented (21 survey waves, n{approx}2,000 per wave). Main outcome measures: Identification of the key symptoms of COVID-19 (cough, high temperature \/ fever, and loss of sense of smell or taste), self-reported adherence to self-isolation if symptomatic, requesting an antigen test if symptomatic, intention to share details of close contacts, self-reported adherence to quarantine if alerted that you had been in contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case. Results: Only 48.9% of participants (95% CI 48.2% to 49.7%) identified key symptoms of COVID-19. Self-reported adherence to test, trace and isolate behaviours was low (self-isolation 18.2%, 95% CI 16.4% to 19.9%; requesting an antigen test 11.9%, 95% CI 10.1% to 13.8%; intention to share details of close contacts 76.1%, 95% CI 75.4% to 76.8%; quarantining 10.9%, 95% CI 7.8% to 13.9%) and largely stable over time. By contrast, intention to adhere to protective measures was much higher. Non-adherence was associated with: men, younger age groups, having a dependent child in the household, lower socio-economic grade, greater hardship during the pandemic, and working in a key sector. Conclusions: Practical support and financial reimbursement is likely to improve adherence. Targeting messaging and policies to men, younger age groups, and key workers may also be necessary.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Louise E.

We assessed whether demand for self-managed medication abortion provided by a fully remote online telemedicine service increased following the emergence of COVID-19. Design: We used regression discontinuity to compare the number of requests to online telemedicine service Women on Web in eight European countries before and after they implemented lockdown measures to slow COVID-19 transmission. We examined the number deaths due to COVID-19, the degree of government-provided economic support, the severity of lockdown travel restrictions, and the medication abortion service provision model in countries with and without significant changes in requests. Setting: Eight European countries served by Women on Web. Participants: 3,915 people who made requests for self-managed abortion to Women on Web between January 1st, 2019 and June 1st, 2020. Main Outcome Measures: Percent change in requests to Women on Web before and after the emergence of COVID-19 and associated lockdown measures. Results: Five countries showed significant increases in requests, ranging from 28% in Northern Ireland (p=0.001) to 139% in Portugal (p<0.001). Two countries showed no significant change in requests, and one country, Great Britain, showed an 88% decrease in requests (p<0.001). Countries with significant increases in requests were either countries where abortion services are mainly provided in hospitals or where no abortion services are available and international travel was prohibited during lockdown. By contrast, Great Britain authorized teleconsultation for medication abortion and provision of medications by mail during the pandemic. Conclusion: These marked changes in requests for self-managed medication abortion during COVID-19 demonstrate demand for fully remote models of abortion care and an urgent need for policymakers to expand access to medication abortion by telemedicine.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abigail R.A.

However, the current pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 continues to reveal important data for understanding its behavior in pregnant women. Methods: We analyzed the records of 326,586 non-pregnant women of reproductive age and 7,444 pregnant women with no other risk factor who also had a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result to estimate adjusted prevalence (aP) and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) of COVID-19 and its requirement of hospitalization, intubation, ICU admission and case-fatality rates. Adjustment was done through Poisson regressions for age and altitude of residence and birth. Generalized binomial models were used to generate probability plots to display how each outcome varied across ages and altitudes. Results: Pregnancy was independently associated with a 15% higher probability of COVID-19 (aPR: 1.15), a 116% higher probability of its following admission (aPR: 2.169) and a 127% higher probability of ICU admission (aPR: 2.275). Also, pregnancy was associated with 84.2% higher probability of developing pneumonia (aPR: 1.842) and a 163% higher probability of its following admission (aPR: 2.639). There were no significant differences in COVID-19 case-fatality rates between pregnant and non pregnant women (1.178, 95% CI: 0.68-1.67). Conclusion: Pregnancy was associated with a higher probability of COVID-19, developing of pneumonia, hospitalization, and ICU admission. Our results also suggest that the risk of COVID-19 and its related outcomes, except for intubation, decrease with altitude.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus displays unique features including widely varying symptoms and outcomes between infected individuals. Sensitive measurement of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies would provide new insight into virus transmission dynamics, pre-existing cross-reactive immunity, and the nuances of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. To date, existing SARS-CoV-2 serology tests have limited utility due to insufficient detection of antibody levels lower than what is typically present after several days of symptoms. To measure lower quantities of SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgG, and IgA with higher resolution than existing assays, we developed a new ELISA protocol with a distinct plate washing procedure and timed plate development via use of a standard curve. This BU ELISA method exhibits very low signal from plasma or serum samples added to uncoated wells at as low as a 1:5 dilution. Use of this method revealed circulating SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein (NP) reactive antibodies from blood samples drawn prior to May 2019. Of our pre-pandemic cohort, no SARS-CoV-2 RBD-reactive IgG antibodies were detected in subjects over 70 years of age, and SARS-CoV-2 NP-reactive antibodies were present at similar levels to infected subjects in some individuals and very low in others. Also, samples drawn in May 2020 from two individuals with no symptoms or no known virus exposure contained SARS-CoV-2 RBD-reactive antibodies at intermediate amounts compared with other subject groups (higher than pre-pandemic and lower than confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected). The one asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 convalescent subject in our study possessed comparable amounts of SARS-CoV-2 NP-specific IgM and IgG but drastically lower IgA than the symptomatic counterparts. Also, our assay detected positive signal from samples that gave negative results in a commercially available Lateral Flow Device (LFD) and the EUA approved Abbott IgG chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection. We propose that this improved ELISA protocol, which is straightforward to perform, low cost, and uses readily available commercial reagents, is a useful tool to elucidate new information about SARS-CoV-2 infection and has promising implications for improved detection of all analytes measurable by this platform.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rachel Yuen","author_inst":"Boston University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Dylan Steiner","author_inst":"Boston University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Riley Pihl","author_inst":"Boston University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Chavez","author_inst":"Boston University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alex Olson","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Lillia Baird","author_inst":"Boston University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Filiz Korkmaz","author_inst":"Boston University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Patricia Urick","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Manish Sagar","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jacob Berrigan","author_inst":"Boston University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rahm Gummuluru","author_inst":"Boston University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ronald Corley","author_inst":"Boston University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Karen Quillen","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Anna Belkina","author_inst":"Boston University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Gustavo Mostoslavsky","author_inst":"Boston University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ian Rifkin","author_inst":"Boston University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yachana Kataria","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Amedeo Cappione","author_inst":"MilliporeSigma"},{"author_name":"Nina Lin","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Nahid Bhadelia","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Snyder-Cappione","author_inst":"Boston University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.11.20187369","rel_title":"Longitudinal multi-omics analysis identifies responses of megakaryocytes, erythroid cells and plasmablasts as hallmarks of severe COVID-19 trajectories","rel_date":"2020-09-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.11.20187369","rel_abs":"The pandemic spread of the potentially life-threatening disease COVID-19 requires a thorough understanding of the longitudinal dynamics of host responses. Temporal resolution of cellular features associated with a severe disease trajectory will be a pre-requisite for finding disease outcome predictors. Here, we performed a longitudinal multi-omics study using a two-centre German cohort of 13 patients (from Cologne and Kiel, cohort 1). We analysed the bulk transcriptome, bulk DNA methylome, and single-cell transcriptome (>358,000 cells, including BCR profiles) of peripheral blood samples harvested from up to 5 time points. The results from single-cell and bulk transcriptome analyses were validated in two independent cohorts of COVID-19 patients from Bonn (18 patients, cohort 2) and Nijmegen (40 patients, cohort 3), respectively. We observed an increase of proliferating, activated plasmablasts in severe COVID-19, and show a distinct expression pattern related to a hyperactive cellular metabolism of these cells. We further identified a notable expansion of type I IFN-activated circulating megakaryocytes and their progenitors, indicative of emergency megakaryopoiesis, which was confirmed in cohort 2. These changes were accompanied by increased erythropoiesis in the critical phase of the disease with features of hypoxic signalling. Finally, projecting megakaryocyte- and erythroid cell-derived co-expression modules to longitudinal blood transcriptome samples from cohort 3 confirmed an association of early temporal changes of these features with fatal COVID-19 disease outcome. In sum, our longitudinal multi-omics study demonstrates distinct cellular and gene expression dynamics upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, which point to metabolic shifts of circulating immune cells, and reveals changes in megakaryocytes and increased erythropoiesis as important outcome indicators in severe COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":72,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joana P.

D-dimer levels have been shown to positively correlate with disease severity and mortality, leading to adoption of new empiric anticoagulation protocols by many centers. We aimed to assess whether COVID-19 further increased the risk of TE events in a cancer population who tested positive for COVID-19 at Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY. The electronic medical records of 218 cancer patients were retrospectively reviewed up to April 10th, 2020. Work-up of thrombosis was done by the primary team upon clinical or laboratory suspicion. All imaging studies' reports, within 20 days of COVID-19 positive test, were reviewed for presence of new arterial or venous thrombosis. Mortality was assessed up to one month since positive COVID-19 test result. Twelve patients (5.5%) were found to have new arterial (N=6, 50%) or venous (N=6, 50%) thrombosis. Five patients (41.7%) had history of prior TE events. Incidence of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism was 1.8% and 0.5%, respectively. Arterial events occurred in the brain (66.7%), aorta (16.7%) and coronary arteries (16.7%). Median time from COVID test was 8 days (IQR, 1.5 - 11.3). Five patients (41.7%) had received either prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation for a median 2 days (IQR, 1 - 5). Median peak D-dimer within 36 hours of the TE event was 9.8 mcg\/mL (N=4 patients, IQR, 1.7 - 18.3). Mortality did not differ significantly between the patients with new TE events vs those without; mortality 41.7% vs 37.4%, respectively, p=0.77. Empiric anticoagulation did not improve mortality. Fifty percent of all TE events were arterial. The overall TE rate of 5.5% in the cancer population was not higher than the risk of general population. Our findings support the need for larger studies in the COVID-19+ cancer population.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Phaedon D Zavras","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Jacobi Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Rafi Kabarriti","author_inst":"Department of Radiation Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Vikas Mehta","author_inst":"Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head & Neck Surgery, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Goel","author_inst":"Department of Medical Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York, USA"},{"author_name":"Henny H.

Despite expected universal susceptibility to a novel pathogen, the pandemic to date has been characterized by higher observed incidence in the oldest individuals and lower incidence in children and adolescents. Differential testing by age group may explain some of these observed differences, but datasets linking case counts to public health testing volumes are uncommon. Methods: We used data from Ontario, Canada. Case data were obtained from Ontarios provincial line, while testing data were obtained from an information system with complete SARS-CoV-2 testing data for public, hospital, and private laboratories. Demographic and temporal patterns in reported case incidence, testing rates, and test positivity were explored using negative binomial regression models. Standardized morbidity and testing ratios (SMR, STR), and standardized test positivity (STP) were calculated by dividing age- and sex-specific rates by overall rates; demographic and temporal patterns in standardized ratios were explored using meta-regression. Testing adjusted SMR were estimated using linear regression models. Results: Observed disease incidence and testing rates were highest in oldest individuals and markedly lower in those aged < 20. Temporal trends in disease incidence and testing were observed, but standardizing morbidity and testing ratios eliminated temporal trends (i.e., relative patterns by age and sex remained identical regardless of epidemic phase). After adjustment for testing frequency, SMR were lowest in children and adults aged 70 and older, approximately the same in adolescents as in the population as a whole and elevated in young adults (aged 20-29 years), providing a markedly different picture of the epidemic than seen with crude SMR or case-based incidence. Test-adjusted SMR were validated using seroprevalence data (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.82, P = 0.04). Conclusions: Surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 infection is typically performed using only test-positive case data, without adjustment for testing frequency. Older adults are tested more frequently, likely due to increased disease severity, while children are under-tested. Adjustment for testing frequency results in a very different picture of SARS-CoV-2 infection risk by age, one that is consistent with estimates obtained through serological testing.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Fisman","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Amy Greer","author_inst":"University of Guelph"},{"author_name":"Michael Hillmer","author_inst":"Ontario Ministry of Health"},{"author_name":"Sheila O'Brien","author_inst":"Canadian Blood Services"},{"author_name":"Steven J.

This study investigates the interaction between influenza and COVID-19 during the latter part of the 2019-20 influenza season in England. Methods: Individuals tested for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 were extracted from national surveillance systems between 20\/01\/2020 and 25\/04\/2020. To estimate influenza infection on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, univariable and multivariable analyses on the odds of SARS-CoV-2 in those who tested positive for influenza compared to those who tested negative for influenza. To assess whether a coinfection was associated with severe SARS-CoV-2 outcome, univariable and multivariable analyses on the odds of death adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidity and coinfection status. Findings: The risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 was 68% lower among influenza positive cases, suggesting possible pathogenic competition between the two viruses. Patients with a coinfection had a risk of death of 5.92 (95% CI, 3.21-10.91) times greater than among those with neither influenza nor SARS-CoV-2 suggesting possible synergistic effects in coinfected individuals. The odds of ventilator use or death and ICU admission or death was greatest among coinfection patients showing strong evidence of an interaction effect compared to SARS-CoV-2\/influenza acting independently. Interpretation: Cocirculation of these viruses could have a significant impact on morbidity, mortality and health service demand. Testing for influenza alongside SARS-CoV-2 and maximising influenza vaccine uptake should be prioritised to mitigate these risks.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julia Stowe","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Elise Tessier","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Hongxin Zhao","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Guy","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Berit Muller-Pebody","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Maria Zambon","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Nick Andrews","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Mary Ramsay","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Jamie Lopez Bernal","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Josephs-Spaulding","author_inst":"Institute for Experimental Medicine, University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Philipp Koehler","author_inst":"Department I of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Cologne and University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany; German Center for Infection Res"},{"author_name":"Axel Kuenstner","author_inst":"Luebeck Institute of Experimental Dermatology, University of Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany."},{"author_name":"Elisa Rosati","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel and University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany"},{"author_name":"Anna C.

Neutrophils play a key role in the lung injury characteristic of non-COVID-19 ARDS, but a relative paucity of these cells is observed at post-mortem in lung tissue of patients who succumb to infection with SARS-CoV-2. With emerging evidence of a dysregulated innate immune response in COVID-19, we undertook a functional proteomic survey of circulating neutrophil populations, comparing patients with COVID-19 ARDS, non-COVID-19 ARDS, moderate COVID-19, and healthy controls. We observe that expansion of the circulating neutrophil compartment and the presence of activated low and normal density mature and immature neutrophil populations occurs in both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS. In contrast, release of neutrophil granule proteins, neutrophil activation of the clotting cascade and formation of neutrophil platelet aggregates is significantly increased in COVID-19 ARDS. Importantly, activation of components of the neutrophil type I IFN responses is specific to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and linked to metabolic rewiring. Together this work highlights how differential activation of circulating neutrophil populations may contribute to the pathogenesis of ARDS, identifying processes that are specific to COVID-19 ARDS.","rel_num_authors":33,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Leila Reyes","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Manuel Alejandro Sanchez-Garcia","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Tyler Morrison","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Andrew JM Howden","author_inst":"University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Emily R Watts","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Simone Arienti","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Pranvera Sadiku","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Patricia Coelho","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ananda S Mirchandani","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"David Hope","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Sarah K Clark","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Jo Singleton","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Shonna Johnston","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Robert Grecian","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Azin Poon","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Sarah McNamara","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Isla Harper","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Max Head Fourman","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Alejandro J Brenes","author_inst":"University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Shalini Pathak","author_inst":"University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Amy Lloyd","author_inst":"University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Gio Rodriguez Blanco","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Alex Von Kriegsheim","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Bart Ghesquiere","author_inst":"Vesalius Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Wesley Vermaelen","author_inst":"Vesalius Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Camila T Cologna","author_inst":"Vesalius Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Kevin Dhaliwal","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Nik Hirani","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"David Dockrell","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Moira KB Whyte","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"David M Griffith","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Doreen A Cantrell","author_inst":"University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Sarah R Walmsley","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Marc P.

We characterized the utilization of medicines as prescribed in routine practice amongst patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in South Korea, China, Spain, and the USA. Design: International network cohort Setting: Hospital electronic health records from Columbia University Irving Medical Centre (NYC, USA), Stanford (CA, USA), Tufts (MA, USA), Premier (USA), Optum EHR (USA), department of veterans affairs (USA), NFHCRD (Honghu, China) and HM Hospitals (Spain); and nationwide claims from HIRA (South Korea) Participants: patients hospitalized for COVID-19 from January to June 2020 Main outcome measures: Prescription\/dispensation of any medicine on or 30 days after hospital admission date Analyses: Number and percentage of users overall and over time Results: 71,921 people were included: 304 from China, 2,089 from Spain, 7,599 from South Korea, and 61,929 from the USA. A total of 3,455 medicines were identified. Common repurposed medicines included hydroxychloroquine (<2% in NFHCRD to 85.4% in HM), azithromycin (4.9% in NFHCRD to 56.5% in HM), lopinavir\/ritonavir (<3% in all US but 34.9% in HIRA and 56.5% in HM), and umifenovir (0% in all except 78.3% in NFHCRD). Adjunctive medicines were used with great variability, with the ten most used treatments being (in descending order): bemiparin, enoxaparin, heparin, ceftriaxone, aspirin, vitamin D, famotidine, vitamin C, dexamethasone, and metformin. Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin increased rapidly in use in March-April but declined steeply in May-June. Conclusions: Multiple medicines were used in the first months of COVID-19 pandemic, with substantial geographic and temporal variation. Hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir-ritonavir, and umifenovir (in China only) were the most prescribed repurposed medicines.

In this work, we propose an agent-based model of the epidemic in a confined space of agents representing humans. An extension to the SEIR model allows us to consider the difference between the appearance (black-box view) of the spread of disease, and the real situation (glass-box view). Our model allows for simulations of lockdowns, social distancing, personal hygiene, quarantine, and hospitalization, with further considerations of different parameters such as the extent to which hygiene and social distancing are observed in a population. Our results give qualitative indications of the effects of various policies and parameters; for instance, that lockdowns by themselves are extremely unlikely to bring an end to an epidemic and may indeed make things worse, that social distancing matters more than personal hygiene, and that the growth of infection comes down significantly for moderately high levels of social distancing and hygiene, even in the absence of herd immunity.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ashutosh Trivedi","author_inst":"Spext Co."},{"author_name":"Nanda Kishore Sreenivas","author_inst":"Oracle"},{"author_name":"Shrisha Rao","author_inst":"International Institute of Information Technology - Bangalore"},{"author_name":"Waheed-Ul-Rahman Ahmed","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology, and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford; College of Medicine and Health, University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Heba Alghoul","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Islamic University of Gaza, Palestine"},{"author_name":"Osaid Alser","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston"},{"author_name":"Thamir M Alshammari","author_inst":"Medication Safety Research Chair, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Carlos Areia","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"William Carter","author_inst":"Data Science to Patient Value Program, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Paula Casajust","author_inst":"Real-World Evidence, Trial Form Support, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Dalia Dawoud","author_inst":"Cairo University, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo, Egypt."},{"author_name":"Asieh Golozar","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA ; Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Tarrytown, NY, US"},{"author_name":"Jitendra Jonnagaddala","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Community Medicine, UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Paras Mehta","author_inst":"College of Medicine, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA"},{"author_name":"Gong Menchung","author_inst":"DHC Technologies Co.

COVID-19 vaccination programme success will rely on public willingness to be vaccinated. Methods: We used a multi-methods approach - involving an online cross-sectional survey and semi-structured interviews - to investigate parents' and guardians' views on the acceptability of a future COVID-19 vaccine. 1252 parents and guardians (aged 16+ years) who reported living in England with a child aged 18 months or under completed the survey. Nineteen survey respondents were interviewed. Findings: Most participants reported they would definitely accept or were unsure but leaning towards accepting a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves (Definitely 55.8%; Unsure but leaning towards yes 34.3%) and their child\/children (Definitely 48.2%; Unsure but leaning towards yes 40.9%). Less than 4% of participants reported that they would definitely not accept a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves or their child\/children. Participants were more likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves than for their child\/children. Participants that self-reported as Black, Asian, Chinese, Mixed or Other ethnicity were almost 3 times more likely to reject a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves and their children than White British, White Irish and White Other participants. Respondents from lower income households were also more likely to reject a COVID-19 vaccine. The main reason for vaccine acceptance was for self-protection from COVID-19. Common concerns were around COVID-19 vaccine safety and effectiveness, which were largely prompted by the newness and rapid development of the vaccine. Conclusion: To alleviate concerns, information on how COVID-19 vaccines are developed and tested, including their safety and efficacy, must be communicated clearly to the public. To prevent inequalities in uptake, it is crucial to understand and address factors that may affect COVID-19 vaccine acceptability in ethnic minority and lower-income groups who are disproportionately affected by COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sadie L Bell","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Richard Clarke","author_inst":"Newcastle University London"},{"author_name":"Sandra Mounier-Jack","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jemma L Walker","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Pauline Paterson","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Osaid Alser","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston"},{"author_name":"Thamir M Alshammari","author_inst":"Medication Safety Research Chair, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Carlos Areia","author_inst":"Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"William Carter","author_inst":"Data Science to Patient Value Program, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA"},{"author_name":"Paula Casajust","author_inst":"Real-World Evidence, Trial Form Support, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Dalia Dawoud","author_inst":"Cairo University, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo, Egypt."},{"author_name":"Asieh Golozar","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA ; Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Tarrytown, NY, US"},{"author_name":"Jitendra Jonnagaddala","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Community Medicine, UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Paras Mehta","author_inst":"College of Medicine, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA"},{"author_name":"Gong Menchung","author_inst":"DHC Technologies Co.

This has led to a drastic change in the routine management of non-communicable diseases with a potential long-term impact on patient health care. We investigated the management of non-COVID-19 patients across all medical specialties during the pandemic in Italy. Methods: A PRISMA guideline-based systematic review of the available literature was performed using PubMed, Embase, and Scopus, restricting the search to the main outbreak period in Italy (from 20 February to 22 June, 2020). We selected articles in English or Italian that detailed changes in the Italian hospital care for non-COVID-19 patients due to the pandemic. Our keywords included all medical specialties in combination with our geographical focus (Italy) and COVID-19. Findings: Of the 4643 potentially eligible studies identified by the search, 247 studies were included in the systematic review. A decrease in the management of emergencies in non-COVID patients was found together with an increase in mortality. Similarly, non-deferrable conditions met a tendency toward decreased diagnosis. All specialties have been affected by the reorganization of healthcare provision in the hub-and-spoke system and have benefited from telemedicine during the pandemic. Interpretation: Our work highlights the changes taking place in the Italian public healthcare system in order to tackle the developing health crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings of our review may be useful to analyze future directions for the healthcare system in the case of new pandemic scenarios.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gianmarco Lugli","author_inst":"Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of Florence, Florence, Italy"},{"author_name":"Matteo Maria Ottaviani","author_inst":"Sant'Anna School of Avdanced Studies, Pisa, Italy"},{"author_name":"Annarita Botta","author_inst":"Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of Florence, Florence, Italy"},{"author_name":"Guido Ascione","author_inst":"Department of Cardiac Surgery, IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Bruschi","author_inst":"Rizzoli Orthopaedic Insititute, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"},{"author_name":"Federico Cagnazzo","author_inst":"Department of Neuroradiology, Hopital Gui de Chauliac, Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Zammarchi Lorenzo","author_inst":"Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of Florence, Florence, Italy."},{"author_name":"Paola Romagnani","author_inst":"Nephrology and Dialysis Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Meyer Children's University Hospital, Florence, Italy"},{"author_name":"Tommaso Portaluri","author_inst":"CEST Centre for Excellence and Transdisciplinary Studies, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Paula Casajust","author_inst":"Real-World Evidence, Trial Form Support, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Dalia Dawoud","author_inst":"Cairo University, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo, Egypt."},{"author_name":"Asieh Golozar","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA ; Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Tarrytown, NY, US"},{"author_name":"Jitendra Jonnagaddala","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Community Medicine, UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Paras Mehta","author_inst":"College of Medicine, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA"},{"author_name":"Gong Menchung","author_inst":"DHC Technologies Co.

Methods: A rapid systematic qualitative review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA and ENTREQ guidelines. A comprehensive systematic search was carried out in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, Global Health, CINAHL and Web of Science. Included papers (i) report on primary qualitative studies (ii) of the barriers and facilitators to the implementation of social distancing measures (iii) in potentially epidemic infectious diseases. After critical appraisal and standardised data extraction, a meta-ethnographical approach was used for synthesis. Review findings were assessed for strength and reliability using CerQUAL. Results: 28 papers were included from the systematic search that yielded 5620 results. One additional paper was found by searching references. The review identifies two broad categories of barriers to social distancing measures: individual- or community-level psychological or sociological phenomena, and perceived shortcomings in governmental action. Based on this, 25 themes are identified that can be addressed to improve the implementation of social distancing. Conclusion: There are many barriers, on different levels, to the implementation of social distancing measures. Among other findings, the review identifies the need for good communication as well as the need for authorities to provide comprehensive support as two key opportunities to increase acceptability and adherence. High-quality research is needed during the COVID-19 pandemic to better describe mechanisms by which implementation of social distancing can be improved, and, more importantly, what is already known has to be put into practice.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mahan Sadjadi","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Katharina Selda Moerschel","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark Petticrew","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Guido Ascione","author_inst":"Department of Cardiac Surgery, IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Bruschi","author_inst":"Rizzoli Orthopaedic Insititute, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"},{"author_name":"Federico Cagnazzo","author_inst":"Department of Neuroradiology, Hopital Gui de Chauliac, Montpellier"},{"author_name":"Zammarchi Lorenzo","author_inst":"Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of Florence, Florence, Italy."},{"author_name":"Paola Romagnani","author_inst":"Nephrology and Dialysis Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Meyer Children's University Hospital, Florence, Italy"},{"author_name":"Tommaso Portaluri","author_inst":"CEST Centre for Excellence and Transdisciplinary Studies, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Paula Casajust","author_inst":"Real-World Evidence, Trial Form Support, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Dalia Dawoud","author_inst":"Cairo University, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo, Egypt."},{"author_name":"Asieh Golozar","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA ; Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Tarrytown, NY, US"},{"author_name":"Jitendra Jonnagaddala","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Community Medicine, UNSW Sydney"},{"author_name":"Paras Mehta","author_inst":"College of Medicine, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA"},{"author_name":"Gong Menchung","author_inst":"DHC Technologies Co.

We conducted a nationwide survey to assess self-reported discrimination and concern for physical assault due to COVID-19 across racial\/ethnic groups, including diverse subgroups of Asians. Results. Chinese respondents experienced the largest change (15% increase) in proportion of respondents reporting discrimination from 2019 to 2020 (P<.01). Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, and Other API showed up to 3.9 times increased odds of self-reported racial\/ethnic discrimination due to COVID-19 and, with the addition of Filipino, experienced up to 5.4 times increased odds of concern for physical assault due to COVID-19 compared to Whites. Conclusions. Our study is the first to examine self-reported discrimination and concern for physical assault due to COVID-19 in subgroups of Asian Americans, finding that East (Chinese, Korean, Japanese) and Southeast (Vietnamese, Filipino) Asian Americans have been disproportionately affected.
