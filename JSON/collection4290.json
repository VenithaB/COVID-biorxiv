We hypothesized the differential COVID-19 severity observed among European countries could be associated with the Zn-deficiency prevalence. The COVID-19 data from different stages of pandemic, i.e., 8 April, 12 and 26 May 2020, were analyzed for covariation with the estimated Zn-deficiency. A significant, relatively stable, but negative correlation of Zn-deficiency with cases per million for the time period [r(20): -0.4930 to -0.5335, p-value: 0.02720 to 0.0154] and a steady improvement of covariation with deaths per million [r(20): -0.4056; p-value: 0.0760 on 26 May 2020] was observed.

The CDC has issued a recommended panel of PCR-based test sets that entail several primer\/probe sets that target the SARS-CoV-2 N-gene, but also one that targets the human RNase P gene (h-RP) as a positive control for RNA extraction and\/or reverse-transcription (RT) efficacy.\n\nWe discovered that the CDC-recommended h-RP primer\/probe set has a faulty design, because both PCR primers are located in the same exon, which allows for unwanted PCR-amplification of background genomic DNA (gDNA). By removing RNA from nose-swab samples by an RNase treatment, we showed that the presence of gDNA in samples resulted in false-positive signals for the h-RP test control. This is rather serious, because it could lead to false-negative test outcomes, since the CDC interpretation of an absent SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR signal plus a positive h-RP rRT-PCR signal is interpreted as \"2019-nCoV not detected\", whereas a false-positive h-RP rRT-PCR signal resulting from amplification of gDNA should be interpreted as \"Invalid Result\" and the procedure should be repeated.\n\nIn order to overhaul the faulty h-RP rRT-PCR primer\/probe set with minimal modification, we designed and tested several new h-RP reverse primers. Replacement of the CDC-recommended PCR reverse primer with our selected exon-exon junction reverse primer corrected the problem of false-positive results with this important SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test control and thus eliminated the problem of potential false-negative COVID-19 diagnoses.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rob J.

Typically, SARS-CoV caused SARS pandemic in 2003 and SARS-CoV-2 caused the COVID-19 pandemic recently. Both viruses have been reported to originate from bats. Thus, direct or indirect interspecies transmission from bats to humans is required for the viruses to cause pandemics. Receptor utilization is a key factor determining the host range of viruses which is critical to the interspecies transmission. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, but only ACE2s of certain animals can be utilized by the viruses. Here, we employed pseudovirus cell-entry assay to evaluate the receptor-utilizing capability of ACE2s of 20 animals by the two viruses and found that SARS-CoV-2 utilized less ACE2s than SARS-CoV, indicating a narrower host range of SARS-CoV-2. Meanwhile, pangolin CoV, another SARS-related coronavirus highly homologous to SARS-CoV-2 in its genome, yet showed similar ACE2 utilization profile with SARS-CoV rather than SARS-CoV-2. To clarify the mechanism underlying the receptor utilization, we compared the amino acid sequences of the 20 ACE2s and found 5 amino acid residues potentially critical for ACE2 utilization, including the N-terminal 20th and 42nd amino acids that may determine the different receptor utilization of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin CoV. Our studies promote the understanding of receptor utilization of pandemic coronaviruses, potentially contributing to the virus tracing, intermediate host screening and epidemic prevention for pathogenic coronaviruses.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ye Qiu","author_inst":"Hunan University"},{"author_name":"Qiong Wang","author_inst":"Hunan University"},{"author_name":"Jin-Yan Li","author_inst":"Hunan University"},{"author_name":"Ce-Heng Liao","author_inst":"Hunan University"},{"author_name":"Zhi-Jian Zhou","author_inst":"Hunan University"},{"author_name":"Xing-Yi Ge","author_inst":"Hunan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.13.149591","rel_title":"Coronavirus genomes carry the signatures of their habitats","rel_date":"2020-06-13","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.13.149591","rel_abs":"Coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2 regularly infect host tissues that express antiviral proteins (AVPs) in abundance. Understanding how they evolve to adapt or evade host immune responses is important in the effort to control the spread of COVID-19. Two AVPs that may shape viral genomes are the zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) and the apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme-catalytic polypeptide-like 3 protein (APOBEC3). The former binds to CpG dinucleotides to facilitate the degradation of viral transcripts while the latter deaminates C into U residues leading to dysfunctional transcripts. We tested the hypothesis that both APOBEC3 and ZAP may act as primary selective pressures that shape the genome of an infecting coronavirus by considering a comprehensive number of publicly available genomes for seven coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS, Bovine CoV, Murine MHV, Porcine HEV, and Canine CoV). We show that coronaviruses that regularly infect tissues with abundant AVPs have CpG-deficient and U-rich genomes; whereas viruses that do not infect tissues with abundant AVPs do not share these sequence hallmarks. In SARS-CoV-2, CpG is most deficient in the S protein region to evaded ZAP-mediated antiviral defense during cell entry. Furthermore, over four months of SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary history, we observed a marked increase in C to U substitutions in the 5 UTR and ORF1ab regions. This suggests that the two regions could be under constant C to U deamination by APOBEC3. The evolutionary pressures exerted by host immune systems onto viral genomes may motivate novel strategies for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yulong Wei","author_inst":"University of Ottawa"},{"author_name":"Jordan R.

In this study, we targeted for a design of multi-epitope based vaccine using immunoinformatics tools. We considered the structural proteins S, E and, M of SARS-CoV-2, since they facilitate the infection of the virus into host cell and using different bioinformatics tools and servers, we predicted multiple B-cell and T-cell epitopes having potential for the required vaccine design. Phylogenetic analysis provided insight on ancestral molecular changes and molecular evolutionary relationship of S, E, and M proteins. Based on the antigenicity and surface accessibility of these proteins, eight epitopes were selected by various B cell and T cell epitope prediction tools. Molecular docking was executed to interpret the binding interactions of these epitopes and three potential epitopes WTAGAAAYY, YVYSRVKNL, and GTITVEELK were selected for their noticeable higher binding affinity scores -9.1, -7.4, and -7.0 kcal\/mol, respectively.

These findings led us to evaluate the susceptibility of colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) patients to SARS-CoV-2 infection by investigation of ACE2 expression in their tumor tissues. The expression analysis revealed that both mRNA and protein levels of ACE2 had increased in colon cancer samples than normal group. Next, the prognosis analysis has indicated that the upregulation of ACE2 was not correlated with patient survival outcomes. Further assessment displayed the hypomethylation of the ACE2 gene promoter in COAD patients. Surprisingly, this methylation status has a strong negative correlation with ACE2 gene expression. The functional enrichment analysis of the genes that had similar expression patterns with ACE2 in colon cancer tissues demonstrated that they mainly enriched in Vitamin digestion and absorption, Sulfur relay system, and Fat digestion and absorption pathways. Finally, we found that ACE2 gene expression had a significant association with the immune cell infiltration levels in COAD patients. In conclusion, it has plausible that COAD patients are more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and experience severe injuries.

Early reports of hospitalised COVID-19 cases have shown relatively low frequency of chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) but increased risk of adverse outcome. The mechanisms of altered susceptibility to viral acquisition and\/or severe disease in at-risk groups are poorly understood. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are widely used in the treatment of COPD but the extent to which these therapies protect or expose patients with a COPD to risk of increased COVID-19 severity is unknown. Here, using a combination of human and animal in vitro and in vivo disease models, we show that ICS administration attenuates pulmonary expression of the SARS-CoV-2 viral entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2. This effect was mechanistically driven by suppression of type I interferon as exogenous interferon-{beta} reversed ACE2 downregulation by ICS. Mice deficient in the type I interferon-\/{beta} receptor (Ifnar1-\/-) also had reduced expression of ACE2. Collectively, these data suggest that use of ICS therapies in COPD reduces expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 and this effect may thus contribute to altered susceptibility to COVID-19 in patients with COPD.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lydia J Finney","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Glanville","author_inst":"Prokarium, London Bioscience Innovation Centre"},{"author_name":"Hugo Farne","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Julia Aniscenko","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Peter Fenwick","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Samuel Kemp","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Maria-Belen Trujillo-Torralbo","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Maria Calderazzo","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jadwiga A Wedzicha","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Patrick Mallia","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Nathan W Bartlett","author_inst":"University of Newcastle"},{"author_name":"Sebastian L Johnston","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Aran Singanayagam","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Loic Carrique","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tomas Malinauskas","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Reinis R Ruza","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Pranav Shah","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tiong Kit Tan","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Pramila Rijal","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Robert F Donat","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kerry Godwin","author_inst":"PHE, Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Karen Buttigieg","author_inst":"PHE Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Julia Tree","author_inst":"PHE Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Julika Radecke","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source"},{"author_name":"Neil G Paterson","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source"},{"author_name":"Piyasa Supasa","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Juthathip Mongkolsapaya","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Gavin R Screaton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Miles W Carroll","author_inst":"PHE Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Javier G Jaramillo","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"MIchael Knight","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"William S James","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Raymond J Owens","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"James H Naismith","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alain Townsend","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth E Fry","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Yuguang Zhao","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jingshan Ren","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David I Stuart","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kuan-Ying A Huang","author_inst":"Chang Gung University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.12.149229","rel_title":"Cystal structure of inhibitor-bound human MSPL\/TMPRSS13 that can activate high pathogenic avian influenza","rel_date":"2020-06-13","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.12.149229","rel_abs":"Viral infection is triggered when a surface envelope glycoprotein, hemagglutinin (HA), is cleaved by host cell proteins of the transmembrane protease serine (TMPRSS) family. The extracellular region of TMPRSS-2, -3, -4, and MSPL are composed of LDLA, SRCR, and SPD domains. MSPL can cleave the consensus multibasic (R-X-X\/R-R) and monobasic (Q(E)-T\/X-R) motifs on HA, while TMPRSS2 or -4 only cleaves monobasic motifs. To better understand HA cleavage mediated by MSPL, we solved the crystal structure of the extracellular region of human MSPL in complex with the furin inhibitor. The structure revealed that three domains are gathered around the C-terminal \u03b1-helix of the SPD domain. The furin inhibitor structure shows that the side chain of P1-Arg inserts into the highly conserved S1 pocket, whereas the side chain of P2-Lys interacts with the Asp\/Glu-rich 99 loop that is unique to MSPL. We also constructed a homology model of TMPRSS2, which is identified as an initiator of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The model suggests that TMPRSS2 is more suitable for Ala\/Val residues at the P2 site than Lys\/Arg residues.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ayako Ohno","author_inst":"Department of Nutritional Physiology, Institute of Medical Nutrition, Tokushima University Graduate School"},{"author_name":"Nobuo Maita","author_inst":"Division of Disease Proteomics, Institute of Advanced Medical Sciences, Tokushima University"},{"author_name":"Takanori Tabata","author_inst":"Laboratory for Pharmacology, Pharmaceutical Research Center, Asahikasei Pharma"},{"author_name":"Hikaru Nagano","author_inst":"Department of Nutrition, Graduate School of Comprehensive Rehabilitation, Osaka Prefecture University"},{"author_name":"Kyohei Arita","author_inst":"Graduate School of Medical Life Science, Yokohama City University"},{"author_name":"Mariko Ariyoshi","author_inst":"Graduate School of Frontier Biosciences, Osaka University"},{"author_name":"Takayuki Uchida","author_inst":"Department of Nutritional Physiology, Institute of Medical Nutrition, Tokushima University Graduate School"},{"author_name":"Reiko Nakao","author_inst":"Department of Nutritional Physiology, Institute of Medical Nutrition, Tokushima University Graduate School"},{"author_name":"Anayt Ulla","author_inst":"Department of Nutritional Physiology, Institute of Medical Nutrition, Tokushima University Graduate School"},{"author_name":"Kosuke Sugiura","author_inst":"Department of Nutritional Physiology, Institute of Medical Nutrition, Tokushima University Graduate School Graduate School"},{"author_name":"Koji Kishimoto","author_inst":"Graduate School of Technology, Industrial and Social Sciences, Tokushima University"},{"author_name":"Shigetada Teshima-Kondo","author_inst":"Department of Nutrition, Graduate School of Comprehensive Rehabilitation, Osaka Prefecture University"},{"author_name":"Takeshi Nikawa","author_inst":"Department of Nutritional Physiology, Institute of Medical Nutrition, Tokushima University Graduate School"},{"author_name":"Loic Carrique","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tomas Malinauskas","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Reinis R Ruza","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Pranav Shah","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tiong Kit Tan","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Pramila Rijal","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Robert F Donat","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kerry Godwin","author_inst":"PHE, Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Karen Buttigieg","author_inst":"PHE Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Julia Tree","author_inst":"PHE Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Julika Radecke","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source"},{"author_name":"Neil G Paterson","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source"},{"author_name":"Piyasa Supasa","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Juthathip Mongkolsapaya","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Gavin R Screaton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Miles W Carroll","author_inst":"PHE Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Javier G Jaramillo","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"MIchael Knight","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"William S James","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Raymond J Owens","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"James H Naismith","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alain Townsend","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth E Fry","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Yuguang Zhao","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jingshan Ren","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David I Stuart","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kuan-Ying A Huang","author_inst":"Chang Gung University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"biophysics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.12.148296","rel_title":"DeepEMhacer: a deep learning solution for cryo-EM volume post-processing","rel_date":"2020-06-13","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.12.148296","rel_abs":"Cryo-EM maps are valuable sources of information for protein structure modeling.

Most popular approaches, based on B-factor correction, suffer from limitations. For instance, they ignore the heterogeneity in the map local quality that reconstructions tend to exhibit. Aiming to overcome these problems, we present DeepEMhancer, a deep learning approach designed to perform automatic post-processing of cryo-EM maps. Trained on a dataset of pairs of experimental maps and maps sharpened using their respective atomic models, DeepEMhancer has learned how to post-process experimental maps performing masking-like and sharpening-like operations in a single step. DeepEMhancer was evaluated on a testing set of 20 different experimental maps, showing its ability to obtain much cleaner and more detailed versions of the experimental maps. Additionally, we illustrated the benefits of DeepEMhancer on the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ruben Sanchez Garcia","author_inst":"CNB-CSIC"},{"author_name":"Josue Gomez-Blanco","author_inst":"Departament of Anatomy and Cell Biology, McGill University"},{"author_name":"Ana Cuervo","author_inst":"CNB-CSIC"},{"author_name":"Jose Maria Carazo","author_inst":"CNB-CSIC"},{"author_name":"Carlos Oscar S Sorzano","author_inst":"National Center of Biotechnology (CSIC)"},{"author_name":"Javier Vargas","author_inst":"Universidad Complutense de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Takayuki Uchida","author_inst":"Department of Nutritional Physiology, Institute of Medical Nutrition, Tokushima University Graduate School"},{"author_name":"Reiko Nakao","author_inst":"Department of Nutritional Physiology, Institute of Medical Nutrition, Tokushima University Graduate School"},{"author_name":"Anayt Ulla","author_inst":"Department of Nutritional Physiology, Institute of Medical Nutrition, Tokushima University Graduate School"},{"author_name":"Kosuke Sugiura","author_inst":"Department of Nutritional Physiology, Institute of Medical Nutrition, Tokushima University Graduate School Graduate School"},{"author_name":"Koji Kishimoto","author_inst":"Graduate School of Technology, Industrial and Social Sciences, Tokushima University"},{"author_name":"Shigetada Teshima-Kondo","author_inst":"Department of Nutrition, Graduate School of Comprehensive Rehabilitation, Osaka Prefecture University"},{"author_name":"Takeshi Nikawa","author_inst":"Department of Nutritional Physiology, Institute of Medical Nutrition, Tokushima University Graduate School"},{"author_name":"Loic Carrique","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tomas Malinauskas","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Reinis R Ruza","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Pranav Shah","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tiong Kit Tan","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Pramila Rijal","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Robert F Donat","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kerry Godwin","author_inst":"PHE, Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Karen Buttigieg","author_inst":"PHE Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Julia Tree","author_inst":"PHE Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Julika Radecke","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source"},{"author_name":"Neil G Paterson","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source"},{"author_name":"Piyasa Supasa","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Juthathip Mongkolsapaya","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Gavin R Screaton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Miles W Carroll","author_inst":"PHE Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Javier G Jaramillo","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"MIchael Knight","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"William S James","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Raymond J Owens","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"James H Naismith","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alain Townsend","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth E Fry","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Yuguang Zhao","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jingshan Ren","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David I Stuart","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kuan-Ying A Huang","author_inst":"Chang Gung University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.12.20129999","rel_title":"Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Genomes from Southern California Reveals Community Transmission Pathways in the Early Stage of the US COVID-19 Pandemic","rel_date":"2020-06-13","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.12.20129999","rel_abs":"Given the higher mortality rate and widespread phenomenon of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) within the United States (US) population, understanding the mutational pattern of SARS CoV-2 has global implications for detection and therapy to prevent further escalation. Los Angeles has become an epicenter of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the US. Efforts to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 require identifying its genetic and geographic variation and understanding the drivers of these differences. For the first time, we report genetic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 genome isolates in the Los Angeles population using targeted next generation sequencing (NGS). Samples collected at Cedars Sinai Medical Center were collected from patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We identified and diagnosed 192 patients by our in-house qPCR assay. In this population, the highest frequency variants were in known mutations in the 5'UTR, AA193 protein, RdRp and the spike glycoprotein. SARS-CoV-2 transmission within the local community was tracked by integrating mutation data with patient postal codes with two predominant community spread clusters being identified. Notably, significant viral genomic diversity was identified. Less than 10 percent of the Los Angeles community samples resembled published mutational profiles of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from China, while >50 percent of the isolates shared closely similarities to those from New York State. Based on these findings we conclude SARS-CoV-2 was likely introduced into the Los Angeles community predominantly from New York State but also via multiple other independent transmission routes including but not limited to Washington State and China.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wenjuan Zhang","author_inst":"Molecular Pathology Laboratory, Department of Pathology and

following COVID-19 infection across three settings (long-term care homes (LTCH), shelters, the rest of the population) in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), Canada. Methods: We sourced person-level data from COVID-19 surveillance and reporting systems in Ontario, and examined settings with population-specific denominators (LTCH residents, shelters, and the rest of the population). We calculated cumulatively, the diagnosed cases per capita, proportion tested for COVID-19, daily and cumulative positivity, and case fatality proportion. We estimated the age- and sex-adjusted relative rate ratios for test positivity and case fatality using quasi-Poisson regression. Results: Between 01\/23\/2020-05\/25\/2020, we observed a shift in the proportion of cases: from travel-related and into LTCH and shelters. Cumulatively, compared to the rest of the population, the number of diagnosed cases per 100,000 was 59-fold and 18-fold higher among LTCH and shelter residents, respectively. By 05\/25\/2020, 77.2% of LTCH residents compared to 2.4% of the rest of the population had been tested. After adjusting for age and sex, LTCH residents were 2.5 times (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.3-2.8) more likely to test positive. Case fatality was 26.3% (915\/3485), 0.7% (3\/402), and 3.6% (506\/14133) among LTCH residents, shelter population, and others in the GTA, respectively. After adjusting for age and sex, case fatality was 1.4-fold (95%CI: 1.1-1.9) higher among LTCH residents than the rest of the population. Interpretation: Heterogeneity across micro-epidemics among specific populations in specific settings may reflect underlying heterogeneity in transmission risks, necessitating setting-specific COVID-19 prevention and mitigation strategies.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Linwei Wang","author_inst":"Unity Health Toronto"},{"author_name":"Huiting Ma","author_inst":"Unity Health Toronto"},{"author_name":"Kristy C.Y.

We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using linear mixed models with random intercept and fixed slopes to assess the association of population density and R0. We also assessed whether this association was differential across county-level main mode of transportation-to-work percentage. Counties with greater population density have greater rates of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, likely due to increased contact rates in areas with greater density. The effect of population density and R0 was not modified by private transportation use. Differential R0 by population density can assist in more accurate predictions of the rate of spread of SARS-CoV-2 in areas that do not yet have active cases.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Karla Therese L.

Considerable attention has been paid to the burden COVID-19 has put on acute care hospitals, with numerous models projecting hospitalizations and ICU needs for the duration of the pandemic. However, less attention has been paid to where these patients may go if they require additional care following hospital discharge. As COVID-19 patients recover from severe infections, many of them require additional care. Yet with post-acute care facilities averaging 85\\% capacity prior to the pandemic and the significant potential for outbreaks, consideration of the downstream effects of the surge of hospitalized COVID-19 patients is critical. Here, we present a method for projecting COVID-19 post-acute care needs. Our model is designed to take the output from any of the numerous epidemiological models (hospital discharges) and estimate the flow of patients to post-acute care services, thus providing a similar surge planning model for post-acute care services. Using data from the University of Utah Hospital, we find that for those who require specialized post-acute care, the majority require either home health care or skilled nursing facilities. Likewise, we find the expected peak in post-acute care occurs about two weeks after the expected peak for acute care hospitalizations, a result of the duration of hospitalization. This short delay between acute care and post-acute care surges highlights the importance of considering the organization necessary to accommodate the influx of recovering COVID patients and protect non-COVID patients prior to the peak in acute care hospitalizations. We developed this model to guide policymakers in addressing the \"aftershocks\" of discharged patients requiring further supportive care; while we only show the outcomes for discharges based on preliminary data from the University of Utah Hospital, we suggest alternative uses for our model including adapting it to explore potential alternative strategies for addressing the surge in acute care facilities during future pandemic waves.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matthew Maloney","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Ryan Morley","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Robert Checketts","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Peter Weir","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Darryl Barfuss","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Hannah R Meredith","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Michelle G Hofmann","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Matthew H Samore","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Lindsay T Keegan","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Mare-Claude Boily","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Stephen Hwang","author_inst":"Unity Health Toronto"},{"author_name":"Sharon Straus","author_inst":"Unity Health Toronto"},{"author_name":"Stefan Baral","author_inst":"JHSPH"},{"author_name":"Sharmistha Mishra","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Tomas Malinauskas","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Reinis R Ruza","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Pranav Shah","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tiong Kit Tan","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Pramila Rijal","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Robert F Donat","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kerry Godwin","author_inst":"PHE, Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Karen Buttigieg","author_inst":"PHE Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Julia Tree","author_inst":"PHE Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Julika Radecke","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source"},{"author_name":"Neil G Paterson","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source"},{"author_name":"Piyasa Supasa","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Juthathip Mongkolsapaya","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Gavin R Screaton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Miles W Carroll","author_inst":"PHE Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Javier G Jaramillo","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"MIchael Knight","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"William S James","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Raymond J Owens","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"James H Naismith","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alain Townsend","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth E Fry","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Yuguang Zhao","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jingshan Ren","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David I Stuart","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kuan-Ying A Huang","author_inst":"Chang Gung University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.13.20130013","rel_title":"Impacts of regional climate on the COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-06-13","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.13.20130013","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic had led to 500000 confirmed death by June 30, 2020.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses the membrane protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is increased by ARB\/ACEI treatment, as a cell entry receptor. Therefore, the use of ARBs\/ACEIs for COVID-19 remains controversial. Methods: A retrospective case-control study was conducted using COVID-19 patients previously diagnosed with hypertension before COVID-19 onset. The primary outcome was severe infection or all-cause mortality. Cases included ARB\/ACEI use for 30 days or longer during the 6 months before COVID-19 onset. Primary controls included antihypertensive use other than ARBs\/ACEIs (narrow control); secondary controls included all other hypertension patients (broad control). We investigated ARB\/ACEI association with outcomes in general and by subgroups (age, sex, and presence of diabetes) using logistic regression models with propensity score matching. Findings: Of 234427 suspected COVID-19 patients we screened, 1585 hypertension patients were analyzed. In the 892 cases, 428 narrow controls, and 693 broad controls, severe infection or death occurred in 8.6%, 22.2%, and 16.7%, respectively. ARB\/ACEI use was associated with a reduced risk of severe infection or death relative to the narrow control group (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.28-0.65) and broad control group (aOR 0.49, 95% CI 0.33-0.71). The association was smaller for newly diagnosed hypertension patients (aOR 0.11, 95% CI 0.03-0.42 compared to narrow control group). ARB\/ACEI protective effects against severe infection or death were significantly observed in male and diabetic patients. Interpretation: ARB\/ACEI use was associated with a lower risk of severe infection or mortality compared to other antihypertensives or ARB\/ACEI nonuse.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hee Kyung Choi","author_inst":"Yonsei University; Korea University Ansan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hee-Jo Koo","author_inst":"Yonsei University"},{"author_name":"Hyeri Seok","author_inst":"Korea University Ansan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ji Hoon Jeon","author_inst":"Korea University Ansan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Won Suk Choi","author_inst":"Korea University Ansan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dae Jung Kim","author_inst":"Ajou University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Dae Won Park","author_inst":"Korea University Ansan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Euna Han","author_inst":"Yonsei University"},{"author_name":"Lindsay T Keegan","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Mare-Claude Boily","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Stephen Hwang","author_inst":"Unity Health Toronto"},{"author_name":"Sharon Straus","author_inst":"Unity Health Toronto"},{"author_name":"Stefan Baral","author_inst":"JHSPH"},{"author_name":"Sharmistha Mishra","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Tomas Malinauskas","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Reinis R Ruza","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Pranav Shah","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tiong Kit Tan","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Pramila Rijal","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Robert F Donat","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kerry Godwin","author_inst":"PHE, Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Karen Buttigieg","author_inst":"PHE Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Julia Tree","author_inst":"PHE Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Julika Radecke","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source"},{"author_name":"Neil G Paterson","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source"},{"author_name":"Piyasa Supasa","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Juthathip Mongkolsapaya","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Gavin R Screaton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Miles W Carroll","author_inst":"PHE Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Javier G Jaramillo","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"MIchael Knight","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"William S James","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Raymond J Owens","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"James H Naismith","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alain Townsend","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth E Fry","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Yuguang Zhao","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jingshan Ren","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David I Stuart","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kuan-Ying A Huang","author_inst":"Chang Gung University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.12.20129791","rel_title":"Dynamics of psychological responses to Covid-19 in India: A longitudinal study","rel_date":"2020-06-13","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.12.20129791","rel_abs":"To curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, India announced a nationwide lockdown on 24th March 2020 for 21 days, later extended for a longer time.

However, no study has assessed whether the psychological toll changed over time due to repeated extensions of the lockdown. We followed up 159 Indian adults during the first two months of the lockdown to assess any change in their anxiety, stress, and depressive symptoms. Multilevel linear regression models of repeated observations nested within individuals, adjusted for socio-demographic covariates, showed that anxiety ({beta}=0.81, CI: 0.03, 1.60), stress ({beta}=0.51, CI: 0.32, 0.70), and depressive symptoms ({beta}=0.37, CI: 0.13, 0.60) increased over time during the lockdown. This increase was higher among women than men independent of covariates. Individual resilience was negatively associated with the psychological outcomes. This suggests that the state needs to address the current mental health impacts of a long-drawn out lockdown and its long-term sequelae. Disproportionate burden on women needs immediate attention. Sustainable change requires addressing the root causes driving the gender inequalities in psychological distress during such crises.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anvita Gopal","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar"},{"author_name":"Anupam Joya Sharma","author_inst":"IIT Gandhinagar"},{"author_name":"Malavika Ambale Subramanyam","author_inst":"IIT Gandhinagar"},{"author_name":"Ji Hoon Jeon","author_inst":"Korea University Ansan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Won Suk Choi","author_inst":"Korea University Ansan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dae Jung Kim","author_inst":"Ajou University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Dae Won Park","author_inst":"Korea University Ansan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Euna Han","author_inst":"Yonsei University"},{"author_name":"Lindsay T Keegan","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Mare-Claude Boily","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Stephen Hwang","author_inst":"Unity Health Toronto"},{"author_name":"Sharon Straus","author_inst":"Unity Health Toronto"},{"author_name":"Stefan Baral","author_inst":"JHSPH"},{"author_name":"Sharmistha Mishra","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Tomas Malinauskas","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Reinis R Ruza","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Pranav Shah","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tiong Kit Tan","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Pramila Rijal","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Robert F Donat","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kerry Godwin","author_inst":"PHE, Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Karen Buttigieg","author_inst":"PHE Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Julia Tree","author_inst":"PHE Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Julika Radecke","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source"},{"author_name":"Neil G Paterson","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source"},{"author_name":"Piyasa Supasa","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Juthathip Mongkolsapaya","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Gavin R Screaton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Miles W Carroll","author_inst":"PHE Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Javier G Jaramillo","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"MIchael Knight","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"William S James","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Raymond J Owens","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"James H Naismith","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alain Townsend","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth E Fry","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Yuguang Zhao","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jingshan Ren","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David I Stuart","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kuan-Ying A Huang","author_inst":"Chang Gung University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.12.20129650","rel_title":"Burnout among healthcare professionals during COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study","rel_date":"2020-06-13","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.12.20129650","rel_abs":"Background: The unpredictable nature of the new COVID-19 pandemic and the already alarming incidence of healthcare workers being affected can have a significant impact on the psychological well-being of the staff. Objective: To describe the prevalence of burnout among healthcare professionals and the associated factors. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: Eight university affiliated hospitals in the capital city of Tehran, Iran. Participants: All healthcare workers at the study sites who had been taking care of COVID-19 patients. Measurements: Age, gender, marital status, having children, hospital, job category, experience, and work load, as well as the level of burnout in each subscale. Results: 326 persons (53.0%) experienced high levels of burnout. The average score in emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and lack of personal accomplishment was 26.6, 10.2, and 27.3, respectively. The level of burnout in the three subscales varied based on the personal as well as work related factors and gender was the only variable that was associated with high levels of all three domains. Limitations: There was no control group and thus we cannot claim a causal relationship between COVID-19 and the observed level of burnout. Not all confounding factors might have been accounted for. Conclusions: Burnout is prevalent among healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients. Age, gender, job category, and site of practice contribute to the level of burnout that the staff experience.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammad Jalili","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mahtab Niroomand","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Fahimeh Hadavand","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Kataun Zeinali","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti Universityof Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Akbar Fotouhi","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Dae Jung Kim","author_inst":"Ajou University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Dae Won Park","author_inst":"Korea University Ansan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Euna Han","author_inst":"Yonsei University"},{"author_name":"Lindsay T Keegan","author_inst":"University of Utah"},{"author_name":"Mare-Claude Boily","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Stephen Hwang","author_inst":"Unity Health Toronto"},{"author_name":"Sharon Straus","author_inst":"Unity Health Toronto"},{"author_name":"Stefan Baral","author_inst":"JHSPH"},{"author_name":"Sharmistha Mishra","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Tomas Malinauskas","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Reinis R Ruza","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Pranav Shah","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tiong Kit Tan","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Pramila Rijal","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Robert F Donat","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kerry Godwin","author_inst":"PHE, Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Karen Buttigieg","author_inst":"PHE Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Julia Tree","author_inst":"PHE Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Julika Radecke","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source"},{"author_name":"Neil G Paterson","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source"},{"author_name":"Piyasa Supasa","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Juthathip Mongkolsapaya","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Gavin R Screaton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Miles W Carroll","author_inst":"PHE Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Javier G Jaramillo","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"MIchael Knight","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"William S James","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Raymond J Owens","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"James H Naismith","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alain Townsend","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth E Fry","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Yuguang Zhao","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jingshan Ren","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David I Stuart","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kuan-Ying A Huang","author_inst":"Chang Gung University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"occupational and environmental health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.12.20129908","rel_title":"A Logistic Model for Age-Specific COVID-19 Case-Fatality Rates","rel_date":"2020-06-13","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.12.20129908","rel_abs":"Objectives To develop a mathematical model to characterize age-specific case-fatality rates (CFR) of COVID-19.

These institutions have turned to distance learning to provide educational continuity. Schools now face the challenge of how to reopen safely and resume in-class learning. However, there is little empirical evidence to guide decision-makers on how this can be achieved. Here, we show that selectively deploying e-learning for larger classes is highly effective at decreasing campus-wide opportunities for student-to-student contact, while allowing most in-class learning to continue uninterrupted. We conducted a natural experiment at a large university that implemented a series of e-learning interventions during the COVID-19 outbreak. Analyses of >24 million student connections to the university Wi-Fi network revealed that population size can be manipulated by e-learning in a targeted manner according to class size characteristics. Student mixing showed accelerated growth with population size according to a power law distribution. Therefore, a small e-learning dependent decrease in population size resulted in a large reduction in student clustering behaviour. Our results show that e-learning interventions can decrease potential for disease transmission while minimizing disruption to university operations. Universities should consider targeted e-learning a viable strategy for providing educational continuity during early or late stages of a disease outbreak.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sing Chen Yeo","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Clin K.Y.

At the time of writing this paper no medical therapy is officially recommended or has shown results in improving the outcomes in COVID-19 patients. With the aim of diminishing the impact in Hospital admissions and reducing the number of medical complications, we implemented a strategy based on a Hospital Home-Care Unit (HHCU) using an easy-to-use treatment based on an oral administration regimen outside the hospital with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) plus azithromycin (AZM) for a short period of 5 days. Patients and methods: Patients [&ge;] 18 years old visiting the emergency room at the Hospital Universitario San Pedro de Logrono (La Rioja) between March, 31st and April, 12th diagnosed with COVID-19 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by a specific PCR, as follows: Patients with pneumonia (CURB [&le;] 1) who did not present severe comorbidities and had no processes that contraindicated this therapeutic regime. Olygosimptomatic patients without pneumonia aged [&ge;] 55 years. Patients [&ge;] 18 years old without pneumonia with significant comorbidities. We excluded patients with known allergies to some of the antimicrobials used and patients treated with other drugs that increase the QTc or with QTc >450msc. The therapeutic regime was: HCQ 400 mg every twice in a loading dose followed by 200 mg twice for 5 days, plus AZM 500 mg on the first day followed by 250 mg daily for 5 days. A daily telephone follow-up was carried out from the hospital by the same physician. The end-points of our study were: 1.- To measure the need for hospital admission within 15 days after the start of treatment. 2.- To measure the need to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) within 15 days after the start of the treatment. 3.- To describe the severity of the clinical complications developed. 4.- To measure the mortality within 30 days after starting treatment (differentiating if the cause is COVID-19 or something else). 5.-To describe the safety and adverse effects of the therapeutic regime. Results: During the 13 days studied a total of 502 patients were attended in the emergency room due to COVID-19. Forty-two were sent at home; 80 were attended by the HHCU (patients on this study) and 380 were admitted to the Hospital. In our series there were a group of 69 (85.18%) patients diagnosed with pneumonia (37 males and 32 females). Most of them, 57 (82.60%) had a CURB65 score of <1 (average age 49) and 12 (17.40%) a CURB score of 1 (average age 63). Eighteen (22.50%) of the pneumonia patients also had some morbidity as a risk factor. 11 patients (13.75%) without pneumonia were admitted to the HHCU because comorbidities or age [&ge;] 55 years. Six patients with pneumonia had to be hospitalized during the observation period, 3 of them because side effects and 3 because of worsening. One of these patients, with morbid obesity and asthma, had clinical worsening needing mechanical ventilation at ICU and developed acute distress respiratory syndrome. With the exception of the patient admitted to the ICU, the rest of the patients were discharged at home in the following 8 days (3 to 8 days). Twelve patients (15%), 11 of whom had pneumonia, experienced side effects affecting mainly the digestive. In another patient a QTc interval prolongation (452 msc) was observed. In total 3 of these patients had to be admitted in the Hospital, 2 because of vomiting and 1 because a QTc interval lengthening. None of the patients needed to stop the HCQ or AZM and all the 80 patients finished the therapeutic strategy. From the group without pneumonia only a patient developed diarrhea that did not require hospitalization or stop the medication. Conclusions: Our strategy has been associated with a reduction in the burden of hospital pressure, and it seems to be successful in terms of the number of patients who have developed serious complications and \/ or death. None of the patients died in the studied period and only 6 have to be admitted in conventional hospitalization area.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jos\u00e9 A.

OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY To explore the potential of HCQ as a pre-exposure prophylaxis for COVID 19 in health care workers in a tertiary care hospital. MATERIALS & METHODS We have conducted a retrospective cohort study among 106 Health Care Workers (HCW) exposed to COVID-19 patients, at a tertiary care hospital in India where there was an abrupt cluster outbreak within on duty personnel. HCWs who had voluntarily taken hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) prior to exposure were considered one cohort while those who had not were considered to be the Control group. All participants with a verifiable high risk contact history were tested for COVID-19 by RT-PCR. RESULTS The two cohorts were comparable in terms of age, gender, co-morbidities and exposure. The primary outcome was incidence rates of RT-PCR positive COVID-19 infection amongst HCQ users and Controls. In this retrospective cohort study, 106 healthcare workers were examined of whom 54 were HCQ users and rest were not. The comparative analysis of incidence of infection between the two groups demonstrated that voluntary HCQ usage was associated with lesser likelihood of developing SARS-CoV-2 infection (4 out of 54 HCW), compared to those who were not on it (20 out of 52 HCW), {chi}2 =14.59, p<0.001. None of the HCQ users noted any serious adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated that voluntary HCQ consumption as pre-exposure prophylaxis by HCWs is associated with a statistically significant reduction in risk of SARS-CoV-2. These promising findings therefore highlight the need to examine this association in greater detail among a larger sample using Randomised Controlled Trials (RCT).

Another perspective is COVID-19s toll in terms of years of life lost. We calculated years of life lost for COVID-19 and other leading causes of death over those three months in the US. We also predicted years of life lost for COVID-19 and ischemic heart diseases (which includes heart attacks) for March through August 2020. Methods: Years of life lost are the sum of differences between life expectancy at age of death and age at death. Average years of life lost, years of life lost divided by the number of deaths, were also calculated. We used the COVID-19 Projections Using Machine Learning model to predict years of life lost from COVID-19 through the end of August 2020. Results: COVID-19 caused 12,035 more deaths than ischemic heart diseases during March through May 2020 but ischemic heart diseases years of life lost were 1.5% greater than those for COVID-19. Average years of life lost were 10.8 and 12.4 for COVID-19 and ischemic heart diseases, respectively. At the end of August, COVID-19 may overtake ischemic heart diseases as the leading cause of deaths and years of life lost in the US. Conclusion: Each COVID-19 death causes more than a decade of lost life in the US. We are reminded of a Danish Proverb that states Prediction is difficult, especially when dealing with the future.

The study investigates the prevalence and predictors of general psychiatric disorders measured by the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and frequency of loneliness during COVID-19 in the United Kingdom, a country heavily hit by the pandemic. We analyzed 15,530 respondents of the first large-scale, nationally representative survey of COVID-19 in a developed country, the first wave of Understanding Society COVID-19 Study. Results show that 29.2% of the respondents score 4 or more, the caseness threshold, on the general psychiatric disorder measure, and 35.86% of the respondents sometimes or often feel lonely. Regression analyses show that those who have or had COVID-19-related symptoms are more likely to develop general psychiatric disorders and are lonelier. Women and people in their 30s have higher risks of general psychiatric disorders and loneliness, while having a job and living with a partner are protective factors. This study showcases the general psychiatric disorders and loneliness of broader members of the society during COVID-19 and the underlying social disparities.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lambert Zixin Li","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Senhu Wang","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Zhengkang ZUO","author_inst":"School of Earth and Space Science, Peking University, Beijing, 100871, China."},{"author_name":"Feizhou ZHANG","author_inst":"School of Earth and Space Science, Peking University, Beijing, 100871, China."},{"author_name":"Ke SHANG","author_inst":"School of Geophysics and Information Technology, China University of Geosciences, Beijing, 100083, China."},{"author_name":"Wenjie YU","author_inst":"College of Resources and Environment Science, Xinjiang University, Urumqi, 830046, China."},{"author_name":"Yu FU","author_inst":"School of Earth and Space Science, Peking University, Beijing, 100871, China."},{"author_name":"Chuqiao HAN","author_inst":"College of Resources and Environment Science, Xinjiang University, Urumqi, 830046, China."},{"author_name":"Yi LIN","author_inst":"School of Earth and Space Science, Peking University, Beijing, 100871, China."},{"author_name":"Kaiwen JIANG","author_inst":"School of Earth and Space Science, Peking University, Beijing, 100871, China."},{"author_name":"Shanlin SUN","author_inst":"College of Electronic Information and Automation, Guilin University of Aerospace Technology, Guilin 541004, Guangxi Province China."},{"author_name":"Yiyuan SUN","author_inst":"School of Earth and Space Science, Peking University, Beijing, 100871, China."},{"author_name":"Shoujiang ZHAO","author_inst":"School of Earth and Space Science, Peking University, Beijing, 100871, China."},{"author_name":"Lei YAN","author_inst":"School of Earth and Space Science, Peking University, Beijing, 100871, China."},{"author_name":"Tomas Malinauskas","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Reinis R Ruza","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Pranav Shah","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tiong Kit Tan","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Pramila Rijal","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Robert F Donat","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kerry Godwin","author_inst":"PHE, Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Karen Buttigieg","author_inst":"PHE Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Julia Tree","author_inst":"PHE Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Julika Radecke","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source"},{"author_name":"Neil G Paterson","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source"},{"author_name":"Piyasa Supasa","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Juthathip Mongkolsapaya","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Gavin R Screaton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Miles W Carroll","author_inst":"PHE Porton Down"},{"author_name":"Javier G Jaramillo","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"MIchael Knight","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"William S James","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Raymond J Owens","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"James H Naismith","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alain Townsend","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth E Fry","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Yuguang Zhao","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jingshan Ren","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"David I Stuart","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kuan-Ying A Huang","author_inst":"Chang Gung University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"}]}
