The global response throughout the world has been primarily the implementation of lockdown measures, testing and contact tracing to minimise the spread of the disease. The aim of the present study was to predict the COVID-19 prevalence and disease progression rate in Indian scenario in order to provide an analysis that can shed light on comprehending the trends of the outbreak and outline an impression of the epidemiological stage for each state of a diverse country like India. In addition, the forecast of COVID-19 incidence trends of these states can help take safety measures and policy design for this epidemic in the days to come. In order to achieve the same, we have utilized an approach where we test modelling choices of the spatially unambiguous kind, proposed by the wave of infections spreading from the initial slow progression to a higher curve. We have estimated the parameters of an individual state using factors like population density and mobility. The findings can also be used to strategize the testing and quarantine processes to manipulate the spread of the disease in the future. This is especially important for a country like India that has several limitations about healthcare infrastructure, diversity in socioeconomic status, high population density, housing conditions, health care coverage that can be important determinants for the overall impact of the pandemic. The results of our 5-phase model depict a projection of the state wise infections\/disease over time. The model can generate live graphs as per the change in the data values as the values are automatically being fetched from the crowd-sourced database.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samuel Bharti","author_inst":"Amity Institute of Biotechnology, Amity University, Uttar Pradesh, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Priyanka Narad","author_inst":"Amity Institute of Biotechnology, Amity University, Uttar Pradesh, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Parul Chugh","author_inst":"Amity Institute of Biotechnology, Amity University, Uttar Pradesh, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Alakto Choudhury","author_inst":"Amity Institute of Biotechnology, Amity University, Uttar Pradesh, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Seema Bhatnagar","author_inst":"Amity Institute of Biotechnology, Amity University, Uttar Pradesh, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Abhishek Sengupta","author_inst":"Amity Institute of Biotechnology, Amity University, Uttar Pradesh, INDIA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.02.20120808","rel_title":"The Relationship Between COVID-19 Infection and Risk Perception, Knowledge, Attitude As Well As Four Non-pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) During the Late Period Of The COVID-19 Epidemic In China An Online Cross-sectional Survey of 8158 Adults","rel_date":"2020-06-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.02.20120808","rel_abs":"Background: So far, there has been no published population study on the relationship between COVID-19 infection and public risk perception, information source, knowledge, attitude and four non-pharmaceutical interventions(NPI: hand washing, proper coughing habits, social distancing and mask wearing) during the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Methods: An online survey of 8158 Chinese adults between 22 February to 5 March 2020 was conducted. Bivariate associations between categorical variables were examined using Fisher exact test. We also explored the determinants of four NPIs as well as their association with COVID-19 infection using logistic regression. Results: Of 8158 adults included, 57 (0.73%) were infected with COVID-19. The overwhelming majority of respondents showed a positive attitude (99.2%), positive risk perception (99.9%) and high knowledge levels that were among the strongest predictors of four highly adopted NPIs (hand washing:96.8%; proper coughing: 93.1%; social distancing:87.1%; mask wearing:97.9%). There was an increased risk of COVID-19 infection for those who not washing hands (2.28% vs 0.65%; RR=3.53: 95%CI: 1.53-8.15; P<0.009); not practicing proper coughing (1.79% vs 0.73%; RR=2.44: 95%CI: 1.15-5.15;P=0.026); not practicing social distancing (1.52% vs 0.58%; RR=2.63:95%CI:1.48-4.67; P=0.002); and not wearing a mask (7.41% vs 0.6%; RR=12.38:95%CI:5.81-26.36; P<0.001). For those who did practice all other three NPIs, wearing mask was associated with significantly reduced risk of infection compared to those who did not wear a mask (0.6% vs 16.7%; p=0.035). Similarly, for those who did not practice all or part of the other three NPIs, wearing mask was also associated with significantly reduced risk of infection. In a penalised logistic regression model including all four NPIs, wearing a mask was the only significant predictor of COVID-19 infection among four NPIs (OR=7.20; 95%CI:2.24-23.11; p<0.001). Conclusions: We found high levels of risk perception, positive attitude, desirable knowledge as well as a high level of adopting four NPIs. The relevant knowledge, risk perception and attitude were strong predictors of adapting the four NPIs. Mask wearing, among four personal NPIs, was the most effective protective measure against COVID-19 infection with added preventive effect among those who practised all or part of the other three NPIs.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hong Xu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Yong Gan","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Daikun Zheng","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Medical College, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Bo Wu","author_inst":"Wanzhou District Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Xian Zhu","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Chang Xu","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Chenglu Liu","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Zhou Tao","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Yaoyue Hu","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Min Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Mingjiang Li","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Zuxun Lu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Jack Chen","author_inst":"University of New South Wales"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.02.20120014","rel_title":"Viral load dynamics in transmissible symptomatic patients with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-06-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.02.20120014","rel_abs":"To investigate the relationship between viral load and secondary transmission in novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we reviewed epidemiological and clinical data obtained from immunocompetent laboratory-confirmed patients with COVID-19 at Toyama University Hospital.

We therefore evaluated the performance of a variety of antibody testing technologies and their potential as diagnostic tools. A highly specific in-house ELISA was developed for the detection of anti-spike (S), -receptor binding domain (RBD) and -nucleocapsid (N) antibodies and used for the cross-comparison of ten commercial serological assays - a chemiluminescence-based platform, two ELISAs and seven colloidal gold lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) - on an identical panel of 110 SARS-CoV-2-positive samples and 50 pre-pandemic negatives. There was a wide variation in the performance of the different platforms, with specificity ranging from 82% to 100%, and overall sensitivity from 60.9% to 87.3%. However, the head to head comparison of multiple serodiagnostic assays on identical sample sets revealed that performance is highly dependent on the time of sampling, with sensitivities of over 95% seen in several tests when assessing samples from more than 20 days post onset of symptoms. Furthermore, these analyses identified clear outlying samples that were negative in all tests, but were later shown to be from individuals with mildest disease presentation. Rigorous comparison of antibody testing platforms will inform the deployment of point of care technologies in healthcare settings and their use in the monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infections.","rel_num_authors":31,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Suzanne Pickering","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Gilberto Betancor","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rui Pedro Galao","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Blair Merrick","author_inst":"Guy's and St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Adrian W Signell","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Harry D Wilson","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Mark Tan Kia Ik","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Seow","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Carl Graham","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Sam Acors","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Neophytos Kouphou","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Kathryn JA Steel","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Oliver Hemmings","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Amita Patel","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Gaia Nebbia","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Sam Douthwaite","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Lorcan O'Connell","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Jakub Luptak","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Laura McCoy","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Philip JM Brouwer","author_inst":"University of Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Marit J van Gils","author_inst":"University of Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Rogier W Sanders","author_inst":"University of Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Rocio Martinez Nunez","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Karen Bisnauthsing","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Geraldine O'Hara","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Eithne MacMahon","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Rahul Batra","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Michael H Malim","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Stuart JD Neil","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Katie Doores","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan D Edgeworth","author_inst":"King's College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.02.20120634","rel_title":"Assembly of an integrated human lung cell atlas reveals that SARS-CoV-2 receptor is co-expressed with key elements of the kinin-kallikrein, renin-angiotensin and coagulation systems in alveolar cells","rel_date":"2020-06-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.02.20120634","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2, the pathogenic agent of COVID-19, employs angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) as its cell entry receptor. Clinical data reveal that in severe COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 infects the lung, leading to a frequently lethal triad of respiratory insufficiency, acute cardiovascular failure, and coagulopathy. Physiologically, ACE2 plays a role in the regulation of three systems that could potentially be involved in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19: the kinin-kallikrein system, resulting in acute lung inflammatory edema; the renin-angiotensin system, promoting cardiovascular instability; and the coagulation system, leading to thromboembolism. Here we analyzed ~130,000 human lung single-cell transcriptomes and show that key elements of the kinin-kallikrein, renin-angiotensin and coagulation systems are co-expressed with ACE2 in alveolar cells, which could explain how changes in ACE2 promoted by SARS-CoV-2 cell entry result in the development of the three most severe clinical components of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Davi Sidarta-Oliveira","author_inst":"University of Campinas, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Carlos Poblete Jara","author_inst":"University of Campinas, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Adriano J Ferruzzi","author_inst":"University of Campinas, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Munir S Skaf","author_inst":"University of Campinas, Brazil"},{"author_name":"William H Velander","author_inst":"University of Nebraska, USA"},{"author_name":"Eliana P Araujo","author_inst":"University of Campinas, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Licio A Velloso","author_inst":"University of Campinas, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Seow","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Carl Graham","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Sam Acors","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Neophytos Kouphou","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Kathryn JA Steel","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Oliver Hemmings","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Amita Patel","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Gaia Nebbia","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Sam Douthwaite","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Lorcan O'Connell","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Jakub Luptak","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Laura McCoy","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Philip JM Brouwer","author_inst":"University of Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Marit J van Gils","author_inst":"University of Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Rogier W Sanders","author_inst":"University of Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Rocio Martinez Nunez","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Karen Bisnauthsing","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Geraldine O'Hara","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Eithne MacMahon","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Rahul Batra","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Michael H Malim","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Stuart JD Neil","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Katie Doores","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan D Edgeworth","author_inst":"King's College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.02.20120477","rel_title":"Detection of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 exposed individuals by a sensitive S-based ELISA.","rel_date":"2020-06-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.02.20120477","rel_abs":"To assess the current coronavirus pandemic, there is a pressing need to determine the exposure and seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 on a local and global level.

Severe COVID-19 disease is associated with disordered inflammatory responses. We hypothesized that reduced plasma RNLS levels could be a marker of COVID-19 disease severity. Methods: Plasma was collected from 51 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 15 uninfected non-hospitalized controls. Plasma RNLS and cytokine levels were measured and sociodemographic and clinical data were collected from chart review. Data were analyzed using nonparametric analyses and Kaplan Meir curve log rank analysis. Results: Plasma RNLs levels were negatively correlated with inflammatory markers, including IL-1b, IL-6, and TNFa (p = 0.04, p = 0.03, p = 0.01, respectively). Patients with COVID-19 disease had lower levels of RNLS than controls. Lower levels of RNLS were associated with more severe disease among COVID-19 patients. Low RNLS was also associated with worse survival among COVID-19 patients (HR = 4.54; 95% CI: 1.06-19.43; p = 0.005). Conclusion: Low plasma RNLS levels are associated with severe COVID-19 disease and may be a useful additional biomarker when identifying patients with severe COVID-19 disease. Given RNLS anti-inflammatory properties and negative correlation with inflammatory markers, these findings also suggest evidence of a potential pathophysiological mechanism for severe COVID-19 disease.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Melinda Wang","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xiaojia Guo","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hyung J Chun","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alfred Ian Lee","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Charles Cha","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fred Gorelick","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Gary V Desir","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Leo Hanke","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Therese Thunberg","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Gerald McInerney","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Andrea Puhar","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Felipe Cava","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Gunilla B Karlsson Hedestam","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Tor Monsen","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Fredrik Elgh","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Bert Blomkvist","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Ingrid Marklund","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Clas Ahlm","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Magnus Evander","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Johan Normark","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Anders Johansson","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Anna K Overby","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Mattias Forsell","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Karen Bisnauthsing","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Geraldine O'Hara","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Eithne MacMahon","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Rahul Batra","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Michael H Malim","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Stuart JD Neil","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Katie Doores","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan D Edgeworth","author_inst":"King's College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.03.20120881","rel_title":"A prediction model based on machine learning for diagnosing the early COVID-19 patients","rel_date":"2020-06-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.03.20120881","rel_abs":"With the dramatically fast spread of COVID-9, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test has become the gold standard method for confirmation of COVID-19 infection. However, RT-PCR tests are complicated in operation andIt usually takes 5-6 hours or even longer to get the result. Additionally, due to the low virus loads in early COVID-19 patients, RT-PCR tests display false negative results in a number of cases. Analyzing complex medical datasets based on machine learning provides health care workers excellent opportunities for developing a simple and efficient COVID-19 diagnostic system. This paper aims at extracting risk factors from clinical data of early COVID-19 infected patients and utilizing four types of traditional machine learning approaches including logistic regression(LR), support vector machine(SVM), decision tree(DT), random forest(RF) and a deep learning-based method for diagnosis of early COVID-19. The results show that the LR predictive model presents a higher specificity rate of 0.95, an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.971 and an improved sensitivity rate of 0.82, which makes it optimal for the screening of early COVID-19 infection. We also perform the verification for generality of the best model (LR predictive model) among Zhejiang population, and analyze the contribution of the factors to the predictive models. Our manuscript describes and highlights the ability of machine learning methods for improving the accuracy and timeliness of early COVID-19 infection diagnosis. The higher AUC of our LR-base predictive model makes it a more conducive method for assisting COVID-19 diagnosis. The optimal model has been encapsulated as a mobile application (APP) and implemented in some hospitals in Zhejiang Province.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sun Nan Nan","author_inst":"Hangzhou Wowjoy Information Technology Co., Ltd, Hangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Yang Ya","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Centre for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Tang Ling Ling","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, ShuLan (Hangzhou) Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang Shuren University Shulan International Medical College, Hangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Dai Yi Ning","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases,Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, Hangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Gao Hai Nv","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, ShuLan (Hangzhou) Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang Shuren University Shulan International Medical College, Hangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Pan Hong Ying","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, Hangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Ju Bin","author_inst":"Hangzhou Wowjoy Information Technology Co., Ltd, Hangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Leo Hanke","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Therese Thunberg","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Gerald McInerney","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Andrea Puhar","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Felipe Cava","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Gunilla B Karlsson Hedestam","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Tor Monsen","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Fredrik Elgh","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Bert Blomkvist","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Ingrid Marklund","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Clas Ahlm","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Magnus Evander","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Johan Normark","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Anders Johansson","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Anna K Overby","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Mattias Forsell","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Karen Bisnauthsing","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Geraldine O'Hara","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Eithne MacMahon","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Rahul Batra","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Michael H Malim","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Stuart JD Neil","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Katie Doores","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan D Edgeworth","author_inst":"King's College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.03.20121004","rel_title":"Exposure to cough aerosols and development of pulmonary COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-06-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.03.20121004","rel_abs":"Half a year after the emergence of COVID-19, research is still going on to gain insight in the importance of different SARS-CoV-2 transmission routes and their impact on the clinical picture of COVID-19.

In particular, we analyse the doubling time, reproduction number (Rt) and infection duration associated with the epidemic wave that was detected in incidence data starting from Feb 27. Different models suggest a slowing down of the epidemic in Mar, which would be consistent with the implementation of the national lock-down on Mar 17. The inferred distributions for the effective infection duration and Rt are in line with those estimated from contact tracing data. Finally, based on the available sequence data, we estimate that the French epidemic wave originated between mid-Jan and early Feb.

The calculator shows that the stringent measures imposed have an immediate effect of rapidly slowing down the spread of the coronavirus. After about two weeks, the effective reproduction number reduced to 1.0. Since then, the number has been fluctuating around 1.0. The COVID-19 Epidemic Calculator is available in the form of an online Google Sheet and the results are presented as Tableau Public dashboards at www.cv19.one.

The results show that average temperature and average relative humidity are the major contributors in explaining the differentials of COVID-19 transmission in temperate and subtropical regions whereas the mean diurnal temperature range and temperature seasonality are the most significant determinants in tropical regions. The average temperature is the most influential factor affecting the number of COVID-19 cases in France, Turkey, the US, the UK, and Germany, and the cases decrease sharply above 10oC. Among the tropical countries, India found to be most affected by mean diurnal temperature, and Brazil fazed by temperature seasonality. Most of the temperate countries like France, USA, Turkey, UK, and Germany with an average temperature between 5-12oC had high number of COVID-19 cases. The findings are expected to add to the ongoing debates on the influence of climatic factors influencing the number of COVID-19 cases and could help researchers and policymakers to make appropriate decisions for preventing the spread.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Malay Pramanik","author_inst":"Asian Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Koushik Chowdhury","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur"},{"author_name":"Md Juel Rana","author_inst":"International Institute for Population Sciences"},{"author_name":"Praffulit Bisht","author_inst":"Jawaharlal Nehru University"},{"author_name":"Raghunath Pal","author_inst":"Jawaharlal Nehru University"},{"author_name":"Sylvia Szabo","author_inst":"Asian Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Indrajit Pal","author_inst":"Asian Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Bhagirath Behera","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur"},{"author_name":"Qiuhua Liang","author_inst":"Loughborough University"},{"author_name":"Sabu S.

One pathway through which both experience of and worries about adversity may impact health is through effects on sleep. We used data from 48,723 UK adults in the COVID-19 Social Study assessed weekly from 01\/04\/2020-12\/05\/2020 to study the association between adversities and sleep quality. We studied six categories of adversity including both worries and experiences of: illness with COVID-19, financial difficulty, loss of paid work, difficulties acquiring medication, difficulties accessing food, and threats to personal safety. We used random-effect within-between models to account for all time-invariant confounders. Both the total number of adversity experiences and total number of adversity worries were associated with lower quality sleep. Each additional experience was associated with a 1.16 (95% CI = 1.10, 1.22) times higher odds of poor quality sleep while each additional worry was associated with a 1.20 (95% CI = 1.17, 1.22) times higher odds of poor quality sleep. When considering specific experiences and worries, all worries and experiences were significantly related to poorer quality sleep except experiences relating to employment and finances. Having a larger social network offered some buffering effects on associations but there was limited further evidence of moderation by social or psychiatric factors. Poor sleep may be a mechanism by which COVID-19 adversities are affecting mental health. This highlights the importance of interventions that support adaptive coping strategies during the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Liam Wright","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Andrew Steptoe","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Daisy Fancourt","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Praffulit Bisht","author_inst":"Jawaharlal Nehru University"},{"author_name":"Raghunath Pal","author_inst":"Jawaharlal Nehru University"},{"author_name":"Sylvia Szabo","author_inst":"Asian Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Indrajit Pal","author_inst":"Asian Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Bhagirath Behera","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur"},{"author_name":"Qiuhua Liang","author_inst":"Loughborough University"},{"author_name":"Sabu S.

This research aims to study the possible correlation between the numbers of swab tests and confirmed cases of infection, with special attention to the sickness level. Study Design: The study is carried out with reference to the Italian case, but the result is of more general importance, in particular for countries with limited availability of ICUs (intensive care units). Methods: The statistical analysis shows correlation between the number of swab tests and those of daily positive cases, mild cases admitted to hospital, intensive care cases, recovery, and death rate, and provides a basis to carry on an AI study. The results were validated using a multivariate linear regression (MLR) approach. Results: Our main result is the identification of a significant statistical effect of reduction of the pressure on the Health system as result of the increase of the tests. The relevance of this result is not confined to the COVID-19 outbreak, because the high demand of hospitalizations and ICU treatments due to this pandemic has an indirect effect on the possibility of guaranteeing an adequate treatment for other high-fatality disease, such as e.g. cardiological, and oncological. Conclusions: Our results show that swab testing may play a major role to decrease the stress on the Health system of a country. Therefore, this case study is relevant in particular for the planning of the control of the pandemic in countries with a limited capacity of admission to ICU s units.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Behzad Pirouz","author_inst":"Department of Computer Engineering, Modelling, Electronics and Systems Engineering, University of Calabria, Rende 87036, Italy"},{"author_name":"Hana Javadi Nejad","author_inst":"University of Calabria, Rende 87036, Italy"},{"author_name":"Galileo Violini","author_inst":"Centro Internacional de Fisica, Bogota, Colombia;  University of Calabria, Rende 87036, Italy;"},{"author_name":"Behrouz Pirouz","author_inst":"University of Calabria"},{"author_name":"Raghunath Pal","author_inst":"Jawaharlal Nehru University"},{"author_name":"Sylvia Szabo","author_inst":"Asian Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Indrajit Pal","author_inst":"Asian Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Bhagirath Behera","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur"},{"author_name":"Qiuhua Liang","author_inst":"Loughborough University"},{"author_name":"Sabu S.

Methods A modified SECIR compartment model was used to estimate the number of severe COVID-19 cases at the peak of the outbreak. Projections of the number of hospital beds, ICU beds, and ventilators needed at outbreak peak were generated for four scenarios (if 30, 50, 70, or 100% of patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms seek health services) assuming that all people with severe infections would require hospitalization, that 4.72% would require ICU admission, and that 2.3% would require mechanical ventilation. Findings Across the 52 countries included in this analysis, the average number of severe COVID-19 cases projected at outbreak peak was 138 per 100,000 (SD: 9.6). Comparing current national capacities to estimated needs at outbreak peak, we found that 31of 50 countries (62%) do not have a sufficient number of hospital beds per 100,000 people if 100% of patients with severe infections seek out health services and assuming that all hospital beds are empty and available for use by patients with COVID-19. If only 30% of patients seek out health services then 10 of 50 countries (20%) do not have sufficient hospital bed capacity. The average number of ICU beds needed at outbreak peak across the 52 included countries ranged from 2 per 100,000 people (SD: 0.1) when 30% of people with severe COVID-19 infections access health services to 6.5 per 100,000 (SD: 0.5) assuming 100% of people seek out health services. Even if only 30% of severely infected patients seek health services at outbreak peak, then 34 of 48 countries (71%) do not have a sufficient number of ICU beds per 100,000 people to handle projected need. Only four countries (Cabo Verde, Egypt, Gabon, and South Africa) have a sufficient number of ventilators to meet projected national needs if 100% of severely infected individuals seek health services assuming all ventilators are functioning and available for COVID-19 patients, while 35 other countries require two or more additional ventilators per 100,000 people.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jessica Craig","author_inst":"CDDEP"},{"author_name":"Erta Kalanxhi","author_inst":"CDDEP"},{"author_name":"Gilbert Osena","author_inst":"CDDEP"},{"author_name":"Isabel Frost","author_inst":"CDDEP"},{"author_name":"Raghunath Pal","author_inst":"Jawaharlal Nehru University"},{"author_name":"Sylvia Szabo","author_inst":"Asian Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Indrajit Pal","author_inst":"Asian Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Bhagirath Behera","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur"},{"author_name":"Qiuhua Liang","author_inst":"Loughborough University"},{"author_name":"Sabu S.

Emerging evidence indicates a potential role for monocyte in COVID-19 immunopathology. We investigated two soluble markers of monocyte activation, sCD14 and sCD163, in covid19 patients with the aim of characterizing their potential role in monocyte-macrophage disease immunopathology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind. Methods. Fifty-nine SARS-Cov-2 positive hospitalized patients, classified according to ICU or non-ICU admission requirement, were prospectively recruited and analyzed by ELISA for levels of sCD14 and sCD163, along with other laboratory parameters, and compared to a healthy control group. Results. sCD14 and sCD163 levels were significantly higher among COVID-19 patients, independently of ICU admission requirement, compared to the control group. We found a significant correlation between sCD14 levels and other inflammatory markers, particularly Interleukin-6, in the non-ICU patients group. sCD163 showed a moderate positive correlation with the time at sampling from admission, increasing its value over time, independently of severity group. Conclusions. Monocyte-macrophage activation markers are increased and correlate with other inflammatory markers in SARS-Cov-2 infection, in association to hospital admission. These data suggest a potentially preponderant role for monocyte-macrophage activation in the development of immunopathology of covid19 patients.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jose Gomez Rial","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario Santiago de Compostela"},{"author_name":"Maria Jose Curras Tuala","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario Santiago de Compostela"},{"author_name":"Irene Rivero Calle","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario Santiago de Compostela"},{"author_name":"Alberto Gomez Carballa","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario Santiago de Compostela"},{"author_name":"Miriam Cebey Lopez","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario Santiago de Compostela"},{"author_name":"Carmen Rodriguez Tenreiro","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario Santiago de Compostela"},{"author_name":"Ana Dacosta Urbieta","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario Santiago de Compostela"},{"author_name":"Carmen Rivero Velasco","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario Santiago de Compostela"},{"author_name":"Nuria Rodriguez Nunez","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario Santiago de Compostela"},{"author_name":"Rocio Trastoy Pena","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario Santiago de Compostela"},{"author_name":"Javier Rodriguez Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario Santiago de Compostela"},{"author_name":"Antonio Salas","author_inst":"Universidad Santiago de Compostela"},{"author_name":"Federico Martinon Torres","author_inst":"Hospital Clinico Universitario Santiago de Compostela"},{"author_name":"Sylvie van der Werf","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Bruno Lina","author_inst":"Universit\u00e9 de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Laurence Josset","author_inst":"Universit\u00e9 de Lyon"},{"author_name":"Vincent Enouf","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Samuel Alizon","author_inst":"CNRS"},{"author_name":"Magnus Evander","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Johan Normark","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Anders Johansson","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Anna K Overby","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Mattias Forsell","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Karen Bisnauthsing","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Geraldine O'Hara","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Eithne MacMahon","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Rahul Batra","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Michael H Malim","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Stuart JD Neil","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Katie Doores","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan D Edgeworth","author_inst":"King's College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.02.20120774","rel_title":"Quantifying the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 long-term shedding among non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients","rel_date":"2020-06-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.02.20120774","rel_abs":"Analysis of 851 COVID-19 patients with a SARS-CoV-2-positive PCR at follow-up shows 99 patients remained SARS-CoV-2-positive after four weeks from initial diagnosis.

In this phase a marked systematic weekly periodicity in the Covid-19 attack has become clear, the study of which could be useful for the long term strategy to deal with the virus and the pandemic. The most important aspect of this strong weekly modulation is its global nature, phase-coherent over most of globe, independent of the geographical location. The fact that the same periodicity is now evident even those countries Asia and Africa, where it was absent or not prominent earlier, suggests the possibility that the pattern could be an early indicator for significant community transmission.

Since the first sequenced whole-genome of SARS-CoV-2 on January 2020, the identification of its genetic variants has become crucial in tracking and evaluating their spread across the globe.\n\nIn this study, we compared 15,259 SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from 60 countries since the outbreak of this novel coronavirus with the first sequenced genome in Wuhan to quantify the evolutionary divergence of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, we compared the codon usage patterns, every two weeks, of 13 of SARS-CoV-2 genes encoding for the membrane protein (M), envelope (E), spike surface glycoprotein (S), nucleoprotein (N), non-structural 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro), ssRNA-binding protein (RBP), 2-O-ribose methyltransferase (OMT), endoRNase (RNase), helicase, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), Nsp7, Nsp8, and exonuclease ExoN.\n\nAs a general rule, we find that SARS-CoV-2 genome tends to diverge over time by accumulating mutations on its genome and, specifically, on the coding sequences for proteins N and S. Interestingly, different patterns of codon usage were observed among these genes. Genes S, Nsp7, NSp8, tend to use a norrower set of synonymous codons that are better optimized to the human host. Conversely, genes E and M consistently use a broader set of synonymous codons, which does not vary with respect to the reference genome. We identified key SARS-CoV-2 genes (S, N, ExoN, RNase, RdRp, Nsp7 and Nsp8) suggested to be causally implicated in the virus adaptation to the human host.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maddalena Dilucca","author_inst":"La Sapienza, Roma"},{"author_name":"Sergio Forcelloni","author_inst":"Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Andrea Giansanti","author_inst":"Sapienza Universita di Roma"},{"author_name":"Alexandros Georgakilas","author_inst":"National Technical University of Athens"},{"author_name":"Athanasia Pavlopoulou","author_inst":"Izmir International Biomedicine and Genome Institute, Dokuz Eylul University"},{"author_name":"Douglas W.

Design Cross-sectional study using survey questionnaire. Setting Healthcare industry: St Mary's Hospital, a small NHS district hospital on the Isle of Wight, United Kingdom. Participants NHS staff members employed by the Isle of Wight NHS Trust. Results Of 3100 eligible staff members, 462 (~15%) responded to the survey. Of the respondents, 90% were aged between 31 and 65, and half had direct patient contact through their job role. Almost three quarters (73%) used social media apps on their smartphones. 421 out of 460 respondents had no trouble downloading and installing the NHSX Covid app on their smartphones. 20% of respondents were left confused by instructions to turn off Bluetooth when wearing PPE. Only 35 people either had to report symptoms or received an alert of contact with a suspected covid case. Of these over 20% were not clear what to do in such a situation. Conclusions The trial app has been embraced and adopted well. Many have experienced no problems with it. However, some healthcare workers have been unable to download or install the app due to compatibility issues and some have been left confused by having to turn off Bluetooth whilst wearing PPE. This raises questions as to the effectiveness of the app for its intended purpose in contact tracing efforts. Recommendations We recommend that the wording of alerts and guidance provided by the app be made clearer and more accessible. We also recommend developments to the app to facilitate use by healthcare workers in a clinical setting. We also propose that \"app instructors\" be made available in hospitals to ensure that patients and staff can access help and advice on use of the app.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joshua Filer","author_inst":"Isle of Wight NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Daniel Gheorghiu","author_inst":"Isle of Wight NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Andrea Giansanti","author_inst":"Sapienza Universita di Roma"},{"author_name":"Alexandros Georgakilas","author_inst":"National Technical University of Athens"},{"author_name":"Athanasia Pavlopoulou","author_inst":"Izmir International Biomedicine and Genome Institute, Dokuz Eylul University"},{"author_name":"Douglas W.

The Covid-19 death rate increases exponentially with age, and the main risk factors are age itself, as well as having underlying conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, severe chronic respiratory disease and cancer. Furthermore, the almost complete lack of deaths in children suggests that infection alone is not sufficient to cause death; rather, one must have gone through a number of changes, either as a result of undefined aspects of aging, or as a result of chronic disease. These characteristics of Covid-19 death are consistent with the multistep model of disease, a model which has primarily been used for cancer, and more recently for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We applied the multi-step model to data on Covid-19 case fatality rates (CFRs) from China, South Korea, Italy, Spain and Japan. In all countries we found that a plot of ln (CFR) against ln (age) was approximately linear with a slope of about 5. As a comparison, we also conducted similar analyses for selected other respiratory diseases. SARS showed a similar log-log age-pattern to that of Covid-19, albeit with a lower slope, whereas seasonal and pandemic influenza showed quite different age-patterns. Thus, death from Covid-19 and SARS appears to follow a distinct age-pattern, consistent with a multistep model of disease that in the case of Covid-19 is probably defined by comorbidities and age producing immune-related susceptibility. Identification of these steps would be potentially important for prevention and therapy for SARS-COV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Neil Pearce","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Giovenale Moirano","author_inst":"University of Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Milena Maule","author_inst":"University of Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Manolis Kogevinas","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Xavier Rodo","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Deborah Lawlor","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Jan Vandenbroucke","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Christina Vandenbroucke-Grauls","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Fernando P Polack","author_inst":"Vanderbilt Unversity"},{"author_name":"Adnan Custovic","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Andrew D.

None of these tests should be used for the diagnosis or population screening of the disease, considering that the antibodies appear only on the 8th - 14th day of the disease onset. The present study evaluates a sample of immunofluorescent and immunochromatographic rapid tests to show their agreement in relation to Chemiluminescence. Methods A diagnostic test evaluation assay was performed to establish the performance of five rapid tests (4 immunochromatographic and 1 immunofluorescent tests) for IgG and IgM serology for SARS-CoV-2 using a panel of 30 serum samples from patients received in the laboratory analysis routine. For the evaluation of clinical performance, the qualitative results of the rapid tests were compared against those obtained by chemiluminescence, dichotomized as positives (>>10 AU \/ mL) or negative (<10 UA \/ mL). Findings The best agreement is seen in the immunofluorescent assay, for the IgG contrast, with a particularly good kappa index (0.85), without positive disagreements and a negative disagreement of about 15%. In the immunochromatographic methods Kappa index was 0.61 at best, with disagreements in negative findings of {approx}35% and in positive cases of up to {approx}70%. The IgM concordance behavior, on the other hand, reflects a weak to moderate Kappa concordance value (Kappa 0.2 to 0.6), with negative disagreements reaching up to 55% and positives of up to 84%, without any evaluated test reaching Kappa performance equal to or greater than 0.8. Interpretation Serological studies should be used in the clinical and epidemiological context and of other diagnostic tests. Given the high demand and supply in the market of \"rapid serological tests\", its evaluation against panels of serologically positive or negative samples established by Chemiluminescence or Electro chemiluminescence is essential to authorize its extensive use in populations Funding None","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Klever V Saenz-Flor Sr.","author_inst":"Universidad Central del Ecuador"},{"author_name":"Lorena M Santafe Sr.","author_inst":"Synlab Solutions in Diagnostics Ecuador"},{"author_name":"Milena Maule","author_inst":"University of Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Manolis Kogevinas","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Xavier Rodo","author_inst":"ISGlobal"},{"author_name":"Deborah Lawlor","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Jan Vandenbroucke","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Christina Vandenbroucke-Grauls","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Fernando P Polack","author_inst":"Vanderbilt Unversity"},{"author_name":"Adnan Custovic","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Andrew D.

In this research article, we identify public sentiment associated with the pandemic using Coronavirus specific Tweets and R statistical software, along with its sentiment analysis packages. We demonstrate insights into the progress of fear-sentiment over time as COVID-19 approached peak levels in the United States, using descriptive textual analytics supported by necessary textual data visualizations. Furthermore, we provide a methodological overview of two essential machine learning (ML) classification methods, in the context of textual analytics, and compare their effectiveness in classifying Coronavirus Tweets of varying lengths. We observe a strong classification accuracy of 91\\% for short Tweets, with the Na\\\"ive Bayes method. We also observe that the logistic regression classification method provides a reasonable accuracy of 74\\% with shorter Tweets, and both methods showed relatively weaker performance for longer Tweets. This research provides insights into Coronavirus fear sentiment progression, and outlines associated methods, implications, limitations and opportunities.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jim Samuel","author_inst":"University of Charleston, Charleston, WV"},{"author_name":"Ali G.

A large number of patients affected by the SARS-Cov-2 virus worldwide undergo recovery of symptoms in about one month. Among these patients, the healing process is still under observation, with some patients in need of careful clinical monitoring. While the radiological findings have been shown to regress almost completely, little knowledge is available at the moment about other complications in the lung and in other organs. We then investigated the lung perfusion conditions in patients affected by COVID- 19 during recovery. Method. We retrospectively studied 20 patients, from 14 to 60 days after resolution of the COVID-19 symptoms, using chest CT. In a subgroup of 5 patients contrasted CT was used. Beside normal radiological evaluation of lung tissue, perfusion conditions were evaluated by digital image processing in the lung volume automatically segmented. Results. Pulmonary lung evaluation showed that COVID-19 pneumonia almost completely regressed, with mild focal areas affected by fibrous stripes. In patients that reported dyspnea, lung CT showed complete resolution of interstitial changes. Quantification of lung perfusion condition by contrasted CT, showed that dyspnea in 3 patients was associated with areas of hypoperfusion, while in 2 patients not reporting dyspnea perfusion conditions were comparable to normal controls. Conclusions. Although we obtained preliminary data, this is the first report on quantitative evaluation of hypoperfused lung tissue detected in recovering COVID-19 patients. These results suggest the need to further investigate these patients and to redefine the role of CT evaluation for diagnostic purposes as well as for evaluation of potential treatments.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gianluigi Patelli","author_inst":"Bolognini Hospital - ASST Bergamo Est"},{"author_name":"Silvia Paganoni","author_inst":"Bolognini Hospital - ASST Bergamo Est"},{"author_name":"Francesca Besana","author_inst":"Bolognini Hospital - ASST Bergamo Est"},{"author_name":"Mattia Ronzoni","author_inst":"D\/Vision Lab srl"},{"author_name":"Simone Manini","author_inst":"D\/Vision Lab srl"},{"author_name":"Andrea Remuzzi","author_inst":"University of Bergamo"},{"author_name":"Jan Vandenbroucke","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Christina Vandenbroucke-Grauls","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Fernando P Polack","author_inst":"Vanderbilt Unversity"},{"author_name":"Adnan Custovic","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Andrew D.

Patients with severe COVID-19 infections and comorbidities are more prone to respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), mechanical ventilator use and ultimately succumb to these complications. Little evidence exists of the prevalence of underlying lung comorbidities among COVID-19 patients and associated mortality. Methods We performed a systematic review of the literature including PubMed (Medline), Embase (Ovid), Google Scholar and Cochrane Library. The last date for our search was 29th April 2020. We included all original research articles on COVID-19 and calculated prevalence of chronic lung disease patients among COVID-19 patients using random effects model. Further we assessed for mortality rates among COVID-19 patients associated with these lung comorbidities. Results The authors identified 29 articles that reported prevalence of chronic lung conditions among COVID-19 patients. Among those, 26 were from China and 3 from the United States. The pooled prevalence of lung comorbidities including Asthma, COPD, and lung cancer was 3% (95% CI=0-14%), 2.2% (95% CI=0.02-0.03%) and 2.1% (95% CI=0.00-0.21%) respectively. Mortality rates associated with these comorbidities was 30% (41\/137) for COPD and 19% (7\/37) for lung cancer respectively. No mortality rates were reported for patients with asthma. Conclusion This study offers latest evidence of prevalence of chronic lung conditions among patients with COVID-19. Asthma, followed by COPD and lung cancer, was the most common lung comorbidity associated with COVID-19, while the higher mortality rate was found in COPD. Future studies are needed to assess other lung comorbidities and associated mortality among patients diagnosed with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammed G Alkhathami","author_inst":"Prince sultan military college for health sciences"},{"author_name":"Shailesh Advani","author_inst":"Georgetown University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adil A Abalkhail","author_inst":"Qassim University, Department of Human Health"},{"author_name":"Fahad M Alkhathami","author_inst":"Jazan University, Respiratory Care Department"},{"author_name":"Mohammed K AlShehri","author_inst":"King Fahad Medical City, Respiratory Care Administration"},{"author_name":"Ebtisam Albeashy","author_inst":"Itqan Scientific Research Services Company"},{"author_name":"Jihad A Al Salamah","author_inst":"Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Respiratory Care Department"},{"author_name":"Christina Vandenbroucke-Grauls","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Fernando P Polack","author_inst":"Vanderbilt Unversity"},{"author_name":"Adnan Custovic","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Andrew D.

Several researchers have given the evidence of impacts of COVID-19 on the respiratory, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal system. Studies still have debated on kidney injury of COVID-19 patients. The purpose of the meta-analysis was to evaluate the association of kidney impairment with the development of COVID-19. Methods: The PubMed, Embase and MedRxiv databases were searched until April 1, 2020. We extracted data from eligible studies to summarize the clinical manifestations and laboratory indexes of kidney injury on COVID-19 infection patients and further compared the prevalence of acute kidney injury (AKI) and the mean differences of three biomarkers between in ICU\/severe and non-ICU\/non-severe cases. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the I2 method. Results: In the sum of 19 studies with 4375 patients were included in this analysis. The pooled prevalence of AKI, increased serum creatinine (Scr), increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), increased D-dimer, proteinuria and hematuria in patients with COVID-19 were 7.7%, 6.6%, 6.2%, 49.8%, 42% and 30.3% respectively. Moreover, the means of Scr, BUN and D-dimer were shown 6-folds, 1.8-folds and 0.68-folds, respectively, higher in ICU\/severe cases than in corresponding non-ICU\/non-severe patients. The prevalence of AKI was about 17 folds higher in ICU\/severe patients compared with the non-ICU\/non-severe cases. Conclusions: Overall, we assessed the incidences of the clinic and laboratory features of kidney injury in COVID-19 patients. And kidney dysfunction may be a risk factor for COVID-19 patients developing into the severe condition. In reverse, COVID-19 can also cause damage to the kidney.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qixin Yang","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xiyao Yang","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Adil A Abalkhail","author_inst":"Qassim University, Department of Human Health"},{"author_name":"Fahad M Alkhathami","author_inst":"Jazan University, Respiratory Care Department"},{"author_name":"Mohammed K AlShehri","author_inst":"King Fahad Medical City, Respiratory Care Administration"},{"author_name":"Ebtisam Albeashy","author_inst":"Itqan Scientific Research Services Company"},{"author_name":"Jihad A Al Salamah","author_inst":"Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Respiratory Care Department"},{"author_name":"Christina Vandenbroucke-Grauls","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Fernando P Polack","author_inst":"Vanderbilt Unversity"},{"author_name":"Adnan Custovic","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Andrew D.

One set of questions involves host genetic factors that may affect disease susceptibility and pathogenesis. New work is emerging related to SARS-CoV-2; previous work has been conducted on other coronaviruses that affect different species. Objectives: We aimed to review the literature on host genetic factors related to coronaviruses, with a systematic focus on human studies. Methods: We conducted a PubMed-based search and analysis for articles relevant to host genetic factors in coronavirus. We categorized articles, summarized themes related to animal studies, and extracted data from human studies for analyses. Results: We identified 1,187 articles of potential relevance. Forty-five studies were related to human host genetic factors related to coronavirus, of which 35 involved analysis of specific genes or loci; aside from one meta-analysis on respiratory infections, all were candidate-driven studies, typically investigating small number of research subjects and loci. Multiple significant loci were identified, including 16 related to susceptibility to coronavirus (of which 7 identified protective alleles), and 16 related to outcomes or clinical variables (of which 3 identified protective alleles). The types of cases and controls used varied considerably; four studies used traditional replication\/validation cohorts. Of the other studies, 28 involved both human and non-human host genetic factors related to coronavirus, 174 involved study of non-human (animal) host genetic factors related to coronavirus, 584 involved study of non-genetic host factors related to coronavirus, including involving immunopathogenesis, 16 involved study of other pathogens (not coronavirus), 321 involved other studies of coronavirus, and 18 studies were assigned to the other categories and removed. Key findings: We have outlined key genes and loci from animal and human host genetic studies that may bear investigation in the nascent host genetic factor studies of COVID-19. Previous human studies to date have been limited by issues that may be less impactful on current endeavors, including relatively low numbers of eligible participants and limited availability of advanced genomic methods.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marissa LoPresti","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"David B Beck","author_inst":"National Human Genome Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Priya Duggal","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Derek A.T.

A key unknown in social distancing strategies is the duration of time for which such strategies are needed. Answering this question requires an accurate model of the transmission trajectory. A challenge in fitting such a model is the limited COVID-19 case data available from a given location. To overcome this challenge, we propose fitting a model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission jointly across multiple locations. We apply the model to COVID-19 case data from Spain, UK, Germany, France, Denmark, and New York to estimate the distribution for the time needed for social distancing to end to range from May 2020 to July 2021 (95% credible interval), where the median date is October 2020. Our method is not specific to COVID-19, and it can also be applied to future pandemics.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nadav Rakocz","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Boyang Fu","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Eran Halperin","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Sriram Sankararaman","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Benjamin D Solomon","author_inst":"National Human Genome Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Ebtisam Albeashy","author_inst":"Itqan Scientific Research Services Company"},{"author_name":"Jihad A Al Salamah","author_inst":"Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Respiratory Care Department"},{"author_name":"Christina Vandenbroucke-Grauls","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Fernando P Polack","author_inst":"Vanderbilt Unversity"},{"author_name":"Adnan Custovic","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Andrew D.
