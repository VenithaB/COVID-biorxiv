Numerous factors may influence an individuals willingness to report these symptoms. Understanding these factors has become urgent during the COVID-19 pandemic Objective To determine which factors influence symptom reporting during an emerging infectious disease outbreak Methods We conducted a rapid review of the evidence. We included papers based on primary research, published in peer-reviewed journals, written in English, included factors associated with symptom reporting or accessing healthcare, and related to a major public health incident involving an infectious disease outbreak Results Five themes were identified as facilitators of symptom reporting or accessing healthcare (accurate and informative communication, symptom severity, concern about exposure, ease of access, and relationship with the healthcare provider). Seven themes were identified as barriers of symptom reporting or accessing healthcare (lack of knowledge, fear, stigmatization, invasion of privacy, low concerns about symptoms, economics, and practicalities of attending a healthcare facility) Discussion If contract tracing services are to be effective, members of the public need to have the capability, opportunity and motivation to use them. The themes identified should be used to evaluate the information provided to the public about such a service, the routes of access, and the underlying polices relating to the service, in order to ensure that as many people as possible with relevant symptoms will make contact","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patrice Carter","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Odette Megnin-Viggars","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Gideon James Rubin","author_inst":"King's College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.22.20159962","rel_title":"Mathematical model study of a pandemic: Graded lockdown approach","rel_date":"2020-07-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.22.20159962","rel_abs":"A kinetic approach is developed, in a \"tutorial style\" to describe the evolution of an epidemic with spread taking place through contact. The \"infection-rate\" is calculated from the rate at which an infected person approaches an uninfected susceptible individual, i.e. a potential recipient of the disease, up to a distance p, where the value of p may lie between pmin[&le;]p[&le;]pmax. We consider a situation with a total population of N individuals, living in an area A, x(t) amongst them being infected while xd(t) = {beta}'x(t) is the number that has died in the course of transmission and evolution of the epidemic. The evolution is developed under the conditions (1) a faction (t) of the [N-x(t)-xd(t)] uninfected individuals and (2) a {beta}(t) fraction of the x(t) infected population are quarantined, while the \"source-events\" that spread the infection are considered to occur with frequency {upsilon}. The processes of contact and transmission are considered to be Markovian. Transmission is assumed to be inhibited by several processes like the use of \"masks\", \"hand washing or use of sanitizers\" while \"physical distancing\" is described by p. The evolution equation for x(t) is a Riccati - type differential equation whose coefficients are time-dependent quantities, being determined by an interplay between the above parameters. A formal solution for x(t) is presented, for a \"graded lockdown\" with the parameters, 0[&le;](t), {beta}(t)[&le;]1 reaching their respective saturation values in time scales, {tau}1, {tau}2 respectively, from their initial values (0)={beta}(0)=0. The growth is predicted for several BBMP wards in Bengaluru and in urban centers in Chikkaballapur district, as an illustrative case. The above selections serve as model cases for high, moderate and thin population densities. It is seen that the evolution of [x(t)\/N] with time depends upon (a) the initial time scale of evolution, (b) the time scale of cure and (c) on the time dependence of the Lockdown function Q(t) = {[1-(t)]{middle dot}[1-{beta}(t)]}. The formulae are amenable to simple computations and show that in order to curb the spread one must ensure that Q({infty}) must be below a critical value and the vigilance has to be continued for a long time (at least 100 to 150 days) after the decay starts,to avoid all chances of the infection reappearing.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"S Chateerjee","author_inst":"Ongil, No. 4, Rajiv Gandhi Salai, Taramani, Chennai 600 113, India"},{"author_name":"V.C.

So far COVID-19 in-hospital mortality and modes of death under optimised care conditions have not been systematically studied. Methods This retrospective observational monocenter cohort study was performed after implementation of a non-restricted, dynamic tertiary care model at the University Medical Center Freiburg, an experienced ARDS and ECMO referral center. All hospitalised patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality, secondary endpoints included major complications and modes of death. A multistate analysis and a Cox regression analysis for competing risk models were performed. Modes of death were determined by two independent reviewers. Results Between February 25, and May 8, 213 patients were included in the analysis. The median age was 65 years, 129 patients (61%) were male. 70 patients (33%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), of which 57 patients (81%) received mechanical ventilation and 23 patients (33%) extracorporeal membrane-oxygenation (ECMO) support. According to the multistate model the probability to die within 90 days after COVID-19 onset was 24% in the whole cohort. If the levels of care at time of study entry were accounted for, the probabilities to die were 16% if the patient was initially on a regular ward, 47% if in the ICU and 57% if mechanical ventilation was required at study entry. Age >=65 years and male sex were predictors for in-hospital death. Predominant complications - as judged by two independent reviewers - determining modes of death were multi-organ failure, septic shock and thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications. Conclusion In a dynamic care model COVID-19-related in-hospital mortality remained substantial. In the absence of potent antiviral agents, strategies to alleviate or prevent the identified complications should be investigated. In this context, multistate analyses enable comparison of models-of-care and treatment strategies and allow estimation and allocation of health care resources.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Siegbert Rieg","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine II, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, 79106 Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Maja von Cube","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biometry and Statistics, Faculty of Medicine and Medical Center - University of"},{"author_name":"Johannes Kalbhenn","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, 79106 Freiburg, "},{"author_name":"Stefan Utzolino","author_inst":"Department of General and Visceral Surgery, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, 79106 Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Katharina Pernice","author_inst":"Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Heart Center, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, 79106 Freiburg, German"},{"author_name":"Lena Bechet","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine II, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, 79106 Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Johanna Baur","author_inst":"Department of Medicine III (Interdisciplinary Medical Intensive Care), Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, 791"},{"author_name":"Corinna N Lang","author_inst":"Department of Medicine III (Interdisciplinary Medical Intensive Care), Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, 791"},{"author_name":"Dirk Wagner","author_inst":"Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Martin Wolkewitz","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biometry and Statistics, Faculty of Medicine and Medical Center, University of Freiburg, 79104 Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Winfried V Kern","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine II, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, 79106 Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Paul Biever","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology and Angiology I, Heart Center Freiburg University, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.22.20160002","rel_title":"Remdesivir for COVID-19: match-population analysis with compassionate use of Remdesivir for severe COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-07-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.22.20160002","rel_abs":"We retrospectively compared outcomes between patients who received compassionate care Remdesivir and whose who met criteria for Remdesivir, but did not received it due to period of unavailability.

We measured levels of total lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD19+ B cells, CD56+ NK cells, and the serum concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-{beta}), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), and interferon gamma (IFN-{gamma}) by flow cytometry. We found that in most post-recovery patients, levels of total lymphocytes (66.67%), CD3+ T cells (54.55%), CD4+ T cells (54.55%), CD8 + T cells (81.82%), CD19+ B cells (69.70%), and CD56+ NK cells(51.52%) remained lower than normal, whereas most patients showed normal levels of IL-2 (100%), IL-4 (80.88%), IL-6 (79.41%), IL-10 (98.53%), TNF- (89.71%), IFN-{gamma} (100%) and IL-17 (97.06%). Compared to healthy controls, 2-week post-recovery patients had significantly lower absolute numbers of total lymphocytes, CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD19+ B cells, and CD56+ NK cells, along with significantly higher levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-, IFN-{gamma} and IL-17. Among post-recovery patients, T cells, particularly CD4+ T cells, were positively correlated with CD19+ B cell counts. Additionally, CD8+ T cells positively correlated with CD4+ T cells and IL-2 levels, and IL-6 positively correlated with TNF- and IFN-{gamma}. These correlations were not observed in healthy controls. By ROC curve analysis, post-recovery decreases in lymphocyte subsets and increases in cytokines were identified as independent predictors of rehabilitation efficacy. These findings indicate that the immune system has gradually recovered following COVID-19 infection; however, the sustained hyper-inflammatory response for more than 14 days suggests a need to continue medical observation following discharge from the hospital. Longitudinal studies of a larger cohort of recovered patients are needed to fully understand the consequences of the infection.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hasi Chaolu","author_inst":"First hospital of Shanxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xinri Zhang","author_inst":"First hospital of Shanxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xin Li","author_inst":"Cardiovascular Hospital of Shanxi Province"},{"author_name":"Xin Li","author_inst":"First hospital of Shanxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Dongyan Li","author_inst":"First hospital of Shanxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Lena Bechet","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine II, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, 79106 Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Johanna Baur","author_inst":"Department of Medicine III (Interdisciplinary Medical Intensive Care), Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, 791"},{"author_name":"Corinna N Lang","author_inst":"Department of Medicine III (Interdisciplinary Medical Intensive Care), Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, 791"},{"author_name":"Dirk Wagner","author_inst":"Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Martin Wolkewitz","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biometry and Statistics, Faculty of Medicine and Medical Center, University of Freiburg, 79104 Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Winfried V Kern","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine II, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, 79106 Freiburg"},{"author_name":"Paul Biever","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology and Angiology I, Heart Center Freiburg University, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.22.20160093","rel_title":"Using mobile phone data for epidemiological simulations of lockdowns: government interventions, behavioral changes, and resulting changes of reinfections","rel_date":"2020-07-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.22.20160093","rel_abs":"Epidemiological simulations as a method are used to better understand and predict the spreading of infectious diseases, for example of COVID-19.

Cremations are performed for most deaths in Ontario and require coroner certification before the cremation can take place. Our objective was to provide timely analysis of deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic using cremation data. Methods: This study describes cremation certificate data from January 1, 2017, to May 31, 2020, in Ontario. Cremation records during 2020 were compared to historical records from 2017-2019, grouped according to age, month, and place of death and further stratified by COVID-19 involvement. A time series model was fit to quantify the deviation in cremation trends during the COVID-19 period. Results: There have been 33 834 cremations in Ontario in 2020, and 20 898 (62%) took place from March onwards. In April, which saw the peak number of COVID-19 cases, had an additional 1,830 cremations compared to historical averages over 2017-2019, representing a 32% increase (3 871 in 2020). Time series modelling of cremations in Ontario from January 2017 demonstrated that cremations in March, April, and May 2020 exceeded the predicted increase based on modelled estimates. Even without the COVID-19 deaths, the seasonal and numerical trends for 2020 are substantially different from the historical period. Interpretation: Cremations were higher in the months during the pandemic compared to previous years. These early estimates of mortality are critical for understanding the impact of COVID-19. This study has demonstrated the utility of cremation data to provide timely mortality information during a public health emergency.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gemma Postill","author_inst":"Western University"},{"author_name":"Regan Murray","author_inst":"Office of the Chief Coroner for Ontario"},{"author_name":"Andrew Wilton","author_inst":"Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences"},{"author_name":"Richard A.

Surveillance monitoring has suggested that the age distribution of people infected with SARS CoV2 has changed since the pandemic began, but no formal analysis has been performed. Methods Retrospective review of SARS CoV2 molecular testing results from a national reference laboratory was performed. Result distributions by age and positivity were compared between early period (March to April 2020) and late periods (June to July 2020) of the COVID 19 pandemic. Additionally, a subanalysis compared changing age distributions between inpatients and outpatients. Results There were 277,601 test results of which 19320 (7.0%) were positive. The median age of infected people declined over time (p < 0.0005). In March-April, the median age of positive people was 40.8 years (Interquartile range (IQR): 29.0, 54.1). In June-July, the median age of positive people was 35.8 years (IQR: 24.0, 50.2). The positivity rate of patients under 50 increased from 6.0 to 10.6 percent and the positivity rate for those over 50 decreased from 6.3 to 5.0 percent between the early and late periods. The trend was only observed for outpatient populations. Conclusions We confirm that there is a trend toward decreasing age among persons with laboratory-confirmed SARS CoV2 infection, but that these trends seem to be specific to the outpatient population. Overall, this suggests that observed age-related trends are driven by changes in testing patterns rather than true changes in the epidemiology of SARS CoV2 infection. This calls for caution in interpretation of routine surveillance data until testing patterns stabilize.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dina N Greene","author_inst":"University of Washington, Kaiser Permanente"},{"author_name":"Michael L Jackson","author_inst":"Kaiser Permanente Washington"},{"author_name":"David R Hillyard","author_inst":"University of Utah Department of Pathology and ARUP Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Julio C Delgado","author_inst":"University of Utah Department of Pathology and ARUP Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Robert L Schmidt","author_inst":"University of Utah Department of Pathology and ARUP Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Mark J.

We aimed to explore the academic value of preprints through comparing with peer-reviewed publications, and synthesize the parameter estimates of the two kinds of literature. Method We collected papers regarding the estimation of four key epidemiological parameters of the COVID-19 in China: the basic reproduction number (R0), incubation period, infectious period, and case-fatality-rate (CFR). PubMed, Google Scholar, medRxiv, bioRxiv, arRxiv, and SSRN were searched by 20 March, 2020. Distributions of parameters and timeliness of preprints and peer-reviewed papers were compared. Further, four parameters were synthesized by bootstrap, and their validity was verified by susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered-dead-cumulative (SEIRDC) model based on the context of China. Findings 106 papers were included for analysis. The distributions of four parameters in two literature groups were close, despite that the timeliness of preprints was better. Four parameter estimates changed over time. Synthesized estimates of R0 (3.18, 95% CI 2.85-3.53), incubation period (5.44 days, 95% CI 4.98-5.99), infectious period (6.25 days, 95% CI 5.09-7.51), and CFR (4.51%, 95% CI 3.41%-6.29%) were obtained from the whole parameters space, all with p<0.05. Their validity was evaluated by simulated cumulative cases of SEIRDC model, which matched well with the onset cases in China. Interpretation Preprints could reflect the changes of epidemic situation sensitively, and their academic value shouldn't be neglected. Synthesized results of literatures could reduce the uncertainty and be used for epidemic decision making.

A reasonable policy will surely prioritize populations facing high risk of severe illness in high-exposure occupations. The challenge is deciding between high-risk populations in low-exposure occupations and those that are young and healthy but work in high-exposure occupations. We estimate occupation-based infection risks and use age-based infection fatality rates in a model to assign priorities over populations with different occupations and ages. Among others, we find that 50 year-old food-processing workers and 60 year-old financial advisors are equally prioritized. Our model suggests a vaccine distribution that emphasizes age-based mortality risk more than occupation-based exposure risk. Designating some occupations as essential does not affect the optimal vaccine allocation, unless a stay-at-home order is also in effect. Even with vaccines allocated optimally, 1.37% of the employed workforce is still expected to be infected with the virus until the vaccine becomes widely available, provided the vaccine is 50% effective and assuming a supply of 60mil doses.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ana Babus","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Sanmay Das","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"SangMok Lee","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Qingpeng Zhang","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Tianyi Luo","author_inst":"Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mark J.

However, this information is needed in faster timescales. Notably, the dynamics of an epidemic where recovered patients become immune for any period should differ significantly from those of one where the recovered promptly become susceptible. Here, we exploit this difference to provide a reliable protocol that can estimate immunity early in an epidemic. We verify this protocol with synthetic data, discuss its limitations, and then apply it to evaluate human immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in mortality data series from New York City. Our results indicate that New York's mortality figures are incompatible with immunity lasting anything below 105 or above 211 days (90% CI.), and set an example on how to assess immune memory in emerging pandemics before serological studies can be deployed.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pablo Yubero","author_inst":"Spanish National Biotechnology Center (CNB-CSIC)"},{"author_name":"Alvar A.

We sought to assess the risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 and serious complications in current users of ARB or ACEi compared to users of dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (dhpCCB). Design: Cohort study Setting: The analysis used de-identified, patient-level data from HealthVerity, linking longitudinal data from US medical and pharmacy claims, which contain information on inpatient or outpatient diagnoses, procedures and medication dispensing. Participants: We identified patients aged 40+ and free of chronic kidney disease (CKD) who were newly diagnosed COVID-19, between March 1, 2020 and May 30, 2020, and adherent to ACEi, ARB, or dhpCCB therapy. Interventions: Current use of an ACEi, ARB, or dhpCCB. Main outcome measures: We compared the 30-day risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 and serious complications. Results: Of 24,708 patients identified, 7,571 were current users of an ARB, 8,484 of an ACEi, and 8,653 of a dhpCCB. The unadjusted 30-day risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 was 2.66% among ARB users, and 2.90% among ACEi users and 3.68% in dhpCCB users. In the PS-matched cohort, the risk of hospitalization among ARB users was 17% lower as compared to dhpCCB (RR=0.83; 0.68-1.00), and the risk among ACE users was 10% lower as compared to dhpCCB (RR=0.90; 0.76-1.07). When including patients with pre-existing CKD, the protective effect of ARB (RR= 0.74; 0.62-0.88) and ACEi (RR=0.84; 0.71-0.99) was more pronounced. Conclusions: This cohort study showed that neither ARB nor ACEi use increase the risk of severe COVID-19 disease among those infected, and instead suggests that current use of ARB may offer a protective effect. This study found no evidence to support the discontinuation of ARB\/ACEi therapy.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria C Schneeweiss","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sandra Leonard","author_inst":"HealthVerity Inc."},{"author_name":"Andrew Weckstein","author_inst":"Aetion, Inc."},{"author_name":"Sebastian Schneeweiss","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Rassen","author_inst":"Aetion, Inc."},{"author_name":"Mark J.

The availability of information in pediatric intensive care (PICUs) remains limited. The purpose of this study is to characterize COVID-19 positive admissions (CPAs) in the United States and to determine factors that may impact those admissions. Materials and Methods This is a retrospective cohort study using data from the COVID-19 dashboard virtual pediatric system containing information regarding respiratory support and comorbidities for all CPAs between March and April 2020. The state level data contained 13 different factors from population density, comorbid conditions and social distancing score. The absolute CPAs count was converted to frequency using the state's population. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to assess the association between CPAs frequency and endpoints. Results A total of 205 CPAs were reported by 167 PICUs across 48 states. The estimated CPAs frequency was 2.8 per million children. A total of 3,235 tests were conducted with 6.3% positive tests. Children above 11 years of age comprised 69.7% of the total cohort and 35.1% had moderated or severe comorbidities. The median duration of a CPA was 4.9 days [1.25-12.00 days]. Out of the 1,132 total CPA days, 592 [52.2%] were for mechanical ventilation. The inpatient mortalities were 3 [1.4%]. Multivariate analyses demonstrated an association between CPA's with greater population density [beta-coefficient 0.01, p<0.01] and increased percent of children receiving the influenza vaccination [beta-coefficient 0.17, p=0.01]. Conclusions Inpatient mortality during PICU CPAs is relatively low at 1.4%. CPA frequency seems to be impacted by population density while characteristics of illness severity appear to be associated with ultraviolet index, temperature, and comorbidities such as Type 1 diabetes. These factors should be included in future studies using patient-level data.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rohit S.

Houston, located in the Harris County of Texas, is becoming the next hotspot of this pandemic. With a severe decline in international and inter-state travel, a model at the county level, as opposed to the state or country level, is needed. Existing approaches have a few drawbacks. Firstly, the data used is the number of COVID-19 positive cases instead of positivity. The former is a function of the number of tests carried out while the latter is normalized by the number of tests. Positivity gives a better picture of the spread of this pandemic as with time more tests are being administered. Positivity under 5% has been desired for the reopening of businesses to almost 100% capacity. Secondly, the data used by models like SEIRD lacks information about the sentiment of people with respect to coronavirus. Thirdly, models that make use of social media posts might have too much noise. News sentiment, on the other hand, can capture long term effects of hidden variables like public policy, opinions of local doctors, and disobedience of state-wide mandates. The present study introduces a new AI model, viz., Sentiment Informed Timeseries Analyzing AI (SITALA), that has been trained on COVID-19 test positivity data and news sentiment from over 2750 news articles for the Harris county. The news sentiment was obtained using IBM Watson Discovery News. SITALA is inspired by Google-Wavenet architecture and makes use of TensorFlow. The mean absolute error for the training dataset of 66 consecutive days is 2.76 and that for the test dataset of 22 consecutive days is 9.6. The model forecasts that in order to curb the spread of coronavirus in Houston, a sustained negative news sentiment will be desirable. Public policymakers may use SITALA to set the tone of the local policies and mandates.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Prathamesh S Desai","author_inst":"W. M.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the public health impact of reopening schools on the spread of COVID19. An agent-based simulation model was adapted and used to project the number of infections and deaths under multiple school reopening dates and scenarios, including different cohorts receiving in-person instruction on alternating days, only younger children returning to in-person instruction, regular schedule (all students receiving in-person instruction), and school closure (all students receiving online instruction). The study period was February 18th-November 24th, 2020 and the state of Georgia was used as a case study. Across all scenarios, the number of COVID19-related deaths ranged from approximately 17 to 22 thousand during the study period, and on the peak day, the number of new infections ranged from 43 to 68 thousand. An alternating school day schedule performed: (i) almost as well as keeping schools closed, with the infection attack rate ranging from 38.5% to 39.8% compared to that of 37.7% under school closure; (ii) slightly better than only allowing children 10 years or younger to return to in-person instruction.

This systematic review aimed to examine contact tracing effectiveness in the context of COVID-19. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, and All EBM Reviews were searched using a range of terms related to contact tracing for COVID-19. Articles were included if they reported on the ability of contact tracing to slow or stop the spread of COVID-19 or on characteristics of effective tracing efforts. Two investigators screened all studies. Results: A total of 32 articles were found. All were observational or modelling studies, so the quality of the evidence was low. Observational studies (n=14) all reported that contact tracing (alone or in combination with other interventions) was associated with better control of COVID-19. Results of modelling studies (n=18) depended on their assumptions. Under assumptions of prompt and thorough tracing with no further transmission, they found that contact tracing could stop an outbreak (e.g. by reducing the reproduction number from 2.2 to 0.57) or that it could reduce infections (e.g. by 24%-71% with a mobile tracing app). Under assumptions of slower, less efficient tracing, modelling studies suggested that tracing could slow, but not stop COVID-19. Conclusions: Observational and modelling studies suggest that contact tracing is associated with better control of COVID-19. Its effectiveness likely depends on a number of factors, including how many and how fast contacts are traced and quarantined, and how effective quarantines are at preventing further transmission. A cautious interpretation suggests that to stop the spread of COVID-19, public health practitioners have 2-3 days from the time a new case develops symptoms to isolate the case and quarantine at least 80% of its contacts, and that once isolated, cases and contacts should infect zero new cases. Less efficient tracing may slow, but not stop, the spread of COVID-19. Inefficient tracing (with delays of 4-5+ days or less than 60% of contacts quarantined with no further transmission) may not contribute meaningfully to control of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carl-Etienne Juneau","author_inst":"COVID-19 Work Group"},{"author_name":"Anne-Sara Briand","author_inst":"Universite de Montreal"},{"author_name":"Tomas Pueyo","author_inst":"COVID-19 Work Group"},{"author_name":"Pablo Collazzo","author_inst":"Danube University"},{"author_name":"Louise Potvin","author_inst":"Universite de Montreal"},{"author_name":"Mark J.

Future evidence will inform updates to this guidance, which in the interim provides a solid framework to support clinicians caring for children with PIMS-TS.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rachel Harwood","author_inst":"Department of Paediatric Surgery, Alder Hey Childrens Hospital, Eaton Road, Liverpool, L12 2AP"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Allin","author_inst":"National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit, Nuffield Department of Health, University of Oxford, Old Road Campus, Oxford, OX3 9DU"},{"author_name":"Christine E Jones","author_inst":"NIHR Southampton Clinical Research Facility and Biomedical Research Centre, University Hospital Southampton Foundation NHS Trust and Faculty of Medicine and Ins"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Whittaker","author_inst":"Department of Paediatrics, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Padmanabhan Ramnarayan","author_inst":"Childrens Acute Transport Service, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Athimalaipet Ramanan","author_inst":"Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, Upper Maudlin Street Bristol, BS2 8BJ, UK"},{"author_name":"Musa Kaleem","author_inst":"Department of Paediatric Radiology, Alder Hey Childrens Hospital Eaton Road, Liverpool, L12 2AP, UK"},{"author_name":"Robert Tulloh","author_inst":"Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, Upper Maudlin Street Bristol, BS2 8BJ, UK"},{"author_name":"Mark J Peters","author_inst":"UCL Great Ormond St Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond St Hospital NHS Trust, NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, UK"},{"author_name":"Sarah Almond","author_inst":"Department of Paediatric Surgery, Alder Hey Childrens Hospital, Eaton Road, Liverpool, L12 2AP"},{"author_name":"Peter J Davis","author_inst":"Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, Upper Maudlin Street Bristol, BS2 8BJ, UK"},{"author_name":"Michael Levin","author_inst":"Department of Paediatrics, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Saul N Faust","author_inst":"NIHR Southampton Clinical Research Facility and Biomedical Research Centre, University Hospital Southampton Foundation NHS Trust and Faculty of Medicine and Ins"},{"author_name":"Marian Knight","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Simon Kenny","author_inst":"NHS England\/Improvement, PO Box 16738, Redditch, B97 9PT, UK"},{"author_name":"- PIMS-TS National Consensus Management Study Group","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.16.20155531","rel_title":"Safety of Hydroxychloroquine among Outpatient Clinical Trial Participants for COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-07-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.16.20155531","rel_abs":"Introduction: Use of hydroxychloroquine in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, especially in combination with azithromycin, has raised safety concerns. Here, we report safety data from three outpatient randomized clinical trials. Methods: We conducted three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials investigating hydroxychloroquine as pre-exposure prophylaxis, post-exposure prophylaxis and early treatment for COVID-19. We excluded individuals with contraindications to hydroxychloroquine. We collected side effects and serious adverse events. We report descriptive analyses of our findings. Results: We enrolled 2,795 participants. The median age of research participants was 40 (IQR 34-49) years, and 59% (1633\/2767) reported no chronic medical conditions. Overall 2,324 (84%) participants reported side effect data, and 638 (27%) reported at least one medication side effect. Side effects were reported in 29% with daily, 36% with twice weekly, 31% with once weekly hydroxychloroquine compared to 19% with placebo. The most common side effects were upset stomach or nausea (25% with daily, 18% with twice weekly, 16% with weekly, vs. 10% for placebo), followed by diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal pain (23% for daily, 16% twice weekly, 12% weekly, vs. 6% for placebo). Two individuals were hospitalized for atrial arrhythmias, one on placebo and one on twice weekly hydroxychloroquine. No sudden deaths occurred. Conclusion: Data from three outpatient COVID-19 trials demonstrated that gastrointestinal side effects were common but mild with the use of hydroxychloroquine, while serious side effects were rare. No deaths occurred related to hydroxychloroquine. Randomized clinical trials can safely investigate whether hydroxychloroquine is efficacious for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"SARAH M LOFGREN","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA"},{"author_name":"Melanie R Nicol","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Ananta S Bangdiwala","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Katelyn A Pastick","author_inst":"University of Minnesota School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth C Okafor","author_inst":"University of Minnesota School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Caleb P Skipper","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Matthew F Pullen","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Nicole W Engen","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Mahsa Abassi","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Darlisha A Williams","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Alanna A Nascene","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Margaret L Axelrod","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University"},{"author_name":"Sylvian A Lother","author_inst":"University of Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Lauren J MacKenzie","author_inst":"University of Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Glen Drobot","author_inst":"University of Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Nicole Marten","author_inst":"George & Fay Yee Centre for Healthcare Innovation, Winnipeg, Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Matthew P Cheng","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Ryan Zarychanshi","author_inst":"University of Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Ilan S Schwartz","author_inst":"University of Alberta"},{"author_name":"Michael Silverman","author_inst":"Lawson Research Institute, London, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Zain Chagla","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Lauren E Kelly","author_inst":"George & Fay Yee Centre for Healthcare Innovation, Winnipeg, Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Emily G McDonald","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Todd C Lee","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Katherine Huppler Hullsiek","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"David R Boulware","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Radha Rajasingham","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.16.20152868","rel_title":"SECOND WEEK METHYL-PREDNISOLONE PULSES IMPROVE PROGNOSIS IN PATIENTS WITH SEVERE CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 PNEUMONIA: AN OBSERVATIONAL COMPARATIVE STUDY USING ROUTINE CARE DATA.","rel_date":"2020-07-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.16.20152868","rel_abs":"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the effects of a short course of methyl-prednisolone pulses (MP) during the second week of disease (week-2) in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. METHODS: Comparative observational study using data collected from routine care at Hospital Universitario Cruces, Barakaldo, Bizkaia, Spain in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. We compared patients who received week-2-MP (125-250 mg\/d x3) with those who did not, with the end-points time to death and time to death or endotracheal intubation. RESULTS: We included 242 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and elevated inflammatory markers at admission. Sixty-one patients (25%) received week-2-MP. Twenty-two patients (9%) died and 31 (12.8%) suffered death or intubation. The adjusted HRs for death and death or intubation for patients in the week-2-MP group were 0.35 (95%CI 0.11 to 1.06, p= 0.064) and 0.33 (95%CI 0.13 to 0.84, p=0.020), respectively. These differences were specifically seen in the subcohort of patients with a SpO2\/FiO2 at day 7 lower than 353 (adjusted HR 0.31, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.12, p=0.073 and HR 0.34, 95%CI 0.12 to 0.94, p=0.038, respectively) but not in patients with higher SpO2\/FiO2. Patients receiving out-of-week-2-MP, non-pulse glucocorticoids or no glucocorticoids had an increased adjusted risk for both outcomes compared with week-2-MP group: HR 5.04 (95% CI 0.91-27.86), HR 10.09 (95% CI 2.14-47.50), HR 4.14 (95% CI 0.81-21.23), respectively, for death; HR 7.38 (95% CI 1.86-29.29), HR 13.71 (95% CI 3.76-50.07), HR 3.58 (95% CI 0.89-14.32), respectively, for death or intubation. These differences were significant only in the subgroup with low SpO2\/FiO2. CONCLUSIONS: Week-2-MP are effective in improving the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with features of inflammatory activity and respiratory deterioration entering the second week of disease. The recognition of this high-risk population should prompt early use of MP at this point. This study has been registered in the EU PAS Register with the number EUPAS36287.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guillermo Ruiz-Irastorza","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jose-Ignacio Pijoan","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Elena Bereciartua","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Susanna Dunder","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jokin Dominguez","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Paula Garcia-Escudero","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Alejandro Rodrigo","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Carlota Gomez-Carballo","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jimena Varona","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Laura Guio","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Marta Ibarrola","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Amaia Ugarte","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Agustin Martinez-Berriotxoa","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Lauren J MacKenzie","author_inst":"University of Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Glen Drobot","author_inst":"University of Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Nicole Marten","author_inst":"George & Fay Yee Centre for Healthcare Innovation, Winnipeg, Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Matthew P Cheng","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Ryan Zarychanshi","author_inst":"University of Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Ilan S Schwartz","author_inst":"University of Alberta"},{"author_name":"Michael Silverman","author_inst":"Lawson Research Institute, London, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Zain Chagla","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Lauren E Kelly","author_inst":"George & Fay Yee Centre for Healthcare Innovation, Winnipeg, Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Emily G McDonald","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Todd C Lee","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Katherine Huppler Hullsiek","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"David R Boulware","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Radha Rajasingham","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.22.216242","rel_title":"Phylogeny of the COVID-19 Virus SARS-CoV-2 by Compression","rel_date":"2020-07-23","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.22.216242","rel_abs":"We analyze the whole genome phylogeny and taxonomy of the SARS-CoV-2 virus using compression.

The results comprise that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is closest to the RaTG13 virus and similar to two bat SARS-like coronaviruses bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and bat-SL-CoVZC4. The similarity is quantified and compared with the same quantified similarities among the mtDNA of certain species. We treat the question whether Pangolins are involved in the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Innovative approaches for evaluating the biological activity of these cytokines in vivo are urgently needed to complement clinical trials of therapeutic targeting of IL-1 and IL-6 in COVID-19. We show that the expression of IL-1 or IL-6 inducible transcriptional signatures (modules) reflects the bioactivity of these cytokines in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and rheumatoid arthritis, and discerns the effect of therapeutic cytokine blockade in JIA. In COVID-19, elevated expression of IL-1 and IL-6 response modules, but not these cytokines per se, is a feature of disease both in blood and in affected organs. We propose that IL-1 and IL-6 transcriptional response modules can provide a dynamic readout of the activity of these cytokine pathways in vivo, with potential applications for identifying COVID-19 patients who may benefit from IL-1 or IL-6 blocking therapy, and to aid quantification of the biological effects of these treatments.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lucy C K Bell","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Mahdad Noursadeghi","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Gabriele Pollara","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Susanna Dunder","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jokin Dominguez","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Paula Garcia-Escudero","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Alejandro Rodrigo","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Carlota Gomez-Carballo","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jimena Varona","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Laura Guio","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Marta Ibarrola","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Amaia Ugarte","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Agustin Martinez-Berriotxoa","author_inst":"Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Lauren J MacKenzie","author_inst":"University of Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Glen Drobot","author_inst":"University of Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Nicole Marten","author_inst":"George & Fay Yee Centre for Healthcare Innovation, Winnipeg, Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Matthew P Cheng","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Ryan Zarychanshi","author_inst":"University of Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Ilan S Schwartz","author_inst":"University of Alberta"},{"author_name":"Michael Silverman","author_inst":"Lawson Research Institute, London, Ontario"},{"author_name":"Zain Chagla","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Lauren E Kelly","author_inst":"George & Fay Yee Centre for Healthcare Innovation, Winnipeg, Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Emily G McDonald","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Todd C Lee","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Katherine Huppler Hullsiek","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"David R Boulware","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Radha Rajasingham","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.22.213959","rel_title":"From people to Panthera: Natural SARS-CoV-2 infection in tigers and lions at the Bronx Zoo","rel_date":"2020-07-23","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.22.213959","rel_abs":"We describe the first cases of natural SARS-CoV-2 infection detected in animals in the United States.

Here, we took advantage of INNODIA network EUnPOD biobank collection to thoroughly analyse ACE2, both at mRNA and protein level, in multiple human pancreatic tissues and using several methodologies. We showed that ACE2 is indeed present in human pancreatic islets, where is preferentially expressed by insulin producing {beta}-cells.

Since its first report, SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in a global pandemic, with over 10 million human infections and over 560,000 deaths reported worldwide at the end of June 2020. Currently, there are no United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccines and\/or antivirals licensed against SARS-CoV-2, and the high economical and health impact of SARS-CoV-2 has placed global pressure on the scientific community to identify effective prophylactic and therapeutic treatments for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated COVID-19 disease. While some compounds have been already reported to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection and a handful of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been described that neutralize SARS-CoV-2, there is an urgent need for the development and standardization of assays which can be used in high through-put screening (HTS) settings to identify new antivirals and\/or neutralizing mAbs against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we described a rapid, accurate and highly reproducible plaque reduction microneutralization (PRMNT) assay that can be quickly adapted for the identification and characterization of both neutralizing mAbs and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, our MNA is compatible with HTS settings to interrogate large and\/or complex libraries of mAbs and\/or antivirals to identify those with neutralizing and\/or antiviral activity, respectively, against SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jun-Gyu Oark","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Fatai S Oladduni","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Kevin Chiem","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Chengjin Ye","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Michael Pipenbrink","author_inst":"University of Alabama"},{"author_name":"Thomas Moran","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Mark Walter","author_inst":"University of Alabama"},{"author_name":"James Kobie","author_inst":"University of Alabama at Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Luis Martinez-Sobrido","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Piero Marchetti","author_inst":"Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"},{"author_name":"Chantal Mathieu","author_inst":"Clinical and Experimental Endocrinology (CEE), Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (KULEUVEN), Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Decio Laks Eizirik","author_inst":"ULB Center for Diabetes Research, Medical Faculty, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Guido Sebastiani","author_inst":"Diabetes Unit, Department of Medicine, Surgery and Neurosciences, University of Siena, Siena, Italy;

The antibody production against the spike glycoprotein (S protein) or receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 was elevated, with large individual differences, as assessed by ELISA. In the analysis of the predicted the linear B cell epitopes, two regions (671-690 aa. and 1146-1164 aa.), which were located in S1 and S2 but not in the RBD, were highly reactive with the sera from patients. In the further analysis of the B cell epitope within the S protein by utilizing a B cell epitope array, a hot spot in the N-terminal domain of the S protein but not the RBD was observed in individuals with neutralizing activity.

Despite progress at remarkable speed, current intramuscular vaccines are designed to elicit systemic immunity without conferring mucosal immunity. We report the development of an intranasal subunit vaccine that contains the trimeric or monomeric spike protein and liposomal STING agonist as adjuvant. This vaccine induces systemic neutralizing antibodies, mucosal IgA responses in the lung and nasal compartments, and T-cell responses in the lung of mice. Single-cell RNA-sequencing confirmed the concomitant activation of T and B cell responses in a germinal center-like manner within the nasal-associated lymphoid tissues (NALT), confirming its role as an inductive site that can lead to long-lasting immunity. The ability to elicit immunity in the respiratory tract has can prevent the initial establishment of infection in individuals and prevent disease transmission across humans.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xingyue An","author_inst":"University of Houston"},{"author_name":"Melisa Paniagua Martinez","author_inst":"University of Houston"},{"author_name":"Ali Rezvan","author_inst":"University of Houston"},{"author_name":"Mohsen Fathi","author_inst":"University of Houston"},{"author_name":"Shailbala Singh","author_inst":"University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Sujit Biswas","author_inst":"University of Houston"},{"author_name":"Melissa Pourpak","author_inst":"BD Biosciences"},{"author_name":"Cassian Yee","author_inst":"University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Xinli Liu","author_inst":"University of Houston"},{"author_name":"Navin Varadarajan","author_inst":"University of Houston"},{"author_name":"Chantal Mathieu","author_inst":"Clinical and Experimental Endocrinology (CEE), Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (KULEUVEN), Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Decio Laks Eizirik","author_inst":"ULB Center for Diabetes Research, Medical Faculty, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Guido Sebastiani","author_inst":"Diabetes Unit, Department of Medicine, Surgery and Neurosciences, University of Siena, Siena, Italy;

The virus genome analysis during disease spread reveals about its evolution and transmission. We did whole genome sequencing of 225 clinical strains from the state of Odisha in eastern India using ARTIC protocol-based amplicon sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis identified the presence of all five reported clades 19A, 19B, 20A, 20B and 20C in the population. The analyses revealed two major routes for the introduction of the disease in India i.e. Europe and South-east Asia followed by local transmission. Interestingly, 19B clade was found to be much more prevalent in our sequenced genomes (17%) as compared to other genomes reported so far from India. The haplogroup analysis for clades showed evolution of 19A and 19B in parallel whereas the 20B and 20C appeared to evolve from 20A. Majority of the 19A and 19B clades were present in cases that migrated from Gujarat state in India suggesting it to be one of the major initial points of disease transmission in India during month of March and April. We found that with the time 20A and 20B clades evolved drastically that originated from central Europe. At the same time, it has been observed that 20A and 20B clades depicted selection of four common mutations i.e. 241 C>T (5UTR), P323L in RdRP, F942F in NSP3 and D614G in the spike protein. We found an increase in the concordance of G614 mutation evolution with the viral load in clinical samples as evident from decreased Ct value of spike and Orf1ab gene in qPCR. Molecular modelling and docking analysis identified that D614G mutation enhanced interaction of spike with TMPRSS2 protease, which could impact the shedding of S1 domain and infectivity of the virus in host cells.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sunil Raghav","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Arup Ghosh","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Jyotirmayee Turuk","author_inst":"Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Sugandh Kumar","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Atimukta Jha","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Swati Madhulika","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Manasi Priyadarshini","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Viplov K Biswas","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"P.
