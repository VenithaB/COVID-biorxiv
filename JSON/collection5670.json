A systematic benefit-risk assessment was designed and conducted to strengthen the ongoing monitoring of the benefit-risk balance for chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in COVID-19 treatment. Methods: The overall benefit-risk of the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19 compared to standard of care, placebo or other treatments was assessed using the Benefit-Risk Action Team (BRAT) framework. We searched PubMed and Google Scholar to identify literature reporting clinical outcomes in patients taking chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19. A value tree was constructed and key benefits and risks were ranked by two clinicians in order of considered importance. Results: Several potential key benefits and risks were identified for use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in COVID-19 treatment. Currently available results did not show an improvement in mortality risk; Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR) for death between patients who received HCQ alone vs. neither hydroxychloroquine or azithromycin was 1.08 (95% CI 0.63-1.85). A further study compared the incidence of intubation or death (composite outcome) in a time to event analysis between patients who received HCQ vs. those patients who did not (adjusted Cox proportional HR 1.00 (95% CI 0.76-1.32)). Risk of cardiac arrest, abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) and QT prolongation was greater among patients taking HCQ (with or without azithromycin) compared to standard of care in the same study. Conclusions: Overall, based on the available data there does not appear to be a favourable benefit-risk profile for chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine compared to standard of care in treatment of severe COVID-19. As further data from clinical trials and real world use on these benefits and risks becomes available, this can be incorporated into the framework for an ongoing benefit-risk assessment.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vicki Osborne","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Miranda Davies","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Sandeep Dhanda","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Debabrata Roy","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Samantha Lane","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Alison Evans","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Saad AW Shakir","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit, Southampton, UK"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20094797","rel_title":"Outcomes among HIV-positive patients hospitalized with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20094797","rel_abs":"Background: SARS-CoV-2 infection continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Preliminary data on SARS-CoV-2 infection suggests that some immunocompromised hosts experience worse outcomes. We performed a retrospective matched cohort study to characterize outcomes in HIV-positive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: Leveraging data collected from electronic medical records for all patients hospitalized at NYU Langone Health with COVID-19 between March 2, 2020 and April 23, 2020, we matched 21 HIV-positive patients to 42 non-HIV patients using a greedy nearest neighbor algorithm. Admission characteristics, laboratory results, and hospital outcomes were recorded and compared between the two groups. Results: While there was a trend toward increased rates of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and mortality in HIV-positive patients, these differences were not statistically significant. Rates for these outcomes in our cohort are similar to those previously published for all patients hospitalized with COVID-19. HIV-positive patients had significantly higher admission and peak CRP values. Other inflammatory markers did not differ significantly between groups, though HIV-positive patients tended to have higher peak values during their clinical course. Three HIV-positive patients had superimposed bacterial pneumonia with positive sputum cultures, and all three patients expired during hospitalization. There was no difference in frequency of thrombotic events or myocardial infarction between these groups. Conclusion: This study provides evidence that HIV coinfection does not significantly impact presentation, hospital course, or outcomes of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, when compared to matched non-HIV patients. A larger study is required to determine if the trends we observed apply to all HIV-positive patients.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Savannah Karmen-Tuohy","author_inst":"New York University Grossman School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Philip M.

Consequently, allelic variants of the MHC-I protein have been found to be associated with patient outcome to various viral infections, including SARS-CoV. In the present study, we assess the relationship between observed SARS-CoV-2 population mortality and the predicted viral binding capacities of 52 common MHC-I alleles. Potential SARS-CoV-2 MHC-I peptides were identified using a consensus MHC-I binding and presentation prediction algorithm, called EnsembleMHC. Starting with nearly 3.5 million candidates, we resolved a few hundred high-confidence MHC-I peptides. By weighing individual MHC allele SARS-CoV-2 binding capacity by population frequency in 23 countries, we discover a strong inverse correlation between the predicted population SARS-CoV-2 peptide binding capacity and observed mortality rate. Our computations reveal that peptides derived from the structural proteins of the virus produces a stronger association with observed mortality rate, highlighting the importance of S, N, M, E proteins in driving productive immune responses. These results bring to light how molecular changes in the MHC-I proteins may affect population-level outcomes of viral infection.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eric Wilson","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Gabrielle Hirneise","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Abhishek Singharoy","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Karen S Anderson","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Sizun Jiang","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Phillip A Gall","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Chun-Kang Liao","author_inst":"National Taiwan University"},{"author_name":"Liang-Chun Shih","author_inst":"China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Christian M Schurch","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"David R McIlwain","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Pauline Chu","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Nicole A Borchard","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"David Zarabanda","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Sachi S Dholakia","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Angela Yang","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Dayoung Kim","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Tomoharu Kanie","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Chia-Der Lin","author_inst":"China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ming-Hsui Tsai","author_inst":"China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Katie M Phillips","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Raymond Kim","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jonathan B Overdevest","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Matthew A Tyler","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Carol H Yan","author_inst":"University of California San Diego School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chih-Feng Lin","author_inst":"National Taiwan University"},{"author_name":"Yi-Tsen Lin","author_inst":"National Taiwan University"},{"author_name":"Da-Tian Bau","author_inst":"China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Gregory J Tsay","author_inst":"China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zara M Patel","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Yung-An Tsou","author_inst":"China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chih-Jaan Tai","author_inst":"China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Te-Huei Yeh","author_inst":"National Taiwan University"},{"author_name":"Peter H Hwang","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Garry P Nolan","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jayakar V Nayak","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Peter K Jackson","author_inst":"Stanford University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"allergy and immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.08.20095463","rel_title":"Using epidemic simulators for monitoring an ongoing epidemic","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.08.20095463","rel_abs":"Prediction of infection trends, estimating the efficacy of contact tracing, testing or impact of influx of infected are of vital importance for administration during an ongoing epidemic. Most effective methods currently are empirical in nature and their relation to parameters of interest to administrators are not evident. We thus propose a modified SEIRD model that is capable of modeling effect of interventions and in migrations on the progress of an epidemic. The tunable parameters of this model bear relevance to monitoring of an epidemic. This model was used to show that some of the commonly seen features of cumulative infections in real data can be explained by piece wise constant changes in interventions and population influx. We also show that the data of cumulative infections from twelve Indian states between mid March and mid April 2020 can be generated from the model by applying interventions according to a set of heuristic rules. Prediction for the next ten days based on this model, reproduced real data very well. In addition, our model also reproduced the time series of recoveries and deaths. Our work constitutes an important first step towards an effective dashboard for the monitoring of epidemic by the administration, especially in an Indian context.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohan Raghavan","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad"},{"author_name":"Kousik Sarathy Sridharan","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad"},{"author_name":"Yashaswini M R","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad"},{"author_name":"Karen S Anderson","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Sizun Jiang","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Phillip A Gall","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Chun-Kang Liao","author_inst":"National Taiwan University"},{"author_name":"Liang-Chun Shih","author_inst":"China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Christian M Schurch","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"David R McIlwain","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Pauline Chu","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Nicole A Borchard","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"David Zarabanda","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Sachi S Dholakia","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Angela Yang","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Dayoung Kim","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Tomoharu Kanie","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Chia-Der Lin","author_inst":"China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ming-Hsui Tsai","author_inst":"China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Katie M Phillips","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Raymond Kim","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jonathan B Overdevest","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Matthew A Tyler","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Carol H Yan","author_inst":"University of California San Diego School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chih-Feng Lin","author_inst":"National Taiwan University"},{"author_name":"Yi-Tsen Lin","author_inst":"National Taiwan University"},{"author_name":"Da-Tian Bau","author_inst":"China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Gregory J Tsay","author_inst":"China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zara M Patel","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Yung-An Tsou","author_inst":"China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chih-Jaan Tai","author_inst":"China Medical University"},{"author_name":"Te-Huei Yeh","author_inst":"National Taiwan University"},{"author_name":"Peter H Hwang","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Garry P Nolan","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jayakar V Nayak","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Peter K Jackson","author_inst":"Stanford University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.08.20093229","rel_title":"Placental pathology in COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.08.20093229","rel_abs":"Objectives: To describe histopathologic findings in the placentas of women with COVID-19 during pregnancy. Methods: Pregnant women with COVID-19 delivering between March 18, 2020 and May 5, 2020 were identified. Placentas were examined and compared to historical controls and women with placental evaluation for a history of melanoma. Results: 16 placentas from patients with SARS-CoV-2 were examined (15 with live birth in the 3rd trimester 1 delivered in the 2nd trimester after intrauterine fetal demise). Compared to controls, third trimester placentas were significantly more likely to show at least one feature of maternal vascular malperfusion (MVM), including abnormal or injured maternal vessels, as well as delayed villous maturation, chorangiosis, and intervillous thrombi. Rates of acute and chronic inflammation were not increased. The placenta from the patient with intrauterine fetal demise showed villous edema and a retroplacental hematoma. Conclusions: Relative to controls, COVID-19 placentas show increased prevalence of features of maternal vascular malperfusion (MVM), a pattern of placental injury reflecting abnormalities in oxygenation within the intervillous space associated with adverse perinatal outcomes. Only 1 COVID-19 patient was hypertensive despite the association of MVM with hypertensive disorders and preeclampsia. These changes may reflect a systemic inflammatory or hypercoagulable state influencing placental physiology.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elisheva D Shanes","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Leena B Mithal","author_inst":"Ann and Robert H.

Here, we show that endothelial cells do not express angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. Instead, pericytes and microvascular smooth muscle cells express ACE2 in an organotypic manner. Pericyte deficiency leads to increased endothelial expression and release of Von Willebrand factor and intravascular platelet and fibrin aggregation, suggesting that pericytes limit endothelial pro-thrombotic responses. That pericytes and not endothelial cells express ACE2 may provide important clues to the pathology of COVID-19, as pericytes are normally shielded behind an endothelial barrier and may get infected only when this barrier is compromised by COVID-19 risk factors.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Liqun He","author_inst":"Uppsala University"},{"author_name":"Maarja Andaloussi Mae","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Lars Muhl","author_inst":"Integrated Cardio Metabolic Center (ICMC), Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Ying Sun","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Riikka Pietila","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Khayrun Nahar","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Elisa Vazquez Liebanas","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Malin Jonsson Fagerlund","author_inst":"Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Karolinska Institutet, Solna, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Anders Oldner","author_inst":"Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Karolinska Institutet, Solna, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Jianping Liu","author_inst":"Integrated Cardio Metabolic Center (ICMC), Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Guillem Genove","author_inst":"Integrated Cardio Metabolic Center (ICMC), Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Stefanos Liptidis","author_inst":"Integrated Cardio Metabolic Center (ICMC), Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Mocci","author_inst":"Integrated Cardio Metabolic Center (ICMC), Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Simon Stritt","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Andrey Anisimov","author_inst":"Wihuri Research Institute and Translational Cancer Medicine Program, Biomedicum Helsinki, University of Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Karthik Amudhala Hemanthakumar","author_inst":"Wihuri Research Institute and Translational Cancer Medicine Program, Biomedicum Helsinki, University of Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Markus Rasenen","author_inst":"Wihuri Research Institute and Translational Cancer Medicine Program, Biomedicum Helsinki, University of Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Olivier Mirabeau","author_inst":"Chemin des demoiselles Melson 2, 92160 Antony, France"},{"author_name":"Emil Hansson","author_inst":"Integrated Cardio Metabolic Center (ICMC), Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Johan Bjorkegren","author_inst":"Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, The Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, One Gustave L.

This issue limits the interpretability of cryo-EM maps, i.e. ab initio modelling. In this work, we propose 1) approaches to enhance high-resolution features of cryo-EM maps, while preventing map distortions and 2) methods to obtain local B-factors and electron density occupancy maps.

The first macrodomain, Mac1, is conserved throughout CoVs, binds to and hydrolyzes mono-ADP-ribose (MAR) from target proteins. Mac1 likely counters host-mediated anti-viral ADP-ribosylation, a posttranslational modification that is part of the host response to viral infections. Mac1 is essential for pathogenesis in multiple animal models of CoV infection, implicating it as a virulence factor and potential therapeutic target. Here we report the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 in complex with ADP-ribose. SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV Mac1 exhibit similar structural folds and all 3 proteins bound to ADP-ribose with low M affinities. In contrast, we found that only the MERS-CoV Mac1 protein bound to poly-ADP-ribose (PAR), and none of these enzymes could hydrolyze PAR. Importantly, using ADP-ribose detecting antibodies and both gel-based assay and novel ELISA assays, we demonstrated highly efficient de-MARylating activity for all 3 CoV Mac1 proteins. We conclude that the SARS-CoV-2 and other CoV Mac1 proteins are highly efficient MAR-hydrolases with strikingly similar activity, indicating that compounds targeting CoV Mac1 proteins may have broad anti-CoV activity.\n\nIMPORTANCESARS-CoV-2 has recently emerged into the human population and has led to a worldwide pandemic of COVID-19 that has caused nearly 350 thousand deaths worldwide. With, no currently approved treatments, novel therapeutic strategies are desperately needed. All coronaviruses encode for a highly conserved macrodomain (Mac1) that binds to and removes ADP-ribose adducts from proteins in a dynamic post-translational process increasingly recognized as an important factor that regulates viral infection. The macrodomain is essential for CoV pathogenesis and may be a novel therapeutic target. Thus, understanding its biochemistry and enzyme activity are critical first steps for these efforts. Here we report the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 in complex with ADP-ribose, and describe its ADP-ribose binding and hydrolysis activities in direct comparison to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV Mac1 proteins. These results are an important first step for the design and testing of potential therapies targeting this unique protein domain.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yousef M.O.

However, short and\/or overlapping genes can be difficult to detect using conventional computational approaches, whereas high throughput experimental approaches - such as ribosome profiling - cannot distinguish translation of functional peptides from regulatory translation or translational noise. By studying regions showing enhanced conservation at synonymous sites in alignments of SARS-CoV and related viruses (subgenus Sarbecovirus), and correlating with the conserved presence of an open reading frame and plausible translation mechanism, we identified a putative new gene, ORF3a*, overlapping ORF3a in an alternative reading frame. A recently published ribosome profiling study confirmed that ORF3a* is indeed translated during infection. ORF3a* is conserved across the subgenus Sarbecovirus, and encodes a 40-41 amino acid predicted transmembrane protein.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew E Firth","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Maithri M.

Forty-four S2P-specific monoclonal antibodies were generated, three of which bound to the receptor binding domain (RBD). The antibodies were minimally mutated from germline and were derived from different B cell lineages. Only two antibodies displayed neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-virus. The most potent antibody bound the RBD in a manner that prevented binding to the ACE2 receptor, while the other bound outside the RBD. Our study indicates that the majority of antibodies against the viral envelope spike that were generated during the first weeks of COVID-19 infection are non-neutralizing and target epitopes outside the RBD. Antibodies that disrupt the SARS-CoV-2 spike-ACE2 interaction can potently neutralize the virus without undergoing extensive maturation. Such antibodies have potential preventive\/therapeutic potential and can serve as templates for vaccine-design.\n\nIN BRIEFSARS-CoV-2 infection leads to expansion of diverse B cells clones against the viral spike glycoprotein (S).

Our laboratory currently uses two real time RT-PCR platforms, the Roche Cobas SARS-CoV2 and the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2. Both platforms demonstrate comparable performance; however, the run times for each assay are 3.5 hours and 45 minutes, respectively.

In addition to providing guidance for vaccine design, these mAbs are promising candidates for treatment and prevention of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":33,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Philip Brouwer","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Tom Caniels","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Karlijn van Straten","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Jonne Snitselaar","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Yoann Aldon","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Sandhya Bangaru","author_inst":"Scripps Research"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Torres","author_inst":"Scripps Research"},{"author_name":"Nisreen Okba","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Mathieu Claireaux","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Gius Kerster","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Arthur Bentlage","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Marlies van Haaren","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Denise Guerra","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Judith Burger","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Edith Schermer","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Verheul","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Niels van der Velde","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Alex van der Kooi","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Jelle van Schooten","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Marielle van Breemen","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Tom Bijl","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Kwinten Sliepen","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Aafke Aartse","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Ronald Derking","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Ilja Bontjer","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Neeltje Kootstra","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Joost Wiersinga","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Gestur Vidarsson","author_inst":"Sanquin Research"},{"author_name":"Bart Haagmans","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Andrew Ward","author_inst":"Scripps Research"},{"author_name":"Godelieve de Bree","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Rogier Sanders","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Marit van Gils","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Garry P Nolan","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jayakar V Nayak","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Peter K Jackson","author_inst":"Stanford University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.12.091090","rel_title":"Static All-Atom Energetic Mappings of the SARS-Cov-2 Spike Protein with Potential Latch Identification of the Down State Protomer","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.12.091090","rel_abs":"The SARS-Cov-2 virion responsible for the current world-wide pandemic Covid-19 has a characteristic Spike protein (S) on its surface that embellishes both a prefusion state and fusion state. The prefusion Spike protein (S) is a large trimeric protein where each protomer may be in a so-called Up state or Down state, depending on the configuration of its receptor binding domain (RBD). The Up state is believed to allow binding of the virion to ACE-2 receptors on human epithelial cells, whereas the Down state is believed to be relatively inactive or reduced in its binding behavior. We have performed detailed all-atom, dominant energy landscape mappings for noncovalent interactions (charge, partial charge, and van der Waals) of the SARS-Cov-2 Spike protein in its static prefusion state based on recent structural information. We included both interchain interactions and intrachain (domain) interactions in our mappings in order to determine any telling differences (different so-called \"glue\" points) between residues in the Up and Down state protomers. In general, the S2 or fusion machinery domain of S is relatively rigid with strong noncovalent interactions facilitated by helical secondary structures, whereas the S1 domain, which contains the RBD and N-terminal domain (NTD), is relatively more flexible and characterized by beta strand structural motifs. The S2 domain demonstrated no appreciable energetic differences between Up and Down protomers, including interchain as well as each protomers intrachain, S1-S2 interactions. However, the S1 domain interactions across neighboring protomers, which include the RBD-NTD cross chain interactions, showed significant energetic differences between Up-Down and Down-Down neighboring protomers. Surprisingly, the Up-Down, RBD-NTD interactions were overall stronger and more numerous than the Down-Down cross chain interactions, including the appearance of the three residue sequence ALA520-PRO521-ALA522 associated with a turn structure in the RBD of the Up state protomer. Additionally, our intrachain dominant energy mappings within each protomer, identified a significant \"glue\" point or possible \"latch\" for the Down state protomer between the S1 subdomain, SD1, and the RBD domain of the same protomer that was completely missing in the Up state protomer analysis. Ironically, this dominant energetic interaction in the Down state protomer involved the backbone atoms of the same three residue sequence ALA520-PRO521-ALA522 of the RBD with the R-group of GLN564 in the SD1 domain. Thus, this same three residue sequence acts as a stabilizer of the RBD in the Up conformation through its interactions with its neighboring NTD chain and a kind of latch in the Down state conformation through its interactions with its own SD1 domain. The dominant interaction energy residues identified here are also conserved across reported variations of SARS-Cov-2, as well as the closely related virions SARS-Cov and the bat corona virus RatG13. To help verify the potential latch for the Down state protomer, we conducted some preliminary molecular dynamic simulations that effectively turn off this specific latch glue point via a single point mutation of GLN564. Interestingly, the single point mutation lead to the latch releasing in less than a few nanoseconds, but the latch remained fixed in the wild state protomer for up to 0.1 microseconds that were simulated. Many more detailed studies are needed to understand the dynamics of the Up and Down states of the Spike protein, including the stabilizing chain-chain interactions and the mechanisms of transition from Down to Up state protomers. Nonetheless, static dominant energy landscape mappings and preliminary molecular dynamic studies given here may represent a useful starting point for more detailed dynamic analyses and hopefully an improved understanding of the structure-function relationship of this highly complex protein associated with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael H Peters","author_inst":"Virginia Commonwealth University"},{"author_name":"Oscar Bastidas","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Daniel S.

The Childrens Hospital, Los Angeles (CHLA) COVID-19 Analysis Research Database (CARD) (https:\/\/covid19.cpmbiodev.net\/) is a comprehensive genomic resource that provides access to full-length SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes and associated meta-data for over 30,000 (as of May 20, 2020) isolates collected from global sequencing repositories and the sequencing performed at the Center for Personalized Medicine (CPM) at CHLA. Reference phylogenetic trees of global and USA viral isolates were constructed and are periodically updated using selected high quality SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. These provide the baseline and analytical context for identifying the origin of a viral infection, as well as the relatedness of SARS-CoV-2 genomes of interest. A web-based and interactive Phylogenetic Tree Browser supports flexible tree manipulation and advanced analysis based on keyword search while highlighting time series animation, as well as subtree export for graphical representation or offline exploration. A Virus Genome Tracker accepts complete or partial SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence, compares it against all available sequences in the database (>30,000 at time of writing), detects and annotates the variants, and places the new viral isolate within the global or USA phylogenetic contexts based upon variant profiles and haplotype comparisons, in a few seconds. The generated analysis can potentially aid in genomic surveillance to trace the transmission of any new infection. Using CHLA CARD, we demonstrate the identification of a candidate outbreak point where 13 of 31 CHLA internal isolates may have originated. We also discovered multiple indels of unknown clinical significance in the orf3a gene, and revealed a number of USA-specific variants and haplotypes.","rel_num_authors":0,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael H Peters","author_inst":"Virginia Commonwealth University"},{"author_name":"Oscar Bastidas","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Daniel S.

SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs through binding and internalization of the viral spike protein to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the host cell membrane. Lethal complications are caused by damage and failure of vital organs that express high levels of ACE2, including the lungs, the heart and the kidneys. Here, we established a high-throughput drug screening strategy to identify therapeutic candidates that reduce ACE2 levels in human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived cardiac cells. Drug target analysis of validated hit compounds, including 5 alpha reductase inhibitors, revealed androgen signaling as a key modulator of ACE2 levels. Treatment with the 5 alpha reductase inhibitor dutasteride reduced ACE2 levels and internalization of recombinant spike receptor binding domain (Spike-RBD) in hESC-derived cardiac cells and human alveolar epithelial cells. Finally, clinical data on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients demonstrated that abnormal androgen states are significantly associated with severe disease complications and cardiac injury as measured by blood troponin T levels. These findings provide important insights on the mechanism of increased disease susceptibility in male COVID-19 patients and identify androgen receptor inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zaniar Ghazizadeh","author_inst":"Yale"},{"author_name":"Homa Majd","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Mikayla Richter","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Ryan Samuel","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Seyedeh Maryam Zekavat","author_inst":"Yale"},{"author_name":"Hosseinali Asgharian","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Sina Farahvashi","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Ali Kalantari","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Ramirez","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Hongyu Zhao","author_inst":"Yale"},{"author_name":"Pradeep Natarajan","author_inst":"Broad institute"},{"author_name":"Hani Goodarzi","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Faranak Fattahi","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Judith Burger","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Edith Schermer","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Verheul","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Niels van der Velde","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Alex van der Kooi","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Jelle van Schooten","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Marielle van Breemen","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Tom Bijl","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Kwinten Sliepen","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Aafke Aartse","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Ronald Derking","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Ilja Bontjer","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Neeltje Kootstra","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Joost Wiersinga","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Gestur Vidarsson","author_inst":"Sanquin Research"},{"author_name":"Bart Haagmans","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Andrew Ward","author_inst":"Scripps Research"},{"author_name":"Godelieve de Bree","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Rogier Sanders","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Marit van Gils","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Garry P Nolan","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jayakar V Nayak","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Peter K Jackson","author_inst":"Stanford University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"cell biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.082768","rel_title":"Mutation landscape of SARS-CoV-2 reveals three mutually exclusive clusters of leading and trailing single nucleotide substitutions","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.082768","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic has spread across the globe at an alarming rate. However, unlike any of the previous global outbreaks the availability of a large number of SARS-CoV-2 sequences provides us with a unique opportunity to understand viral evolution in real time. We analysed 1448 full-length (>29000 nt) sequences available and identified 40 single-nucleotide substitutions occurring in >1% of the genomes. Majority of the substitutions were C to T or G to A. We identify C\/Gs with an upstream TTT trinucleotide motif as hotspots for mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Interestingly, three of the 40 substitutions occur within highly conserved secondary structures in the 5 and 3 regions of the genomic RNA that are critical for the virus life cycle. Furthermore, clustering analysis revealed unique geographical distribution of SARS-CoV-2 variants defined by their mutation profile. Of note, we observed several co-occurring mutations that almost never occur individually. We define five mutually exclusive lineages (A1, B1, C1, D1 and E1) of SARS-CoV-2 which account for about three quarters of the genomes analysed. We identify lineage-defining leading mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome which precede the occurrence of sub-lineage defining trailing mutations. The identification of mutually exclusive lineage-defining mutations with geographically restricted patterns of distribution has potential implications for diagnosis, pathogenesis and vaccine design.

Extensive contact tracing and testing in South Korea allows us to investigate the transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 into diverse local communities. Objective. Understand the critical aspects of transmission dynamics in a different age, sex, and clusters with various activities. Methods. We conducted a retrospective observational study with 3,127 confirmed cases' contact tracing data from the Center for Disease and Prevention (CDC) of South Korea. We investigated network property concerning infected persons' demographics and different infection clusters. Findings. Overall, women had higher centrality scores than men after week four, when the confirmed cases rapidly increased. Older adults have higher centrality than young\/middle-aged adults after week 9. In the infection clusters, young\/middle-aged adults' infection clusters (such as religious gatherings and gym facilities) have higher average path lengths and diameter than older adults' nursing home infection clusters. Interpretation. Some women had higher reproduction numbers and bridged successive transmission than men when the confirmed cases rapidly increased. Similarly, some older adults (who were not residents of nursing homes) had higher reproduction numbers and bridged successive transmission than young\/middle-aged adults after the peak has passed. The young\/middle-aged adults' religious gatherings and group workout have caused long successive transmissions. In contrast, the older adults' nursing homes were a small world where the transmissions within a few steps can reach out to many persons.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yejin Kim","author_inst":"The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqian Jiang","author_inst":"University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Keiya Uriu","author_inst":"Division of Systems Virology, Department of Infectious Disease Control, International Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Institute of Medical Science, the"},{"author_name":"Masaya Fukushi","author_inst":"Institute of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University"},{"author_name":"Takashi Irie","author_inst":"Institute of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University"},{"author_name":"Yoshio Koyanagi","author_inst":"Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University"},{"author_name":"So Nakagawa","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Life Science, Tokai University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kei Sato","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Manoj B.

(1,2) Although testing was initially focused on the diagnosis and treatment of symptomatic patients, this effort has now expanded to include surveillance of asymptomatic patients in order to protect health care workers and prevent nosocomial infections. There is an urgent need to understand best practices for the delivery of routine medical care during an ongoing outbreak. (3) Here we report the rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in asymptomatic patients screened prior to admission or a surgical or aerosolizing procedure. Methods Beginning March 30, 2020, our hospital began screening all asymptomatic patients prior to needed surgeries and aerosolizing procedures (n=350). On April 13, 2020, we expanded this practice to universal surveillance screening of all patients prior to admission (n=349). Testing was performed on nasopharyngeal swabs using the Washington state emergency use authorized University of Washington CDC-based laboratory-developed test or FDA authorized DiaSorin Simplexa SARS-CoV-2, Hologic Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2, or Roche cobas SARS-CoV-2 tests. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of University of Washington Medical Center (STUDY00009734). Informed consent was not required. Results For patients undergoing surgical or aerosolizing procedures, 3 of 350 patients (0.9%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. For patients who were asymptomatic and tested at the time of admission, 3 of 349 patients (0.9%) were positive and 2 of 349 (0.6%) were inconclusive; inconclusive results were treated as low-level positives. For asymptomatic patients tested for any other reason (e.g. exposure risk), 12 of 157 patients (7.6%) were positive and 1 of 157 (0.6%) were inconclusive. Meanwhile, of the 473 inpatients in this period who had any symptom concerning for COVID-19, 68 of 473 patients (14.3%) were positive. There was a variety of ordering services and locations in all indication categories, with no particular predominating medical service or location. During this time period the outpatient prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 active infection in our region was 3-5% (manuscript in review). Discussion The application of universal surveillance testing for SARS-CoV-2 in patients prior to surgery or aerosolizing procedure shows that the positivity rate for SARS-CoV-2 is low (<1%) in asymptomatic patients without known exposure risk factors. The positivity rate for asymptomatic patients on admission screen was similar; both measures were notably lower than recently reported measurements during an outbreak in New York City that found a positivity rate of 13.7% in asymptomatic pregnant women. (4) The rate of sub-clinical infection likely varies with the scale of the community outbreak. Even in the context of a community-wide outbreak, our data show a low prevalence of COVID-19 infection in the urgent pre-procedural setting. These data reflect the prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in a population of individuals who use medical services and provide an assessment of exposure risk to other patients and healthcare workers around the time of admission. The Greater Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network (SCAN) also recently published results from the first 18 days of home-based testing and reported no positive tests in 1392 patients reporting no COVID-19-like illness. (5) Although other studies support a large proportion of asymptomatic infections, the data from this metropolitan outbreak do not support a similar pattern. Clinical providers, especially those involved in performing procedures that have a risk of aerosolization, are asking for methods to risk-assess patients prior to the procedure. Pre-procedure testing is one option to accomplish this goal. Importantly, in the midst of an outbreak, testing prior to procedures can decrease the use of PPE, identify appropriate precautions for patients, and reduce the risk of nosocomial infection.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"James A Mays","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Alexander L Greninger","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Keith R Jerome","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"John B Lynch","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Patrick C Mathias","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Yoshio Koyanagi","author_inst":"Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University"},{"author_name":"So Nakagawa","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Life Science, Tokai University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kei Sato","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Manoj B.

The objective of this manuscript is to study the relation of population demographics, social characteristics, and social distancing on the number of infections and deaths in the US. Methods Data came from publicly available sources. Social distancing was measured by the change in the rate of human encounters per km2 relative to the pre-COVID-19 national average. A smooth generalized additive model for counts of total infections and deaths at US county-level included population demographics, social characteristics, and social distancing. Results The model strongly predicted the geo-spatial variations in COVID-19 infections and deaths, 97.2% of variation in infections and 99.3% of variation in deaths from March 15, 2020. US counties with higher population density, poverty index, civilian population, and minorities, especially African Americans, had a higher rate of infections and deaths, and social distancing was associated with a slower rate of infections and deaths. The number of people infected was increasing; however, the rate of increase of new infections was showing signs of plateauing from the second week of April. Our model estimates that 1,865,580 US residents will test positive for infections and 117,246 fatalities by June 1, 2020. Importantly, our model suggests significant social differences in the infections and deaths across US communities. Areas with a larger African American population and a higher poverty index are expected to show higher rates of infections and deaths. Conclusion Preventive steps, including social distancing and community closures, have been a cornerstone in slowing the transmission and potentially reducing the spread of the disease. Crucial knowledge of the role of social characteristics in disease transmission is essential to understand and predict current and future disease distribution and plan additional preventive steps.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kumar Rajan","author_inst":"University of California at Davis"},{"author_name":"Klodian Dhana","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Lisa L Barnes","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Neelum T Aggarwal","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Laura Evans","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Robert S Wilson","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Weuve","author_inst":"Boston University"},{"author_name":"Charles DeCarli","author_inst":"University of California Davis"},{"author_name":"Denis A Evans","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Hongyu Zhao","author_inst":"Yale"},{"author_name":"Pradeep Natarajan","author_inst":"Broad institute"},{"author_name":"Hani Goodarzi","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Faranak Fattahi","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Judith Burger","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Edith Schermer","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Verheul","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Niels van der Velde","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Alex van der Kooi","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Jelle van Schooten","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Marielle van Breemen","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Tom Bijl","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Kwinten Sliepen","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Aafke Aartse","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Ronald Derking","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Ilja Bontjer","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Neeltje Kootstra","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Joost Wiersinga","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Gestur Vidarsson","author_inst":"Sanquin Research"},{"author_name":"Bart Haagmans","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Andrew Ward","author_inst":"Scripps Research"},{"author_name":"Godelieve de Bree","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Rogier Sanders","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Marit van Gils","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Garry P Nolan","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jayakar V Nayak","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Peter K Jackson","author_inst":"Stanford University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20092882","rel_title":"The characteristics and death risk factors of 132 COVID-19 pneumonia patients with comorbidities: a retrospective single center analysis in Wuhan, China","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20092882","rel_abs":"Background: The new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) has evolved into a global pandemic disease, and the epidemiological characteristics of the disease have been reported in detail. However, many patients with new coronary pneumonia have comorbidities, and there are few researches reported in this special population. Methods: a retrospective analysis was performed on 132 consecutive COVID-19 patients with comorbidities from January 19, 2020 to March 7, 2020 in Hubei NO.3 People Hospital. Patients were divided into mild group and critical group and were followed up to the clinical endpoint. The observation biomarkers include the clinical feature, blood routine, blood biochemistry, inflammation biomarkers, and coagulation function. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the risk factors associated with death. Results: 132 patients were enrolled in this study and divided into the mild group (n=109, 82.6%) and critical group (n=23, 17.4%), of whom 119 were discharged and 13 were died in hospital. The all-cause mortality rate was 9.8%, of which 7 patients died of respiratory failure, 5 patients died of heart failure, and 1 patient died of chronic renal failure. There was significant statistical difference of mortality rates between the mild group (5.5%) and the critical group (30.4%).The average time of hospitalization was 16.9 (9, 22) days. Hypertension was the most common comorbidity (n=90, 68.2%), followed by diabetes (n=45, 34.1%), coronary heart disease (31, 23.5%). Compared with the mild group, the patients were older in critical group (P <0.05), and neutrophils, neutrophil ratio, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), serum urea nitrogen (BUN), procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein CRP), serum amyloid protein (SSA), N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide precursor (NT-pro BNP) were significantly increased (P <0.05). However, lymphocytes lymphocyte ratio, albumin were lower than those in the critical group (P <0.05). The patients were further divided into the survivor group (n=119, 90.2%) and the non-survivor group (n=13, 9.8%). Compared with the survivor group, the death rate of patients with coronary heart disease was significantly increased (53.8% vs 20.2%), and The neutrophil ratio, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), BUN, PCT, CRP, SAA, interleukin-6(IL-6) and D-dimer were significantly increased (P <0.05), while the lymphocytes and NLR reduced (P <0.05). Multivariate logistic stepwise regression analysis showed that the past medical history of coronary heart disease[OR:2.806 95%CI:0.971~16.795], decreased lymphocytes[OR:0.040, 95%CI:0.001~2.306], increased AST[OR:1.026, 95%CI:1.000~1.052], increased SSA[OR:1.021, 95%CI:1.001~1.025], and increased D-dimer[OR:1.231, 95%CI:1.042~1.456] are risk factors associated with death in COVID-19 patients pneumonia with comorbidities. Conclusion: The mortality rate of COVID-19 patients with coronary heart disease is relatively high. In all patients, the lower lymphocytes, and higher NLR, BUN, PCT, CRP, SSA, D-dimer are significant characteristics. The past medical history of coronary heart disease, decreased lymphocytes, increased AST, SSA and D-dimer are risk factors associated with death in COVID-19 pneumonia patients with comorbidities","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chen Chen","author_inst":"Hubei No.3 People's Hospital of Jianghan University,Wuhan,Hubei,P.R.China"},{"author_name":"Zhang Jing Yi","author_inst":"Hubei NO.3 People's Hospital of Jianghan University"},{"author_name":"Li Chang","author_inst":"Hubei NO.3 People's Hospital of Jianghan University"},{"author_name":"Hu Zhi Shuo","author_inst":"Wuhan NO.1Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhang Ming","author_inst":"Hubei NO.3 People's Hospital of Jianghan University"},{"author_name":"Tu Pei","author_inst":"Hubei NO.3 People's Hospital of Jianghan University"},{"author_name":"Liu Lei","author_inst":"Hubei NO.3 People's Hospital of Jianghan University"},{"author_name":"Zong Wen Xia","author_inst":"Hubei No.3 People's Hospital of Jianghan university"},{"author_name":"Denis A Evans","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Hongyu Zhao","author_inst":"Yale"},{"author_name":"Pradeep Natarajan","author_inst":"Broad institute"},{"author_name":"Hani Goodarzi","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Faranak Fattahi","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Judith Burger","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Edith Schermer","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Verheul","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Niels van der Velde","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Alex van der Kooi","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Jelle van Schooten","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Marielle van Breemen","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Tom Bijl","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Kwinten Sliepen","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Aafke Aartse","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Ronald Derking","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Ilja Bontjer","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Neeltje Kootstra","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Joost Wiersinga","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Gestur Vidarsson","author_inst":"Sanquin Research"},{"author_name":"Bart Haagmans","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Andrew Ward","author_inst":"Scripps Research"},{"author_name":"Godelieve de Bree","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Rogier Sanders","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Marit van Gils","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Garry P Nolan","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jayakar V Nayak","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Peter K Jackson","author_inst":"Stanford University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.08.20089268","rel_title":"Characteristics and outcomes of pregnant women hospitalised with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the UK: a national cohort study using the UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS)","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.08.20089268","rel_abs":"Objective: To describe a national cohort of pregnant women hospitalised with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the UK, identify factors associated with infection and describe outcomes, including transmission of infection, for mother and infant. Design: Prospective national population-based cohort study using the UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS). Setting: All 194 obstetric units in the UK Participants: 427 pregnant women admitted to hospital with confirmed Sars-CoV-2 infection between 01\/03\/2020 and 14\/04\/2020. 694 comparison women who gave birth between 01\/11\/2017 and 31\/10\/2018. Main outcome measures: Incidence of maternal hospitalisation, infant infection. Rates of maternal death, level 3 critical care unit admission, preterm birth, stillbirth, early neonatal death, perinatal death; odds ratios for infected versus comparison women. Results: Estimated incidence of hospitalisation with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy 4.9 per 1000 maternities (95%CI 4.5-5.4). The median gestation at symptom onset was 34 weeks (IQR 29-38). Black or other minority ethnicity (aOR 4.49, 95%CI 3.37-6.00), older maternal age (aOR 1.35, 95%CI 1.01-1.81 comparing women aged 35+ with those aged 30-34), overweight and obesity (aORs 1.91, 95%CI 1.37-2.68 and 2.20, 95%CI 1.56-3.10 respectively compared to women with a BMI<25kg\/m2) and pre-existing comorbidities (aOR 1.52, 95%CI 1.12-2.06) were associated with admission with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy. 247 women (58%) gave birth or had a pregnancy loss; 180 (73%) gave birth at term. 40 (9%) hospitalised women required respiratory support. Twelve infants (5%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, six of these infants within the first 12 hours after birth. Conclusions: The majority of pregnant women hospitalised with SARS-CoV-2 were in the late second or third trimester, supporting guidance for continued social distancing measures in later pregnancy.

Since COVID-19 outbreak, various agents have been tested but no proven effective therapies have been identified. This has led to a lot of controversies among associated researches. Hence, in order to address the issue of using hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in treating COVID-19 patients, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods. A thorough search was carried out to find relevant studies in MEDLINE, medRxiv, PubMed, Cochrane Database, China Academic Journals Full-text Database and Web of Science. Two investigators independently reviewed 274 abstracts and 23 articles. The trials which evaluated HCQ for treatment of COVID-19 were included for this systematic review. Two investigators assessed quality of the studies and data extraction was done by one reviewer and cross checked by the other. Results. Five trials involving 677 patients were included while conducting the meta-analysis. Compared with the control group, HCQ with or without azithromycin (AZI) showed benefits in viral clearance of SARS-CoV-2 (odds ratio (OR) 1.95, 95% CI 0.19-19.73) and a reduction in progression rate (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.58-1.37), but without demonstrating any statistical significance. This systematic review has also suggested a possible synergistic effect of the combination therapy which included HCQ and AZI. However, the use of HCQ was associated with increased mortality in COVID-19 patients. Conclusions. The use of HCQ with or without AZI for treatment of COVID-19 patients, seems to be effective. The combination of HCQ and AZI has shown synergistic effects. However, mortality rate was increased when the treatment was conducted with HCQ.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tzu-Han Yang","author_inst":"Taipei Veterans General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chian-Ying Chou","author_inst":"Taipei Veterans General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yi-Fan Yang","author_inst":"National Taiwan University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yi-Ping Yang","author_inst":"Taipei Veterans General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chian-Shiu Chien","author_inst":"Taipei Veterans General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Aliaksandr A.

While the medical community understands the mode of viral transmission, less is known about how long viral shedding occurs once viral symptoms have resolved. Objective: To determine how long the SARS-CoV-2 remains detectable following self-reporting of viral symptom resolution. Design: A cohort of 86 previously SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were re-tested for proof of viral recovery by nasal swab and nucleic acid amplification less than 28 days after self-reported symptom resolution. Setting: A tertiary care center in a mid-size city utilizing a drive-through SAR-CoV-2 testing center. Participants: 86 previously confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals less than 28 days after self-reported resolution of symptoms evaluated as potential donors for COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Intervention: Participants underwent nasopharyngeal sampling and subsequent nucleic acid amplification for SARS-CoV-2 genes. Main Outcome: SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal secretions detected by rtPCR. Results: 11\/86 (13%) previously confirmed SARS-CoV-2 subjects were still positive at a median of 19 days (range 12-24 days) after symptom resolution. Older patients were more likely to be test-positive, and older positive patients had lower rtPCR CT values. Test-positive patients were not significantly different from test-negative patients with respect to days since symptom recovery. Conclusions and Resolution: These results underscore the necessity of testing COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors less than 28 days after symptom resolution and suggests that COVID-19 positive patients may need to remain in quarantine beyond the recommended two weeks following \"recovery.\"","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"William R Hartman","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Aaron S Hess","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Joseph Connor","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Yi-Ping Yang","author_inst":"Taipei Veterans General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chian-Shiu Chien","author_inst":"Taipei Veterans General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Aliaksandr A.

We aim to investigate the changes in the results of viral nucleic acid tests on pharyngeal swabs and feces of patients with COVID-19 and CT imaging of lungs as the disease progresses. Methods: Seven patients with COVID-19 in the third affiliated hospital of Sun Yat-sen University Yuedong Hospital were retrospectively enrolled with clinical features, including imaging staging, and performance characteristics of viral nucleic acid test results of pharyngeal swabs and feces. The dynamic changes of these features were observed during hospitalization, and therapeutic effect and prognosis of patients were evaluated. Results: The results of seven confirmed cases were positive for viral nucleic acid tests on pharyngeal swabs early after the onset of symptoms, and then turned negative; while the results of viral nucleic acid tests on feces were persistently positive in the mid-term clinical treatment and recovery period. And the viral nucleic acid test results were capricious in three cases. Pulmonary CT imaging showed characteristic changes in early, advanced and recovery phases. Conclusion: The application of viral nucleic acid detection and pulmonary CT imaging can be used for screeningof suspected cases, and early diagnosis and dynamic condition assessment of patients.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Meng Xu","author_inst":"the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University Yuedong Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xun Liu","author_inst":"the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Chuhong Su","author_inst":"Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Yuping Zeng","author_inst":"the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University Yuedong Hospital, Meizhou, China;"},{"author_name":"Jinqian Zhang","author_inst":"the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University Yuedong Hospital, Meizhou, China"},{"author_name":"Xuwen Li","author_inst":"the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University Yuedong Hospital, Meizhou, China"},{"author_name":"Guirong Liu","author_inst":"The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University Yuedong Hospital, Meizhou, China"},{"author_name":"Jinjun Xie","author_inst":"The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University Yuedong Hospital, Meizhou, China"},{"author_name":"Hongyong Liu","author_inst":"the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University Yuedong Hospital, Meizhou, China"},{"author_name":"Yusheng Jie","author_inst":"the third affiliated hospital of Sun Yat-sen university"},{"author_name":"Pradeep Natarajan","author_inst":"Broad institute"},{"author_name":"Hani Goodarzi","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Faranak Fattahi","author_inst":"UCSF"},{"author_name":"Judith Burger","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Edith Schermer","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Verheul","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Niels van der Velde","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Alex van der Kooi","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Jelle van Schooten","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Marielle van Breemen","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Tom Bijl","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Kwinten Sliepen","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Aafke Aartse","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Ronald Derking","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Ilja Bontjer","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Neeltje Kootstra","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Joost Wiersinga","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Gestur Vidarsson","author_inst":"Sanquin Research"},{"author_name":"Bart Haagmans","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Andrew Ward","author_inst":"Scripps Research"},{"author_name":"Godelieve de Bree","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Rogier Sanders","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Marit van Gils","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Garry P Nolan","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jayakar V Nayak","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Peter K Jackson","author_inst":"Stanford University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.05.20092064","rel_title":"Evaluating the serological status of COVID-19 patients using an indirect immunofluorescent assay, France.","rel_date":"2020-05-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.05.20092064","rel_abs":"An indirect immunofluorescent assay was developed in order to assess the serological status of 888 RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients (1,302 serum samples) and controls in Marseille, France.

Seroprevalence was then measured at 3% before a five-day evolution up to 47% after more than 15 days of evolution. We observed that the seroprevalence as well as the titre of specific antibodies were both significantly higher in patients with a poor clinical outcome than in patients with a favourable evolution. These data, which have to be integrated into the ongoing understanding of the immunological phase of the infection, suggest that serotherapy may not be a therapeutic option in patients with severe COVID-19 infection.

Despite limited antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, several drugs are being tested as medication or as prophylaxis to prevent infection. Using a stochastic model of early phase infection, we find that a critical efficacy above 87% is needed to block viral establishment. This can be improved by combination therapy. Below the critical efficacy, establishment of infection can sometimes be prevented, most effectively with drugs blocking viral entry into cells or enhancing viral clearance. Even when a viral infection cannot be prevented, antivirals delay the time to detectable viral loads. This delay flattens the within-host viral dynamic curve, possibly reducing transmission and symptom severity. Thus, antiviral prophylaxis, even with reduced efficacy, could be efficiently used to prevent or alleviate infection in people at high risk.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peter Czuppon","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universit\u00e9"},{"author_name":"Florence D\u00e9barre","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universit\u00e9"},{"author_name":"Antonio Gon\u00e7alves","author_inst":"Universit\u00e9 de Paris, INSERM"},{"author_name":"Olivier Tenaillon","author_inst":"Universit\u00e9 de Paris, INSERM"},{"author_name":"Alan S Perelson","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Guedj","author_inst":"Universit\u00e9 de Paris, INSERM"},{"author_name":"Fran\u00e7ois Blanquart","author_inst":"Coll\u00e8ge de France"},{"author_name":"Herve TISSOT DUPONT","author_inst":"IHU"},{"author_name":"Philippe GAUTRET","author_inst":"IHU"},{"author_name":"Andreas STEIN","author_inst":"IHU"},{"author_name":"Philippe BROUQUI","author_inst":"IHU"},{"author_name":"Philippe PAROLA","author_inst":"IHU"},{"author_name":"Jean-Christophe LAGIER","author_inst":"IHU"},{"author_name":"Didier RAOULT","author_inst":"IHU"},{"author_name":"Michel Drancourt","author_inst":"Aix Marseille Universite-IHU Mediterranee Infection"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Verheul","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Niels van der Velde","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Alex van der Kooi","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Jelle van Schooten","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Marielle van Breemen","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Tom Bijl","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Kwinten Sliepen","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Aafke Aartse","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Ronald Derking","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Ilja Bontjer","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Neeltje Kootstra","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Joost Wiersinga","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Gestur Vidarsson","author_inst":"Sanquin Research"},{"author_name":"Bart Haagmans","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Andrew Ward","author_inst":"Scripps Research"},{"author_name":"Godelieve de Bree","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Rogier Sanders","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Marit van Gils","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC"},{"author_name":"Garry P Nolan","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jayakar V Nayak","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Peter K Jackson","author_inst":"Stanford University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"}]}
