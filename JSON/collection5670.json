To compare the difference of epidemiology and clinical characteristics between asymptomatic COVID-19 infections and moderate type of confirmed cases. Methods Retrospective, single-center cohort study of COVID-19 involving 52 infections of both 26 asymptomatic and 26 moderate type of confirmed cases in the recovery stage at Guizhou Provincial Staff Hospital in Guiyang, China, from January 29, to March 31, 2020; final date of follow-up was April 22. This study was registered in Chinese Clinical Trial Registry Center. Documented the asymptomatic COVID-19 infections and moderate type of confirmed cases. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections and moderate type of confirmed cases were compared. Results The median treatment cycle of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections was 16 days (interquartile range, 11-20 days) and longer than 13 days (interquartile range, 10-15 days) of moderate type of confirmed cases (p=0.049). The median incubation period of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections was 10 days (interquartile range, 0-21 days), while the control group was 7 days (interquartile range, 1-15 days) (p=0.27). On the initial chest computerized tomography (CT) check, 18 (69.2%, 18\/26) asymptomatic COVID-19 infections were no imaging changes, which was of no significance compared with 12 (46.2%, 12\/26) patients with moderate type of confirmed patients (p=0.092). Conclusions In this single-center study, we found that asymptomatic COVID-19 infections have longer treatment cycle than those moderate type of confirmed cases.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wei Zhang","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qinying Long","author_inst":"Guizhou University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yanbiao Huang","author_inst":"Guizhou University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Changju Chen","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jinhua Wu","author_inst":"Guizhou Provincial Staff Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yang Hong","author_inst":"Guizhou maternal and Child Health Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hourong Zhou","author_inst":"Guizhou Provincial People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Weidong Wu","author_inst":"Guizhou Normal College"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.20.106625","rel_title":"CONTAIN: An open-source shipping container laboratory optimisedfor automated COVID-19 diagnostics","rel_date":"2020-05-20","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.20.106625","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged diagnostic systems globally. Expanding testing capabilities to conduct population-wide screening for COVID-19 requires innovation in diagnostic services at both the molecular and industrial scale. No report to-date has considered the complexity of laboratory infrastructure in conjunction with the available molecular assays to offer a standardised solution to testing. Here we present CONTAIN. A modular biosafety level 2+ laboratory optimised for automated RT-qPCR COVID-19 testing based on a standard 40ft shipping container. Using open-source liquid-handling robots and RNA extraction reagents we demonstrate a reproducible workflow for RT-qPCR COVID-19 testing. With five OT2 liquid handlers, a single CONTAIN unit reaches a maximum daily testing capacity of 2400 tests\/day. We validate this workflow for automated RT-qPCR testing, using both synthetic SARS-CoV-2 samples and patient samples from a local NHS hospital. Finally, we discuss the suitability of CONTAIN and its flexibility in a range of diagnostic testing scenarios including high-density urban environments and mobile response units.\n\nVisual abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=143 SRC=\"FIGDIR\/small\/106625v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (44K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18acad6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10ae5f1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7e34d3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1be3815_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kenneth T Walker","author_inst":"OpenCell.bio"},{"author_name":"Matthew Donora","author_inst":"OpenCell.bio"},{"author_name":"Anthony Thomas","author_inst":"Just-Eat Takeaway.com"},{"author_name":"Alexander James Phillips","author_inst":"Effect Engineering"},{"author_name":"Krishma Ramgoolam","author_inst":"Department of Neuroscience, University College London"},{"author_name":"Kjara S Pilch","author_inst":"Department of Neuroscience, University College London"},{"author_name":"Phil Oberacker","author_inst":"School of Biosciences, Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"Tomasz Piotr Jurkowski","author_inst":"School of Biosciences, Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"Rares Marius Gosman","author_inst":"Unaffiliated"},{"author_name":"Aubin Fleiss","author_inst":"Institute of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Alex Perkins","author_inst":"Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Neil MacKenzie","author_inst":"School of Computing, Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Mark Zuckerman","author_inst":"South London virology centre, Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London"},{"author_name":"Helene Steiner","author_inst":"OpenCell.bio"},{"author_name":"Thomas Meany","author_inst":"OpenCell.bio"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"molecular biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.20.106609","rel_title":"Tiger team: a panel of human neutralizing mAbs targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike at multiple epitopes","rel_date":"2020-05-20","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.20.106609","rel_abs":"The novel highly transmissible human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The innate immune response is critical for protection against Coronaviruses. However, little is known about the interplay between the innate immune system and SARS-CoV-2. Here, we modeled SARS-CoV-2 infection using primary human airway epithelial (pHAE) cultures, which are maintained in an air-liquid interface. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infects and replicates in pHAE cultures and is directionally released on the apical, but not basolateral surface. Transcriptional profiling studies found that infected pHAE cultures had a molecular signature dominated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokine induction, including IL-6, TNF, CXCL8. We also identified NF-{kappa}B and ATF4 transcription factors as key drivers of this pro-inflammatory cytokine response. Surprisingly, we observed a complete lack of a type I or III IFN induction during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pre-treatment or post-treatment with type I and III IFNs dramatically reduced virus replication in pHAE cultures and this corresponded with an upregulation of antiviral effector genes. Our findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 induces a strong pro-inflammatory cytokine response yet blocks the production of type I and III IFNs. Further, SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to the effects of type I and III IFNs, demonstrating their potential utility as therapeutic options to treat COVID-19 patients.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe current pandemic of respiratory illness, COVID-19, is caused by a recently emerged coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. This virus infects airway and lung cells causing fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. Severe cases of COVID-19 can result in lung damage, low blood oxygen levels, and even death. As there are currently no vaccines or antivirals approved for use in humans, studies of the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection are urgently needed. SARS-CoV-2 infection of primary human airway epithelial cultures induces a strong pro-inflammatory cytokine response yet blocks the production of type I and III IFNs. Further, SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to the effects of type I and III IFNs, demonstrating their potential utility as therapeutic options to treat COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abigail Vanderheiden","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Philipp Ralfs","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Tatiana Chirkova","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Amit A Upadhyay","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Matthew G Zimmerman","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Shamika Bedoya","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Hadj Aoued","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Gregory K Tharp","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Pellegrini","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Anice C Lowen","author_inst":"Emory University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Vineet D.

COVID-19 typically exhibits respiratory illness. Unexpectedly, emerging clinical reports indicate that neurological symptoms continue to rise, suggesting detrimental effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we show that a Dusseldorf isolate of SARS-CoV-2 enters 3D human brain organoids within two days of exposure. Using COVID-19 convalescent serum, we identified that SARS-CoV-2 preferably targets soma of cortical neurons but not neural stem cells, the target cell type of ZIKA virus. Imaging cortical neurons of organoids reveal that SARS-CoV-2 exposure is associated with missorted Tau from axons to soma, hyperphosphorylation, and apparent neuronal death. Surprisingly, SARS-CoV-2 co-localizes specifically with Tau phosphorylated at Threonine-231 in the soma, indicative of early neurodegeneration-like effects. Our studies, therefore, provide initial insights into the impact of SARS-CoV-2 as a neurotropic virus and emphasize that brain organoids could model CNS pathologies of COVID-19.\n\nOne sentence summaryCOVID-19 modeling in human brain organoids","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jay Gopalakrishnan","author_inst":"Laboratory for Centrosome and Cytoskeleton Biology, Institute of Human Genetics, University hospital, Heinrich-Heine-University Dusseldorf"},{"author_name":"Anand Ramani","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University,"},{"author_name":"Lisa Mueller","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University"},{"author_name":"Philipp Niklas Ostermann","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University,"},{"author_name":"Elke Gabriel","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University,"},{"author_name":"Abida Islam Pranty","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University,"},{"author_name":"Andreas Mueller-Shiffmann","author_inst":"Institute of neuropathology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University,"},{"author_name":"Aruljothi Mariappan","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University,"},{"author_name":"Oliver Goureau","author_inst":"Institut de la Vision, Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, CNRS, F-75012 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Henning Gruell","author_inst":"German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), partner site Bonn-Cologne and Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), University of Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Walker","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University,"},{"author_name":"Marcel Andree","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University,"},{"author_name":"Sandra Hauka","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University,"},{"author_name":"Kai Wohlgemuth","author_inst":"Clinic for children and youth medicine, General paediatrics, University Hospital Munster, Albert- Schweitzer-Campus 1, 48149 Munster"},{"author_name":"Heymut Omran","author_inst":"Clinic for children and youth medicine, General paediatrics, University Hospital Munster, Albert- Schweitzer-Campus 1, 48149 Munster"},{"author_name":"Florian Klein","author_inst":"German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), partner site Bonn-Cologne and Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), University of Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Dagmar Wieczorek","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University"},{"author_name":"Ortwin Adams","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University,"},{"author_name":"Joerg Timm","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University"},{"author_name":"Carsten Korth","author_inst":"Institute of neuropathology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University"},{"author_name":"Heiner Schaal","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University"},{"author_name":"Torsten Houwaart","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University"},{"author_name":"Alexander Dilthey","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"cell biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.20.104885","rel_title":"RdRp mutations are associated with SARS-CoV-2 genome evolution","rel_date":"2020-05-20","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.20.104885","rel_abs":"COVID-19, caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, started in China in late 2019, and soon became a global pandemic. With the help of thousands of viral genome sequences that have been accumulating, it has become possible to track the evolution of viral genome over time as it spread across the world. An important question that still needs to be answered is whether any of the common mutations affect the viral properties, and therefore the disease characteristics. Therefore, we sought to understand the effects of mutations in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), particularly the common 14408C>T mutation, on mutation rate and viral spread. By focusing on mutations in the slowly evolving M or E genes, we aimed to minimize the effects of selective pressure. Our results indicate that 14408C>T mutation increases the mutation rate, while the third-most common RdRp mutation, 15324C>T, has the opposite effect. It is possible that 14408C>T mutation may have contributed to the dominance of its co-mutations in Europe and elsewhere.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Do\u011fa Eskier","author_inst":"Izmir Biomedicine and Genome Center (IBG)"},{"author_name":"G\u00f6khan Karak\u00fclah","author_inst":"Izmir Biomedicine and Genome Center (IBG)"},{"author_name":"Asl\u0131 Suner","author_inst":"Ege University"},{"author_name":"Yavuz Oktay","author_inst":"Izmir Biomedicine and Genome Center(IBG)"},{"author_name":"Elke Gabriel","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University,"},{"author_name":"Abida Islam Pranty","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University,"},{"author_name":"Andreas Mueller-Shiffmann","author_inst":"Institute of neuropathology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University,"},{"author_name":"Aruljothi Mariappan","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University,"},{"author_name":"Oliver Goureau","author_inst":"Institut de la Vision, Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, CNRS, F-75012 Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Henning Gruell","author_inst":"German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), partner site Bonn-Cologne and Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), University of Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Walker","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University,"},{"author_name":"Marcel Andree","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University,"},{"author_name":"Sandra Hauka","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University,"},{"author_name":"Kai Wohlgemuth","author_inst":"Clinic for children and youth medicine, General paediatrics, University Hospital Munster, Albert- Schweitzer-Campus 1, 48149 Munster"},{"author_name":"Heymut Omran","author_inst":"Clinic for children and youth medicine, General paediatrics, University Hospital Munster, Albert- Schweitzer-Campus 1, 48149 Munster"},{"author_name":"Florian Klein","author_inst":"German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), partner site Bonn-Cologne and Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), University of Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Dagmar Wieczorek","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University"},{"author_name":"Ortwin Adams","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University,"},{"author_name":"Joerg Timm","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University"},{"author_name":"Carsten Korth","author_inst":"Institute of neuropathology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University"},{"author_name":"Heiner Schaal","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University"},{"author_name":"Torsten Houwaart","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University"},{"author_name":"Alexander Dilthey","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.20.107292","rel_title":"CD8+ T cell cross-reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 conferred by other coronavirus strains and influenza virus","rel_date":"2020-05-20","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.20.107292","rel_abs":"While individuals infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) manifested a broad range in susceptibility and severity to the disease, the pre-existing immune memory of related pathogens can influence the disease outcome.

Many tests have been developed, yet with variable speed to first result, and of unknown quality, particularly when considering the prediction of neutralizing capacity.\n\nOBJECTIVES\/METHODSThe LIAISON(R) SARS-CoV-2 S1\/S2 IgG assay was designed to measure antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 native S1\/S2 proteins in a standardized automated chemiluminescent assay. Clinical and analytical performance of the test were validated in an observational study using residual samples (>1500) with positive or negative Covid-19 diagnosis.\n\nRESULTSThe LIAISON(R) SARS-CoV-2 S1\/S2 IgG assay proved highly selective and specific, and offers semiquantitative measures of serum or plasma levels of anti-S1\/S2 IgG with neutralizing activity. The diagnostic sensitivity was 91.3% and 95.7% at >5 or [&ge;]15 days from diagnosis respectively, and 100% when assessed against a neutralizing assay. The specificity ranged between 97% and 98.5%. The average imprecision of the assay was <5 % coefficient of variation. Assay performance at 2 different cut-offs was evaluated to optimize predictive values in settings with different % disease prevalence. CONCLUSIONS. The automated LIAISON(R) SARS-CoV-2 S1\/S2 IgG assay brings efficient, sensitive, specific, and precise serological testing to the laboratory, with the capacity to test large amounts of samples per day: first results are available within 35 minutes with a throughput of 170 tests\/hour. The test also provides a semiquantitative measure to identify samples with neutralizing antibodies, useful also for a large scale screening of convalescent plasma for safe therapeutic use.\n\nIMPORTANCEWith the worldwide advance of the COVID-19 pandemic, efficient, reliable and accessible diagnostic tools are needed to support public health officials and healthcare providers in their efforts to deliver optimal medical care, and articulate sound demographic policy. DiaSorin has developed an automated serology based assay for the measurement of IgG specific to SARS CoV-2 Spike protein, and tested its clinical performance in collaboration with Italian health care professionals who provided access to large numbers of samples from infected and non-infected individuals. The assay delivers excellent sensitivity and specificity, and is able to identify samples with high levels of neutralizing antibodies. This will provide guidance in assessing the true immune status of subjects, as well as meeting the pressing need to screen donors for high titer convalescent sera for subsequent therapeutic and prophylactic use.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fabrizio Bonelli","author_inst":"DiaSorin"},{"author_name":"Antonella Sarasini","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo"},{"author_name":"Claudia Zierold","author_inst":"DiaSorin"},{"author_name":"Mariella Calleri","author_inst":"DiaSorin"},{"author_name":"Alice Bonetti","author_inst":"Molecular Virology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo"},{"author_name":"Frank A Blocki","author_inst":"DiaSorin"},{"author_name":"Luca Pallavicini","author_inst":"DiaSorin"},{"author_name":"Alberto Chinali","author_inst":"DiaSorin"},{"author_name":"Daniela Campisi","author_inst":"ASST Niguarda Hospital"},{"author_name":"Elena Percivalle","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo"},{"author_name":"Anna Pia DiNapoli","author_inst":"Molecular Virology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo"},{"author_name":"Carlo Federico Perno","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Fausto Balldanti","author_inst":"Molecular Virology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo"},{"author_name":"Kai Wohlgemuth","author_inst":"Clinic for children and youth medicine, General paediatrics, University Hospital Munster, Albert- Schweitzer-Campus 1, 48149 Munster"},{"author_name":"Heymut Omran","author_inst":"Clinic for children and youth medicine, General paediatrics, University Hospital Munster, Albert- Schweitzer-Campus 1, 48149 Munster"},{"author_name":"Florian Klein","author_inst":"German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), partner site Bonn-Cologne and Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), University of Cologne, Germany"},{"author_name":"Dagmar Wieczorek","author_inst":"Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University"},{"author_name":"Ortwin Adams","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University,"},{"author_name":"Joerg Timm","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University"},{"author_name":"Carsten Korth","author_inst":"Institute of neuropathology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University"},{"author_name":"Heiner Schaal","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University"},{"author_name":"Torsten Houwaart","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University"},{"author_name":"Alexander Dilthey","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.20.105247","rel_title":"A replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus for studies of SARS-CoV-2 spike-mediated cell entry and its inhibition","rel_date":"2020-05-20","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.20.105247","rel_abs":"There is an urgent need for vaccines and therapeutics to prevent and treat COVID-19.

No toxicity was observed for the PVP-I formulations. Significant inactivation was noted with preincubation of the virus with these PVP-I formulations at the lowest concentrations tested. It has been demonstrated that both PVP-I formulations can inactivate SARS-CoV-2 virus efficiently in both a dose-dependent and a time-dependent manner.

The key to understanding the biology and virus-host interactions of SARS-CoV-2 requires the knowledge of mutation and evolution of this virus at both inter- and intra-host levels. However, despite quite a few polymorphic sites identified among SARS-CoV-2 populations, intra-host variant spectra and their evolutionary dynamics remain mostly unknown. Here, using deep sequencing data, we achieved and characterized consensus genomes and intra-host genomic variants from 32 serial samples collected from eight patients with COVID-19. The 32 consensus genomes revealed the coexistence of different genotypes within the same patient. We further identified 40 intra-host single nucleotide variants (iSNVs). Most (30\/40) iSNVs presented in single patient, while ten iSNVs were found in at least two patients or identical to consensus variants. Comparison of allele frequencies of the iSNVs revealed genetic divergence between intra-host populations of the respiratory tract (RT) and gastrointestinal tract (GIT), mostly driven by bottleneck events among intra-host transmissions. Nonetheless, we observed a maintained viral genetic diversity within GIT, showing an increased population with accumulated mutations developed in the tissue-specific environments. The iSNVs identified here not only show spatial divergence of intra-host viral populations, but also provide new insights into the complex virus-host interactions.","rel_num_authors":35,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yanqun Wang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Daxi Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Wanying Sun","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Zhaoyong Zhang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Weijun Chen","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Airu Zhu","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yongbo Huang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fei Xiao","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Molecular Imag"},{"author_name":"Jinxiu Yao","author_inst":"Yangjiang People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mian Gan","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fang Li","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ling luo","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xiaofang Huang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yanjun Zhang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Sook-san Wong","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xinyi Cheng","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Jingkai Ji","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Zhihua Ou","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Minfeng Xiao","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Min Li","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Jiandong Li","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Peidi Ren","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Ziqing Deng","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Huanzi Zhong","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Huanming Yang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Xun Xu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Tie Song","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chris Mok","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Malik Peiris","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Nanshan Zhong","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Jingxian Zhao","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yimin Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease"},{"author_name":"Junhua Li","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Jincun Zhao","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.20.106294","rel_title":"Deep sequencing of B cell receptor repertoires from COVID-19 patients reveals strong convergent immune signatures","rel_date":"2020-05-20","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.20.106294","rel_abs":"Deep sequencing of B cell receptor (BCR) heavy chains from a cohort of 19 COVID-19 patients from the UK reveals a stereotypical naive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 which is consistent across patients and may be a positive indicator of disease outcome.

There was a strong convergent sequence signature across patients, and we identified 777 clonotypes convergent between at least four of the COVID-19 patients, but not present in healthy controls. A subset of the convergent clonotypes were homologous to known SARS and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein neutralising antibodies.

In ACE 8\/8 mice that over-expresses cardiac ACE protein but also has no kidney ACE expression, ACE2 protein in kidney membranes was also decreased (38 % of the WT, p<0.01). In kidney membranes from mice that received captopril or telmisartan for 2 weeks there was a reduction in ACE2 protein (37% in captopril treated p<0.01) and 76% in telmisartan treated p <0.05). In lung membranes the expression of ACE2 was very low and not detected by western blotting but no significant differences in terms of ACE2 activity could be detected in mice treated with captopril (118% of control) or telmisartan (93% of control).\n\nConclusionsGenetic kidney ACE protein deficiency, suppressed enzymatic activity by Captopril or blockade of the AT1 receptor with telmisartan are all associated with a decrease in ACE2 in kidney membranes.

As loneliness is recognised as a major public health concern, it is therefore vital that research considers the impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic on loneliness in order to provide necessary support. But it remains unclear who is lonely in lockdown? Methods: This study compared socio-demographic predictors of loneliness before and during the COVID-19 pandemic using cross-cohort analyses of data from UK adults captured before the pandemic (UK Household Longitudinal Study, n=31,064) and during the pandemic (UCL COVID-19 Social Study, n=60,341). Results: Risk factors for loneliness were near identical prior to and during the pandemic. Young adults, women, people with lower education or income, the economically inactive, people living alone, and urban residents had a higher risk of being lonely. Some people who were already at risk for being lonely (e.g. young adults aged 18-30, people with low household income, and adults living alone) experienced a heightened risk during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to prior to COVID-19 emerging. Further, being a student emerged as a higher risk factor during lockdown than usual. Conclusions: Findings suggest that interventions to reduce or prevent loneliness during COVID-19 should be targeted at those socio-demographic groups already identified as high-risk in previous research. These groups are likely not just to experience loneliness during the pandemic but to have an even higher risk than normal of experiencing loneliness relative to low-risk groups.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Feifei Bu","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Andrew Steptoe","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Daisy Fancourt","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Daniel Batlle","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Aleksandr Kovaltsuk","author_inst":"Oxford University"},{"author_name":"Gavin J.

It rapidly spread to the rest of the world, and was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on the 30th of January 2020. Our understanding of the virus, it is clinical manifestations and treatment options continues to evolve at an unparalleled pace. Objective: This review sought to summarise the key literature regarding transmission, case definitions, clinical management and trials, and performed a systematic review of reported clinical data on COVID-19. Synthesis methods: Two reviewers selected all the literature independently, and extracted information according to pre-defined topics. Results: COVID-19 is pandemic with ~4 million cases and 270,000 deaths in 210 countries as of 8 May 2020. Our review of reports showed that SARS-CoV-2 was mainly transmitted via inhalation of respiratory droplets containing the virus and had an incubation period of four to six days. The commonly reported symptoms were fever (80%) and cough (60%) across the spectrum of clinical disease - mild, moderate, severe and critical. Categorization of these cases for home care or hospital management need to be well defined considering the age of the patient and the presence of underlying co-morbidities. The case definitions we reviewed varied among affected countries, which could have contributed to the differences observed in the mean case fatality rates among continents: Oceania (1%), Asia (3%), Africa (4%), South America (5%), North America (6%) and Europe (10%). Asymptomatic cases, which constituted an estimated 80% of COVID-19 cases are a huge threat to control efforts. Conclusion: The presence of fever and cough may be sufficient to warrant a COVID-19 testing but using these symptoms in isolation will miss a proportion of cases. A clear definition of a COVID-19 case is important for managing, treating and tracking clinical illness. While several treatments are in development or in clinical trials for COVID-19, home care of mild\/moderate cases and hospital care for severe and critical cases remain the recommended management for the disease. Quarantine measures and social distancing can help control the spread of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Laura McArthur","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Monash University, Clayton, VIC 3800, Australia."},{"author_name":"DhanaSekaran Sakthivel","author_inst":"ZiP Diagnostics Pty Ltd, Collingwood, VIC 3066, Australia."},{"author_name":"Ricardo Ataide","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne, VIC 3010, Melbourne, Australia; Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Felicia Chan","author_inst":"Central Clinical School, Monash University, Clayton, VIC 3800, Australia."},{"author_name":"Jack S Richards","author_inst":"ZiP Diagnostics Pty Ltd, Collingwood, VIC 3066, Australia.; Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne, VIC 3010, Melbourne, Australia.; Burnet Institute f"},{"author_name":"Charles A Narh","author_inst":"ZiP Diagnostics Pty Ltd, Collingwood, VIC 3066, Australia.; Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne, VIC 3010, Melbourne, Australia.; Burnet Institute f"},{"author_name":"Ralph Minter","author_inst":"Alchemab Therapeutics Ltd"},{"author_name":"Donna K.

At the same time, oseltamivir, as an over-the-counter drug, is also a popular antiviral drug. As healthcare workers fighting against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we have found that many patients experiencing discomfort or considered to be infected with a virus take oseltamivir. From severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 to middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, and now the current COVID-19 epidemic, there is not plenty of evidence showing that oseltamivir is effective against coronavirus. Still, there is also no sufficient evidence to refute its ineffectiveness. We cannot predict whether there will be a pandemic of respiratory coronavirus in the future, so we hope to initiate such research and preliminarily explore whether oseltamivir is effective for COVID-19, which can better guide healthcare workers in the selection of appropriate antiviral drugs in the face of coronavirus epidemics. If oseltamivir is effective, then a wide promotion of its application often can achieve a double effect with half the effort. If it is not effective, then considering the side effects of oseltamivir, it is not necessary to use unreasonable drugs that will not slow the progression of the disease but can cause adverse reactions. We found that oseltamivir is not suitable for fighting against COVID-19 through the method of computer aided drug design and in vitro study and retrospective case study. Meanwhile it was high-occurrence seasons for the influenza, COVID-19 should be highly suspected in patients who did not benefit from oseltamivir. We hope that the result of our study could be shared with the frontline physicians in fighting against COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qi Tan","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, NHC Key Laboratory of Pulmonary Disease"},{"author_name":"Yang Jin","author_inst":"Wuhan Union Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Ataide","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne, VIC 3010, Melbourne, Australia; Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Melbourne, Australia"},{"author_name":"Felicia Chan","author_inst":"Central Clinical School, Monash University, Clayton, VIC 3800, Australia."},{"author_name":"Jack S Richards","author_inst":"ZiP Diagnostics Pty Ltd, Collingwood, VIC 3066, Australia.; Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne, VIC 3010, Melbourne, Australia.; Burnet Institute f"},{"author_name":"Charles A Narh","author_inst":"ZiP Diagnostics Pty Ltd, Collingwood, VIC 3066, Australia.; Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne, VIC 3010, Melbourne, Australia.; Burnet Institute f"},{"author_name":"Ralph Minter","author_inst":"Alchemab Therapeutics Ltd"},{"author_name":"Donna K.

Without efficacious antiviral drugs or vaccines available, mass quarantine has been the main strategy adopted by governments to contain the virus spread. This has led to a significant reduction in the number of infected people and deaths and to a diminished pressure over the health care system. However, an economic depression is following due to the forced absence of worker from their job and to the closure of many productive activities. For these reasons, governments are lessening progressively the mass quarantine measures to avoid an economic catastrophe. However, most people has not been yet exposed to the virus, so are susceptible to Covid-19. Therefore, the reopening of firms and commercial activities might lead to a resurgence of infection, as already reported in South Korea and in China were epidemic was considered almost gone although in a few of cases. In the worst-case scenario, this might impose the return to strict lockdown measures. Epidemiological models are therefore necessary to forecast possible new infection outbreaks and to inform government to promptly adopt new containment measures. In this context, we tested here if technical analysis methods commonly used in the financial market might provide early signal of change in the direction of SARS-Cov-2 infection trend in Italy, Iran and Brazil, three countries which have been strongly hit by the pandemic but whose present infection trends are substantially different from each other being therefore particularly useful to understand the potential of TA models.

An online questionnaire survey was organized from March 31 to April 6, 2020. The questionnaire assessed preventive behavior using multiple answer responses to indicate the extent of adherence. In total, 2175 respondents completed the questionnaire (age range: 18-69 years). The mean adherence scores for personal and community preventive measures were 7.23 {+\/-} 1.63 (range 1-9) and 9.57 {+\/-} 1.12 (range 1-11), respectively. Perceived adaptation of the community to lockdown ({beta}=2.64, 95% CI 1.25 -4.03), fears\/worries concerning one's health ({beta}=2.87, 95% CI 0.04-5.70), residing in large cities ({beta}=19.40, 95% CI 13.78-25.03), access to official COVID19 information sources ({beta}=16.45, 95% CI 6.82-26.08), and belonging to the healthcare sector ({beta}=22.53, 95% CI 16.00-29.07) were associated with a higher adherence score to anti -COVID instructions. The study indicates excellent preventive behavior of the Vietnamese population which explains the low number of COVID-19 infections and zero recorded mortality up to the first week of May 2020.

Particles of oral\/nasal fluid released by patients undergoing NHF therapy may pose a cross-infection risk, which is a potential concern for treating COVID-19 patients. Methods Liquid particles within the exhaled breath of healthy participants were measured with two protocols: (1) high speed camera imaging and counting exhaled particles under high magnification (6 participants) and (2) measuring the deposition of a chemical marker (riboflavin-5-monophosphate) at a distance of 100 and 500 mm on filter papers through which air was drawn (10 participants). The filter papers were assayed with HPLC. Breathing conditions tested included quiet (resting) breathing and vigorous breathing (which here means nasal snorting, voluntary coughing and voluntary sneezing). Unsupported (natural) breathing and NHF at 30 and 60 LPM were compared. Results (1) Imaging: During quiet breathing, no particles were recorded with unsupported breathing or 30 LPM NHF (detection limit for single particles 33 microns). Particles were detected in 2 of 6 participants at 60 LPM quiet breathing at approximately 10% of the rate caused by unsupported vigorous breathing. Unsupported vigorous breathing released the greatest numbers of particles. Vigorous breathing with NHF at 60 LPM, released half the number of particles compared to vigorous breathing without NHF. (2) Chemical marker tests: No oral\/nasal fluid was detected in quiet breathing without NHF (detection limit 0.28 microlitres\/m3). In quiet breathing with NHF at 60 LPM, small quantities were detected in 4 out of 29 quiet breathing tests, not exceeding 17 microlitres\/m3. Vigorous breathing released 200-1000 times more fluid than the quiet breathing with NHF. The quantities detected in vigorous breathing were similar whether using NHF or not. Conclusion During quiet breathing, 60 LPM NHF therapy may cause oral\/nasal fluid to be released as particles, at levels of tens of microlitres per cubic metre of air. Vigorous breathing (snort, cough or sneeze) releases 200 to 1000 times more oral\/nasal fluid than quiet breathing. During vigorous breathing, 60 LPM NHF therapy caused no statistically significant difference in the quantity of oral\/nasal fluid released compares to unsupported breathing. NHF use does not increase the risk of dispersing infectious aerosols above the risk of unsupported vigorous breathing. Standard infection prevention and control measures should apply when dealing with a patient who has an acute respiratory infection, independent of which, if any, respiratory support is being used.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mark C Jermy","author_inst":"University of Canterbury"},{"author_name":"Callum JT Spence","author_inst":"Fisher and Paykel Healthcare"},{"author_name":"Robert Kirton","author_inst":"Fisher and Paykel Healthcare"},{"author_name":"Jane F O'Donnell","author_inst":"Fisher and Paykel Healthcare; School of Nursing, Massey University"},{"author_name":"Natalia Kabaliuk","author_inst":"University of Canterbury"},{"author_name":"Sally Gaw","author_inst":"University of Canterbury"},{"author_name":"Yannan Jiang","author_inst":"University of Auckland"},{"author_name":"Zulkhairi Zainol Abidin","author_inst":"Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Ronald L Dougherty","author_inst":"University of Kansas"},{"author_name":"Philip Rowe","author_inst":"Fisher and Paykel Healthcare"},{"author_name":"Anjula Mahaliyana","author_inst":"University of Canterbury"},{"author_name":"Amelia Gibbs","author_inst":"Landcare Research"},{"author_name":"Sally Roberts","author_inst":"Auckland District Health Board"},{"author_name":"Olivia Cavlan","author_inst":"Alchemab Therapeutics Ltd"},{"author_name":"Alex Leech","author_inst":"Alchemab Therapeutics Ltd"},{"author_name":"Charlotte M.

Norway closed all kindergartens, schools and universities, and banned sports and cultural activities, while Sweden kept most institutions and trainings facilities open. We aimed to compare peoples' attitudes towards authorities and control measures, and effects on life in Norway and Sweden. Design: Anonymous web-based surveys for individuals age 15 or older distributed through Facebook using the snowball method. Setting: Norway and Sweden, mid-March to mid-April, 2020. Participants: Altogether, 3,508 individuals participated in the survey; 3000 in Norway and 508 in Sweden. 79% of the participants were women, 60% of the Norwegians and 47% of the Swedes were between 30-49 years, and around 45% of the participants in both countries had more than 4 years of higher education. Outcome measures: Perceived threat of the pandemic, views on infection control measures, and impact on daily life. We performed descriptive analyses of the responses and compared the two countries. Results: People had high trust in the health services in both countries, but differed in the degree of trust in their government (17% had high trust in Norway and 37% in Sweden). More Norwegians than Swedes agreed that school closure was a good measure (66% Norway and 18% in Sweden), and that countries with open schools were irresponsible (65% in Norway and 23% in Sweden). About the same amount responded that COVID-19 was a large to very large threat to the population (53% in Norway and 58% in Sweden), whereas more Norwegians than Swedes responded that the threat from repercussions of the mitigation measures were large or very large (71% in Norway and 56% in Sweden). Compliance with infection preventive measures was high and similar in the two countries (more than 98%). In Norway, 69% lived a more sedentary life during the pandemic versus 50% in Sweden; and Norwegians reported they ate more than Swedes (44% in Norway and 33% in Sweden). Conclusion: Sweden, with less restrictive measures against the COVID-19 pandemic, had a higher level of trust in the authorities, while Norwegians reported a more negative lifestyle during the pandemic.

We sought to identify whether implementation of the nationwide lockdown (shelter-in-place) order in South Africa affected ambulatory clinic visitation in rural Kwa-Zulu Natal (KZN). Design Prospective, longitudinal cohort study Setting Data were analyzed from the Africa Health Research Institute Health and Demographic Surveillance System, which includes prospective data capture of clinic visits at eleven primary healthcare clinics in northern KwaZulu-Natal Participants A total of 36,291 individuals made 55,545 clinic visits during the observation period. Exposure of Interest We conducted an interrupted time series analysis with regression discontinuity methods to estimate changes in outpatient clinic visitation from 60 days before through 35 days after the lockdown period. Outcome Measures Daily clinic visitation at ambulatory clinics. In stratified analyses we assessed visitation for the following sub-categories: child health, perinatal care and family planning, HIV services, non-communicable diseases, and by age and sex strata. Results We found no change in total clinic visits\/clinic\/day from prior to and during the lockdown (-6.9 visits\/clinic\/day, 95%CI -17.4, 3.7) or trends in clinic visitation over time during the lockdown period (-0.2, 95%CI -3.4, 3.1). We did detect a reduction in child healthcare visits at the lockdown (-7.2 visits\/clinic\/day, 95%CI -9.2, -5.3), which was seen in both children <1 and children 1-5. In contrast, we found a significant increase in HIV visits immediately after the lockdown (8.4 visits\/clinic\/day, 95%CI 2.4, 14.4). No other differences in clinic visitation were found for perinatal care and family planning, non-communicable diseases, or among adult men and women. Conclusions In rural KZN, the ambulatory healthcare system was largely resilient during the national-wide lockdown order. A major exception was child healthcare visitation, which declined immediately after the lockdown but began to normalize in the weeks thereafter. Future work should explore efforts to decentralize chronic care for high-risk populations and whether catch-up vaccination programs might be required in the wake of these findings.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mark J Siedner","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"John D.

Five months into the outbreak there is an impressive number of studies reporting antibody kinetics and RNA shedding dynamics, but extensive variation in detection assays, study group demographics, and laboratory protocols has presented a challenge for inferring the true biological patterns. Here, we combine existing data on SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM and RNA kinetics using a formal quantitative approach that enables integration of 3,214 data points from 516 individuals, published in 22 studies. This allows us to determine the mean values and distributions of IgG and IgM seroconversion times and titer kinetics, and to characterize how antibody and RNA detection probabilities change during the early phase of infection. We observe extensive variation in antibody response patterns and RNA detection patterns, explained by both individual heterogeneity and protocol differences such as targeted antigen and sample type. These results provide a robust reference for clinical management of individual patients, and a foundation for the mathematical models and serological surveys that underpin public health policies.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Benny Borremans","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Amandine Gamble","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"K C Prager","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Sarah K Helman","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Abby M McClain","author_inst":"National Marine Mammal Foundation"},{"author_name":"Caitlin Cox","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Van Savage","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"James O Lloyd-Smith","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Nomathamsanqa Majozi","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Nothando Ngwenya","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Zahra Reynolds","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Janet Seeley","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Emily Wong","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Collins Iwuji","author_inst":"Brighton and Sussex Medical School"},{"author_name":"Maryam Shahmanesh","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Willem Hanekom","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Kobus Herbst","author_inst":"Africa Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Dan Pennington","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Paul Pfeffer","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Jane Osbourn","author_inst":"Alchemab Therapeutics Ltd"},{"author_name":"Jiandong Li","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Peidi Ren","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Ziqing Deng","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Huanzi Zhong","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Huanming Yang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Xun Xu","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Tie Song","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chris Mok","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Malik Peiris","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Nanshan Zhong","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Aff"},{"author_name":"Jingxian Zhao","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yimin Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease"},{"author_name":"Junhua Li","author_inst":"BGI-Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Jincun Zhao","author_inst":"Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"}]}
