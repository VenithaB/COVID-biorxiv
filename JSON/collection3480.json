With a descriptive epidemiological framing, we assessed whether historical patterns of regional influenza burden are reflected in the observed heterogeneity in COVID-19 cases across regions of the world. Methods Weekly surveillance data reported in FluNet from January 2017-December 2019 for influenza and World Health Organization for COVID-19 (to May 31, 2020) across the seven World Bank regions were used to assess the total and annual number of influenza and COVID-19 cases per country, within and across all regions, to generate comparative descending ranks from highest to lowest burden of disease. Results Across regions, rankings of influenza and COVID-19 were relatively consistent. Europe and Central Asia and North America ranked first and second for COVID-19 and second and first for influenza, respectively. East Asia and the Pacific traditionally ranked higher for influenza with recent increases in COVID-19 consistent with influenza season. Across regions, Sub-Saharan Africa ranked amongst the least affected by both influenza and COVID-19. Conclusion Consistency in the regional distribution of the burden of COVID-19 and influenza suggest shared individual, structural, and environmental determinants of transmission. Using a descriptive epidemiological framework to assess shared regional trends for rapidly emerging respiratory pathogens with better studied respiratory infections may provide further insights into the differential impacts of non-pharmacologic interventions and intersections with environmental conditions. Ultimately, forecasting trends and informing interventions for novel respiratory pathogens like COVID-19 should leverage epidemiologic patterns in the relative burden of past respiratory pathogens as prior information.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stefan D Baral","author_inst":"JHSPH"},{"author_name":"Katherine B Rucinski","author_inst":"JHSPH"},{"author_name":"Jean Olivier Twahirwa Rwema","author_inst":"JHSPH"},{"author_name":"Amrita Rao","author_inst":"JHSPH"},{"author_name":"Neia Prata Menezes","author_inst":"JHSPH"},{"author_name":"Daouda Diouf","author_inst":"Enda Sant\u00e9"},{"author_name":"Adeeba Kamarulzaman","author_inst":"Universiti Malaya"},{"author_name":"Nancy Phaswana-Mafuya","author_inst":"North West University"},{"author_name":"Sharmistha Mishra","author_inst":"University of Toronto"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.18.20134478","rel_title":"The influence of comorbidity on the severity of COVID-19 disease: systematic review and analysis","rel_date":"2020-06-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.18.20134478","rel_abs":"Background: A novel form of coronavirus disease (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly across the world. What risk factors influence the severity of the disease is of considerable importance. Aim: This research offers a systematic review and meta-analysis of the correlation between common clinical conditions and comorbidities and the severity of COVID-19. Methodology: Two independent researchers searched Europe PMC, Google Scholar, and PubMed databases for articles related to influence comorbidities have on the progress of the disease. A search engine was also created to screen a further 59,000 articles in COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). Random-effects modeling was used to pool 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and odds ratios (ORs). The significance of all comorbidities and clinical conditions to the severity of the disease was evaluated by employing machine-learning techniques. Publication bias was assessed by using funnel-plots and Egger's test. Heterogeneity was tested using I2. Results: The meta-analysis incorporated 12 studies spanning 4,101 confirmed COVID-19 patients who were admitted to Chinese hospitals. The prevalence of the most commonly associated co-morbidities and their corresponding odds ratio for disease severity were as follows: coronary heart disease (OR 2.97 [CI: 1.99-4.45], p < 0.0001), cancer (OR 2.65 [CI: 1.12-6.29], p < 0.03), cardiovascular disease (OR 2.89 [CI: 1.90-4.40], p < 0.0001), COPD (OR 3.24 [CI: 1.66-6.32], p = 0.0), and kidney disease (OR 2.2.4 [CI: 1.01-4.99], p = 0.05) with low or moderate level of heterogeneity. The most frequently exhibited clinical symptoms were fever (OR 1.37 [CI: 1.01-1.86], p = 0.04), myalgia\/fatigue (OR 1.31 [CI: 1.11-1.55], p = 0.0018), and dyspnea (OR 3.61, [CI: 2.57-5.06], p = <0.0001). No significant associations between disease severity and liver disease, smoking habits, and other clinical conditions, such as a cough, respiratory\/ARDS, diarrhea or chest tightness\/pain were found. The meta-analysis also revealed that the incubation period was positively associated with disease severity. Conclusion: Existing comorbidities, including COPD, cardiovascular disease, and coronary heart disease, increase the severity of COVID-19. Some studies found a statistically significant association between comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension and disease severity. However, these studies may be biased due to substantial heterogeneity.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nazar Zaki","author_inst":"United Arab Emirates University"},{"author_name":"Elfadil Abdalla Mohamed","author_inst":"Ajman University"},{"author_name":"Sahar Ibrahim","author_inst":"Purdue University"},{"author_name":"Gulfaraz Khan","author_inst":"United Arab Emirates University"},{"author_name":"Neia Prata Menezes","author_inst":"JHSPH"},{"author_name":"Daouda Diouf","author_inst":"Enda Sant\u00e9"},{"author_name":"Adeeba Kamarulzaman","author_inst":"Universiti Malaya"},{"author_name":"Nancy Phaswana-Mafuya","author_inst":"North West University"},{"author_name":"Sharmistha Mishra","author_inst":"University of Toronto"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.18.20134676","rel_title":"Cardiometabolic traits, sepsis and severe covid-19 with respiratory failure: a Mendelian randomization investigation","rel_date":"2020-06-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.18.20134676","rel_abs":"Objectives: To investigate whether there is a causal effect of cardiometabolic traits on risk of sepsis and severe covid-19. Design: Mendelian randomisation analysis. Setting: UK Biobank and HUNT study population-based cohorts for risk of sepsis, and genome-wide association study summary data for risk of severe covid-19 with respiratory failure. Participants: 12,455 sepsis cases (519,885 controls) and 1,610 severe covid-19 with respiratory failure cases (2,205 controls). Exposure: Genetic variants that proxy body mass index (BMI), lipid traits, systolic blood pressure, lifetime smoking score, and type 2 diabetes liability - derived from studies considering between 188,577 to 898,130 participants. Main outcome measures: Risk of sepsis and severe covid-19 with respiratory failure. Results: Higher genetically proxied BMI and lifetime smoking score were associated with increased risk of sepsis in both UK Biobank (BMI: odds ratio 1.38 per standard deviation increase, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.27 to 1.51; smoking: odds ratio 2.81 per standard deviation increase, 95% CI 2.09-3.79) and HUNT (BMI: 1.41, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.69; smoking: 1.93, 95% CI 1.02-3.64). Higher genetically proxied BMI and lifetime smoking score were also associated with increased risk of severe covid-19, although with wider confidence intervals (BMI: 1.75, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.57; smoking: 3.94, 95% CI 1.13 to 13.75). There was limited evidence to support associations of genetically proxied lipid traits, systolic blood pressure or type 2 diabetes liability with risk of sepsis or severe covid-19. Similar findings were generally obtained when using Mendelian randomization methods that are more robust to the inclusion of pleiotropic variants, although the precision of estimates was reduced. Conclusions: Our findings support a causal effect of elevated BMI and smoking on risk of sepsis and severe covid-19. Clinical and public health interventions targeting obesity and smoking are likely to reduce sepsis and covid-19 related morbidity, along with the plethora of other health-related outcomes that these traits adversely affect.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ponsford J Mark","author_inst":"University Hospital Wales"},{"author_name":"Apostolos Gkatzionis","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Venexia Walker","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Andrew Grant","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Robyn E Wootton","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Luke S P Moore","author_inst":"Chelsea & Westminster NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Segun Fatumo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Amy Mason","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Verena Zuber","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Cristen Willer","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Humaira Rasheed","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Ben Brumpton","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Kristian Hveem","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jan Kristian Damas","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Neil M Davies","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Bjorn Olav Asvold","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Erik Solligard","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Simon Jones","author_inst":"Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"Stephen Burgess","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Tormod Rogne","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Dipender Gill","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.18.20134734","rel_title":"Epidemiological characterization of asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 in Colombia","rel_date":"2020-06-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.18.20134734","rel_abs":"Objective: Asymptomatic carriers (AC) of the new Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) represent an important source of spread for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Methods: Using a cross-sectional design and the national database of daily occurrence of COVID-19, we characterized both socially and demographically all ACs. Additional Correspondence Analysis and Logistic Regression Model were performed to identify characteristics associated with AC state (OR, 95% CI). Results: 2338 ACs (11.8%; 95% CI, 11.3-12.2%) were identified, mainly in epidemiological week 18 [EW] (3.98; 3.24-4.90). Age [&le;]39 years (1.56; 1.42-1.72).

We also identified groups of departments with moderate (3.68; 3.13-4.33) and strong (8.31; 6.10-7.46) association with AC. Discussion: Sociodemographic characteristics strongly associated with AC were identified, which may explain its epidemiological relevance and usefulness to optimize mass screening strategies and prevent person-to-person transmission.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anibal A Teheran","author_inst":"Cruz Roja de Colombia"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Camero","author_inst":"Cruz Roja Colombia"},{"author_name":"Ronald Prado de la Guardia","author_inst":"Cruz Roja Colombia"},{"author_name":"Carolina Hernandez","author_inst":"Universidad del Rosario"},{"author_name":"Giovanny Herrera","author_inst":"Universidad del Rosario"},{"author_name":"Luis M Pombo","author_inst":"Fundacion Universitaria Juan N Corpas"},{"author_name":"Albert Avila","author_inst":"Universidad de la Sabana"},{"author_name":"Carolina Florez","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Esther C Barros","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Luis Perez Garcia","author_inst":"Incubadora Venezolana de Ciencia"},{"author_name":"Alberto Paniz Mondolfi","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Juan David Ramirez","author_inst":"Universidad del Rosario"},{"author_name":"Kristian Hveem","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jan Kristian Damas","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Neil M Davies","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Bjorn Olav Asvold","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Erik Solligard","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Simon Jones","author_inst":"Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"Stephen Burgess","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Tormod Rogne","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Dipender Gill","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.19.20134437","rel_title":"LOCKDOWN AS A PANDEMIC MITIGATING POLICY INTERVENTION IN INDIA","rel_date":"2020-06-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.19.20134437","rel_abs":"Abstract. We use publicly available timeline data on the Covid-19 outbreak for nine indian states to calculate the important quantifier of the outbreak, the sought after Rt or the time varying reproduction number of the outbreak. This quantity can be measured in in several ways, e.g. by application of Stochastic compartmentalised SIR (DCM) model, Poissonian likelihood based (ML) model & the exponential growth rate (EGR) model. The third one is known as the effective reproduction number of an outbreak. Here we use, mostly, the second one. It is known as the instantaneous reproduction number for an outbreak. This number can faithfully tell us the success of lockdown measures inside indian states, as containment policy for the spread of Covid-19 viral disease. This can also, indirectly yield notional value of the generation time inteval in different states. In doing this work we employ, pan India serial interval of the outbreak estimated directly from data from January 30th to April 19th, 2020. Simultaneously, in conjunction with the serial interval data, our result is derived from incidences data between March 14th, 2020 to June 1st, 2020, for the said states. We find the lockdown had marked positive effect on the nature of time dependent reproduction number in most of the Indian states, barring a couple. The possible reason for such failures have been investigated.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Subhayan Mandal","author_inst":"Malaviya National Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Manoj Kumar","author_inst":"Malaviya National Institute Of Technology"},{"author_name":"Debasish Sarkar","author_inst":"Malaviya National Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Carolina Hernandez","author_inst":"Universidad del Rosario"},{"author_name":"Giovanny Herrera","author_inst":"Universidad del Rosario"},{"author_name":"Luis M Pombo","author_inst":"Fundacion Universitaria Juan N Corpas"},{"author_name":"Albert Avila","author_inst":"Universidad de la Sabana"},{"author_name":"Carolina Florez","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Esther C Barros","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Luis Perez Garcia","author_inst":"Incubadora Venezolana de Ciencia"},{"author_name":"Alberto Paniz Mondolfi","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Juan David Ramirez","author_inst":"Universidad del Rosario"},{"author_name":"Kristian Hveem","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jan Kristian Damas","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Neil M Davies","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Bjorn Olav Asvold","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Erik Solligard","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Simon Jones","author_inst":"Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"Stephen Burgess","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Tormod Rogne","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Dipender Gill","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.19.162529","rel_title":"The enzymatic activity of the nsp14 exoribonuclease is critical for replication of Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus","rel_date":"2020-06-20","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.19.162529","rel_abs":"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWCoronaviruses (CoVs) stand out for their large RNA genome and complex RNA-synthesizing machinery comprising 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps). The bifunctional nsp14 contains an N-terminal 3-to-5 exoribonuclease (ExoN) and a C-terminal N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) domain. While the latter presumably operates during viral mRNA capping, ExoN is thought to mediate proofreading during genome replication. In line with such a role, ExoN-knockout mutants of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were previously found to have a crippled but viable hypermutation phenotype. Remarkably, using an identical reverse genetics approach, an extensive mutagenesis study revealed the corresponding ExoN-knockout mutants of another betacoronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), to be non-viable. This is in agreement with observations previously made for alpha- and gammacoronaviruses. Only a single MERS-CoV ExoN active site mutant could be recovered, likely because the introduced D191E substitution is highly conservative in nature. For 11 other MERS-CoV ExoN active site mutants, not a trace of RNA synthesis could be detected, unless - in some cases - reversion had first occurred. Subsequently, we expressed and purified recombinant MERS-CoV nsp14 and established in vitro assays for both its ExoN and N7-MTase activities. All ExoN knockout mutations that were lethal when tested via reverse genetics were found to severely decrease ExoN activity, while not affecting N7-MTase activity. Our study thus reveals an additional function for MERS-CoV nsp14 ExoN, which apparently is critical for primary viral RNA synthesis, thus differentiating it from the proofreading activity thought to boost long-term replication fidelity in MHV and SARS-CoV.\n\nIO_SCPLOWMPORTANCEC_SCPLOWThe bifunctional nsp14 subunit of the coronavirus replicase contains 3-to-5 exoribonuclease (ExoN) and N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) domains. For the betacoronaviruses MHV and SARS-CoV, the ExoN domain was reported to promote the fidelity of genome replication, presumably by mediating some form of proofreading. For these viruses, ExoN knockout mutants are alive while displaying an increased mutation frequency. Strikingly, we now established that the equivalent knockout mutants of MERS-CoV ExoN are non-viable and completely deficient in RNA synthesis, thus revealing an additional and more critical function of ExoN in coronavirus replication. Both enzymatic activities of (recombinant) MERS-CoV nsp14 were evaluated using newly developed in vitro assays that can be used to characterize these key replicative enzymes in more detail and explore their potential as target for antiviral drug development.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Natacha S.

The research is based on a cross-sectional observational study, in which we applied, using Google FormsR, the questions contained in CPDI, among with demographic data: age, sex, educational institution, undergraduate course and school year. The Index was applied online for seven days in which a total of 654 valid responses were obtained: 501 (76.6%) female and 149 (22.8%) male. Regarding age, 333 students (50.91%) were 17-20 years old, 279 (42.66%) between 21-25, 30 (4.59%) between 26-30 and 12 (1.84%) between 31-50. The results indicate that the participants reported significant psychological distress, according to the CPDI score. Practically 90% (87.92%) of the students experienced suffering, while only 12.08% did not suffer. The study provides the first empirical evidence on the level of psychological distress in Brazilian university students during the Covid-19 pandemic. Also, it suggests support and monitoring of university students during and after the pandemic, with effective and efficient intervention in their mental health.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carlos von Krakauer Hubner Sr.","author_inst":"Pontifical Catholic University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Marcella Lima Bruscatto","author_inst":"Pontifical Catholic University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Rafaella Dourado Lima","author_inst":"Pontifical Catholic University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Sergi Vilanova-Rotllan","author_inst":"Centre d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria Les Corts, Consorci d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria de Salut Barcelona Esquerre (CAPSBE), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ethel Sequeira-Aymar","author_inst":"Centre d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria Casanova, Consorci d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria de Salut Barcelona Esquerre (CAPSBE), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Mireia Sans-Corrales","author_inst":"Centre d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria Comte Borrell, Consorci d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria de Salut Barcelona Esquerre (CAPSBE), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Elisenda Sant-Arderiu","author_inst":"Centre d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria Casanova, Consorci d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria de Salut Barcelona Esquerre (CAPSBE), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Laia Cayuelas-Redondo","author_inst":"Centre d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria Casanova, Consorci d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria de Salut Barcelona Esquerre (CAPSBE), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Angela Mart\u00ednez-P\u00e9rez","author_inst":"Centre d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria Casanova, Consorci d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria de Salut Barcelona Esquerre (CAPSBE), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Noem\u00ed Garc\u00eda Plana","author_inst":"Centre d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria Comte Borrell, Consorci d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria de Salut Barcelona Esquerre (CAPSBE), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"August Anguita-Guimet","author_inst":"Centre d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria Les Corts, Consorci d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria de Salut Barcelona Esquerre (CAPSBE), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Jaume Benavent-\u00c0reu","author_inst":"Consorci d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria de Salut Barcelona Esquerre (CAPSBE), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Kristian Hveem","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jan Kristian Damas","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Neil M Davies","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Bjorn Olav Asvold","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Erik Solligard","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Simon Jones","author_inst":"Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"Stephen Burgess","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Tormod Rogne","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Dipender Gill","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.17.20133595","rel_title":"Clozapine treatment and risk of COVID-19.","rel_date":"2020-06-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.17.20133595","rel_abs":"Background Clozapine, an antipsychotic with unique efficacy in treatment resistant psychosis, is associated with increased susceptibility to infection, including pneumonia. Aims To investigate associations between clozapine treatment and increased risk of COVID-19 in patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders who are receiving antipsychotic medications, using electronic health records data, in a geographically defined population in London. Method Using information from South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLAM) clinical records, via the Clinical Record Interactive Search system, we identified 6,309 individuals who had an ICD-10 diagnosis of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders and were taking antipsychotics at the time on the COVID-19 pandemic onset in the UK. People who were on clozapine treatment were compared with those on any other antipsychotic treatment for risk of contracting COVID-19 between 1 March and 18 May 2020. We tested associations between clozapine treatment and COVID-19 infection, adjusting for gender, age, ethnicity, BMI, smoking status, and SLAM service use. Results Of 6,309 patients, 102 tested positive for COVID-19. Individuals who were on clozapine had increased risk of COVID-19 compared with those who were on other antipsychotic medication (unadjusted HR = 2.62 (95% CI 1.73 - 3.96), which was attenuated after adjusting for potential confounders, including clinical contact (adjusted hazard ratio HR=1.76, 95% CI 1.14 - 2.72). Conclusions These findings provide support for the hypothesis that clozapine treatment is associated with an increased risk of COVID-19. Further research will be needed in other samples to confirm this association. Potential clinical implications are discussed.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Risha Govind","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Daniela Fonesca de Freitas","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Megan R Pritchard","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Richard D Hayes","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"James H MacCabe","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Mireia Sans-Corrales","author_inst":"Centre d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria Comte Borrell, Consorci d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria de Salut Barcelona Esquerre (CAPSBE), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Elisenda Sant-Arderiu","author_inst":"Centre d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria Casanova, Consorci d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria de Salut Barcelona Esquerre (CAPSBE), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Laia Cayuelas-Redondo","author_inst":"Centre d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria Casanova, Consorci d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria de Salut Barcelona Esquerre (CAPSBE), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Angela Mart\u00ednez-P\u00e9rez","author_inst":"Centre d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria Casanova, Consorci d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria de Salut Barcelona Esquerre (CAPSBE), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Noem\u00ed Garc\u00eda Plana","author_inst":"Centre d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria Comte Borrell, Consorci d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria de Salut Barcelona Esquerre (CAPSBE), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"August Anguita-Guimet","author_inst":"Centre d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria Les Corts, Consorci d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria de Salut Barcelona Esquerre (CAPSBE), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Jaume Benavent-\u00c0reu","author_inst":"Consorci d'Atenci\u00f3 Prim\u00e0ria de Salut Barcelona Esquerre (CAPSBE), Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Kristian Hveem","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jan Kristian Damas","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Neil M Davies","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Bjorn Olav Asvold","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Erik Solligard","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Simon Jones","author_inst":"Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"Stephen Burgess","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Tormod Rogne","author_inst":"Norwegian University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Dipender Gill","author_inst":"Imperial College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.18.20134742","rel_title":"Racial and ethnic determinants of Covid-19 risk","rel_date":"2020-06-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.18.20134742","rel_abs":"Background Racial and ethnic minorities have disproportionately high hospitalization rates and mortality related to the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). There are comparatively scant data on race and ethnicity as determinants of infection risk. Methods We used a smartphone application (beginning March 24, 2020 in the United Kingdom [U.K.] and March 29, 2020 in the United States [U.S.]) to recruit 2,414,601 participants who reported their race\/ethnicity through May 25, 2020 and employed logistic regression to determine the adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for a positive Covid-19 test among racial and ethnic groups. Results We documented 8,858 self-reported cases of Covid-19 among 2,259,841 non-Hispanic white; 79 among 9,615 Hispanic; 186 among 18,176 Black; 598 among 63,316 Asian; and 347 among 63,653 other racial minority participants. Compared with non-Hispanic white participants, the risk for a positive Covid-19 test was increased across racial minorities (aORs ranging from 1.24 to 3.51). After adjustment for socioeconomic indices and Covid-19 exposure risk factors, the associations (aOR [95% CI]) were attenuated but remained significant for Hispanic (1.58 [1.24-2.02]) and Black participants (2.56 [1.93-3.39]) in the U.S. and South Asian (1.52 [1.38-1.67]) and Middle Eastern participants (1.56 [1.25-1.95]) in the U.K. A higher risk of Covid-19 and seeking or receiving treatment was also observed for several racial\/ethnic minority subgroups. Conclusions Our results demonstrate an increase in Covid-19 risk among racial and ethnic minorities not completely explained by other risk factors for Covid-19, comorbidities, and sociodemographic characteristics. Further research investigating these disparities are needed to inform public health measures.","rel_num_authors":30,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chun-Han Lo","author_inst":"Clinical and Translational Epidemiology Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School.

Severe dysregulated systemic inflammation is the putative mechanism. We hypothesize that early prolonged methylprednisolone (MP) treatment could accelerate disease resolution, decreasing the need for ICU and mortality. Methods We conducted a multicenter, observational study to explore the association between exposure to prolonged, low-dose, MP treatment and need for ICU referral, intubation or death within 28 days (composite primary endpoint) in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Italian respiratory high-dependency units. Secondary outcomes were invasive MV-free days and changes in C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Results Findings are reported as MP (n=83) vs. control (n=90). The composite primary endpoint was met by 19 vs. 40 [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.41; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.24-0.72]. Transfer to ICU and need for invasive MV was necessary in 15 vs. 27 (p=0.07) and 14 vs. 26 (p=0.10), respectively. By day 28, the MP group had fewer deaths (6 vs. 21, adjusted HR=0.29; 95% CI: 0.12-0.73) and more days off invasive MV (24.0 plus-or-minus sign 9.0 vs. 17.5 plus-or-minus sign 12.8; p=0.001). Study treatment was associated with rapid improvement in PaO2:FiO2 and CRP levels. The complication rate was similar for the two groups (p=0.84). Conclusion In patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, early administration of prolonged MP treatment was associated with a significantly lower hazard of death (71%) and decreased ventilator dependence. Randomized controlled studies are needed to confirm these findings.","rel_num_authors":45,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Francesco Salton","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Paola Confalonieri","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Pierachille Santus","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Sergio Harari","author_inst":"Ospedale San Giuseppe, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Raffaele Scala","author_inst":"Ospedale San Donato, Arezzo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Simone Lanini","author_inst":"Istituto Spallanzani, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Valentina Vertui","author_inst":"Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Tiberio Oggionni","author_inst":"Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Antonella Caminati","author_inst":"San Giuseppe Hospital Multimedica, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Vincenzo Patruno","author_inst":"Azienda Sanitaria Universitaria Friuli Centrale, Udine, Italy"},{"author_name":"Mario Tamburrini","author_inst":"Azienda Sanitaria Friuli Occidentale, Pordenone, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Scartabellati","author_inst":"Ospedale Maggiore, Crema, Italy"},{"author_name":"Mara Parati","author_inst":"Ospedale Maggiore di Crema"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Villani","author_inst":"Ospedale Maggiore, Crema, Italy"},{"author_name":"Dejan Radovanovic","author_inst":"Ospedale Sacco, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Sara Tomassetti","author_inst":"University of Florence, Italy"},{"author_name":"Claudia Ravaglia","author_inst":"Ospedale Pierantoni, Forli, Italy"},{"author_name":"Venerino Poletti","author_inst":"Ospedale Pierantoni, Forli, Italy"},{"author_name":"Andrea Vianello","author_inst":"University of Padua, Italy"},{"author_name":"Anna Talia Gaccione","author_inst":"General Hospital, Vittorio Veneto, Italy"},{"author_name":"Luca Guidelli","author_inst":"Ospeadle San Donato, Arezzo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Rita Raccanelli","author_inst":"Ospedale San Giuseppe, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Donato Lacedonia","author_inst":"University of Foggia"},{"author_name":"Paolo Lucernoni","author_inst":"General Hospital, Vittorio Veneto, Italy"},{"author_name":"Maria Pia Foschino Barbaro","author_inst":"University of Foggia"},{"author_name":"Stefano Centanni","author_inst":"Ospedale San Paolo, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Michele Mondoni","author_inst":"Ospedale San Paolo, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Matteo Davi","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Alberto Fantin","author_inst":"Azienda Sanitaria Universitaria Friuli Centrale, Udin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Xueyuan Cao","author_inst":"University of Tennessee, Memphis, USA"},{"author_name":"Lucio Torelli","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Antonella Zucchetto","author_inst":"CRO Aviano"},{"author_name":"Marcella Montico","author_inst":"CRO Aviano"},{"author_name":"Annalisa Casarin","author_inst":"University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield UK"},{"author_name":"Micaela Romagnoli","author_inst":"Hospital of Treviso"},{"author_name":"Stefano Gasparini","author_inst":"University of Ancona"},{"author_name":"Martina Bonifazi","author_inst":"University of Ancona"},{"author_name":"Pierlanfranco D'Agaro","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Marcello","author_inst":"ICGEB"},{"author_name":"Danilo Licastro","author_inst":"Area Science Park, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Barbara Ruaro","author_inst":"University Hospital of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Maria Concetta Volpe","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Reba Umberger","author_inst":"University of Tennessee, Memphis, USA"},{"author_name":"Gianfranco Umberto Meduri","author_inst":"University of Tennessee, Memphis, USA"},{"author_name":"Marco Confalonieri","author_inst":"University of Trieste"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.18.20133645","rel_title":"Clinical Outcomes of Patients with COVID-19 and Chronic Inflammatory and Autoimmune Rheumatic Diseases: A Multicentric Matched-Cohort Study","rel_date":"2020-06-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.18.20133645","rel_abs":"ABSTRACT Background The impact of inflammatory rheumatic diseases on COVID-19 severity is poorly known. Here we compare the outcomes of a cohort of rheumatic patients with a matched control cohort to identify potential risk factors for severe illness. Methods In this comparative cohort study, we identified hospital PCR+ COVID-19 rheumatic patients with chronic inflammatory arthritis (IA) or autoimmune\/immunomediated diseases (AI\/IMID). Non-rheumatic controls were randomly sampled 1:1, and matched by age, sex, and PCR date. The main outcome was severe COVID-19, defined as death, invasive ventilation, ICU admission, or serious complications. We assessed the association between the outcome and potential prognostic variables, adjusted by COVID treatment, using logistic regression. Results The cohorts were composed of 456 rheumatic and non-rheumatic patients, in equal numbers. Mean age was 63 [IQR 53-78] and male sex 41% in both cohorts. Rheumatic diseases were IA (60%) and AI\/IMID (40%). Most patients (74%) had been hospitalised, and the risk of severe COVID was 31.6% in the rheumatic and 28.1% in the non-rheumatic cohort. Ageing, male sex and previous comorbidity (obesity, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular, or lung disease) increased the risk in the rheumatic cohort by bivariate analysis. In logistic regression analysis, independent factors associated with severe COVID were increased age (OR 5.31; CI 3.14-8.95), male sex (2.13; CI 1.35-3.36) and having an AI\/IMID (OR 1.98; CI 1.15-3.41). Conclusion In patients with chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases aging, sex and having an AI\/IMID but not IA nor previous immunosuppressive therapies were associated with severe COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jos\u00e9 L Pablos","author_inst":"Servicio de Reumatologia, Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n Hospital 12 de Octubre (imas12), Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

Some sparse case reports have described various forms of encephalitis in COVID-19 disease, but very few data have focused on clinical presentations, clinical course, response to treatment and outcomes yet. Objective: to describe the clinical phenotype, laboratory and neuroimaging findings of encephalitis associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, their relationship with respiratory function and inflammatory parameters and their clinical course and response to treatment. Design: The ENCOVID multicentre study was carried out in 13 centres in northern Italy between February 20th and May 31st, 2020. Only patients with altered mental status and at least two supportive criteria for encephalitis with full infectious screening, CSF, EEG, MRI data and a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. Clinical presentation and laboratory markers, severity of COVID-19 disease, response to treatment and outcomes were recorded. Results: Out of 45 cases screened, twenty-five cases of encephalitis positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection with full available data were included. The most common symptoms at onset were delirium (68%), aphasia\/dysarthria (24%) and seizures (24%). CSF showed hyperproteinorrachia and\/or pleocytosis in 68% of cases whereas SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR resulted negative. Based on MRI, cases were classified as ADEM (n=3), limbic encephalitis (LE, n=2), encephalitis with normal imaging (n=13) and encephalitis with MRI alterations (n=7). ADEM and LE cases showed a delayed onset compared to the other encephalitis (p=0.001) and were associated with previous more severe COVID-19 respiratory involvement. Patients with MRI alterations exhibited worse response to treatment and final outcomes compared to other encephalitis. Conclusions and relevance: We found a wide clinical spectrum of encephalitis associated with COVID19 infection, underlying different pathophysiological mechanisms. Response to treatment and final outcome strongly depended on specific CNS-manifestations.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrea Pilotto","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Stefano Masciocchi","author_inst":"Neurology Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Irene Volonghi","author_inst":"Neurology Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta del Zotto","author_inst":"Neurology Unit, Poliambulanza Hospital, Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Eugenio Magni","author_inst":"Neurology Unit, Poliambulanza Hospital, Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Valeria De Giuli","author_inst":"Neurology Unit, Istituti Ospedalieri, ASST Cremona, Cremona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesca Caprioli","author_inst":"Neurology Unit, Istituti Ospedalieri, ASST Cremona, Cremona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Nicola Rifino","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, ASST Papa Giovanni XXII, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Maria Sessa","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, ASST Papa Giovanni XXII, Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Michele Gennuso","author_inst":"Neurology Unit, Crema Hospital, Crema, Italy"},{"author_name":"Maria Sofia Cotelli","author_inst":"Neurology Unit, ASST Valcamonica, Esine, Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marinella Turla","author_inst":"Neurology Unit, ASST Valcamonica, Esine, Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Ubaldo Balducci","author_inst":"Neurology Unit, ASST Chiari, Chiari, Italy"},{"author_name":"Sara Mariotto","author_inst":"Neurology Unit, Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, University of Verona, Verona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Sergio Ferrari","author_inst":"Neurology Unit, Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, University of Verona, Verona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alfonso Ciccone","author_inst":"Department of Neurology and Stroke Unit, Carlo Poma Hospital, ASST Mantova, Mantova, Italy"},{"author_name":"Fabrizio Fiacco","author_inst":"Neurology Unit, ASST Bergamo Est, Seriate, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alberto Imarisio","author_inst":"Neurology Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Barbara Risi","author_inst":"Neurology Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alberto Benussi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Foca'","author_inst":"University Division of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, University of Brescia and ASST Spedali Civili Hospital, Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesca Caccuri","author_inst":"Microbiology Unit, Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University"},{"author_name":"Matilde Leonardi","author_inst":"Neurology, Public Health, Disability Unit -

We aimed to develop a high throughput multiplex assay to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 to assess immunity to the virus in the general population. Methods Spike protein subunits S1 and RBD, and Nucleoprotein were coupled to distinct microspheres. Sera collected before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (N=224), and of non-SARS-CoV-2 influenza-like illness (N=184), and laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection (N=115) with various severity of COVID-19 were tested for SARS-CoV-2-specific concentrations of IgG. Results Our assay discriminated SARS-CoV-2-induced antibodies and those induced by other viruses. The assay obtained a specificity between 95.1 and 99.0% with a sensitivity ranging from 83.6-95.7%. By merging the test results for all 3 antigens a specificity of 100% was achieved with a sensitivity of at least 90%. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients developed higher IgG concentrations and the rate of IgG production increased faster compared to non-hospitalized cases. Conclusions The bead-based serological assay for quantitation of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies proved to be robust and can be conducted in many laboratories. Finally, we demonstrated that testing of antibodies against different antigens increases sensitivity and specificity compared to single antigen-specific IgG determination.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gerco den Hartog","author_inst":"National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM)"},{"author_name":"Rutger M Schepp","author_inst":"National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM)"},{"author_name":"Marjan Kuijer","author_inst":"National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM)"},{"author_name":"Corine GeurtsvanKessel","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Josine van Beek","author_inst":"National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM)"},{"author_name":"Nynke Rots","author_inst":"National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM)"},{"author_name":"Marion PG Koopmans","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Fiona RM van der Klis","author_inst":"National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM)"},{"author_name":"Robert S van Binnendijk","author_inst":"National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM)"},{"author_name":"Michele Gennuso","author_inst":"Neurology Unit, Crema Hospital, Crema, Italy"},{"author_name":"Maria Sofia Cotelli","author_inst":"Neurology Unit, ASST Valcamonica, Esine, Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marinella Turla","author_inst":"Neurology Unit, ASST Valcamonica, Esine, Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Ubaldo Balducci","author_inst":"Neurology Unit, ASST Chiari, Chiari, Italy"},{"author_name":"Sara Mariotto","author_inst":"Neurology Unit, Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, University of Verona, Verona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Sergio Ferrari","author_inst":"Neurology Unit, Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, University of Verona, Verona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alfonso Ciccone","author_inst":"Department of Neurology and Stroke Unit, Carlo Poma Hospital, ASST Mantova, Mantova, Italy"},{"author_name":"Fabrizio Fiacco","author_inst":"Neurology Unit, ASST Bergamo Est, Seriate, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alberto Imarisio","author_inst":"Neurology Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Barbara Risi","author_inst":"Neurology Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alberto Benussi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Foca'","author_inst":"University Division of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, University of Brescia and ASST Spedali Civili Hospital, Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesca Caccuri","author_inst":"Microbiology Unit, Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University"},{"author_name":"Matilde Leonardi","author_inst":"Neurology, Public Health, Disability Unit -

However, communities have been unequally affected and evidence is growing that social determinants of health may be exacerbating the pandemic. Furthermore, the impact and timing of social distancing at the community level have yet to be fully explored. We investigated the relative associations between COVID-19 mortality and social distancing, sociodemographic makeup, economic vulnerabilities, and comorbidities in 24 counties surrounding 7 major metropolitan areas in the US using a flexible and robust time series modeling approach. We found that counties with poorer health and less wealth were associated with higher daily mortality rates compared to counties with fewer economic vulnerabilities and fewer pre-existing health conditions. Declines in mobility were associated with up to 15% lower mortality rates relative to pre-social distancing levels of mobility, but effects were lagged between 25-30 days. While we cannot estimate causal impact, this study provides insight into the association of social distancing on community mortality while accounting for key community factors.

The predominant diagnostic test is viral RNA detection by RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs specimens, however the results are not promptly obtainable in all patient care locations. Routine laboratory testing, in contrast, is readily available with a turn-around time (TAT) usually within 1-2 hours. Method: We developed a machine learning model incorporating patient demographic features (age, sex, race) with 27 routine laboratory tests to predict an individual's SARS-CoV-2 infection status. Laboratory test results obtained within two days before the release of SARS-CoV-2-RT-PCR result were used to train a gradient boosted decision tree (GBDT) model from 3,356 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tested patients (1,402 positive and 1,954 negative) evaluated at a metropolitan hospital. Results: The model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.854 (95% CI: 0.829-0.878). Application of this model to an independent patient dataset from a separate hospital resulted in a comparable AUC (0.838), validating the generalization of its use. Moreover, our model predicted initial SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positivity in 66% individuals whose RT-PCR result changed from negative to positive within two days. Conclusion: This model employing routine laboratory test results offers opportunities for early and rapid identification of high-risk SARS-CoV-2 infected patients before their RT-PCR results are available. It may play an important role in assisting the identification of SARS-COV-2 infected patients in areas where RT-PCR testing is not accessible due to financial or supply constraints.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"He Sarina Yang","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA;

Design: Systematic review and network meta-analysis Data Sources: PubMed, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, medRxiv, SSRN, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to June 9th, 2020. Study Selection: Published and unpublished randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and baseline-adjusted observational studies which met our predefined eligibility criteria. Main Outcome Measures: The outcomes of interest were mortality, progression to severe disease (severe pneumonia or admission to intensive care unit (ICU)), time to viral clearance, QT prolongation, fatal cardiac complications, and non-cardiac serious adverse events. The level of evidence behind each outcome was also measured using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. Results: 49 studies with a total of 20212 confounder-adjusted patients were included for analysis. The risk of progression to severe pneumonia or ICU admission was significantly reduced with tocilizumab (GRADE low), anakinra (GRADE very low), and remdesivir (GRADE high) compared to standard care. Tocilizumab was shown to reduce mortality rate for both moderate-severe patients in the non-ICU setting at admission (Odds ratio (OR) 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.54, GRADE low) and critically ill patients in the ICU setting (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.91, GRADE low). High dose IVIG reduced death rate (GRADE low) while corticosteroids increased mortality for critically ill patients (GRADE moderate). Convalescent plasma and hydroxychloroquine were shown to promote viral clearance (OR 11.39, 95% CI 3.91 to 33.18, GRADE low and OR 6.08, 95% CI 2.74 to 13.48, GRADE moderate, respectively) while not altering mortality or progression to the severe courses. The combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin was shown to be associated with increased QT prolongation incidence (OR 1,85, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.26, GRADE low) and fatal cardiac complications in cardiac-impaired populations (OR 2.26, 95% CI 1.26 to 4.05, GRADE low). High-dose (>600mg\/day) hydroxychloroquine monotherapy was significantly associated with increased non-cardiac serious adverse events (GRADE moderate). Conclusion: Anti-inflammatory agents (tocilizumab, anakinra, and IVIG) and remdesivir may safely and effectively improve outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Widely used hydroxychloroquine provides marginal clinical benefit in improving viral clearance rates whilst posing both cardiac and non-cardiac safety risks, especially in the vulnerable population. Only 20% of current evidence on pharmacological management of COVID-19 is on moderate and high evidence certainty; remaining 80% are of low or very low certainty and warrant further studies to establish firm conclusions.

Generally, total antibody bridging assays combine good sensitivity with high selectivity. Therefore, we developed sensitive total antibody bridging assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein (NP), in addition to conventional isotype-specific assays. Antibody kinetics was assessed in PCR-confirmed hospitalized COVID-19 patients (n=41) and three populations of patients with COVID-19 symptoms not requiring hospital admission: PCR-confirmed convalescent plasmapheresis donors (n=182), PCR-confirmed hospital care workers (n=47), and a group of longitudinally sampled symptomatic individuals highly suspect of COVID-19 (n=14). In non-hospitalized patients, the antibody response to RBD is weaker but follows similar kinetics as has been observed in hospitalized patients. Across populations, the RBD bridging assay identified most patients correctly as seropositive. In 11\/14 of the COVID-19-suspect cases, seroconversion in the RBD bridging assay could be demonstrated before day 12; NP antibodies emerged less consistently. Furthermore, we demonstrated the feasibility of finger prick sampling for antibody detection against SARS-CoV-2 using these assays. In conclusion, the developed bridging assays reliably detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients, and are therefore well-suited to conduct seroprevalence

proteases that are essential for viral replication and evasion of host innate immune mechanisms. The papain-like protease PLpro cleaves the viral polyprotein, and reverses inflammatory ubiquitin and anti-viral ubiquitin-like ISG15 protein modifications1,2. Drugs that target SARS-CoV-2 PLpro (hereafter, SARS2 PLpro) may hence be effective as treatments or prophylaxis for COVID-19, reducing viral load and reinstating innate immune responses3. We here characterise SARS2 PLpro in molecular and biochemical detail. SARS2 PLpro cleaves Lys48-linked polyubiquitin and ISG15 modifications with high activity. Structures of PLpro bound to ubiquitin and ISG15 reveal that the S1 ubiquitin binding site is responsible for high ISG15 activity, while the S2 binding site provides Lys48 chain specificity and cleavage efficiency. We further exploit two strategies to target PLpro. A repurposing approach, screening 3727 unique approved drugs and clinical compounds against SARS2 PLpro, identified no compounds that inhibited PLpro consistently or that could be validated in counterscreens. More promisingly, non-covalent small molecule SARS PLpro inhibitors were able to inhibit SARS2 PLpro with high potency and excellent antiviral activity in SARS-CoV-2 infection models.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Theresa Klemm","author_inst":"The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and Department of Medical Biology, University of

of coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)","rel_date":"2020-06-19","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.18.160671","rel_abs":"Human coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses which cause respiratory diseases ranging in severity from the seasonal common cold to SARS and COVID-19. Of the 7 human coronaviruses discovered to date, 3 emergent and severe human coronavirus strains (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) have recently jumped to humans in the last 20 years. The COVID-19 pandemic spawned by the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 has highlighted the importance for development of effective therapeutics to target emerging coronaviruses. Upon entry, the replicase genes of coronaviruses are translated and subsequently proteolytically processed by virus-encoded proteases. Of these proteases, nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5, Mpro, or 3CLpro), mediates the majority of these cleavages and remains a key drug target for therapeutic inhibitors. Efforts to develop nsp5 active-site inhibitors for human coronaviruses have thus far been unsuccessful, establishing the need for identification of other critical and conserved non-active-site regions of the protease. In this study, we describe the identification of an essential, conserved horseshoe-shaped region in the nsp5 interdomain loop (IDL) of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a common coronavirus replication model. Using site-directed mutagenesis and replication studies, we show that several residues comprising this horseshoe-shaped region either fail to tolerate mutagenesis or were associated with viral temperature-sensitivity. Structural modeling and sequence analysis of these sites in other coronaviruses, including all 7 human coronaviruses, suggests that the identified structure and sequence of this horseshoe regions is highly conserved and may represent a new, non-active-site regulatory region of the nsp5 (3CLpro) protease to target with coronavirus inhibitors.\n\nImportanceIn December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in humans and triggered a pandemic which has to date resulted in over 8 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 across more than 180 countries and territories (June 2020). SARS-CoV-2 represents the third emergent coronavirus in the past 20 years and the future emergence of new coronaviruses in humans remains certain. Critically, there remains no vaccine nor established therapeutics to treat cases of COVID-19. The coronavirus nsp5 protease is a conserved and indispensable virus-encoded enzyme which remains a key target for therapeutic design. However, past attempts to target the active site of nsp5 with inhibitors have failed stressing the need to identify new conserved non-active-site targets for therapeutic development. This study describes the discovery of a novel conserved structural region of the nsp5 protease of coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) which may provide a new target for coronavirus drug development.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Benjamin C.

December 2019 in China resulted in over 7.8 million infections and over 430,000 deaths worldwide, imposing an urgent need for rapid development of an efficient and cost-effective vaccine, suitable for mass immunization. Here, we generated a replication competent recombinant VSV-{Delta}G-spike vaccine, in which the glycoprotein of VSV was replaced by the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2. In vitro characterization of the recombinant VSV-{Delta}G-spike indicated expression and presentation of the spike protein on the viral membrane with antigenic similarity to SARS-CoV-2. A golden Syrian hamster in vivo model for COVID-19 was implemented. We show that vaccination of hamsters with recombinant VSV-{Delta}G-spike results in rapid and potent induction of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, single-dose vaccination was able to protect hamsters against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, as demonstrated by the abrogation of body weight loss of the immunized hamsters compared to unvaccinated hamsters. Furthermore, whereas lungs of infected hamsters displayed extensive tissue damage and high viral titers, immunized hamsters lungs showed only minor lung pathology, and no viral load. Taken together, we suggest recombinant VSV-{Delta}G-spike as a safe, efficacious and protective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":36,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yfat Yahalom-Ronen","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Hadas Tamir","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Sharon Melamed","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Boaz Politi","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Ohad Shifman","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Hagit Achdout","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Einat B.

Extending our studies to lung epithelial cells, we found that there are major differences in drug sensitivity and entry pathways used by SARS-CoV-2 in these cells. Entry in lung epithelial Calu-3 cells is pH-independent and requires TMPRSS2, while entry in Vero and Huh7.5 cells requires low pH and triggering by acid-dependent endosomal proteases. Moreover, we found 9 drugs are antiviral in lung cells, 7 of which have been tested in humans, and 3 are FDA approved including Cyclosporine which we found is targeting Cyclophilin rather than Calcineurin for its antiviral activity. These antivirals reveal essential host targets and have the potential for rapid clinical implementation.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mark Dittmar","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Jae Seung Lee","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Kanupriya Whig","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Elisha Segrist","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Minghua Li","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Kellie Jurado","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Kirandeep Samby","author_inst":"Medicines for Malaria Venture"},{"author_name":"Holly Ramage","author_inst":"Thomas Jefferson University"},{"author_name":"David Schultz","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Sara Cherry","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Inbar Cohen-Gihon","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Shlomi Lazar","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Hila Gutman","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Itai Glinert","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Lilach Cherry","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Yaron Vagima","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Shirley Lazar","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Shay Weiss","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Amir Ben-Shmuel","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Roy Avraham","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Reut Puni","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Edith Lupu","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Elad Bar David","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Assa Sittner","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Noam Erez","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Ran Zichel","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Emanuelle Mamroud","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Ohad Mazor","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Haim Levy","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Orly Laskar","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Shmuel Yitzhaki","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Shmuel C.

Among those persons with serious COVID-19 disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common and often fatal presentation. Animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection that manifest severe disease are needed to investigate the pathogenesis of COVID-19 induced ARDS and evaluate therapeutic strategies. Here we report ARDS in two aged African green monkeys (AGMs) infected with SARS-CoV-2 that demonstrated pathological lesions and disease similar to severe COVID-19 in humans. We also report a comparatively mild COVID-19 phenotype characterized by minor clinical, radiographic and histopathologic changes in the two surviving, aged AGMs and four rhesus macaques (RMs) infected with SARS-CoV-2. We found dramatic increases in circulating cytokines in three of four infected, aged AGMs but not in infected RMs. All of the AGMs showed increased levels of plasma IL-6 compared to baseline, a predictive marker and presumptive therapeutic target in humans infected with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Together, our results show that both RM and AGM are capable of modeling SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest that aged AGMs may be useful for modeling severe disease manifestations including ARDS.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robert V Blair","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Monica Vaccari","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Lara A Doyle-Meyers","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Chad J Roy","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Kasi Russell-Lodrigue","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Marissa Fahlberg","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Chris J Monjure","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Brandon Beddingfield","author_inst":"Tulane University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kenneth S Plante","author_inst":"World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses, Institute for Human Infections and Immunity, University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Jessica A Plante","author_inst":"World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses, Institute for Human Infections and Immunity, University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Scott C Weaver","author_inst":"World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses, Institute for Human Infections and Immunity, University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Xuebin Qin","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Cecily C Midkiff","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Gabrielle Lehmicke","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Nadia Golden","author_inst":"Lehmicke"},{"author_name":"Breanna Threeton","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Toni Penney","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Carolina Allers","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Mary B Barnes","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Melissa Pattison","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Prasun K Datta","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J Maness","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Angela Birnbaum","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Rudolf P Bohm","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Jay Rappaport","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Ran Zichel","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Emanuelle Mamroud","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Ohad Mazor","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Haim Levy","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Orly Laskar","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Shmuel Yitzhaki","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Shmuel C.

The viral membrane of SARS-CoV-2 surrounds a helical nucleocapsid in which the viral genome is encapsulated by the nucleocapsid protein. The nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 is produced at high levels within infected cells, enhances the efficiency of viral RNA transcription and is essential for viral replication. Here we show that RNA induces cooperative liquid-liquid phase separation of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. In agreement with its ability to phase separate in vitro, we show that the protein associates in cells with stress granules, cytoplasmic RNA\/protein granules that form through liquid-liquid phase separation and are modulated by viruses to maximize replication efficiency. Liquid-liquid phase separation generates high-density protein\/RNA condensates that recruit the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex of SARS-CoV-2 providing a mechanism for efficient transcription of viral RNA. Inhibition of RNA-induced phase separation of the nucleocapsid protein by small molecules or biologics thus can interfere with a key step in the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adriana Savastano","author_inst":"German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"},{"author_name":"Alain Ibanez-de-Opakua","author_inst":"German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"},{"author_name":"Marija Rankovic","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry"},{"author_name":"Markus Zweckstetter","author_inst":"German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"},{"author_name":"Kasi Russell-Lodrigue","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Marissa Fahlberg","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Chris J Monjure","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Brandon Beddingfield","author_inst":"Tulane University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kenneth S Plante","author_inst":"World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses, Institute for Human Infections and Immunity, University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Jessica A Plante","author_inst":"World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses, Institute for Human Infections and Immunity, University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Scott C Weaver","author_inst":"World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses, Institute for Human Infections and Immunity, University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Xuebin Qin","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Cecily C Midkiff","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Gabrielle Lehmicke","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Nadia Golden","author_inst":"Lehmicke"},{"author_name":"Breanna Threeton","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Toni Penney","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Carolina Allers","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Mary B Barnes","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Melissa Pattison","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Prasun K Datta","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J Maness","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Angela Birnbaum","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Rudolf P Bohm","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Jay Rappaport","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Ran Zichel","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Emanuelle Mamroud","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Ohad Mazor","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Haim Levy","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Orly Laskar","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Shmuel Yitzhaki","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Shmuel C.

Alternative methodologies to PCR and immunodiagnostic that would not require specific reagents are worth to investigate not only for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, but also to detect other emergent pathogenic threats. Here, we propose the use of tandem mass spectrometry to detect SARS-CoV-2 marker peptides in nasopharyngeal swabs. We documented that the signal from the microbiota present in such samples is low and can be overlooked when interpreting shotgun proteomic data acquired on a restricted window of the peptidome landscape. Simili nasopharyngeal swabs spiked with different quantities of purified SARS-CoV-2 viral material were used to develop a nanoLC-MS\/MS acquisition method, which was then successfully applied on COVID-19 clinical samples. We argue that peptides ADETQALPQR and GFYAQGSR from the nucleocapsid protein are of utmost interest as their signal is intense and their elution can be obtained within a 3 min window in the tested conditions. These results pave the way for the development of time-efficient viral diagnostic tests based on mass spectrometry.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Duarte Gouveia","author_inst":"University Paris Saclay, CEA, INRAE"},{"author_name":"Guylaine Miotello","author_inst":"University Paris Saclay, CEA, INRAE"},{"author_name":"Fabrice Gallais","author_inst":"University Paris Saclay, CEA, INRAE"},{"author_name":"Jean-Charles Gaillard","author_inst":"University Paris-Saclay, CEA, INRAE"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Debroas","author_inst":"University Paris-Saclay, CEA, INRAE"},{"author_name":"Laurent Bellanger","author_inst":"University Paris-Saclay, CEA, INRAE"},{"author_name":"Jean-Philippe Lavigne","author_inst":"VBMI, INSERM U1047, Universite de Montpellier, Service de Microbiologie et Hygiene Hospitaliere, CHU Nimes"},{"author_name":"Albert Sotto","author_inst":"VBMI, INSERM U1047, Universite de Montpellier, Service des Maladies Infectieuses et Tropicales, CHU Nimes"},{"author_name":"Lucia Grenga","author_inst":"University Paris-Saclay, CEA, INRAE"},{"author_name":"Olivier Pible","author_inst":"University Paris-Saclay, CEA, INRAE"},{"author_name":"Jean Armengaud","author_inst":"University Paris-Saclay, CEA, INRAE"},{"author_name":"Xuebin Qin","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Cecily C Midkiff","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Gabrielle Lehmicke","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Nadia Golden","author_inst":"Lehmicke"},{"author_name":"Breanna Threeton","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Toni Penney","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Carolina Allers","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Mary B Barnes","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Melissa Pattison","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Prasun K Datta","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J Maness","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Angela Birnbaum","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Rudolf P Bohm","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Jay Rappaport","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Ran Zichel","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Emanuelle Mamroud","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Ohad Mazor","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Haim Levy","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Orly Laskar","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Shmuel Yitzhaki","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Shmuel C.

Recently, ELISA binding cross-reactivity against components of human epidemic coronaviruses with currently available intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) Gamunex-C and Flebogamma DIF (5% and 10%) have been reported. In this study, the same products were tested for neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and their potential as an antiviral therapy.\n\nMethodsThe neutralization capacity of six selected lots of IVIG was assessed against SARS-CoV-2 (two different isolates), SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in cell cultures. Infectivity neutralization was measured by determining the percent reduction in plaque-forming units (PFU) and by cytopathic effects for two IVIG lots in one of the SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Neutralization was quantified using the plaque reduction neutralization test 50 (PRNT50) in the PFU assay and the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) in the cytopathic\/cytotoxic method (calculated as the minus log10 dilution which reduced the viral titer by 50%).\n\nResultsAll IVIG preparations showed neutralization of both SARS-CoV-2 isolates, ranging from 79 to 89.5% with PRNT50 titers from 4.5 to >5 for the PFU method and ranging from 47.0%-64.7% with an IC50 ~1 for the cytopathic method. All IVIG lots produced neutralization of SARS-CoV ranging from 39.5 to 55.1 % and PRNT50 values ranging from 2.0 to 3.3. No IVIG preparation showed significant neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV.\n\nConclusionIn cell culture neutralization assays, the tested IVIG products contain antibodies with significant cross-neutralization capacity against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. However, no neutralization capacity was demonstrated against MERS-CoV. These preparations are currently available and may be immediately useful for COVID-19 management.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda D\u00edez","author_inst":"Immunotherapies Unit, Bioscience Research and Development, Grifols, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Carolina Romero","author_inst":"Immunotherapies Unit, Bioscience Research and Development, Grifols, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"J\u00falia Vergara Alert","author_inst":"IRTA, Centre de Recerca en Sanitat Animal (CReSA, IRTA-UAB), Campus de la Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona (UAB), Bellaterra, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Melissa Bell\u00f3 P\u00e9rez","author_inst":"Laboratorio Coronavirus.
