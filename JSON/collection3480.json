The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is related to SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which have caused the previous outbreaks. The papain-like protease (PLpro) is an attractive drug target due to its essential roles in the viral life cycle. As a cysteine protease, PLpro is rich in cysteines and histidines and their protonation\/deprotonation modulates catalysis and conformational plasticity. Here we report the pKa calculations and assessment of the proton-coupled conformational dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV PLpros using a newly developed GPU-accelerated implicit-solvent continuous constant pH molecular dynamics method with an asynchronous replica-exchange scheme. The calculated pKa\u2019s support the catalytic roles of the Cys-His-Asp triad. We also found that several residues can switch protonation states at physiological pH, among which is C270\/271 located on the flexible blocking loop 2 (BL2) of SARS-CoV-2\/CoV PLpro. Simulations revealed that the BL2 conformational dynamics is coupled to the titration of C271\/270, in agreement with the crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro. Simulations also revealed that BL2 in MERS-CoV PLpro is very flexible, sampling both open and closed states despite the lack of an analogous cysteine. Our work provides a starting point for more detailed mechanistic studies to assist structure-based design of broad-spectrum inhibitors against CoV PLpros.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jack A Henderson","author_inst":"University of Maryland School of Pharmacy"},{"author_name":"Neha Verma","author_inst":"University of Maryland School of Pharmacy"},{"author_name":"Jana Shen","author_inst":"University of Maryland School of Pharmacy"},{"author_name":"Tatjana Weil","author_inst":"Ulm University"},{"author_name":"Ruediger Gross","author_inst":"Ulm University"},{"author_name":"Maximilian Hirschenberger","author_inst":"Ulm University"},{"author_name":"Alina Seidel","author_inst":"Ulm University"},{"author_name":"Susanne Klute","author_inst":"Ulm University"},{"author_name":"caterina Prelli-Bozzo","author_inst":"Ulm University"},{"author_name":"Fabian Zech","author_inst":"Ulm University"},{"author_name":"Nico Preising","author_inst":"Ulm University"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Fois","author_inst":"Ulm University"},{"author_name":"Robin Lochbaum","author_inst":"Ulm University"},{"author_name":"Philip Knaff","author_inst":"MPI Mainz"},{"author_name":"Volker Mailaender","author_inst":"MPI Mainz"},{"author_name":"Ludger Staendker","author_inst":"Ulm University"},{"author_name":"Dietmar Thal","author_inst":"University Ulm"},{"author_name":"Christian Schumann","author_inst":"Clinics Kempten- Allgaeu"},{"author_name":"Steffen Stenger","author_inst":"Ulm University"},{"author_name":"Konstantin Sparrer","author_inst":"Ulm University"},{"author_name":"Alexander Kleger","author_inst":"Ulm University"},{"author_name":"Guenter Lochnit","author_inst":"University Giessen"},{"author_name":"Frank Kirchhoff","author_inst":"Ulm University"},{"author_name":"Manfred Frick","author_inst":"Ulm University"},{"author_name":"Jan Muench","author_inst":"Ulm University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"biophysics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.29.178889","rel_title":"Discovery of Synergistic and Antagonistic Drug Combinations against SARS-CoV-2 In Vitro","rel_date":"2020-07-01","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.29.178889","rel_abs":"COVID-19 is undoubtedly the most impactful viral disease of the current century, afflicting millions worldwide. As yet, there is not an approved vaccine, as well as limited options from existing drugs for treating this disease. We hypothesized that combining drugs with independent mechanisms of action could result in synergy against SARS-CoV-2. Using in silico approaches, we prioritized 73 combinations of 32 drugs with potential activity against SARS-CoV-2 and then tested them in vitro. Overall, we identified 16 synergistic and 8 antagonistic combinations, 4 of which were both synergistic and antagonistic in a dose-dependent manner. Among the 16 synergistic cases, combinations of nitazoxanide with three other compounds (remdesivir, amodiaquine and umifenovir) were the most notable, all exhibiting significant synergy against SARS-CoV-2. The combination of nitazoxanide, an FDA-approved drug, and remdesivir, FDA emergency use authorization for the treatment of COVID-19, demonstrate a strong synergistic interaction. Notably, the combination of remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine demonstrated strong antagonism. Overall, our results emphasize the importance of both drug repurposing and preclinical testing of drug combinations for potential therapeutic use against SARS-CoV-2 infections.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tesia Bobrowski","author_inst":"University of North Carolina"},{"author_name":"Lu Chen","author_inst":"National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences"},{"author_name":"Rich T.

The need for an effective vaccine to curb this pandemic cannot be overemphasized. In view of this, we, therefore, designed a subcomponent antigenic peptide vaccine targeting the N-terminal (NT) and C-terminal (CT) RNA binding domains of nucleocapsid protein that aid in viral replication. Promising antigenic B-cells and T cell epitopes were predicted using computational pipelines. The peptides \u201cRIRGGDGKMKDL\u201d and \u201cAFGRRGPEQTQGNFG\u201d were the B cell linear epitopes with good antigenic index and non-allergenic property. Two CD8+ and Three CD4+ T-cell epitopes were also selected considering their safe immunogenic profiling such as allergenicity, antigen level conservancy, antigenicity, peptide toxicity, and putative restrictions to a number of MHC-I and II alleles. With these selected epitopes, a non-allergenic chimeric peptide vaccine incapable of inducing a Type II hypersensitivity reaction was constructed. The molecular interaction between the toll-like receptor-5 (TLR5) which was triggered by the vaccine was analyzed by molecular docking and scrutinized using dynamics simulation. Finally, in silico cloning was performed to ensure the expression and translation efficiency of the vaccine, utilizing pET-28a vector. This research, therefore, provides a guide for experimental investigation and validation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Onyeka S.

Many complex, highly detailed models have been developed to help policy setters make better decisions. However, the basis of these models is unlikely to be understood by non-experts. We describe the advantages of simple models for covid-19. We say a model is simple if its only parameter is the rate of contact between people in the population. This contact rate can vary over time, depending on choices by policy setters. Such models can be understood by a broad audience, and thus can be helpful in explaining the policy decisions to the public. They can be used to evaluate the outcomes of different policy strategies. However, simple models have a disadvantage when dealing with inhomogeneous populations.To augment the power of a simple model to evaluate complicated situations, we add what we call satellite equations that do not change the original model. For example, with the help of a satellite equation, one could know what his\/her chance is of remaining uninfected through the end of epidemic. Satellite equations can model the effect of the epidemic on high-risk individuals, or death rates, or on nursing homes, and other isolated populations. To compare simple models with complex models, we introduce our slightly complex Model J. We find the conclusions of simple and complex models can be quite similar. But, for each added complexity, a modeler may have to choose additional parameter values describing who will infect whom under what conditions, choices for which there is often little rationale but that can have a big impact on predictions. Our simulations suggest that the added complexity offers little predictive advantage.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sana Jahedi","author_inst":"University of New Brunswick"},{"author_name":"James Yorke","author_inst":"University of Maryland"},{"author_name":"Iroanya O.

There is some data that Vitamin D may have protective effect, so authors decided to analyze European country-wide data to determine if Vitamin D levels are associated with COVID-19 population death rate. Methods: To retrieve the Vitamin D levels data, authors analyzed the Vitamin D European population data compiled by 2019 ECTS Statement on Vitamin D Status published in the European Journal of Endocrinology. For the data set to used for analysis, only recently published data, that included general adult population of both genders ages 40-65 or wider, and must have included the prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency. Results: There were 10 countries data sets that fit the criteria and were analyzed. Severe Vitamin D deficiency was defined as 25(OH)D less than 25 nmol\/L (10 ng\/dL). Pearson correlation analysis between death rate per million from COVID-19 and prevalence of severe Vitamin D deficiency shows a strong correlation with r = 0.76, p = 0.01, indicating significant correlation. Correlation remained significant, even after adjusting for age structure of the population. Additionally, over time, correlation strengthened, and r coefficient asymptoticaly increased. Conclusions: Authors recommend universal screening for Vitamin D deficiency, and further investigation of Vitamin D supplementation in randomized control studies, which may lead to possible treatment or prevention of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Isaac Z Pugach","author_inst":"Complete Med Care"},{"author_name":"Sofya Pugach","author_inst":"Complete Med Care"},{"author_name":"Iroanya O.

There is limited empirical research that examines the impact of these orders. We aimed to rapidly ascertain whether social distancing; difficulty with daily activities (obtaining food, essential medications and childcare); and levels of concern regarding COVID-19 changed after the March 16, 2020 announcement of shelter-in-place orders for seven counties in the San Francisco Bay Area. Methods: We conducted an online, cross-sectional social media survey from March 14 - April 1, 2020. We measured changes in social distancing behavior; experienced difficulties with daily activities (i.e., access to healthcare, childcare, obtaining essential food and medications); and level of concern regarding COVID-19 after the March 16 shelter-in-place announcement in the San Francisco Bay Area and elsewhere in the U.S. Results: The percentage of respondents social distancing all of the time increased following the shelter-in-place announcement in the Bay Area (9.2%, 95% CI: 6.6, 11.9) and elsewhere in the U.S. (3.4%, 95% CI: 2.0, 5.0).

Concomitantly, COVID-19 patients exhibit a state of hypercoagulability that can affect circuit lifespan. An optimal anticoagulation strategy is therefore needed in order to maintain circuit patency and therapeutic efficiency of RRT. Methods Retrospective single-centre cohort study on 71 critically ill COVID-19 patients at the University of Freiburg Medical Center. Included were all patients aged 18 years and older with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection that were admitted to ICU between February 26 and May 21, 2020. We collected data on the COVID-19 disease course, AKI, RRT, thromboembolic events and anticoagulation. Primary outcome of the study was the effect of different anticoagulation strategies during RRT on extracorporeal circuit lifespans. Results Anticoagulation during continuous veno-venous haemodialysis (CVVHD) was performed with unfractionated heparin (UFH) or citrate. Mean treatment time in the UFH group was 21.3h (SEM: {+\/-}5.6h). Mean treatment time in the citrate group was 45.6h (SEM: {+\/-}2.7h). Citrate anticoagulation prolonged treatment duration significantly by 24.4h (p=0.0014). Anticoagulation during sustained low-efficiency daily dialysis (SLEDD) was performed with UFH, argatroban or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). Mean dialysis time with UFH was 8.1h (SEM: {+\/-}1.3h), argatroban 8.0h (SEM: {+\/-}0.9h) and LMWH 11.8h (SEM: {+\/-}0.5h). Compared to UFH and argatroban, LMWH significantly prolonged treatment times by 3.7h (p=0.0082) and 3.8h (p=0.0024), respectively. Conclusions UFH fails to prevent early clotting events in dialysis circuits. For patients, who do not require an effective systemic anticoagulation, regional citrate dialysis is the most effective strategy in our cohort. For patients, who require an effective systemic anticoagulation treatment, the usage of LMWH results in the longest circuit life spans.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Frederic Arnold","author_inst":"Department of Medicine IV: Nephrology and Primary Care, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Lukas Westermann","author_inst":"Department of Medicine IV: Nephrology and Primary Care, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Siegbert Rieg","author_inst":"Department of Medicine II: Division of Infectious Diseases, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germ"},{"author_name":"Elke Neumann-Haefelin","author_inst":"Department of Medicine IV: Nephrology and Primary Care, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Paul Biever","author_inst":"Department of Medicine III: Interdisciplinary Medical Intensive Care, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Frei"},{"author_name":"Gerd Walz","author_inst":"Department of Medicine IV: Nephrology and Primary Care, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Johannes Kalbhenn","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Yakup Tanriver","author_inst":"Department of Medicine IV: Nephrology and Primary Care, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Obi C.

We utilize the quasi-experimental setting created by the nationwide protests precipitated by George Floyd's tragic death on May 25, 2020, to assess the causal impact of social distancing on the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Our sample period spans from January 22, 2020, to June 20, 2020, and consists of 474,422 county-days representing 3,142 counties from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. To assess the change in COVID-19 case counts following the protests, we employ a differences in differences estimation strategy in a multivariate setting, in which we control for social distancing restrictions and social mobility across counties. We also control for covariates that may influence COVID-19 transmission, and implement placebo tests using a Monte Carlo simulation. Findings: We document a country wide increase of over 3.06 cases per day, per 100,000 population, following the onset of the protests (95%CI: 2.47-3.65), and a further increase of 1.73 cases per day, per 100,000 population, in the counties in which the protests took place (95%CI: 0.59- 2.87). Relative to the week preceding the onset of the protests, this represents a 61.2% country wide increase in COVID-19 cases, and a further 34.6% increase in the protest counties. Interpretation: Our study documents a significant increase in COVID-19 case counts in counties that experienced a protest, and we conclude that social distancing practices causally impact the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The observed effect cannot be explained by changes in social distancing restrictions and social mobility, and placebo tests rule out the possibility that this finding is attributable to chance.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Louis Gagnon","author_inst":"Smith School of Business, Queen's University"},{"author_name":"Jessica Lloyd","author_inst":"Royal College of Surgeons In Ireland"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Gagnon","author_inst":"Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland"},{"author_name":"Elke Neumann-Haefelin","author_inst":"Department of Medicine IV: Nephrology and Primary Care, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Paul Biever","author_inst":"Department of Medicine III: Interdisciplinary Medical Intensive Care, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Frei"},{"author_name":"Gerd Walz","author_inst":"Department of Medicine IV: Nephrology and Primary Care, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Johannes Kalbhenn","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Yakup Tanriver","author_inst":"Department of Medicine IV: Nephrology and Primary Care, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Obi C.

In particular, identifying high risk population subgroups aids policymakers and health officials in combatting the epidemic. This has been challenging during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, because governmental agencies typically release aggregate COVID-19 data as marginal summary statistics of patient demographics. These data may identify disparities in COVID-19 outcomes between broad population subgroups, but do not provide comparisons between more granular population subgroups defined by combinations of multiple demographics. We introduce a method that overcomes the limitations of aggregated summary statistics and yields estimates of COVID-19 infection and case fatality rates --- key quantities for guiding public policy related to the control and prevention of COVID-19 --- for population subgroups across combinations of demographic characteristics. Our approach uses pseudo-likelihood based logistic regression to combine aggregate COVID-19 case and fatality data with population-level demographic survey data to estimate infection and case fatality rates for population subgroups across combinations of demographic characteristics. We illustrate our method on California COVID-19 data to estimate test-based infection and case fatality rates for population subgroups defined by gender, age, and race and ethnicity. Our analysis indicates that in California, males have higher test-based infection rates and test-based case fatality rates across age and race\/ethnicity groups, with the gender gap widening with increasing age. Although elderly infected with COVID-19 are at an elevated risk of mortality, the test-based infection rates do not increase monotonically with age. LatinX and African Americans have higher test-based infection rates than other race\/ethnicity groups. The subgroups with the highest 5 test-based case fatality rates are African American male, Multi-race male, Asian male, African American female, and American Indian or Alaska Native male, indicating that African Americans are an especially vulnerable California subpopulation.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Di Xiong","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Lu Zhang","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Gregory L.

These measures are imposed in order to reduce the spread of the disease and to lift the pressure on healthcare systems. Estimating the impact of such interventions as well as monitoring the gradual relaxing of these stringent measures is quintessential to understand how resurgence of the COVID-19 epidemic can be controlled for in the future. In this paper we use a stochastic age-structured discrete time compartmental model to describe the transmission of COVID-19 in Belgium. Our model explicitly accounts for age-structure by integrating data on social contacts to (i) assess the impact of the lockdown as implemented on March 13, 2020 on the number of new hospitalizations in Belgium; (ii) conduct a scenario analysis estimating the impact of possible exit strategies on potential future COVID-19 waves. More specifically, the aforementioned model is fitted to hospital admission data, data on the daily number of COVID-19 deaths and serial serological survey data informing the (sero)prevalence of the disease in the population while relying on a Bayesian MCMC approach. Our age-structured stochastic model describes the observed outbreak data well, both in terms of hospitalizations as well as COVID-19 related deaths in the Belgian population. Despite an extensive exploration of various projections for the future course of the epidemic, based on the impact of adherence to measures of physical distancing and a potential increase in contacts as a result of the relaxation of the stringent lockdown measures, a lot of uncertainty remains about the evolution of the epidemic in the next months.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Steven Abrams","author_inst":"Data Science Institute, Interuniversity Institute for Biostatistics and statistical Bioinformatics (I-BioStat), UHasselt & Global Health Institute (GHI), Depart"},{"author_name":"James Wambua","author_inst":"Data Science Institute, Interuniversity Institute for Biostatistics and statistical Bioinformatics (I-BioStat), UHasselt"},{"author_name":"Eva Santermans","author_inst":"Data Science Institute, Interuniversity Institute for Biostatistics and statistical Bioinformatics (I-BioStat), UHasselt"},{"author_name":"Lander Willem","author_inst":"Centre for Health Economic Research and Modelling Infectious Diseases, Vaccine & Infectious Disease Institute, University of Antwerp"},{"author_name":"Elise Kuylen","author_inst":"Centre for Health Economic Research and Modelling Infectious Diseases, Vaccine & Infectious Disease Institute, University of Antwerp"},{"author_name":"Pietro Coletti","author_inst":"Data Science Institute, Interuniversity Institute of Biostatistics and statistical Bioinformatics (I-BioStat), UHasselt"},{"author_name":"Pieter Libin","author_inst":"Data Science Institute, Interuniversity Institute of Biostatistics and statistical Bioinformatics (I-BioStat), UHasselt"},{"author_name":"Christel Faes","author_inst":"Data Science Institute, Interuniversity Institute of Biostatistics and statistical Bioinformatics (I-BioStat), UHasselt"},{"author_name":"Oana Petrof","author_inst":"Data Science Institute, Interuniversity Institute of Biostatistics and statistical Bioinformatics (I-BioStat), UHasselt"},{"author_name":"Sereina A.

However, a surge in diagnostic testing quickly resulted in worldwide competition for the same sample preparation and real-time RT-PCR diagnostic reagents (rRT-PCR). Consequently, Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, UK sought to diversify their diagnostic portfolio by exploring alternative amplification chemistries including those that permit direct testing without RNA extraction. This study describes the validation of a SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP assay, which is an isothermal, autocycling, strand displacement nucleic acid amplification technique which can be performed on extracted RNA (RNA RT-LAMP) or directly from swab (Direct RT-LAMP). Analytical specificity (ASp) of this new RT-LAMP assay was 100% and analytical sensitivity (ASe) was between 1x101 and 1x102 copies when using a synthetic DNA target. The overall diagnostic sensitivity (DSe) and specificity (DSp) of RNA RT LAMP was 97% and 99% respectively, relative to the standard of care (SoC) rRT-PCR. When a CT cut-off of 33 was employed, above which increasingly, evidence suggests there is a very low risk of patients shedding infectious virus, the diagnostic sensitivity was 100%. The DSe and DSp of Direct-RT LAMP was 67% and 97%, respectively. When setting CT cut-offs of [&le;]33 and [&le;]25, the DSe increased to 75% and 100%, respectively. Time from swab-to-result for a strong positive sample (CT &lt 25) was &lt 15 minutes. We propose that RNA RT-LAMP could replace rRT-PCR where there is a need for increase in throughput, whereas Direct RT-LAMP could be used as a screening tool for triaging patients into appropriate hospitals wards, at GP surgeries and in care homes, or for population screening to identify highly contagious individuals (super shedders). Direct RT-LAMP could also be used during times of high prevalence to save critical extraction and rRT-PCR reagents by screening out those strong positives from diagnostic pipelines.","rel_num_authors":30,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Veronica L Fowler","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Bryony Armson","author_inst":"School of Biosciences and Medicine, University of Surrey"},{"author_name":"Jose L Gonzales","author_inst":"Wageningen Bioveterinary Research (WBVR)"},{"author_name":"Emma L Wise","author_inst":"School of Biosciences and Medicine, University of Surrey"},{"author_name":"Emma L.

The loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay has proven to be a reliable and simple protocol that can detect small amounts of viral RNA in patient samples (<10 genomes per L) (Nagamine, Hase, and Notomi 2002) Recently, Rabe and Cepko at Harvard published a sensitive and simple protocol for COVID-19 RNA detection in saliva using an optimized LAMP assay (Rabe and Cepko, 2020). This LAMP protocol has the benefits of being simple, requiring no specialized equipment; rapid, requiring less than an hour from sample collection to readout; and cheap, costing around $1 per reaction using commercial reagents. The pH based colorimetric readout also leaves little ambiguity and is intuitive. However, a shortfall in many nucleic acid-based methods for detection in saliva samples has been the variability in output due to the presence of inhibitory substances in saliva. Centrifugation to separate the reaction inhibitors from inactivated sample was shown to be an effective way to ensure reliable LAMP amplification. However, a centrifuge capable of safely achieving the necessary speeds of 2000 RPM for several minutes often costs hundreds of dollars and requires a power supply. We present here an open hardware solution- Handyfuge - that can be assembled with readily available components for the cost of <5 dollars a unit and could be used together with the LAMP assay for point of care detection of COVID-19 RNA from saliva. The device is then validated using the LAMP protocol from Rabe and Cepko. With the use of insulated coolers for reagent supply chain and delivery, the assay presented can be completed without the need for electricity or any laboratory scale infrastructure.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ethan Li","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Adam Larson","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Anestha Kothari","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Manu Prakash","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Emma L.

Methods: A retrospective cohort study took place, and data from 740 subjects, from all 32 states of Mexico, were analyzed. The association between the studied factors and severe (dyspnea requiring hospital admission) COVID-19 was evaluated through risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Severe illness was documented in 28% of participants. In multiple analysis, male gender (RR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.06 - 1.20), advanced age ([reference: 15 - 29 years old] 30 - 44, RR = 1.02, 95% CI 0.94 - 1.11; 45 - 59, RR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.15 - 1.38; 60 years or older, RR = 1.44, 95% CI 1.29 - 1.60), chronic kidney disease (RR = 1.31, 95% CI 1.04 - 1.64) and thoracic pain (RR = 1.16, 95% CI 1.10 - 1.24) were associated with an increased risk of severe disease. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating predictors of COVID-19 severity in a large subset of the Latin-American population. It is also the first in documenting gender-related differences regarding the severity of the illness. These results may be useful for health care protocols for the early detection and management of COVID-19 patients that may benefit from opportune and specialized supportive medical treatment.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Efren Murillo-Zamora","author_inst":"Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social"},{"author_name":"Xochitl Trujillo","author_inst":"Universidad de Colima"},{"author_name":"Miguel Huerta","author_inst":"Universidad de Colima"},{"author_name":"Monica Rios-Silva","author_inst":"Universidad de Colima"},{"author_name":"Oliver Mendoza-Cano","author_inst":"Universidad de Colima"},{"author_name":"Zoe Vincent-Mistiaen","author_inst":"Gibraltar Health Authority"},{"author_name":"Sarah Fouch","author_inst":"School of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of Portsmouth"},{"author_name":"Connor J Maltby","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Seden Grippon","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Simon Munro","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Lisa Jones","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Tom Holmes","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Claire Tillyer","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Joanne Elwell","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Amy Sowood","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Helio Santos","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Oliver de Peyer","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Sophie Dixon","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Thomas Hatcher","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Suvetha Sivanesan","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Helen Knight","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Shailen Laxman","author_inst":"OptiSense Limited"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Walsh","author_inst":"GeneSys Biotech Limited"},{"author_name":"Michael Andreou","author_inst":"OptiSense Limited"},{"author_name":"Nick Morant","author_inst":"GeneSys Biotech Limited"},{"author_name":"Duncan Clark","author_inst":"GeneSys Biotech Limited"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Houghton","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Nathan Moore","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Cortes","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Stephen P Kidd","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Jessica Olsen","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Amin Oomatia","author_inst":"The Royal Free Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nicola O'Reilly","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Anett Rideg","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Ok-Ryul Song","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Amy Strange","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Charles Swanton","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute; University College London; University College London Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Samra Turajlic","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute; The Royal Marsden Hospital"},{"author_name":"Philip A.

Many countries have closed their borders with China and performed obligate protective procedures, however, this disease was still rising worldwide. In this report, we aim to identify transmission patterns from China to other countries, along with describing the disease control situation of countries. Methods: We retrospectively collected information about infected cases with COVID-19 from WHO situation reports, official notification websites of health ministries and reliable local newspapers from each country. Descriptive and cluster analysis was performed to describe the transmission characteristics while the logistic regression test was used to estimate the risk factors for the occurrence of an infected individual with an unknown source. Results: A total of 446 infected cases were recorded from 24 countries outside China until 12 February 2020, with the number of reported infected cases were doubled every 3.08 days (range from 2.6 to 3.9). Besides the spread from China, the transmission was originated from sub-endemic countries (Japan, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, France, German). Out of 6 countries got occurrence of an infected individual with unknown source and possible potential factors contributed to this occurrence was a time of epidemic circulating, number of patients and number of clusters when the occurrence still has not happened, and notably, the unreported situation of Chinese tourists information. Conclusions: The situational reports of each country about COVID-19 should be more detailed mentioning the transmissions routes with keeping contact tracing of the unknown cases to increase the control of this disease.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Minh-Duc Nguyen-Tran","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Medicine and Pharmacy at Ho Chi Minh City, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Ali Ahmed-Fouad Abozaid","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University, Cairo 11843, Egypt"},{"author_name":"Luu Lam Thang Tai","author_inst":"Department of Emergency, City childrens hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, 700000, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Le Huu Nhat Minh","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Medicine and Pharmacy at Ho Chi Minh City, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Quang-Loc Le","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Medicine and Pharmacy at Ho Chi Minh City, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Hoang-Dung Nguyen","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Medicine and Pharmacy at Ho Chi Minh City, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Khanh-Linh Dao","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, Haiphong University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Hai Phong City , Vietnam."},{"author_name":"Huu-Hoai Le","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Medicine and Pharmacy at Ho Chi Minh City, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Nguyen Tien Huy","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical Medicine, Nagasaki University"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Kwan","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Christina Price","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Charles Dela Cruz","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Halene","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"David van Dijk","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"John Hwa","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Alfred I Lee","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Hyung J Chun","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Sophie Dixon","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Thomas Hatcher","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Suvetha Sivanesan","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Helen Knight","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Shailen Laxman","author_inst":"OptiSense Limited"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Walsh","author_inst":"GeneSys Biotech Limited"},{"author_name":"Michael Andreou","author_inst":"OptiSense Limited"},{"author_name":"Nick Morant","author_inst":"GeneSys Biotech Limited"},{"author_name":"Duncan Clark","author_inst":"GeneSys Biotech Limited"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Houghton","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Nathan Moore","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Cortes","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Stephen P Kidd","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Jessica Olsen","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Amin Oomatia","author_inst":"The Royal Free Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nicola O'Reilly","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Anett Rideg","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Ok-Ryul Song","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Amy Strange","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Charles Swanton","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute; University College London; University College London Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Samra Turajlic","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute; The Royal Marsden Hospital"},{"author_name":"Philip A.

Methods We developed a dynamic COVID-19 microsimulation model to evaluate clinical and economic outcomes and cost-effectiveness of epidemic control strategies in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Interventions assessed were Healthcare Testing (HT), where diagnostic testing is performed only for those presenting to healthcare centres; Contact Tracing (CT) in households of cases; Isolation Centres (IC), for cases not requiring hospitalisation; community health worker-led Mass Symptom Screening and molecular testing for symptomatic individuals (MS); and Quarantine Centres (QC), for household contacts who test negative. Given uncertainties about epidemic dynamics in South Africa, we evaluated two main epidemic scenarios over 360 days, with effective reproduction numbers (Re) of 1.5 and 1.2. We compared HT, HT+CT, HT+CT+IC, HT+CT+IC+MS, HT+CT+IC+QC, and HT+CT+IC+MS+QC, considering strategies with incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) <US$3,250\/year-of-life saved (YLS) cost-effective. In sensitivity analyses, we varied Re, molecular testing sensitivity, and efficacies and costs of interventions. Findings With Re 1.5, HT resulted in the most COVID-19 deaths over 360 days. Compared with HT, HT+CT+IC+MS+QC reduced mortality by 94%, increased costs by 33%, and was cost-effective (ICER $340\/YLS). In settings where quarantine centres cannot be implemented, HT+CT+IC+MS was cost-effective compared with HT (ICER $590\/YLS). With Re 1.2, HT+CT+IC+QC was the least costly strategy, and no other strategy was cost-effective. HT+CT+IC+MS+QC was cost-effective in many sensitivity analyses; notable exceptions were when Re was 2.6 and when efficacies of ICs and QCs for transmission reduction were reduced. Interpretation In South Africa, strategies involving household contact tracing, isolation, mass symptom screening, and quarantining household contacts who test negative would substantially reduce COVID-19 mortality and be cost-effective. The optimal combination of interventions depends on epidemic growth characteristics and practical implementation considerations.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Krishna P Reddy","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fatma M Shebl","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Julia H A Foote","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guy Harling","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Justine A Scott","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christopher Panella","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kieran P Fitzmaurice","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Clare Flanagan","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Emily P Hyle","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Anne M Neilan","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Amir M Mohareb","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Linda-Gail Bekker","author_inst":"Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation, University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Richard J Lessells","author_inst":"University of KwaZulu-Natal"},{"author_name":"Andrea L Ciaranello","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Robin Wood","author_inst":"Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation, University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Elena Losina","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kenneth A Freedberg","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Pooyan Kazemian","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mark J Siedner","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Suvetha Sivanesan","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Helen Knight","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Shailen Laxman","author_inst":"OptiSense Limited"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Walsh","author_inst":"GeneSys Biotech Limited"},{"author_name":"Michael Andreou","author_inst":"OptiSense Limited"},{"author_name":"Nick Morant","author_inst":"GeneSys Biotech Limited"},{"author_name":"Duncan Clark","author_inst":"GeneSys Biotech Limited"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Houghton","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Nathan Moore","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Cortes","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Stephen P Kidd","author_inst":"Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Jessica Olsen","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Amin Oomatia","author_inst":"The Royal Free Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nicola O'Reilly","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Anett Rideg","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Ok-Ryul Song","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Amy Strange","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Charles Swanton","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute; University College London; University College London Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Samra Turajlic","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute; The Royal Marsden Hospital"},{"author_name":"Philip A.

Among several other effects this pandemic has wreaked havoc on the psychology and cognition of people across the globe. In this paper we attempted to find out the impact of lockdown and social isolation on the cognition and emotion of young healthy adults with high education (n=43) by means of a questionnaire sent through email. We found that more than 50% of the participants had some kind of emotional or cognitive (dysexecutive) symptoms, as calculated through emotional symptom index (ESI) and cognitive symptom index (CSI). The correlation between cognitive and emotional symptoms was also found to be moderately strong (0.59). Although it is a pilot study and larger samples are required to draw firm conclusion, the results argue in favor of a negative impact on the cognition and emotion of healthy educated young people caused by the COVID-19 related lockdown. It can be conjectured that, if taking an older sample with a lower education, emotional and cognitive changes would be more evident.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Durjoy Lahiri","author_inst":"Bangur Institute of Neurosciences, IPGME&R, Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Souvik Dubey","author_inst":"Bangur Institute of Neurosciences, IPGME&R, Kolkata, India"},{"author_name":"Alfredo Ardila","author_inst":"I.M.

Suggestive relationships between respiratory issues and COVID-19-related ICU admission and mortality were observed, while circulatory system diseases showed stronger association in NHAA patients. We were able to replicate some known comorbidities related to COVID-19 outcomes while discovering potentially unknown associations, such as endocrine\/metabolic conditions related to hospitalization and mental disorders related to mortality, for future validation.

We report the available safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity data from an ongoing placebo-controlled, observer-blinded dose escalation study among healthy adults, 18-55 years of age, randomized to receive 2 doses, separated by 21 days, of 10 g, 30 g, or 100 g of BNT162b1, a lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified, mRNA vaccine that encodes trimerized SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein RBD. Local reactions and systemic events were dose-dependent, generally mild to moderate, and transient. RBD-binding IgG concentrations and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers in sera increased with dose level and after a second dose. Geometric mean neutralizing titers reached 1.8- to 2.8-fold that of a panel of COVID-19 convalescent human sera. These results support further evaluation of this mRNA vaccine candidate.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mark J.

The use of reliable and comparable PCR assays is a cornerstone to allow use of different PCR assays depending on the local equipment. In this work, we provide a comparison of the Cobas(R) (Roche) and the RealStar(R) assay (Altona).\n\nMethodsAssessment of the two assays was performed prospectively in three reference Parisians hospitals, using 170 clinical samples. They were tested with the Cobas(R) assay, selected to obtain a distribution of cycle threshold (Ct) as large as possible, and tested with the RealStar assay with three largely available extraction platforms: QIAsymphony (Qiagen), MagNAPure (Roche) and NucliSENS-easyMag (BioMerieux).\n\nResultsOverall, the agreement (positive for at least one gene) was 76%. This rate differed considerably depending on the Cobas Ct values for gene E: below 35 (n = 91), the concordance was 99%. Regarding the positive Ct values, linear regression analysis showed a determination correlation (R2) of 0.88 and the Deming regression line revealed a strong correlation with a slope of 1.023 and an intercept of -3.9. Bland-Altman analysis showed that the mean difference (Cobas(R) minus RealStar(R)) was + 3.3 Ct, with a SD of + 2.3 Ct.\n\nConclusionsIn this comparison, both RealStar(R) and Cobas(R) assays provided comparable qualitative results and a high correlation when both tests were positive. Discrepancies exist after 35 Ct and varied depending on the extraction system used for the RealStar(R) assay, probably due to a low viral load close to the detection limit of both assays.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marie-Laure Chaix","author_inst":"Universit\u00e9 de Paris"},{"author_name":"Marc Wirden","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universit\u00e9s, UPMC Univ Paris 06-UMR_S 1136, Pierre Louis Institute of Epidemiology and Public Health, F-75005, Paris, France INSERM-UMR_S 1136, Pierre "},{"author_name":"Linda Feghoul","author_inst":"APHP Hospital Saint Louis"},{"author_name":"M\u00e9lanie Bertine","author_inst":"IAME"},{"author_name":"Marie-Laure N\u00e9r\u00e9","author_inst":"Laboratoire de Virologie, H\u00f4pital Saint-Louis, AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Quentin Le Hingrat","author_inst":"IAME, UMR 1137, INSERM, Universit\u00e9 Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9, AP-HP, Laboratoire de Virologie, H\u00f4pital Bichat, AP-HP, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"David Boutolleau","author_inst":"Groupe Hospitalier Pitie-Salpetriere"},{"author_name":"Constance Delaugerre","author_inst":"Laboratoire de Virologie, H\u00f4pital Saint-Louis, AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Anne-Genevi\u00e8ve Marcelin","author_inst":"Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital, INSERM U 943 and Pierre et Marie Curie University"},{"author_name":"Diane Descamps","author_inst":"Hopital Bichat Claude Bernard"},{"author_name":"Jerome LeGoff","author_inst":"Paris Diderot University and APHP - H\u00f4pital Saint-Louis"},{"author_name":"Benoit Visseaux","author_inst":"Hopital Bichat Claude Bernard - APHP - IAME, UMR 1137, INSERM, Universit\u00e9 Paris Diderot"},{"author_name":"Warren Kalina","author_inst":"Pfizer, Inc.

In addition to the lack of availability, the current methods do not always fully inactivate the virus. Together, this calls for the development of safer methods for extraction and detection of viral RNA from patient samples that utilise readily available reagents and equipment present in most standard laboratories. We present a rapid and straightforward RNA extraction protocol for inactivating the SARS-CoV-2 virus that uses standard lab reagents. This protocol expands analysis capacity as the inactivated samples can be used in RT-qPCR detection tests at laboratories not otherwise classified for viral work. The method circumvents the need for commercial RNA purification kits, takes about 30 minutes from swab to PCR-ready viral RNA, and enables downstream detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR with very high sensitivity (~4 viral RNA copies per RT-qPCR). In summary, we present a rapid, safe and sensitive method for high-throughput detection of SARS-CoV-2, that can be conducted in any laboratory equipped with a qPCR machine.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lelde Kalnina","author_inst":"Rigshospitalet (The National University Hospital)"},{"author_name":"\u00c0ngels Mateu-Regu\u00e9","author_inst":"Rigshospitalet (The National University Hospital)"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Oerum","author_inst":"CNRS\/Universit\u00e9 Paris Diderot"},{"author_name":"Annemette Hald","author_inst":"Rigshospitalet (The National University Hospital)"},{"author_name":"Jan Gerstoft","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet"},{"author_name":"Henrik Oerum","author_inst":"CIVI Biopharma Inc.,"},{"author_name":"Finn Cilius Nielsen","author_inst":"Rigshospitalet (The National University Hospital)"},{"author_name":"Astrid K.N.

Favipiravir is a broad-spectrum oral antiviral agent that shows in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. Presently, data on the effectiveness and optimal dosage of favipiravir for treating COVID-19 is limited. Methods. We conducted a retrospective observational study of hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 at five tertiary care hospitals in Thailand. We reviewed patient charts to obtain all necessary data. Results. Among 247 COVID-19 patients, 63 (23.0%) received [&ge;]1 dose of favipiravir. Of these, 27.0% required an O2-nasal cannula, 9.5% required non-invasive ventilation and\/or high-flow O2-therapy, and 6.4% required invasive mechanical ventilation and\/or ECMO. The median baseline NEWS2 score was 5(0-16). The Day-7 clinical improvement rate [95%CI] was 66.7%[53.7-78.0%] in all patients, 92.5%[75.7%-99.1%] in patients who did not require O2-supplementation, and 47.2%[0.4%-64.5%] in patients who required O2-supplementation. No life-threatening adverse events were identified. The 28-day mortality rate was 4.8%. Multivariate analysis revealed three poor prognostic factors for Day-7 clinical improvement [odds ratio (95%CI); p-value]: older age [0.94 (0.89 to 0.99); p=0.04], higher baseline NEWS2 score [0.64 (0.47 to 0.88); p=0.006], and lower favipiravir loading dose ([&le;]45 mg\/kg\/day) [0.04 (0.005 to 0.4); p=0.006]. Conclusions. Our study reports the promising effectiveness of favipiravir for treating COVID-19 patients. In addition to older age and a high baseline NEWS2 score, a low loading dose of favipiravir ([&ge;]45 mg\/kg\/day) was also identified as a poor prognostic factor for early clinical improvement. Further studies to explore the optimal dose and the optimal timing of drug initiation for favipiravir should be performed.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pinyo Rattanaumpawan","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University"},{"author_name":"Supunnee Jirajariyavej","author_inst":"Taksin Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kanokorn Lerdlamyong","author_inst":"Vachira Phuket Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nattawan Palavutitotai","author_inst":"Lerdsin Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jatuporn Saiyarin","author_inst":"Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Henrik Oerum","author_inst":"CIVI Biopharma Inc.,"},{"author_name":"Finn Cilius Nielsen","author_inst":"Rigshospitalet (The National University Hospital)"},{"author_name":"Astrid K.N.

Several reports indicate short lasting immunity against endemic coronaviruses, which contrasts repeated reports that biobanked venous blood contains SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells even before the outbreak in Wuhan. This suggests there exists a preformed T cell memory in individuals not exposed to the pandemic virus. Given the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to other members of the Coronaviridae family, the endemic coronaviruses appear likely candidates to generate this T cell memory. However, given the apparent poor immunological memory created by the endemic coronaviruses, other immunity against other common pathogens might offer an alternative explanation. Here, we utilize a combination of epitope prediction and similarity to common human pathogens to identify potential sources of the SARS-CoV-2 T cell memory. We find that no common human virus, other than beta-coronaviruses, can explain the pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in uninfected individuals. Our study suggests OC43 and HKU1 are the most likely pathogens giving rise to SARS-CoV-2 preformed immunity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ulrik Stervbo","author_inst":"Marien Hospital Herne - Universitatsklinikum der Ruhr-Universitat Bochum"},{"author_name":"Sven Rahmann","author_inst":"University of Duisburg-Essen"},{"author_name":"Toralf Roch","author_inst":"Marien Hospital Herne - Universitatsklinikum der Ruhr-Universitat Bochum"},{"author_name":"Timm Henning Westhoff","author_inst":"Marien Hospital Herne - Universitatsklinikum der Ruhr-Universitat Bochum"},{"author_name":"Nina Babel","author_inst":"Marien Hospital Herne - Universitatsklinikum der Ruhr-Universitat Bochum"},{"author_name":"Michael J Mina","author_inst":"Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Finn Cilius Nielsen","author_inst":"Rigshospitalet (The National University Hospital)"},{"author_name":"Astrid K.N.

We were able to detect all canonical sub-genomic RNAs at expected abundances, with the exception of ORF10, suggesting that this is not a functional ORF. A number of recurrent non-canonical sub-genomic RNAs are detected. We show that the results are reproducible using technical replicates and determine the optimum number of reads for sub-genomic RNA analysis. Finally variants found in genomic RNA are transmitted to sub-genomic RNAs with high fidelity in most cases. This tool can be applied to tens of thousands of sequences worldwide to provide the most comprehensive analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sub-genomic RNA to date.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matthew Daniel Parker","author_inst":"Sheffield Bioinformatics Core, Neuroscience Institute, The University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK"},{"author_name":"Benjamin B Lindsey","author_inst":"The Florey Institute, Department of Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, Medical School, University of Sheffield.

Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2) was identified as the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. As a carboxypeptidase, ACE2 cleaves many biological substrates besides Ang II to control vasodilatation and permeability. Given the nanomolar high affinity between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, we wonder how this interaction would affect the enzymatic activity of ACE2. Surprisingly, SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein increased ACE2 proteolytic activity ~3-10 fold when fluorogenic caspase-1 substrate and Bradykinin-analog peptides were used to characterize ACE2 activity. In addition, the enhancement was mediated by ACE2 binding of RBD domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike. These results highlighted the altered activity of ACE2 during SARS-CoV-2 infection and would shed new lights on the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and its complications for better treatments.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jinghua Lu","author_inst":"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Peter D.

Enormous sequencing depth can be necessary to compile sufficient information for identification of a certain pathogen. Generic HTS combining with in-solution capture enrichment can markedly increase the sensitivity for virus detection in complex diagnostic samples.\n\nMethodsA virus panel based on the principle of biotinylated RNA-baits was developed for specific capture enrichment of epizootic and zoonotic viruses (VirBaits). The VirBaits set was supplemented by a SARS-CoV-2 predesigned bait set for testing recent SARS-CoV-2 positive samples. Libraries generated from complex samples were sequenced via generic HTS and afterwards enriched with the VirBaits set. For validation, an internal proficiency test for emerging epizootic and zoonotic viruses (African swine fever virus, Ebolavirus, Marburgvirus, Nipah henipavirus, Rift Valley fever virus) was conducted.\n\nResultsThe VirBaits set consists of 177,471 RNA-baits (80-mer) based on about 18,800 complete viral genomes targeting 35 epizootic and zoonotic viruses. In all tested samples, viruses with both DNA and RNA genomes were clearly enriched ranging from about 10-fold to 10,000-fold for viruses including distantly related viruses with at least 72% overall identity to viruses represented in the bait set. Viruses showing a lower overall identity (38% and 46%) to them were not enriched but could nonetheless be detected based on capturing conserved genome regions. The internal proficiency test supports the improved virus detection using the combination of HTS plus targeted enrichment but also point to the risk of carryover between samples.\n\nConclusionsThe VirBaits approach showed a high diagnostic performance, also for distantly related viruses. The bait set is modular and expandable according to the favored diagnostics, health sector or research question. The risk of carryover needs to be taken into consideration. The application of the RNA-baits principle turned out to be user-friendly, and even non-experts (without sophisticated bioinformatics skills) can easily use the VirBait workflow. The rapid extension of the established VirBaits set adapted to actual outbreak events is possible without any problems as shown for SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Claudia Wylezich","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Sten Calvelage","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Kore Schlottau","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Ute Ziegler","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Anne Pohlmann","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Dirk Hoeper","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Martin Beer","author_inst":"Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut"},{"author_name":"Luke R Green","author_inst":"The Florey Institute, Department of Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, Medical School, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK"},{"author_name":"Paul Parsons","author_inst":"Department of Animal and Plant Sciences, Alfred Denny Building, The University of Sheffield, S10 2TN"},{"author_name":"Rachel M Tucker","author_inst":"Department of Animal and Plant Sciences, Alfred Denny Building, The University of Sheffield, S10 2TN"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Brown","author_inst":"The Florey Institute, Department of Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, Medical School, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK."},{"author_name":"Danielle Groves","author_inst":"The Florey Institute, Department of Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, Medical School, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK."},{"author_name":"Katie Johnson","author_inst":"Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Department of Virology\/Microbiology, Sheffield, UK."},{"author_name":"Laura Carrilero","author_inst":"Department of Animal and Plant Sciences, Alfred Denny Building, The University of Sheffield, S10 2TN"},{"author_name":"Joe Heffer","author_inst":"IT Services, The University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK"},{"author_name":"David Partridge","author_inst":"Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Department of Virology\/Microbiology, The Florey Institute, Department of Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascul"},{"author_name":"Cariad Evans","author_inst":"Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Department of Virology\/Microbiology, Sheffield, UK."},{"author_name":"Mohammad Razza","author_inst":"Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Department of Virology\/Microbiology, Sheffield, UK."},{"author_name":"Alexanda J Keeley","author_inst":"Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Department of Virology\/Microbiology, The Florey Institute, Department of Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascul"},{"author_name":"Nikki Smith","author_inst":"The Florey Institute, Department of Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, Medical School, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK."},{"author_name":"Dennis Wang","author_inst":"Sheffield Bioinformatics Core, Department of Computer Science, The University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK."},{"author_name":"Simon Mallal","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA"},{"author_name":"Thushan I de Silva","author_inst":"The Florey Institute, Department of Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, Medical School, University of Sheffield, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Fo"},{"author_name":"Ugur Sahin","author_inst":"BioNTech, Mainz, Germany"},{"author_name":"Kathrin U.
