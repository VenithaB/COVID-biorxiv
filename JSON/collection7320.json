The aim of this work is to estimate and predict the true number of COVID-19 (detected and undetected) infections in India for short to medium forecast horizons. In particular, using publicly available COVID-19 infection data up to 28th April 2020, we forecast the true number of infections in India till the end of lockdown (3rd May) and five days beyond (8th May). Methods: The high death rate observed in most COVID-19 hit countries is suspected to be a function of the undetected infections existing in the population. An estimate of the age weighted infection fatality rate (IFR) of the disease of 0.41%, specifically calculated by taking into account the age structure of Indian population, is already available in the literature. In addition, the recorded case fatality rate (CFR= 1%) of Kerala, the first state in India to successfully flatten the curve by consistently reporting single digit new infections from 12-20 April, is used as a second estimate of the IFR. These estimates are used to formulate a relationship between deaths recorded and the true number of infections and recoveries. The estimated undetected and detected cases time series based on these two IFR estimates are then used to fit a discrete time multivariate infection model to predict the total infections at the end of the formal lockdown period. Results: Over three consecutive fortnight periods during the lockdown, it was noted that the rise in detected infections has decreased by 8.2 times. For an IFR of 0.41%, the rise in undetected infections decreased 2.5 times, while for the higher IFR value of 1%, undetected cases decreased by 2.4 times. The predicted number of total infections in India on 3rd May for both IFRs varied from 2.8 - 6.8 lakhs. Interpretation and Conclusions: The behaviour of the undetected cases over time effectively illustrates the effects of lockdown and increased testing. From our estimates, it is found that the lockdown has brought down the undetected to detected cases ratio, and has consequently dampened the increase in the number of total cases. However, even though the rate of rise in total infections has fallen, the lifting of the lockdown should be done keeping in mind that 2.3 to 6.4 lakhs undetected cases will already exist in the population by 3rd May.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Siuli Mukhopadhyay","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"},{"author_name":"Debraj Chakraborty","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"},{"author_name":"Antonello Maruotti","author_inst":"Dipartimento di Giurisprudenza, Economia, Politica e Lingue Moderne Libera Universita Ss Maria Assunta"},{"author_name":"Heinz Holling","author_inst":"Department of Methods and Statistics, Faculty of Psychology and Sports University of Muenster.

We implement an SEIR model to compute the infected population and number of casualties of this epidemic. The example may ideally regard the situation in the Italian Region of Lombardy, where the epidemic started on February 25, but by no means attempts to perform a rigorous case study in view of the lack of suitable data and uncertainty of the different parameters, namely, the variation of the degree of home isolation and social distancing as a function of time, the number of initially exposed individuals and infected people, the incubation and infection periods and the fatality rate. First, we perform an analysis of the results of the model, by varying the parameters and initial conditions (in order the epidemic to start, there should be at least one exposed or one infected human). Then, we consider the Lombardy case and calibrate the model with the number of dead individuals to date (April 28, 2020) and constraint the parameters on the basis of values reported in the literature. The peak occurs at day 37 (April 1) approximately, when there is a rapid decrease, with a reproduction ratio R0 = 3 initially, 1.36 at day 22 and 0.78 after day 35, indicating different degrees of lockdown. The predicted death toll is almost 15000 casualties, with 2.4 million infected individuals at the end of the epidemic. The incubation period providing a better fit of the dead individuals is 4.25 days and the infection period is 4 days, with a fatality rate of 0.00144\/day [values based on the reported (official) number of casualties]. The infection fatality rate (IFR) is 0.57 %, and 2.36 % if twice the reported number of casualties is assumed. However, these rates depend on the initially exposed individuals. If approximately nine times more individuals are exposed, there are three times more infected people at the end of the epidemic and IFR = 0.47 %. If we relax these constraints and use a wider range of lower and upper bounds for the incubation and infection periods, we observe that a higher incubation period (13 versus 4.25 days) gives the same IFR (0.6 versus 0.57 %), but nine times more exposed individuals in the first case. Therefore, a precise determination of the fatality rate is subject to the knowledge of the characteristics of the epidemic. We plan to perform again these calculations and publish a short note when the epidemic is over and the complete and precise data is available. Besides the specific example, the analysis proposed in this work shows how isolation measures, social distancing and knowledge of the diffusion conditions help us to understand the dynamics of the epidemic. Hence, the importance to quantify the process to verify the effectiveness of the isolation.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jose' M Carcione","author_inst":"OGS - https:\/\/www.inogs.it\/it\/users\/jos%C3%A9-maria-carcione"},{"author_name":"Shyamapada Mandal","author_inst":"Laboratory of Microbiology and Experimental Medicine, Department of Zoology, University of Gour Banga, Malda-732103, India"},{"author_name":"Audrey Duval","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Niccolo Buetti","author_inst":"Inserm"},{"author_name":"Pascal Crepey","author_inst":"EHESP"},{"author_name":"Didier Guillemot","author_inst":"Paris-Saclay University , Inserm, Institut Pasteur, AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Rodolphe Thiebaut","author_inst":"University of Bordeaux, Inria"},{"author_name":"Philippe Vanhems","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Jean-Ralph Zahar","author_inst":"AP-HP, Inserm"},{"author_name":"David RM Smith","author_inst":"Paris-Saclay University, Institut Pasteur, Cnam"},{"author_name":"Lulla Opatowski","author_inst":"Paris Saclay university, Inserm, Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Modelling COVID-19 in hospitals REACTinG AVIESAN working group","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.19.20071548","rel_title":"Current Understanding of COVID-19 Clinical Course and Investigational Treatments","rel_date":"2020-04-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.19.20071548","rel_abs":"Importance: Currently, there is no unified framework linking disease progression to established viral levels, clinical tests, inflammatory markers, and investigational treatment options. Objective: It may take many weeks or months to establish a standard treatment approach. Given the growing morbidity and mortality with respect to COVID-19, we present a treatment approach based on a thorough review of scholarly articles and clinical reports. Our focus is on staged progression, clinical algorithms, and individualized treatment. Evidence Review: We followed the protocol for a quality review article proposed by Heyn et. al.1 A literature search was conducted to find all relevant studies related to COVID-19. The search was conducted between April 1, 2020 and April 13, 2020 using the following electronic databases: PubMed (1809 to present), Google Scholar (1900 to present), MEDLINE (1946 to present), CINAHL (1937 to present), and Embase (1980 to present). Keywords used included COVID-19, 2019-nCov, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, with terms such as efficacy, seroconversion, microbiology, pathophysiology, viral levels, inflammation, survivability, and treatment and pharmacology. No language restriction was placed on the search. Reference lists were manually scanned for additional studies. Findings: Of the articles found in the literature search, 70 were selected for inclusion in this study (67 cited in the body of the manuscript and 3 additional unique references in the Figures). The articles represent work from China, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, Rwanda, Israel, France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada, and the United States. Most of the articles were cohort or case studies, but we also drew upon information found in guidelines from hospitals and clinics instructing their staff on procedures to follow. In addition, we based some decisions on data collected by agencies such as the CDC, FDA, IHME, ISDA, and Worldometer. None of the case studies or cohort studies used a large number of participants. The largest group of participants numbered less than 500 and some case studies had fewer than 30 patients. However, the review of the literature revealed the need for individualized treatment protocols due to the variability of patient clinical presentation and survivability. A number of factors appear to influence mortality: the stage at which the patient first presented for care, pre-existing health conditions, age, and the viral load the patient carried. Conclusion and Relevance: COVID-19 can be divided into three distinct Stages, beginning at the time of infection (Stage I), sometimes progressing to pulmonary involvement (Stage II, with or without hypoxemia) and less frequently to systemic inflammation (Stage III). In addition to modeling the stages of disease progression, we have also created a treatment algorithm which considers age, comorbidities, clinical presentation, and disease progression to suggest drug classes or treatment modalities. This paper presents the first evidence-based recommendations for individualized treatment for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Richard B Aguilar","author_inst":"Cano Health"},{"author_name":"Patrick Hardigan","author_inst":"Nova Southeastern University"},{"author_name":"Bindu Mayi","author_inst":"Nova Southeastern University"},{"author_name":"Darby Sider","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Florida"},{"author_name":"Jared Piotrkowski","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Florida"},{"author_name":"Jinesh Mehta","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Florida"},{"author_name":"Jenankan Dev","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Florida"},{"author_name":"Yelenis Seijo","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Florida"},{"author_name":"Antonio Lewis Camargo","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Florida"},{"author_name":"Luis Andux","author_inst":"Cano Health"},{"author_name":"Kathleen Hagen","author_inst":"Nova Southeastern University"},{"author_name":"Marlow B Hernandez","author_inst":"Cano Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.17.20070276","rel_title":"Early epidemiological and clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in Japan","rel_date":"2020-04-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.17.20070276","rel_abs":"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses -2 (SARS-COV2) named as COVID-19 had spread worldwide and leading to 1,210,956 confirmed cases and 67,594 deaths Methods: A data of 1192 confirmed cases and 43 deaths due to COVID-19 in Japan collected from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan and analysed for different epidemiological parameters and their clinical manifestations. We used Clauset-Newman-Moore (CNM) clustering algorithm to develop web-network of confirmed cases to identified clusters of community transmission. Results: Out of 1192 confirmed cases, 90.60% were symptomatic and 9.39% were asymptomatic. The prevalence of COVID19 in males was 56.29% and 43.20 % in females. The mean interval (SD) from symptom onset to diagnosis was 6-22.6 days while mean interval (SD) from contact to onset of symptoms was 5-19.5 days. People of age range 40-79 were more infected and deaths median age was 80. The main symptoms were fever, dry cough, fatigue and pneumonia. The main infected cities were Tokyo (195\/1192, 16.35%), Hokkaido (160\/1192 13.42%), Aichi (150\/1192, 12.58%) and Osaka (145\/1192, 12.16%). Only 2.34% cases had travel history from Wuhan China and Osaka music concert was identify as main cluster for community transmission. While 556 (46.64%) cases were clinically diagnosed and 557 (46.72%) were confirmed by using RT-PCR. Conclusions: Other than, declare emergency Japan need to change their approach of diagnosing COVID-19, as asymptomatic cases prevalence is high and maybe it is reason for current sudden increase of cases. Screening centre should be establish away from hospitals, which are treating positive cases.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Muhammad Qasim","author_inst":"University of Otago"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Yasir","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science, University Of Otago, Dunedin, PO Box 56, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand"},{"author_name":"Waqas Ahmad","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science, University Of Otago, Dunedin, PO Box 56, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand"},{"author_name":"Minami Yoshida","author_inst":"Centre for Bioengineering & Nanomedicine (Dunedin), Department of Food Science, Division of Sciences.

In search for key targets of effective therapeutics, robust animal models mimicking COVID-19 in humans are urgently needed. Here, we show that productive SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lungs of mice is limited and restricted by early type I interferon responses. In contrast, we show that Syrian hamsters are highly permissive to SARS- CoV-2 and develop bronchopneumonia and a strong inflammatory response in the lungs with neutrophil infiltration and edema. Moreover, we identify an exuberant innate immune response as a key player in pathogenesis, in which STAT2 signaling plays a dual role, driving severe lung injury on the one hand, yet restricting systemic virus dissemination on the other. Finally, we assess SARS-CoV- 2-induced lung pathology in hamsters by micro-CT alike used in clinical practice. Our results reveal the importance of STAT2-dependent interferon responses in the pathogenesis and virus control during SARS-CoV-2 infection and may help rationalizing new strategies for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":51,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robbert Boudewijns","author_inst":"KU Leuven Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Rega Institute, Laboratory of Virology and Chemotherapy, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Hendrik Jan Thibaut","author_inst":"KU Leuven Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Rega Institute, Laboratory of Virology and Chemotherapy, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Suzanne J.F.

a serious threat to global public health, and imposes severe burdens on the entire human society. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) can cause severe respiratory illness and death. Currently, there are no specific antiviral drugs that can treat COVID-19. Several vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are being actively developed by research groups around the world. The surface S (spike) protein and the highly expressed internal N (nucleocapsid) protein of SARS-CoV-2 are widely considered as promising candidates for vaccines. In order to guide the design of an effective vaccine, we need experimental data on these potential epitope candidates. In this study, we mapped the immunodominant (ID) sites of S protein using sera samples collected from recently discharged COVID-19 patients. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein-specific antibody levels in the sera of recovered COVID-19 patients were strongly correlated with the neutralising antibody titres. We used epitope mapping to determine the landscape of ID sites of S protein, which identified nine linearized B cell ID sites. Four out of the nine ID sites were found in the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Further analysis showed that these ID sites are potential high-affinity SARS-CoV-2 antibody binding sites. Peptides containing two out of the nine sites were tested as vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 in a mouse model. We detected epitope-specific antibodies and SARS-CoV-2-neutralising activity in the immunised mice. This study for the first time provides human serological data for the design of vaccines against COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bao-zhong

consequential societal changes are likely to have major health consequences way beyond those caused by the virus infection. One of the medical fields that may experience significant consequences of the pandemic is that of psychiatry. Importantly, individuals who already live with mental disorders may be particularly vulnerable to the psychological stress associated with the pandemic. However, data on how the COVID-19 pandemic affects this group of people is largely absent from the literature. Here, we report data from a quality development project conducted at the psychiatric services of the Central Denmark Region (CDR), which has a catchment area of approximately 1.3 million people covered by five psychiatric hospitals providing inpatient and outpatient treatment of all types of mental disorders. Based on a manual screening of all clinical notes from the period from February 1st to March 23rd 2020 that contained at least one of the following words: corona, COVID, virus, epidemic, pandemic, and contaminate\/contamination (including compound words), we found 1357 notes from 918 adult patients that described pandemic-related psychopathology (symptoms that appeared to be caused\/deteriorated by the pandemic and\/or its societal consequences). To our knowledge, this is the first investigation of COVID-19 pandemic-related psychopathology from a large psychiatric treatment setting. The results clearly suggest that this phenomenon exists among individuals with mental illness. However, as the data from this investigation stems from standard clinical practice where the patients were not systematically assessed for pandemic-related psychopathology, we cannot speak to its overall prevalence. Nevertheless, we believe that our findings underline the necessity of taking urgent action to mitigate the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with mental disorders. A low-cost intervention would be to simply discuss the ongoing pandemic and its societal consequences with patients seeking care in psychiatric settings - as this may lead to relief of pandemic-related symptoms via general comforting, and clarification of misunderstandings\/false beliefs regarding the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christopher

for the developing countries. Considering the widely spread COVID-19, it is of great benefit to develop an automated and accurate system for quantification of COVID-19 associated lung abnormalities using thick-section chest CT images. Purpose: To develop a fully automated AI system to quantitatively assess the disease severity and disease progression using thick-section chest CT images. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, a deep learning based system was developed to automatically segment and quantify the COVID-19 infected lung regions on thick-section chest CT images. 531 thick-section CT scans from 204 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were collected from one appointed COVID-19 hospital from 23 January 2020 to 12 February 2020. The lung abnormalities were first segmented by a deep learning model. To assess the disease severity (non-severe or severe) and the progression, two imaging bio-markers were automatically computed, i.e., the portion of infection (POI) and the average infection HU (iHU). The performance of lung abnormality segmentation was examined using Dice coefficient, while the assessment of disease severity and the disease progression were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the Cohen's kappa statistic, respectively. Results: Dice coefficient between the segmentation of the AI system and the manual delineations of two experienced radiologists for the COVID-19 infected lung abnormalities were 0.74 {+\/-} 0.28 and 0.76 {+\/-} 0.29, respectively, which were close to the inter-observer agreement, i.e., 0.79 {+\/-} 0.25. The computed two imaging bio-markers can distinguish between the severe and non-severe stages with an AUC of 0.9680 (p-value < 0.001). Very good agreement ({kappa} = 0.8220) between the AI system and the radiologists were achieved on evaluating the changes of infection volumes. Conclusions: A deep learning based AI system built on the thick-section CT imaging can accurately quantify the COVID-19 associated lung abnormalities, assess the disease severity and its progressions.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhang Li","author_inst":"College of Aerospace Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha,

is challenging governments, health systems and the scientific community worldwide. A central question in the COVID-19 pandemic is whether climatic factors modulate its progression. This information is key to epidemiologists and healthcare decision-makers for improving their management plans. Previous attempts to assess the impact of climatic parameters have yielded ambiguous results, either because they were using geographically or temporally restricted data, or because they were comparing infection rates across countries, which were measured differently depending on local screening strategies. In March 2020, the spread of COVID-19 dramatically increased the number of countries recording deaths, providing an opportunity to use mortality rate, which is measured more homogeneously across countries than infection rates, as a descriptor of the COVID-19 outbreak over a large latitudinal range. Here, using data recorded in 208 territories from 88 countries, we show that mortality rate is negatively influenced by warmer air temperature and positively affected by higher relative humidity. Each additional Celsius degree decreases mortality rate by ~4%, while a 1% increase in relative humidity raises mortality rate by ~2%. Temperature is positively correlated with UV-index, for which one unit of increase results in a ~15% decrease in the mortality rate. We also show that other factors contribute to the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak, such as the proportion of vulnerable age classes in the population, access to a non-overwhelmed health system, as well as governmental travel restrictions for controlling the spread of the disease. All of them are critical factors impacting the mortality rate of COVID-19. The influence of climatic factors is a warning to all southern hemisphere countries where winter is coming soon. Northern hemisphere countries should also be warned that climatic factors alone will likely not be sufficient to contain the disease.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Claudio S.

caused significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, with particularly severe outcomes in healthcare institutions and congregate settings. To mitigate spread, healthcare systems have been cohorting patients to limit contacts between uninfected patients and potentially infected patients or healthcare workers (HCWs). A major challenge in managing the pandemic is the presence of currently asymptomatic individuals capable of transmitting the virus, who could introduce COVID-19 into uninfected cohorts. The optimal combination of personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing approaches to prevent these events is unclear, especially in light of ongoing limitations in access to both. Methods Using stochastic simulations with an SEIR model we quantified and compared the impacts of PPE use, patient and HCWs testing, and cohorting. Findings In the base case without testing or PPE, the healthcare system was rapidly overwhelmed, and became a net contributor to the force of infection. We found that effective use of PPE by both HCWs and patients could prevent this scenario, while random testing of apparently asymptomatic individuals on a weekly basis was less effective. We also found that even imperfect use of PPE could provide substantial protection by decreasing the force of infection, and that creation of smaller patient\/HCW subcohorts can provide additional resilience to outbreak development. Interpretation These findings reinforce the importance of ensuring adequate PPE supplies even in the absence of testing, and provide support for strict subcohorting regimens to reduce outbreak potential in healthcare institutions.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joel C Miller","author_inst":"School of Engineering at Mathematical Sciences, La Trobe University, Bundoora, VIC"},{"author_name":"Xueting Qiu","author_inst":"Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics, Department of Epidemiology, T.H.

anticipating local surge in healthcare needs. Methods: We developed a mechanistic transmission model to simulate a range of scenarios of COVID-19 spread in the Greater Toronto Area. We estimated healthcare needs against 2019 daily admissions using healthcare administrative data, and applied outputs to hospital-specific data on catchment, capacity, and baseline non-COVID admissions to estimate potential surge by day 90 at two hospitals (St. Michaels Hospital [SMH] and St. Josephs Health Centre [SJHC]). We examined fast\/large, default, and slow\/small epidemics, wherein the default scenario (R0 2.4) resembled the early trajectory in the GTA. Results: Without further interventions, even a slow\/small epidemic exceeded the citys daily ICU capacity for patients without COVID-19. In a pessimistic default scenario, for SMH and SJHC to remain below their non-ICU bed capacity, they would need to reduce non-COVID inpatient care by 70% and 58% respectively. SMH would need to create 86 new ICU beds, while SJHC would need to reduce its ICU beds for non-COVID care by 72%. Uncertainty in local epidemiological features was more influential than uncertainty in clinical severity. If physical distancing reduces contacts by 20%, maximizing the diagnostic capacity or syndromic diagnoses at the community-level could avoid a surge at each hospital. Interpretation: As distribution of the citys surge varies across hospitals over time, efforts are needed to plan and redistribute ICU care to where demand is expected. Hospital-level surge is based on community-level transmission, with community-level strategies key to mitigating each hospitals surge.

SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 exploring the effects of policy choices in three domains: social distancing, hospital triaging, and testing. We distinguished between high-risk and low-risk members of the population, and modeled differences in social interactions due to context, risk level, infection status, and testing status. The model incorporates many of the currently important characteristics of the disease, including overcapacity in the healthcare system and uncertainties surrounding the proportion and transmission potential of asymptomatic cases. We compared current policy guidelines from public health agencies with alternative options, and investigated the effects of policy decisions on the overall proportion of COVID-19-related deaths. Our results support current policies to contain the outbreak but also suggest possible refinements, including emphasizing the need to reduce public, random contacts more than private contacts, and testing low-risk symptomatic individuals before high-risk symptomatic individuals. Our model furthermore points to interactions among the three policy domains; the efficacy of a particular policy choice depends on other implemented policies. Finally, our results provide an explanation for why societies like Germany, with lower average rates of social contact, are more successful at containing the outbreak than highly social societies such as Italy, despite the implementation of similar policy measures.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Audrey McCombs","author_inst":"Iowa State University"},{"author_name":"Claus

enterprises have been continually faced with anticipating the spread of COVID-19 and the effects it is having on visits, admissions, bed needs, and crucial supplies. While many studies have focused on understanding the basic epidemiology of the disease, few open source tools have been made available to aid hospitals in their planning. We developed a web-based application (available at: http:\/\/covid19forecast.rush.edu\/) for US states and territories that allows users to choose from a suite of models already employed in characterizing the spread of COVID-19. Users can obtain forecasts for hospital visits and admissions as well as anticipated needs for ICU and non-ICU beds, ventilators, and personal protective equipment supplies. Users can also customize a large set of inputs, view the variability in forecasts over time, and download forecast data. We describe our web application and its models in detail and provide recommendations and caveats for its use. Our application is primarily designed for hospital leaders, healthcare workers, and government official who may lack specialized knowledge in epidemiology and modeling. However, specialists can also use our open source code as a platform for modification and deeper study. As the dynamics of COVID-19 change, our application will also change to meet emerging needs of the healthcare community.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kenneth J

It is an infectious disease which is caused by newly discovered coronavirus. Our study demonstrates with a nonlinear model of this devastating COVID-19 which narrates transmission from human-to-human in the society. Pontryagin Maximum principle has also been applied in order to obtain optimal control strategies where the maintenance of social distancing is the major control. The target of this study is to find out the most fruitful control measures of averting coronavirus infection and eventually, curtailed of the COVID-19 transmission among people. The model is investigated analytically by using most familiar necessary conditions of Pontryagin maximum principle. Furthermore, numerical simulations have been performed to illustrate the analytical results. The analysis reveals that implementation of educational campaign, social distancing and developing human immune system are the major factors which can be able to plunge the scenario of becoming infected.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Md.

Here, we estimate the probable onset date of the community spread of SARS-CoV-2 from the cumulative number of deaths reported during the early stage of the epidemic in Western Europe and the Americas. Our results support that SARS-CoV-2 probably started to spread locally in all western countries analyzed between the middle of January and early February 2020, thus long before community transmission was officially recognized and control measures were implemented.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Edson Delatorre","author_inst":"Departamento de Biologia.

evolution. A previous analysis was based on the assumption that the number of nasopharyngeal swabs would be constant. However the number of daily swabs is now more than five times what it was when we did our previous analysis. Therefore, here we consider the time evolution of the ratio of the new daily cases to number of swabs, which is more representative of the evolution of the pandemic when the number of swabs is increasing or changing in time. We consider a number of possible distributions representing the evolution of the pandemic in Italy and we test their prediction capability over a period of up to four weeks. The results show that a distribution of the type of Planck black body radiation law provides very good forecasting. The use of different distributions provides an independent possible estimate of the uncertainty. We then consider five possible trajectories for the number of daily swabs and we estimate the potential dates of a substantial reduction in the number of new daily cases. We then estimate the spread in a substantial reduction, below a certain threshold, of the daily cases per swab among the Italian regions. We finally perform Monte Carlo simulations with 25000 runs to evaluate a random uncertainty in the prediction of the date of a substantial reduction in the number of diagnosed daily cases per swab.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ignazio Ciufolini","author_inst":"University of Salento"},{"author_name":"Antonio Paolozzi","author_inst":"Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"Tiago Graf","author_inst":"Instituto Goncalo Moniz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Salvador, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Gonzalo Bello","author_inst":"Laboratorio de AIDS e Imunologia Molecular, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"M.

In this paper we present the initial results of the @CoronaSurveys project. The objective of this project is the collection and publication of data concerning the number of people that show symptoms compatible with COVID-19 in different countries using open anonymous surveys. While this data may be biased, we conjecture that it is still useful to estimate the number of infected persons with the COVID-19 virus at a given point in time in these countries, and the evolution of this number over time.

an unprecedented amount of published scientific articles. Objective: To assess the characteristics of articles published during the first 3 months of the COVID-19 pandemic and to compare it with articles published during 2009 H1N1 swine influenza pandemic. Data sources: Articles on COVID-19 and on H1N1 swine influenza indexed in PubMed (Medline) during the first 3 months of these pandemics. Study selection: Any article published in the respective study periods that included any terminology related to COVID-19 or H1N1 in the title, abstract or full-text was eligible for inclusion. Articles that did not present an English abstract, as well as correspondence to previous research and erratum were excluded. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two operators conducted the selection of articles and data extraction procedures independently. The article is reported following STROBE guidelines for observational studies. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalence of primary and secondary articles. Prevalence of reporting of limitations in the abstracts. Results: Of the 2482 articles retrieved, 1165 were included. Approximately half of them were secondary articles (575, 49.4%). Common primary articles were: human medical research (340, 59.1%), in silico studies (182, 31.7%) and in vitro studies (26, 4.5%). Of the human medical research, the vast majority were observational studies and cases series, followed by single case reports and one randomized controlled trial. Secondary articles were mainly reviews, viewpoints and editorials (373, 63.2%). The second largest category was guidelines or guidance articles, including 193 articles (32.7%), of which 169 were indications for specific departments, patients or procedures. Limitations were reported in 42 out of 1165 abstracts (3.6%), with 10 abstracts reporting actual methodological limitations. In a similar timeframe in 2009 there were 223 articles published on the H1N1 pandemic. As compared to that pandemic, during COVID-19 there were higher chances to publish reviews and guidance articles and lower chances to publish in vitro and animal research studies. Conclusions and Relevance: As compared to the most recent pandemic, there is an overwhelming amount of information published on COVID-19. However, the majority of the articles published do not add significant information, possibly diluting the original information published. Also, only a negligible number of published articles reports limitations in the abstracts, hindering a rapid interpretation of their shortcomings.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicola Di Girolamo","author_inst":"Oklahoma State University"},{"author_name":"Reint Meursinge Reynders","author_inst":"University of Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Antonio Fernandez Anta","author_inst":"IMDEA Networks Institute"},{"author_name":"Davide Frey","author_inst":"Inria Rennes, France"},{"author_name":"Augusto Garcia-Agundez","author_inst":"TU Darmstadt, Germany"},{"author_name":"Chryssis Georgiou","author_inst":"U.

causes COVID-19 is largely driven by human behavior and person-to-person contact. By staying home, people reduce the probability of contacting an infectious individual, becoming infected, and passing on the virus. One of the most promising sources of data on time use is smartphone location data. We develop a time use driven proportional mixing SEIR model that naturally incorporates time spent at home measured using smartphone location data and allows people of different health statuses to behave differently. We simulate epidemics in almost every county in the United States. The model suggests that Americans' behavioral shifts have reduced cases in 55%-86% of counties and for 71%-91% of the population, depending on modeling assumptions. Resuming pre-epidemic behavior would lead to a rapid rise in cases in most counties. Spatial patterns of bending and flattening the curve are robust to modeling assumptions. Depending on epidemic history, county demographics, and behavior within a county, returning those with acquired immunity (assuming it exists) to regular schedules generally helps reduce cumulative COVID-19 cases. The model robustly identifies which counties would experience the greatest share of case reduction relative to continued distancing behavior. The model occasionally mischaracterizes epidemic patterns in counties tightly connected to larger counties that are experiencing large epidemics. Understanding these patterns is critical for prioritizing testing resources and back-to-work planning for the United States.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eli P Fenichel","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Kevin Berry","author_inst":"University of Alaska, Anchorage"},{"author_name":"Jude Bayham","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Gregg Gonsalves","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Augusto Garcia-Agundez","author_inst":"TU Darmstadt, Germany"},{"author_name":"Chryssis Georgiou","author_inst":"U.

forced societies across the world to resort to social distancing to slow the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Due to the economic impacts of social distancing, there is growing desire to relax these measures. To characterize a range of possible strategies for control and to understand their consequences, we performed an optimal control analysis of a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Given that the pandemic is already underway and controls have already been initiated, we calibrated our model to data from the US and focused our analysis on optimal controls from May 2020 through December 2021. We found that a major factor that differentiates strategies that prioritize lives saved versus reduced time under control is how quickly control is relaxed once social distancing restrictions expire in May 2020. Strategies that maintain control at a high level until summer 2020 allow for tapering of control thereafter and minimal deaths, whereas strategies that relax control in the short term lead to fewer options for control later and a higher likelihood of exceeding hospital capacity. Our results also highlight that the potential scope for controlling COVID-19 until a vaccine is available depends on epidemiological parameters about which there is still considerable uncertainty, including the basic reproduction number and the effectiveness of social distancing. In light of those uncertainties, our results do not constitute a quantitative forecast and instead provide a qualitative portrayal of possible outcomes from alternative approaches to control.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alex Perkins","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Guido Espana","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Jude Bayham","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Gregg Gonsalves","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Augusto Garcia-Agundez","author_inst":"TU Darmstadt, Germany"},{"author_name":"Chryssis Georgiou","author_inst":"U.

Methods To project the final infection numbers in Bangladesh we used the SIR mathematical model. Confirmed cases of infection data were obtained from Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) of Bangladesh Results The confirmed cases in Bangladesh follow our SIR model prediction cases. By the end of April the predicted cases of infection will be 17450 to 21616 depending on the control strategies. Due to large population and socio-economic characteristics, we assumed 60% social distancing and lockdown can be possible. Assuming that, the predicated final size of infections will be 3782558 on the 92th day from the first infections and steadily decrease to zero infection after 193 days Conclusion To estimate the impact of social distancing we assumed eight different scenarios, the predicted results confirmed the positive impact of this type of control strategies suggesting that by strict social distancing and lockdown, COVID-19 infection can be under control and then the infection cases will steadily decrease down to zero.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammad Mahmudur Rahman","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biotechnology, Bangladesh University of Health Sciences, Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Asif Ahmed","author_inst":"Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering Discipline, Khulna Univesity, Khulna, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Khondoker Moazzem Hossain","author_inst":"Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering Discipline, Khulna University, Khulna, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Tasnima Haque","author_inst":"BIHS General Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Md.

COVID-19, is spreading rapidly worldwide, no drug has been shown to be sufficiently effective for treating COVID-19. We previously found that nafamostat mesylate, an existing drug used for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), effectively blocked MERS-CoV S protein-initiated cell fusion by targeting TMPRSS2, and inhibited MERS-CoV infection of human lung epithelium-derived Calu-3 cells. Here we established a quantitative fusion assay dependent on SARS-CoV-2 S protein, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, and found that nafamostat mesylate potently inhibited the fusion while camostat mesylate was about 10-fold less active. Furthermore, nafamostat mesylate blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection of Calu-3 cells with an EC50 around 10 nM, which is below its average blood concentration after intravenous administration through continuous infusion. These findings, together with accumulated clinical data regarding its safety, make nafamostat a likely candidate drug to treat COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mizuki

is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and is still spreading rapidly worldwide. Full-genome-sequence computational analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome will allow us to understand the recent evolutionary events and adaptability mechanisms more accurately, as there is still neither effective therapeutic nor prophylactic strategy. In this study, we used population genetics analysis to infer the mutation rate and plausible recombination events that may have contributed to the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Furthermore, we localized targets of recent and strong positive selection. The genomic regions that appear to be under positive selection are largely co-localized with regions in which recombination from non-human hosts appeared to have taken place in the past. Our results suggest that the pangolin coronavirus genome may have contributed to the SARS-CoV-2 genome by recombination with the bat coronavirus genome. However, we find evidence for additional recombination events that involve coronavirus genomes from other hosts, i.e., Hedgehog and Sparrow. Even though recombination events within human hosts cannot be directly assessed, due to the high similarity of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we infer that recombinations may have recently occurred within human hosts using a linkage disequilibrium analysis. In addition, we employed an Approximate Bayesian Computation approach to estimate the parameters of a demographic scenario involving an exponential growth of the size of the SARS-CoV-2 populations that have infected European, Asian and Northern American cohorts, and we demonstrated that a rapid exponential growth in population size can support the observed polymorphism patterns in SARS-CoV-2 genomes.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria Vasilarou","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (IMBB), Foundation for Research and Technology Hellas

However, whether SARS-CoV-2 replicate in the human intestine and its clinical relevance to potential fecal-oral transmission remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate productive infection of SARS-CoV-2 in ACE2+ mature enterocytes in human small intestinal enteroids. In addition to TMPRSS2, another mucosa-specific serine protease, TMPRSS4, also enhanced SARS-CoV-2 spike fusogenic activity and mediated viral entry into host cells. However, newly synthesized viruses released into the intestinal lumen were rapidly inactivated by human colonic fluids and no infectious virus was recovered from the stool specimens of COVID-19 patients. Our results highlight the intestine as a potential site of SARS-CoV-2 replication, which may contribute to local and systemic illness and overall disease progression.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ruochen Zang","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Maria F.G.

These events define five major clades (G, I, S, D and V) of globally-circulating viral populations, representing 85.7% of all sequenced cases, which we can identify using a 10 nucleotide genetic classifier or barcode. We applied this barcode to 4,000 additional genomes deposited between March 31st and April 15th and classified successfully 95.6% of the clades demonstrating the utility of this approach. An analysis of amino acid variation in SARS-CoV-2 ORFs provided evidence of substitution events in the viral proteins involved in both host-entry and genome replication. The systematic monitoring of dynamic changes in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes of circulating virus populations over time can guide therapeutic and prophylactic strategies to manage and contain the virus and, also, with available efficacious antivirals and vaccines, aid in the monitoring of circulating genetic diversity as we proceed towards elimination of the agent. The barcode will add the necessary genetic resolution to facilitate tracking and monitoring of infection clusters to distinguish imported and indigenous cases and thereby aid public health measures seeking to interrupt transmission chains without the requirement for real-time complete genomes sequencing.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qingtian Guan","author_inst":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Mukhtar Sadykov","author_inst":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Raushan Nugmanova","author_inst":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Michael J Carr","author_inst":"School of Medicine, University of College Dublin;Research Center for Zoonosis Control, Global Institution for Collaborative Research and Education (GI-CoRE)"},{"author_name":"Stefan T Arold","author_inst":"Computational Bioscience Research Center (CBRC), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology;Centre de Biochimie Structurale, CNRS, INSERM, University of"},{"author_name":"Arnab Pain","author_inst":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST);GI-CoRE,Hokkaido University;Nuffield Division of Clinical Laboratory Sciences (NDCLS), The John Radcl"},{"author_name":"Zhuoming Liu","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kevin F.
