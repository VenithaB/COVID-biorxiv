The accuracy of early diagnosis is critical in the control of the spread of the virus. Although the real-time RT-PCR detection of the virus nucleic acid is the current golden diagnostic standard, it has high false negative rate when only apply single test. Objective Summarize the baseline characteristics and laboratory examination results of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Analyze the factors that could interfere with the early diagnosis quantitatively to support the timely confirmation of the disease. Methods All suspected patients with COVID-19 were included in our study until Feb 9th, 2020. The last day of follow-up was Mar 20th, 2020. Throat swab real-time RT-PCR test was used to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection. The difference between the epidemiological profile and first laboratory examination results of COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 patients were compared and analyzed by multiple logistic regression. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under curve (AUC) were used to assess the potential diagnostic value in factors, which had statistical differences in regression analysis. Results In total, 315 hospitalized patients were included. Among them, 108 were confirmed as COVID-19 patients and 207 were non-COVID-19 patients. Two groups of patients have significance in comparing age, contact history, leukocyte count, lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (p<0.10). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed age, contact history and decreasing lymphocyte count could be used as individual factor that has diagnostic value (p<0.05). The AUC of first RT-PCR test was 0.84 (95% CI 0.73-0.89), AUC of cumulative two times of RT-PCR tests was 0.92 (95% CI 0.88-0.96) and 0.96 (95% CI 0.93-0.99) for cumulative three times of RT-PCR tests. Ninety-six patients showed typical pneumonia radiological features in first CT scan, AUC was 0.74 (95% CI 0.60-0.73). The AUC of patients age, contact history with confirmed people and the decreased lymphocytes were 0.66 (95% CI 0.60-0.73), 0.67 (95% CI 0.61-0.73), 0.62 (95% CI 0.56-0.69), respectively. Taking chest CT scan diagnosis together with patients age and decreasing lymphocytes, AUC would be 0.86 (95% CI 0.82-0.90). The age threshold to predict COVID-19 was 41.5 years, with a diagnostic sensitivity of 0.70 (95% CI 0.61-0.79) and a specificity of 0.59 (95% CI 0.52-0.66). Positive and negative likelihood ratios were 1.71 and 0.50, respectively. Threshold of lymphocyte count to diagnose COVID-19 was 1.53x109\/L, with a diagnostic sensitivity of 0.82 (95% CI 0.73-0.88) and a specificity of 0.50 (95% CI 0.43-0.57). Positive and negative likelihood ratios were 1.64 and 0.37, respectively. Conclusion Single RT-PCR test has relatively high false negative rate. When first RT-PCR test show negative result in suspected patients, the chest CT scan, contact history, age and lymphocyte count should be used combinedly to assess the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jinwei Ai","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Junyan Gong","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Limin Xing","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Renjiao He","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fangtao Tian","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Juan Wang","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shengduo Polo Pei","author_inst":"Karolinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Dongxuan Chen","author_inst":"Leiden University"},{"author_name":"Guoxin Huang","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Meiling Zhang","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gaojing Qu","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wufeng Fan","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hongming Lin","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Desheng Li","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bin Pei","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.09.20059758","rel_title":"A Scalable Method of Applying Heat and Humidity for Decontamination of N95 Respirators During the COVID-19 Crisis","rel_date":"2020-04-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.09.20059758","rel_abs":"A lack of N95 respirators during the COVID-19 crisis has placed healthcare workers at risk.

We also test the Chen Heng V9501 KN95 and HKYQ N95 finding no degradation of mask filtration efficiency, however even for unheated masks these scored <50 for every fit test. The heating method presented here is scalable from individual masks to over a thousand a day with a single industrial convection oven, making this method practical for local application inside health-care facilities.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lo\u00efc Anderegg","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Cole Meisenhelder","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Chiu Oan Ngooi","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Lei Liao","author_inst":"4C Air"},{"author_name":"Wang Xiao","author_inst":"4C air"},{"author_name":"Steven Chu","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Yi Cui","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"John M Doyle","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Dongxuan Chen","author_inst":"Leiden University"},{"author_name":"Guoxin Huang","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Meiling Zhang","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gaojing Qu","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wufeng Fan","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hongming Lin","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Desheng Li","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bin Pei","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"occupational and environmental health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.09.20059261","rel_title":"COVID-19 in India: Predictions, Reproduction Number and Public Health Preparedness","rel_date":"2020-04-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.09.20059261","rel_abs":"Abstract Introduction: The COVID-19 has emerged as a global concern for public health due to large scale outbreak. The number of confirmed cases has also been increased in India in the past few weeks. The predictions for the COVID-19 can provide insights into the epidemiology of the disease, which helps policymakers to check health system capacities. Methods: We obtained data on daily confirmed, recovered and death cases for a period of 21 days and have implemented the exponential growth model to predict future cases for all the three components. The mathematical model was used to calculate the average reproduction number and herd immunity. We estimated the number of active cases till the 30th of April. We have also tried to analyze the public health capacity to combat COVID-19 in India. Results: If the exponential growth in the number of cases continues then the total number of active cases will be 2,49,635 until the end of April. The reproduction number for COVID-19 in India was found to be 2.56 and herd immunity as 61%. The cumulative cases predicted by the mathematical model was 1,20,203. Discussion: This prediction provides an alarming situation for India in terms of public health preparedness. The number of tests is needed to increase to detect all the cases of COVID-19 in India. Though some serious preventive measures have been implemented, but India should be ready to face any sudden community outbreak.

Our findings highlight the diminishing marginal benefit of social distancing, characterized by a linear decrease in medical demands against an exponentially increasing social distancing duration. We determine an optimal intermittent social-to-no-distancing ratio of 5:1 corresponding to ~80% reduction in healthcare demands; beyond this ratio, benefit of social distancing diminishes to a negligible level.

We analysed information about cases to infer transmission dynamics and potential modes of transmission. Methods: We collected the daily number of 197 symptomatic cases, and that of the 146 passenger cases in two categories, i.e. those who stayed and did not stay in the same stateroom. We retrieved the quarantine details and the ship's 14-day itinerary. We searched the websites of national\/local health authority along the cruise routes and local news using Google for locally confirmed cases associated with the ship. We obtained the design of air conditioning and sewage treatment of the ship from literature. We back-calculated the dates of infection from the epidemic curve and compared with the start of on-board quarantine. Results: Major infections started on Jan 28 and completed by Feb 6 for passengers except those who stayed in the same stateroom with infected individual(s). No other confirmed cases were identified among the disembarked people in Hong Kong except an 80 years old passenger. No confirmed cases were reported in three other stopovers between Jan 27-31 associated with disembarked passengers or visitors from the ship, however two Okinawa taxi drivers became confirmed cases in association with driving the ship passengers. Infection among passengers after Feb 6 was limited to those who stayed in the same stateroom with an infected passenger. Infections in crew members peaked on Feb 7, suggesting significant transmission among crew members after quarantine on Feb 5. Conclusions: We infer that the ship central air conditioning system did not play a role, i.e. the long-range airborne route was absent in the outbreak. Most transmission appears to have occurred through close contact and fomites.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pengcheng Xu","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hua Qian","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Te Miao","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Hui-ling Yen","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Hongwei Tan","author_inst":"Tongji University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin J.

The main focus of this paper is two-fold: (a) generating short term (real-time) forecasts of the future COVID-19 cases for multiple countries; (b) risk assessment (in terms of case fatality rate) of the novel COVID-19 for some profoundly affected countries by finding various important demographic characteristics of the countries along with some disease characteristics. To solve the first problem, we presented a hybrid approach based on autoregressive integrated moving average model and Wavelet-based forecasting model that can generate short-term (ten days ahead) forecasts of the number of daily confirmed cases for Canada, France, India, South Korea, and the UK. The predictions of the future outbreak for different countries will be useful for the effective allocation of health care resources and will act as an early-warning system for government policymakers. In the second problem, we applied an optimal regression tree algorithm to find essential causal variables that significantly affect the case fatality rates for different countries. This data-driven analysis will necessarily provide deep insights into the study of early risk assessments for 50 immensely affected countries.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tanujit Chakraborty","author_inst":"Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Indrajit Ghosh","author_inst":"Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Te Miao","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Hui-ling Yen","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Hongwei Tan","author_inst":"Tongji University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin J.

Here, we provide forecasts for the potential incidence rate, and magnitude, of a COVID-19 epidemic in Kenya based on the observed growth rate and age distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases observed in China, whilst accounting for the demographic and geographic dissimilarities between China and Kenya. Methods We developed a modelling framework to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Kenya, KenyaCoV. KenyaCoV was used to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission both within, and between, different Kenyan regions and age groups. KenyaCoV was parameterized using a combination of human mobility data between the defined regions, the recent 2019 Kenyan census, and estimates of age group social interaction rates specific to Kenya. Key epidemiological characteristics such as the basic reproductive number and the age-specific rate of developing COVID-19 symptoms after infection with SARS-CoV-2, were adapted for the Kenyan setting from a combination of published estimates and analysis of the age distribution of cases observed in the Chinese outbreak. Results We find that if person-to-person transmission becomes established within Kenya, identifying the role of subclinical, and therefore largely undetected, infected individuals is critical to predicting and containing a very significant epidemic. Depending on the transmission scenario our reproductive number estimates for Kenya range from 1.78 (95% CI 1.44 - 2.14) to 3.46 (95% CI 2.81-4.17). In scenarios where asymptomatic infected individuals are transmitting significantly, we expect a rapidly growing epidemic which cannot be contained only by case isolation. In these scenarios, there is potential for a very high percentage of the population becoming infected (median estimates: >80% over six months), and a significant epidemic of symptomatic COVID-19 cases. Exceptional social distancing measures can slow transmission, flattening the epidemic curve, but the risk of epidemic rebound after lifting restrictions is predicted to be high.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samuel P C Brand","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Rabia Aziza","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Ivy K Kombe","author_inst":"Kenya Medical Research Institute, Wellcome Trust Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Charles N Agoti","author_inst":"Kenya Medical Research Institute, Wellcome Trust Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Joe Hilton","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Kat S Rock","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Andrea Parisi","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"D James Nokes","author_inst":"Kenya Medical Research Institute, Wellcome Trust Research Programme and University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Matt Keeling","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Edwine Barasa","author_inst":"Kenya Medical Research Institute, Wellcome Trust Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Meiling Zhang","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gaojing Qu","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wufeng Fan","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hongming Lin","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Desheng Li","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bin Pei","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.09.20059832","rel_title":"Standardization and Age-Distribution of COVID-19: Implications for Variability in Case Fatality and Outbreak Identification","rel_date":"2020-04-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.09.20059832","rel_abs":"Background: Epidemiological data from the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated variability in attack rates by age, and country-to-country variability in case fatality ratio (CFR). Objective: To use direct and indirect standardization for insights into the impact of age-specific under-reporting on between-country variability in CFR, and apparent size of COVID-19 epidemics. Design: Post-hoc secondary data analysis (case studies), and mathematical modeling. Setting: China, global. Interventions: None. Measurements: Data were extracted from a sentinel epidemiological study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control (CCDC) that describes attack rates and CFR for COVID-19 in China prior to February 12, 2020. Standardized morbidity ratios (SMR) were used to impute missing cases and adjust CFR. Age-specific attack rates and CFR were applied to different countries with differing age structures (Italy, Japan, Indonesia, and Egypt), in order to generate estimates for CFR, apparent epidemic size, and time to outbreak recognition for identical age-specific attack rates. Results: SMR demonstrated that 50-70% of cases were likely missed during the Chinese epidemic. Adjustment for under-recognition of younger cases decreased CFR from 2.4% to 0.8% (assuming 50% case ascertainment in older individuals). Standardizing the Chinese epidemic to countries with older populations (Italy, and Japan) resulted in larger apparent epidemic sizes, higher CFR and earlier outbreak recognition. The opposite effect was demonstrated for countries with younger populations (Indonesia, and Egypt). Limitations: Secondary data analysis based on a single country at an early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, with no attempt to incorporate second order effects (ICU saturation) on CFR. Conclusion: Direct and indirect standardization are simple tools that provide key insights into between-country variation in the apparent size and severity of COVID-19 epidemics.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Fisman","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Amy Greer","author_inst":"University of Guelph"},{"author_name":"Ashleigh Tuite","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Charles N Agoti","author_inst":"Kenya Medical Research Institute, Wellcome Trust Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Joe Hilton","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Kat S Rock","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Andrea Parisi","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"D James Nokes","author_inst":"Kenya Medical Research Institute, Wellcome Trust Research Programme and University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Matt Keeling","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Edwine Barasa","author_inst":"Kenya Medical Research Institute, Wellcome Trust Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Meiling Zhang","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gaojing Qu","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wufeng Fan","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hongming Lin","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Desheng Li","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bin Pei","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.09.20059659","rel_title":"How do environmental, economic and health factors influence regional vulnerability to COVID-19?","rel_date":"2020-04-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.09.20059659","rel_abs":"We have studied the correlations between twelve environmental, economic and health variables, by carrying out a statistical analysis of the fatality rate of COVID-19 in 14 countries.

We trained an artificial neural network model, a modified auto-encoder with Covid19 Chinese data, to forecast epidemic curve of the different Italian regions, and use the susceptible\/exposed\/infected\/removed (SEIR) compartment model to predict the spreading and peaks. We have estimated the basic reproduction number (R0), which represents the average number of people that can be infected by a person who has already acquired the infection - both by fitting the exponential growth rate of the infection across a one month period, and also by using a day by day assessment, based on single observations. Results. The expected peak of SEIR model for new daily cases was at the end of March at national level. The peak of overall positive cases is expected by April 11th in Southern Italian Regions, a couple of days after that of Lombardy and Northern regions. According to our model, total confirmed cases in all Italy regions could reach 160,000 cases by April 30th and stabilize at a plateau. Conclusions.

BACKGROUND: The rapid outbreak of the new Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the spread of the virus worldwide, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, have prompted various investigations about the impact of environmental factors on the rate of development of this epidemic. Different studies have called attention to various parameters that may have influenced the spread of the virus, and in particular, the impact of climatic parameters has been emphasized. OBJECTIVE: The main hypothesis object of our research is that between regions exhibiting a significant difference in the mean daily temperature, a significant difference is also observed in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases and that this does not happen if there is no significant difference in mean daily temperature. METHOD: The research hypothesis was investigated through statistical analysis. The F-test was used to test whether there is significant equality of variances for each pair of case studies, and then, by the T-Test, the existence of a significant difference was investigated. In all statistical tests, the confidence level of 95% is considered. In order to minimize the impact on the results of factors like the policy of the government or cultural differences among countries (food, exercise, weight, etc.), three case studies within five countries, namely Iran, Italy, Germany, Spain, and United States were compared separately. RESULT: This statistical analysis shows that there is a correlation between the average temperature and the epidemic rate, and this is especially evident when differences in average daily temperature are significantly larger, as it happens for Bandar Abbas in Iran, Milan in Italy, Santa Cruz in Spain, and Los Angeles in the US. Besides, the analysis of the average air temperatures shows that the epidemic rates of COVID-19 were higher in the case studies with a lower average temperature. Instead, when no significant differences exist in the average daily temperature of two cities in the same country, there is no significant difference in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases. CONCLUSION: In all five selected countries, we found that when there is a significant difference in the daily mean temperature between two regions of a country, a significant difference also exists in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases. Conversely, if there are no significant differences in the mean daily temperature of two regions in the same country, no significant difference is observed in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases for these regions. In conclusion, the results of this study support the research hypothesis and confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method for analysis of the epidemic rates.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Behzad Pirouz","author_inst":"Department of Computer Engineering, Modelling, Electronics and Systems Engineering, University of Calabria"},{"author_name":"Amirsina Golmohammadi","author_inst":"Department of Oral Medicine, Dental Branch, Islamic Azad University of Medical Sciences, Tehran"},{"author_name":"Hasti Saeidpour Masouleh","author_inst":"Medical Student, Student Research Committee, Anzali International Campus, Guilan University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Galileo Violini","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Catolica Madre y Maestra, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic"},{"author_name":"Behrouz Pirouz","author_inst":"University of Calabria"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Arduini","author_inst":"Precision Cardiology Laboratory, The Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Sikander Hayat","author_inst":"Precision Cardiology Laboratory, Bayer US LLC"},{"author_name":"G\u00f6kcen Eraslan","author_inst":"The Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Christoph Muus","author_inst":"The Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Roby Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christian M Stegmann","author_inst":"Precision Cardiology Laboratory, Bayer US LLC"},{"author_name":"- Human Cell Atlas Lung Biological Network","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Kenneth B Margulies","author_inst":"Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Patrick T Ellinor","author_inst":"Precision Cardiology Laboratory, The Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Desheng Li","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bin Pei","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.09.20059360","rel_title":"Using random testing to manage a safe exit from the COVID-19 lockdown","rel_date":"2020-04-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.09.20059360","rel_abs":"We argue that frequent sampling of the fraction of infected people (either by random testing or by analysis of sewage water), is central to managing the COVID-19 pandemic because it both measures in real time the key variable controlled by restrictive measures, and anticipates the load on the healthcare system due to progression of the disease. Knowledge of random testing outcomes will (i) significantly improve the predictability of the pandemic, (ii) allow informed and optimized decisions on how to modify restrictive measures, with much shorter delay times than the present ones, and (iii) enable the real-time assessment of the efficiency of new means to reduce transmission rates. Here we suggest, irrespective of the size of a suitably homogeneous population, a conservative estimate of 15000 for the number of randomly tested people per day which will suffice to obtain reliable data about the current fraction of infections and its evolution in time, thus enabling close to real-time assessment of the quantitative effect of restrictive measures. Still higher testing capacity permits detection of geographical differences in spreading rates. Furthermore and most importantly, with daily sampling in place, a reboot could be attempted while the fraction of infected people is still an order of magnitude higher than the level required for a relaxation of restrictions with testing focused on symptomatic individuals. This is demonstrated by considering a feedback and control model of mitigation where the feed-back is derived from noisy sampling data.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Markus Mueller","author_inst":"Paul Scherrer Institute"},{"author_name":"Peter Derlet","author_inst":"Paul Scherrer Institute"},{"author_name":"Christopher Mudry","author_inst":"Paul Scherrer Institute"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Aeppli","author_inst":"Paul Scherrer Institute"},{"author_name":"Behrouz Pirouz","author_inst":"University of Calabria"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Arduini","author_inst":"Precision Cardiology Laboratory, The Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Sikander Hayat","author_inst":"Precision Cardiology Laboratory, Bayer US LLC"},{"author_name":"G\u00f6kcen Eraslan","author_inst":"The Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Christoph Muus","author_inst":"The Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Roby Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christian M Stegmann","author_inst":"Precision Cardiology Laboratory, Bayer US LLC"},{"author_name":"- Human Cell Atlas Lung Biological Network","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Kenneth B Margulies","author_inst":"Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Patrick T Ellinor","author_inst":"Precision Cardiology Laboratory, The Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Desheng Li","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bin Pei","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.09.20059402","rel_title":"Near- and forecasting the SARS-COV-2 epidemic requires a global view and multiple methods","rel_date":"2020-04-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.09.20059402","rel_abs":"Conventional epidemiological models require estimates of important parameters including incubation time and case fatality rate that may be unavailable in the early stage of an epidemic. For the ongoing SARS-COV-2 epidemic, with no previous population exposure, alternative prediction methods less reliant on assumptions may prove more effective in the near-term. We present three methods used to provide early estimates of likely SARS-COV-2 epidemic progression. During the first stage of the epidemic, growth rate charts revealed the UK, Italy and Spain as outliers, with differentially increasing growth of deaths over cases. A novel data-driven time-series model was then used to near-cast 7-day future cases and deaths with much greater precision. Finally, an epidemio-statistical model was used to bridge from near-casting to forecasting the future course of the global epidemic. By applying multiple approaches to global SARS-COV-2 data, coupled with mixed-effects methods, countries further ahead in the epidemic provide valuable information for those behind. Using current daily global data, we note convergence in near-term predictions for Italy signifying an appropriate call on the future course of the global epidemic. For the UK and elsewhere, prediction of peak and eventual time to resolution is now possible.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daren J Austin","author_inst":"GlaxoSmithKline"},{"author_name":"Peter Derlet","author_inst":"Paul Scherrer Institute"},{"author_name":"Christopher Mudry","author_inst":"Paul Scherrer Institute"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Aeppli","author_inst":"Paul Scherrer Institute"},{"author_name":"Behrouz Pirouz","author_inst":"University of Calabria"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Arduini","author_inst":"Precision Cardiology Laboratory, The Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Sikander Hayat","author_inst":"Precision Cardiology Laboratory, Bayer US LLC"},{"author_name":"G\u00f6kcen Eraslan","author_inst":"The Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Christoph Muus","author_inst":"The Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Roby Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christian M Stegmann","author_inst":"Precision Cardiology Laboratory, Bayer US LLC"},{"author_name":"- Human Cell Atlas Lung Biological Network","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Kenneth B Margulies","author_inst":"Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Patrick T Ellinor","author_inst":"Precision Cardiology Laboratory, The Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Desheng Li","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bin Pei","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.09.20059436","rel_title":"New approximations, and policy implications, from a delayed dynamic model of a fast pandemic","rel_date":"2020-04-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.09.20059436","rel_abs":"We study an SEIQR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered) model for an infectious disease, with time delays for latency and an asymptomatic phase. For fast pandemics where nobody has prior immunity and everyone has immunity after recovery, the SEIQR model decouples into two nonlinear delay differential equations (DDEs) with five parameters. One parameter is set to unity by scaling time. The subcase of perfect quarantining and zero self-recovery before quarantine, with two free parameters, is examined first. The method of multiple scales yields a hyperbolic tangent solution; and a long-wave approximation yields a first order ordinary differential equation (ODE). With imperfect quarantining and nonzero self-recovery, the long-wave approximation is a second order ODE. These three approximations each capture the full outbreak, from infinitesimal initiation to final saturation. Low-dimensional dynamics in the DDEs is demonstrated using a six state non-delayed reduced order model obtained by Galerkin projection. Numerical solutions from the reduced order model match the DDE over a range of parameter choices and initial conditions. Finally, stability analysis and numerics show how correctly executed time-varying social distancing, within the present model, can cut the number of affected people by almost half. Alternatively, faster detection followed by near-certain quarantining can potentially be even more effective.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chandrika Prakash Vyasarayani","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad"},{"author_name":"Anindya Chatterjee","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur"},{"author_name":"Christopher Mudry","author_inst":"Paul Scherrer Institute"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Aeppli","author_inst":"Paul Scherrer Institute"},{"author_name":"Behrouz Pirouz","author_inst":"University of Calabria"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Arduini","author_inst":"Precision Cardiology Laboratory, The Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Sikander Hayat","author_inst":"Precision Cardiology Laboratory, Bayer US LLC"},{"author_name":"G\u00f6kcen Eraslan","author_inst":"The Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Christoph Muus","author_inst":"The Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Roby Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christian M Stegmann","author_inst":"Precision Cardiology Laboratory, Bayer US LLC"},{"author_name":"- Human Cell Atlas Lung Biological Network","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Kenneth B Margulies","author_inst":"Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Patrick T Ellinor","author_inst":"Precision Cardiology Laboratory, The Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Desheng Li","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bin Pei","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.09.20059592","rel_title":"Between Geography and Demography: Key Interdependencies and Exit Mechanisms for Covid-19","rel_date":"2020-04-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.09.20059592","rel_abs":"We develop a minimalist compartmental model to analyze policies on mobility restriction in Italy during the Covid-19 outbreak. Our findings show that a early lockdowns barely shift the epidemic in time: moreover, beyond a critical value of the lockdown strength, an epidemic that seems to be quelled fully recovers after lifting the restrictions. We investigate the effects on lockdown scenarios and exit mechanisms by introducing heterogeneities in the model. In particular, we consider Italian regions as separate administrative entities in which social interactions through different age classes occur. We find that, due to the sparsity of the mobility matrix, epidemics developed independently in different regions once the outbreak starts. Moreover, after the epidemics ha started, the influence of contacts with other regions becomes soon irrelevant. Sparsity accounts for the observed delays across different regions. Analogous arguments would apply to the international borders. We also show how disregarding the structure of social contacts could lead to severe underestimation of the post-lockdown effects. Nevertheless, age class based mechanisms can help to mitigate rebound effects with milder strategies. Finally, we point out that our results can be generalized beyond this particular model by providing a description of the effects of key parameters on non-medical mitigation strategies for epidemics.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Antonio Scala","author_inst":"Institute of Complex Systems, CNR"},{"author_name":"Andrea Flori","author_inst":"Politecnico di Milano"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Spelta","author_inst":"Univ. di Pavia"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Brugnoli","author_inst":"CNR-ISC"},{"author_name":"Matteo Cinelli","author_inst":"CNR-ISC"},{"author_name":"Walter Quattrociocchi","author_inst":"Univ. di Venezia 'Ca Foscari"},{"author_name":"Fabio Pammolli","author_inst":"Politecnico di Milano"},{"author_name":"G\u00f6kcen Eraslan","author_inst":"The Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Christoph Muus","author_inst":"The Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Roby Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christian M Stegmann","author_inst":"Precision Cardiology Laboratory, Bayer US LLC"},{"author_name":"- Human Cell Atlas Lung Biological Network","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Kenneth B Margulies","author_inst":"Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Patrick T Ellinor","author_inst":"Precision Cardiology Laboratory, The Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Desheng Li","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bin Pei","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.09.20059790","rel_title":"Estimating cost-benefit of quarantine length for Covid-19 mitigation","rel_date":"2020-04-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.09.20059790","rel_abs":"The international community has been put in an unprecedented situation by the COVID-19 pandemic.

In this study, we propose an agent-based model of disease transmission in a society divided into closely connected families, workplaces, and social groups. This allows us to discuss mitigation strategies, including targeted quarantine measures. We find that workplace and more diffuse social contacts are roughly equally important to disease spread, and that an effective lockdown must target both. We examine the cost-benefit of replacing a lockdown with tracing and quarantining contacts of the infected. Quarantine can contribute substantially to mitigation, even if it has short duration and is done within households. When reopening society, testing and quarantining is a strategy that is much cheaper in terms of lost workdays than a long lockdown of workplaces. A targeted quarantine strategy is quite efficient with only 5 days of quarantine, and its effect increases when testing is more widespread.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andreas Eilersen","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Kim Sneppen","author_inst":"University of Copenhagen"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Spelta","author_inst":"Univ. di Pavia"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Brugnoli","author_inst":"CNR-ISC"},{"author_name":"Matteo Cinelli","author_inst":"CNR-ISC"},{"author_name":"Walter Quattrociocchi","author_inst":"Univ. di Venezia 'Ca Foscari"},{"author_name":"Fabio Pammolli","author_inst":"Politecnico di Milano"},{"author_name":"G\u00f6kcen Eraslan","author_inst":"The Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Christoph Muus","author_inst":"The Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Roby Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christian M Stegmann","author_inst":"Precision Cardiology Laboratory, Bayer US LLC"},{"author_name":"- Human Cell Atlas Lung Biological Network","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Kenneth B Margulies","author_inst":"Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Patrick T Ellinor","author_inst":"Precision Cardiology Laboratory, The Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Desheng Li","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bin Pei","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.10.20061036","rel_title":"A novel high specificity COVID-19 screening method based on simple blood exams and artificial intelligence","rel_date":"2020-04-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.10.20061036","rel_abs":"Background: The SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for COVID-19 poses a significant challenge to healthcare systems worldwide. Despite governmental initiatives aimed at containing the spread of the disease, several countries are experiencing unmanageable increases in the demand for ICU beds, medical equipment, and larger testing capacity. Efficient COVID-19 diagnosis enables healthcare systems to provide better care for patients while protecting caregivers from the disease. However, many countries are constrained by the limited amount of test kits available, the lack of equipment and trained professionals. In the case of patients visiting emergency rooms (ERs) with a suspect of COVID-19, a prompt diagnosis can improve the outcome and even provide information for efficient hospital management. In this context, a quick, inexpensive and readily available test to perform an initial triage at ER could help to smooth patient flow, provide better patient care, and reduce the backlog of exams. Methods: In this Case-control quantitative study, we developed a strategy backed by artificial intelligence to perform an initial screening of suspect COVID-19 cases. We developed a machine learning classifier that takes widely available simple blood exams as input and predicts if that suspect case is likely to be positive (having SARS-CoV-2) or negative(not having SARS-CoV-2). Based on this initial classification, positive cases can be referred for further highly sensitive testing (e.g. CT scan, or specific antibodies). We used publicly available data from the Albert Einstein Hospital in Brazil from 5,644 patients. Focussing on using simple blood exams, a sample of 599 subjects that had the fewest missing values for 16 common exams were selected. From these 599 patients, only 81 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 (determined by RT-PCR). Based on this data, we built an artificial intelligence classification framework, ER-CoV, aiming at determining which patients were more likely to be negative for SARS-CoV-2 when visiting an ER and that were categorized as a suspect case by medical professionals. The primary goal of this investigation is to develop a classifier with high specificity and high negative predictive values, with reasonable sensitivity. Findings: We identified that our framework achieved an average specificity of 92.16% [95% CI 91.73 - 92.59] and negative predictive value (NPV) of 95.29% [95% CI 94.65% - 95.90%]. Those values are completely aligned with our goal of providing an effective low-cost system to triage suspected patients at ERs. As for sensitivity, our model achieved an average of 63.98% [95% CI 59.82% - 67.50%] and positive predictive value (PPV) of 48.00% [95% CI 44.88% - 51.56%]. An error analysis identified that, on average, 45% of the false negative results would have been hospitalized anyway, thus the model is making mistakes for severe cases that would not be overlooked, partially mitigating the fact that the test is not high-sensitive. All code for our AI model, called ER-CoV is publicly available at https:\/\/github.com\/soares-f\/ER-CoV. Interpretation: Based on the capacity of our model to accurately predict which cases are negative from suspected patients arriving at emergency rooms, we envision that this framework can play an important role in patient triage. Probably the most important outcome is related to testing availability, which at this point is extremely low in many countries. Considering the achieved specificity, we would reduce by at least 90% the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests performed at emergency rooms, with the chance of getting a false negative at around 5%. The second important outcome is related to patient management in hospitals. Patients predicted as positive by our framework could be immediately separated from the other patients while waiting for the results of confirmatory tests. This could reduce the spread rate inside hospitals since in many hospitals all suspected cases are kept in the same ward. In Brazil, where the data was collected, rate infection is starting to quickly spread, the lead time of a SARS-CoV-2 can be up to 2 weeks.

During this early period, potential controls were not effectively put in place or enforced in many countries. Hence, the early phases of COVID-19 spread in countries where controls were weak offer a unique perspective on the ensemble-behavior of COVID-19 basic reproduction number Ro. The work here shows that there is global convergence (i.e. across many nations) to an uncontrolled Ro=4.5 that describes the early time spread of COVID-19. This value is in agreement with independent estimates from other sources reviewed here and adds to the growing consensus that the early estimate of Ro=2.2 adopted by the World Health Organization is low. A reconciliation between power-law and exponential growth predictions is also featured within the confines of the SIR formulation. Implications for evaluating potential control strategies from this uncontrolled Ro are briefly discussed in the context of the maximum possible infected fraction of the population (needed for assessing health care capacity) and mortality (especially in the USA given diverging projections). Model results indicate that if intervention measures still result in Ro > 2.7 within 49 days after first infection, intervention is unlikely to be effective in general for COVID-19. Current optimistic projections place mortality figures in the USA in the range of 100,000 fatalities. For fatalities to be confined to 100,000 requires a reduction in Ro from 4.5 to 2.7 within 17 days of first infection assuming a mortality rate of 3.4%.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gabriel G.

Whether regional variations in social vulnerability to disasters influence COVID-19 outcomes and incidence in the U.S. is unknown. Objective To examine the association of Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), a percentile-based measure of county-level social vulnerability to disasters, and its sub-components (socioeconomic status, household composition, minority status, and housing type\/transportation accessibility) with the case fatality rate (CFR) and incidence of COVID-19. Design Ecological study of counties with at least 50 confirmed COVID-19 cases as of April 4th, 2020. Generalized linear mixed-effects models with state-level clustering were applied to estimate county-level associations of overall SVI and its sub-component scores with COVID-19 CFR (deaths\/100 cases) and incidence (cases\/1000 population), adjusting for population percentage aged >65 years, and for comorbidities using the average Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC) score. Counties with high SVI ([&ge;]median) and high CFR ([&ge;]median) were identified. Setting Population-based study of U.S. county-level data. Participants U.S. counties with at least 50 confirmed COVID-19 cases. Main outcomes and measures COVID-19 CFR and incidence. Results Data from 433 counties including 283,256 cases and 6,644 deaths were analyzed. Median SVI was 0.46 [Range: 0.01-1.00], and median CFR and incidence were 1.9% [Range: 0-13.3] and 1.2 per 1000 people [Range: 0.6-38.8], respectively. Higher SVI, indicative of greater social vulnerability, was associated with higher CFR (RR: 1.19 [1.05, 1.34], p=0.005, per-1 unit increase), an association that strengthened after adjustment for age>65 years and comorbidities (RR: 1.63 [1.38, 1.91], p<0.001), and was further confirmed in a sensitivity analysis limited to six states with the highest testing levels. Although the association between overall SVI and COVID-19 incidence was not significant, the SVI sub-components of socioeconomic status and minority status were both predictors of higher incidence and CFR. A combination of high SVI ([&ge;]0.46) and high adjusted CFR ([&ge;]2.3%) was observed in 28.9% of counties. Conclusions and Relevance Social vulnerability is associated with higher COVID-19 case fatality. High social vulnerability and CFR coexist in more than 1 in 4 U.S. counties. These counties should be targeted by public policy interventions to help alleviate the pandemic burden on the most vulnerable population.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aditi Nayak","author_inst":"Emory University, Atlanta, GA"},{"author_name":"Shabatun J Islam","author_inst":"Emory University, Atlanta, GA"},{"author_name":"Anurag Mehta","author_inst":"Emory University, Atlanta, GA"},{"author_name":"Yi-An Ko","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, GA"},{"author_name":"Shivani A Patel","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, GA"},{"author_name":"Abhinav Goyal","author_inst":"Emory University, Atlanta, GA"},{"author_name":"Samaah Sullivan","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, GA"},{"author_name":"Tene T Lewis","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, GA"},{"author_name":"Viola Vaccarino","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, GA"},{"author_name":"Alanna A Morris","author_inst":"Emory University, Atlanta, GA"},{"author_name":"Arshed A Quyyumi","author_inst":"Emory University, Atlanta, GA"},{"author_name":"- Human Cell Atlas Lung Biological Network","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Kenneth B Margulies","author_inst":"Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Patrick T Ellinor","author_inst":"Precision Cardiology Laboratory, The Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Desheng Li","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bin Pei","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.10.20060830","rel_title":"Risk Assessment of nCOVID-19 Pandemic In India: A Mathematical Model And Simulation","rel_date":"2020-04-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.10.20060830","rel_abs":"The entire world is now eventually locked down due to the outbreak of nCOVID-19 corona virus outbreak. The fast and relentless spread nCOVID-19 has basically segmented the populace only into merely into three classes, such as susceptible, infected and recovered compartments. Adapting the classical SEIR- type epidemic modelling framework, the direct person-to-person contact transmission is taken as the direct route of transmission of nCOVID-19 pandemic. In this research, the authors have developed a model of the nation-wide trends of the outburst of the nCOVID-19 infection using an SEIR Model. The SEIR dynamics are expressed using ordinary differential equations. The creators initially determined the parameters of the model from the accessible day by day information for Indian States dependent on around 35 days history of diseases, recuperation and deaths. The determined parameters have been amassed to extend future patterns for the Indian subcontinent, which is right now at a beginning time in the contamination cycle. The novelty of the study lies in the prediction of both the pessimistic and optimistic mathematical model based comprehensive analysis of nCOVID-19 infection spreading, for two different conditions: (a) if lock down gets withdrawn and (b) if lock down continues as a whole. If the complete lock down in India is withdrawn on 14th April 2020, as a whole, then from the simulation, the authors have predicted that the infected population will flare-up to a large extent , suddenly, however, gradual or zone specific withdrawal would be more effective solution. This study also suggested some possible way-out to get rid of this situation by providing a trade-off between \"flattening of the curve\" as well as less economic turbulence.

In this paper, we compare outcomes for two northern Italian regions which had almost simultaneous initial outbreaks: Lombardy, which had a patient-centered approach that relied on primary care physicians and hospital care, and Veneto, which focused on community-based diagnosis and care. Methods We used numerator and denominator data from public Italian government sources to calculate reported rates of COVID-19 testing\/1000, COVID-19 cases\/100,000 overall and for health care workers (HCWs) and non-HCWs, deaths per 100,000, and the percent of cases admitted to hospitals and ICUs for February 24-April 1, 2020. Results As of April 1, 2020, Lombardy experienced 44,733 cases and 7,539 deaths; for Veneto, the corresponding values were 9,625 and 499. The cumulative case rate was 445\/100,000 for Lombardy and 196\/100,000 for Veneto, a 2.3-fold difference. Mortality rates were 7.5 times higher in Lombardy than in Veneto (75\/100,000 and 10\/100,000, respectively). Cumulative rates of testing were nearly twice as high in Veneto and were 2.7 times higher in the first week of the epidemic. In Lombardy, 51.5% of patients were admitted, including, 5.2% to intensive care units; for Veneto, the corresponding figures were 25.1% and 4.3%, respectively. HCWs account for 14.3% of all cases in Lombardy compared with 4.4% in Veneto. In Lombardy, the rate among HCWs was 19.1 times higher than in the general population (6,924\/100,000 versus 362\/100,000), while in Veneto it was 3.9 times higher (676\/100,000 versus 172\/100,000). Discussion The community-based approach in Veneto appears to be associated with substantially reduced rates of cases, hospitalizations, deaths, and infection in HCWs compared with the patient-centered approach in Lombardy. Our findings suggest that the impact of COVID-19 can be reduced through strong and aggressive public health efforts to confirm and isolate cases and contacts in a timely way and to minimize unnecessary contact between HCWs and cases through home-based testing and pro-active home follow-up.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nancy Binkin","author_inst":"Department of Family Medicine and Public Health, School of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California"},{"author_name":"Stefania Salmaso","author_inst":"Consultant, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Federica Michieletto","author_inst":"Department of Prevention, Food Security, and Veterinary Services, Veneto Region, Venice, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesca Russo","author_inst":"Department of Prevention, Food Security, and Veterinary Services, Veneto Region, Venice, Italy"},{"author_name":"Shivani A Patel","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, GA"},{"author_name":"Abhinav Goyal","author_inst":"Emory University, Atlanta, GA"},{"author_name":"Samaah Sullivan","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, GA"},{"author_name":"Tene T Lewis","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, GA"},{"author_name":"Viola Vaccarino","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, GA"},{"author_name":"Alanna A Morris","author_inst":"Emory University, Atlanta, GA"},{"author_name":"Arshed A Quyyumi","author_inst":"Emory University, Atlanta, GA"},{"author_name":"- Human Cell Atlas Lung Biological Network","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Kenneth B Margulies","author_inst":"Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Patrick T Ellinor","author_inst":"Precision Cardiology Laboratory, The Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Desheng Li","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bin Pei","author_inst":"Xiangyang No.1 Peoples Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.10.20060699","rel_title":"No evidence of clinical efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection with oxygen requirement: results of a study using routinely collected data to emulate a target trial","rel_date":"2020-04-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.10.20060699","rel_abs":"Background Treatments are urgently needed to prevent respiratory failure and deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

In order to meaningfully impact the COVID-19 pandemic, promising antiviral therapies must be identified within the next several months. However, the number of clinical trials that can be performed in this timeframe is limited. We therefore developed a mathematical model which allows projection of all possible therapeutic approaches. Our model recapitulates off-treatment viral dynamics and predicts a three-phase immune response. Addition of treatment with remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, neutralizing antibodies or cellular immunotherapy demonstrates that if in vivo drug potency is high, then rapid elimination of virus is possible. Potent therapies dosed soon after peak viral load when infected people typically develop symptoms, are predicted to decrease shedding duration and intensity of the effector immune response, but to have little effect on viral area under the curve, which is driven by high levels of early SARS CoV-2 replication. Potent therapy dosed prior to peak viral load, when infection is usually pre-symptomatic, is predicted to be the only option to lower viral area under the curve. We also identify that clinically meaningful drug resistance is less likely to emerge with a highly potent agent that is dosed after peak viral load. Our results support an early test and treat approach for COVID-19, but also demonstrate the need to identify early viral shedding kinetic features that are the most predictive surrogates of clinical severity and transmission risk.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ashish Goyal","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"E.

We divide the regions into different risk categories and discuss anomalies. The worst cases are confined between the Appenine and the Alps mountain ranges but the situation seem to improve closer to the sea. The Veneto region gave the most efficient response so far and some of their resources could be diverted to other regions, in particular more tests to the Lombardia, Liguria, Piemonte, Marche and V. Aosta regions, which seem to be worst affected. We noticed worrying anomalies in the Lazio, Campania and Sicilia regions to be monitored. We stress that the number of fatalities we predicted on March 12 has been confirmed daily by the bulletins. This suggests a change of strategy in order to reduce such number maybe moving the weaker population (and negative to the virus test) to beach resorts, which should be empty presently. The ratio deceased\/positives on April 4, 2020 is 5.4% worldwide, 12.3% in Italy, 1.4% in Germany, 2.7% in the USA, 10.3% in the UK and 4.1% in China. These large fluctuations should be investigated starting from the Italian regions, which show similar large fluctuations.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aldo Bonasera","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Giacomo Bonasera","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Suylatu Zhang","author_inst":"Inner Mongolia University"},{"author_name":"Amelie Chabrol","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier Sud Francilien"},{"author_name":"Romain Paule","author_inst":"Foch Hospital"},{"author_name":"Constance Guillaud","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Gallien","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Raphael Lepeule","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Tali-Anne Szwebel","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Xavier Lescure","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Frederic Schlemmer","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Marie Matignon","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Mehdi Khellaf","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Etienne Crickx","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Terrier","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Caroline Morbieu","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Paul Legendre","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Julien Dang","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Yoland Schoindre","author_inst":"Foch Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jean-Michel Pawlotski","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Marc Michel","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Elodie Perrodeau","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Carlier","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Roche","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Victoire De Lastours","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Luc Mouthon","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Etienne Audureau","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Philippe Ravaud","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Bertrand Godeau","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Costedoat","author_inst":"APHP"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.10.20060673","rel_title":"COVID-19 lockdowns cause global air pollution declines with implications for public health risk","rel_date":"2020-04-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.10.20060673","rel_abs":"The lockdown response to COVID-19 has caused an unprecedented reduction in global economic activity. We test the hypothesis that this has reduced tropospheric and ground-level air pollution concentrations using satellite data and a network of >10,000 air quality stations. After accounting for the effects of meteorological variability, we find remarkable declines in ground-level nitrogen dioxide (NO2: -29 % with 95% confidence interval -44% to -13%), ozone (O3: -11%; -20% to -2%) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5: -9%; -28% to 10%) during the first two weeks of lockdown (n = 27 countries). These results are largely mirrored by satellite measures of the troposphere although long-distance transport of PM2.5 resulted in more heterogeneous changes relative to NO2. Pollutant anomalies were related to short-term health outcomes using empirical exposure-response functions. We estimate that there was a net total of 7400 (340 to 14600) premature deaths and 6600 (4900 to 7900) pediatric asthma cases avoided during two weeks post-lockdown. In China and India alone, the PM2.5-related avoided premature mortality was 1400 (1100 to 1700) and 5300 (1000 to 11700), respectively. Assuming that the lockdown-induced deviations in pollutant concentrations are maintained for the duration of 2020, we estimate 0.78 (0.09 to 1.5) million premature deaths and 1.6 (0.8 to 2) million pediatric asthma cases could be avoided globally. While the state of global lockdown is not sustainable, these findings illustrate the potential health benefits gained from reducing 'business as usual' air pollutant emissions from economic activities.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zander S Venter","author_inst":"Norwegian Institute for Nature Research"},{"author_name":"Kristin Aunan","author_inst":"CICERO Center for International Climate Research"},{"author_name":"Sourangsu Chowdhury","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Chemistry"},{"author_name":"Jos Lelieveld","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Chemistry"},{"author_name":"Romain Paule","author_inst":"Foch Hospital"},{"author_name":"Constance Guillaud","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Gallien","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Raphael Lepeule","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Tali-Anne Szwebel","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Xavier Lescure","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Frederic Schlemmer","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Marie Matignon","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Mehdi Khellaf","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Etienne Crickx","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Terrier","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Caroline Morbieu","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Paul Legendre","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Julien Dang","author_inst":"INSERM"},{"author_name":"Yoland Schoindre","author_inst":"Foch Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jean-Michel Pawlotski","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Marc Michel","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Elodie Perrodeau","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Carlier","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Roche","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Victoire De Lastours","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Luc Mouthon","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Etienne Audureau","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Philippe Ravaud","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Bertrand Godeau","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Costedoat","author_inst":"APHP"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.10.20060681","rel_title":"A Stratified Model to Quantify the Effects of Containment Policies on the Spread of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-04-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.10.20060681","rel_abs":"The SARS-Cov-2 virus is spreading fast all over the world and has already imposed a significant social and economic cost in many countries. Different countries have utilised a variety of containment policies with an emphasis on social distancing as a strategy to stop the spread of COVID-19. Quantifying the effects of such policies in different time-scales and comparing the efficacy of various available policies is of utmost importance for policy-makers in different countries. That is even more important when the policy-makers want to plan for long-term strategies and to weigh each option based on its epidemiological effects and socio-economic costs. In the absence of detailed knowledge of the interactions between individuals in a population and the characteristics of the SARS-Cov-2 virus, quantifying the effects of these policies is very difficult. Hence, there is an immediate need for models that can predict the spread of COVID-19 in a population, without the need for such detailed information. In this manuscript, a method is presented that can be used to predict the spread of COVID-19 in any country and under any containment policy imposed separately on different groups in the population. The method tunes the parameters of a known stratified model based on the available data on the spread of COVID-19. The model includes a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations and is easy to simulate and easy to understand. As it is presented in this manuscript, the population is divided into age-groups. But given the availability of the data, there is no reason to limit the stratification into only age-groups and we can consider any relevant groups. To estimate the parameters of the model such that it reflects the characteristics of the spread of COVID-19 in a population, the method relies on an optimisation scheme. More specifically, the optimisation scheme estimates the contact rates between different age groups in the population. But a very important and useful feature of the model is that the estimated parameters for one population can be translated and used for any other population with a known age-structure, which in this day and age, includes almost any country or city in the world. Also, it is shown that the method is quite insensitive to the underlying assumptions in the optimisation scheme and also to deliberate or non-deliberate errors that might have occurred in collecting the data. The capabilities of the model are demonstrated using a case study under different containment policies, from an uncontained population to mitigation and suppression policies. Also, we can use the model to quantify the effects of strategies which include switching between different containment policies at pre-determined points in time. The model allows us to quantify the effects of each of these policies on the spread of the disease in a population, in particular, the instantaneous and total numbers of infectious individuals in a population which are important parameters for policy-makers. The simulation results, as explained in the following, provide some insight into various policies and some of the results are possibly counter-intuitive for many people. For example, the model predicts that closing down schools and universities without any other containment policy imposed on older age-groups has almost no impact on the number of patients that might need support-care in hospitals. The method provides an easy-to-use tool to use the information collected on the spread of COVID-19 in a country or region and then use that information in another population which might not have been as widely affected by the disease yet.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vahid S.
