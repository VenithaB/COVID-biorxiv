The Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to widespread concerns about the risk of infection in patients with rheumatic diseases (RD) receiving disease modifying ant-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and other immunosuppressants (IS). Methods. A SurveyMonkey based electronic survey was conducted amongst members of the Indian Rheumatology Association to understand the need for changes in prevailing practices. Results. Of the 861 invitees, 221 responded. In the wake of the pandemic, 47.5% would reduce biological DMARDs (bDMARDs) while only 12.2% would reduce the use of conventional synthetic DMARDs. 64.2% were likely to defer change in IS, the reluctance being most with rituximab (58.3%) followed by cyclophosphamide (53.3%), anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha agents (52.4%) and Janus kinase inhibitors (34.39%). Hydroxychloroquine was the preferred choice (81.9%) for the treatment of COVID-19 followed by protease inhibitors (22.1%) and intravenous immunoglobulin (8.1%). Chloroquine was less preferred (19%). More than two-thirds (70.5%) believed that COVID-19 might trigger macrophage activation syndrome. Social distancing (98.1%) and hand hygiene (74.6%) were recommended by majority. 62.8% would avoid touch for clinical examination whenever feasible. Conclusion. Most rheumatologists perceived the need to change treatment of RDs during the COVID-19 pandemic; reduce immunosuppression and defer the usage of rituximab and bDMARDs.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Latika Gupta","author_inst":"SGPGI"},{"author_name":"Durga Misra","author_inst":"SGPGIMS, Lucknow"},{"author_name":"Vishwesh Agarwal","author_inst":"Mahatma Gandhi Missions Medical College, Navi Mumbai, India"},{"author_name":"Suma Balan","author_inst":"Department of Paediatric Rheumatology,  Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences, Kochi"},{"author_name":"Vikas Agarwal","author_inst":"Professor  Department of Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences Lucknow, India, 226014"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"rheumatology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.06.20045393","rel_title":"Sudden hyposmia as a prevalent symptom of COVID-19 infection.","rel_date":"2020-04-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.06.20045393","rel_abs":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has recently caused a pandemic that has involved Italy as the second worldwide nation in terms of infected patients and deaths. The clinical manifestation of Covid-19 ranges from asymptomatic carrier status to severe pneumonia. Asymptomatic individuals in Covid-19 are those who are carriers of the virus but do not show clinical symptoms and are able to transmit the disease in the same degree as symptomatic carriers. In order to contain contagions is of supreme importance to identify asymptomatic patients because this subpopulation is one of the main factors contributing to the spread of this disease. We report on six Italian patients with COVID-19 who presented sudden hyposmia as the only or most prominent disease manifestation, without upper or lower respiratory tract involvement or other major features of the disease. A supra-threshold olfaction test confirmed the hyposmia in all patients.

The virus that first manifested in Wuhan, China has travelled across continents. The increase in number of deaths in Italy, Iran, USA, and other countries has alarmed both the developed and developing countries. Scientists are working hard to develop a vaccine against the virus, but until now no breakthrough has been achieved. India, the second most populated country in the world, is working hard in all dimensions to stop the spread of community infection. Health care facilities are being updated; medical and paramedical staffs are getting trained, and many agencies are raising awareness on the issues related to this virus and its transmission. The administration is leaving no stone unturned to prepare the country to mitigate the adverse effects. However, as the number of infected patients, and those getting cured is changing differently in different states everyday it is difficult to predict the spread of the virus and its fate in Indian context. Different states have adopted measures to stop the community spread. Considering the vast size of the country, the population size and other socio-economic conditions of the states, a single uniform policy may not work to contain the disease. In this paper, we discuss a predictive mathematical model that can give us some idea of the fate of the virus, an indicative data and future projections to understand the further course this pandemic can take. The data can be used by the health care agencies, the Government Organizations and the Planning Commission to make suitable arrangements to fight the pandemic. Though the model is preliminary, it can be used at regional level to manage the health care system in the present scenario. The recommendations can be made, and advisories prepared based on the predictive results that can be implemented at regional levels.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jyoti Bhola","author_inst":"Hansraj College, University of Delhi"},{"author_name":"Vandana Revathi Venkateswaran","author_inst":"Max Plank Institute for Evolutionary Biology, Germany"},{"author_name":"Monika Koul","author_inst":"Hansraj College, University of Delhi"},{"author_name":"Andrea Vianello","author_inst":"Department of Cardiological, Thoracic and Vascular Sciences, Respiratory Pathophysiology Unit, University of Padua, Padua, Italy"},{"author_name":"Miryam Carecchio","author_inst":"University of Padova, Department of Neurosciences, section ofNeurology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.02.20050740","rel_title":"Comparison of transmissibility of coronavirus between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients: Reanalysis of the Ningbo Covid-19 data","rel_date":"2020-04-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.02.20050740","rel_abs":"We investigate the transmissibility of coronavirus for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients using the Ningbo Covid-19 data1.

This paper aimed to pool the available data to provide a more complete picture of the characteristics of COVID-19 patients. Methods: A systematic review and pooled analysis was performed. Eligible studies were identified from database and hand searches up to March 2, 2020. Data on clinical (including laboratory and radiological) and epidemiological (including demographic) characteristics of confirmed COVID-19 cases were extracted and combined by simple pooling. Results: Of 644 studies identified, 69 studies (involving 48,926 patients) were included in the analysis. The average age of the patients was 49.16 years. A total of 51.46% of the patients were men and 52.32% were non-smokers. Hypertension (50.82%) and diabetes (20.89%) were the most frequent comorbidities observed. The most common symptoms were fever (83.21%), cough (61.74%), and myalgia or fatigue (30.22%). Altered levels of blood and biochemical parameters were observed in a proportion of the patients. Most of the patients (78.50%) had bilateral lung involvements, and 5.86% showed no CT findings indicative of viral pneumonia. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (28.36%), acute cardiac injury (7.89%) and acute kidney injury (7.60%) were the most common complications recorded. Conclusions: Clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 patients were mostly heterogeneous and non-specific. This is the most comprehensive report of the characteristics of COVID-19 patients to date. The information presented is important for improving our understanding of the spectrum and impact of this novel disease.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shing Cheng Tan","author_inst":"Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Huaqing Jin","author_inst":"Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science, The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Monika Koul","author_inst":"Hansraj College, University of Delhi"},{"author_name":"Andrea Vianello","author_inst":"Department of Cardiological, Thoracic and Vascular Sciences, Respiratory Pathophysiology Unit, University of Padua, Padua, Italy"},{"author_name":"Miryam Carecchio","author_inst":"University of Padova, Department of Neurosciences, section ofNeurology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.04.20047886","rel_title":"Timing of antiviral treatment initiation is critical to reduce SARS-Cov-2 viral load","rel_date":"2020-04-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.04.20047886","rel_abs":"We modeled the viral dynamics of 13 untreated patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 to infer viral growth parameters and predict the effects of antiviral treatments.

Results: A total of 21 studies met our inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses suggest that mask use provided a significant protective effect (OR = 0.35 and 95% CI = 0.24-0.51). Use of masks by healthcare workers (HCWs) and non-healthcare workers (Non-HCWs) can reduce the risk of respiratory virus infection by 80% (OR = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.11-0.37) and 47% (OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.36-0.79). The protective effect of wearing masks in Asia (OR = 0.31) appeared to be higher than that of Western countries (OR = 0.45). Masks had a protective effect against influenza viruses (OR = 0.55), SARS (OR = 0.26), and SARS-CoV-2 (OR = 0.04). In the subgroups based on different study designs, protective effects of wearing mask were significant in cluster randomized trials, case-control studies and retrospective studies. Conclusions: This study adds additional evidence of the enhanced protective value of masks, we stress that the use masks serve as an adjunctive method regarding the COVID-19 outbreak.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mingming Liang","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Liang Gao","author_inst":"Saarland University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ce Cheng","author_inst":"Cape Fear Valley Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Qin Zhou","author_inst":"Mayo clinic"},{"author_name":"John Patrick Uy","author_inst":"AMITA Health Saint Joseph Hospital Chicago"},{"author_name":"Kurt Heiner","author_inst":"Dignity Health Mercy Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chenyu Sun","author_inst":"AMITA Health Saint Joseph Hospital Chicago"},{"author_name":"Rui Guo","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, The 8th hospital of Xi'an"},{"author_name":"Lin Shi","author_inst":"Department of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Yanbin Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Baojun Zhang","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Jinsong Hu Hu","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Yaling Guo","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, The 8th hospital of Xi'an"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.02.20050914","rel_title":"A statistical method of batch screening entrying population from abroad by stages and groups in COVID-19 nucleic acid testing","rel_date":"2020-04-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.02.20050914","rel_abs":"Abstract Purpose: To screen for COVID-19 patients in immigration using minimal nucleic acid testing (NAT).

When the test result is negative, it means that everyone in the group is not infected and the screening of the group is complete. When the test results were positive, the group moved on to the second stage. In the second stage, all samples in the positive group will be tested individually for NAT. Results: The advantages and considerations of the method are discussed. Prevalence in the incoming population was a determinant of the sample size within the group. The lower the incidence, the larger the sample size within the group, the higher the savings in NAT and testing costs.

Objectives: Here we investigate the prevalence of loss of smell and taste among COVID-19 diagnosed individuals and we identify the combination of symptoms, besides loss of smell and taste, most likely to correspond to a positive COVID-19 diagnosis in non-severe cases. Design: Community survey. Setting and Participants: Subscribers of RADAR COVID-19, an app that was launched for use among the UK general population asking about COVID-19 symptoms. Main Exposure: Loss of smell and taste. Main Outcome Measures: COVID-19. Results: Between 24 and 29 March 2020, 1,573,103 individuals reported their symptoms via the app; 26% reported suffering from one or more symptoms of COVID-19. Of those, n=1702 reported having had a RT-PCR COVID-19 test and gave full report on symptoms including loss of smell and taste; 579 were positive and 1123 negative. In this subset, we find that loss of smell and taste were present in 59% of COVID-19 positive individuals compared to 18% of those negative to the test, yielding an odds ratio (OR) of COVID-19 diagnosis of OR[95%CI]=6.59[5.25; 8.27], P= 1.90x10-59 . We also find that a combination of loss of smell and taste, fever, persistent cough, fatigue, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and loss of appetite is predictive of COVID-19 positive test with sensitivity 0.54[0.44; 0.63], specificity 0.86[0.80; 0.90], ROC-AUC 0.77[0.72; 0.82] in the test set, and cross-validation ROC-AUC 0.75[0.72; 0.77]. When applied to the 410,598 individuals reporting symptoms but not formally tested, our model predicted that 13.06%[12.97%;13.15] of these might have been already infected by the virus. Conclusions and Relevance: Our study suggests that loss of taste and smell is a strong predictor of having been infected by the COVID-19 virus. Also, the combination of symptoms that could be used to identify and isolate individuals includes anosmia, fever, persistent cough, diarrhoea, fatigue, abdominal pain and loss of appetite. This is particularly relevant to healthcare and other key workers in constant contact with the public who have not yet been tested for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cristina Menni","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Ana Valdes","author_inst":"NIHR Nottingham Biomedical Research Centre, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Maxim B Freydin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Sajaysurya Ganesh","author_inst":"Zoe Global limited"},{"author_name":"Julia El-Sayed Moustafa","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Alessia Visconti","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Pirro Hysi","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Ruth C E Bowyer","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Massimo Mangino","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Mario Falchi","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Wolf","author_inst":"Zoe Global Limited"},{"author_name":"Claire Steves","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Tim Spector","author_inst":"King's College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.06.20052159","rel_title":"Efficient and Practical Sample Pooling High-Throughput PCR Diagnosis of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-04-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.06.20052159","rel_abs":"Diagnostic assays using quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) most commonly process patient samples one by one. While this is usually an effective and reliable method, the current efforts against the COVID-19 pandemic demand more efficient measures. Diagnostic assays can be scaled up by the method of High-Throughput qPCR via sample pooling. Pooling, the action of combining multiple samples into one tube, is most effective when the chance of positive detection of the target, SARS-CoV-2 RNA, is low. In such cases, large groups of samples can be conclusively classified as negative with a single test, with no need to individually test every sample. However, different frequencies of the target-product presence in the samples, require different pool\/batch sizes for optimal results. Here, we present two possible optimized pooling strategies for diagnostic SARSCoV-2 testing on large scales, each one better suited for a different range of target frequency. In the first, we employ a simple information-theoretic heuristic to derive a highly efficient re-pooling protocol: an estimate of the target frequency determines the initial pool size, and any subsequent pools found positive are re-pooled at half-size and tested again. In the range of very rare target (<0.05), this approach can reduce the number of necessary tests dramatically. For example, this method achieves a reduction of a factor of 50 for a target frequency of 0.001. The second method is a simpler approach of optimized one-time pooling followed by individual tests on positive pools. We show that this approach is just as efficient for moderate target-product frequencies (0.05<0.2). For example, it reduces the number of tests needed by half if the frequency of positives samples is 0.07. We show that both methods are comparable to the absolute upper-bound efficiency given by Shannon's source coding theorem. Our strategies require no investment at all, and they offer a significant reduction in the amount of equipment and time needed to test large numbers of samples. Both approaches are dynamic; they can be easily implemented in different conditions with various infection rates and sample numbers. We compare our strategies to the naive way of testing and also to alternative matrix methods. Most importantly, we offer practical pooling instructions for laboratories that perform large scale qPCR assays to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 viral particles.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Haran Shani-Narkiss","author_inst":"Center for Brain Sciences, Hebrew University of Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Omri David Gilday","author_inst":"Center for Brain Sciences, Hebrew University of Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Nadav Yayon","author_inst":"Center for Brain Sciences, Hebrew University of Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Itamar Daniel Landau","author_inst":"Center for Brain Sciences, Hebrew University of Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Julia El-Sayed Moustafa","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Alessia Visconti","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Pirro Hysi","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Ruth C E Bowyer","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Massimo Mangino","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Mario Falchi","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Wolf","author_inst":"Zoe Global Limited"},{"author_name":"Claire Steves","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Tim Spector","author_inst":"King's College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.04.20052241","rel_title":"A Systematic Meta-Analysis of CT Features of COVID-19: Lessons from Radiology","rel_date":"2020-04-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.04.20052241","rel_abs":"Several studies have been published in the past few months describing the CT features of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). There is a great degree of heterogeneity in the study designs, lesion descriptors used and conclusions derived. In our systematic analysis and meta-review, we have attempted to homogenize the reported features and provide a comprehensive view of the disease pattern and progression in different clinical stages. After an extensive literature search, we short-listed and reviewed 49 studies including over 4145 patients with 3615 RT-PCR positive cases of COVID-19 disease. We have found that there is a good agreement among these studies that diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities (GGOs) is the most common finding at all stages of the disease followed by consolidations and mixed density lesions. 78% of patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infections had either ground-glass opacities, consolidation or both. Inter-lobular septal thickening was also found to be a common feature in many patients in advanced stages. The progression of these initial patchy ground-glass opacities and consolidations to diffuse lesions with septal thickening, air bronchograms in the advanced stages, to either diffuse white-out lungs needing ICU admissions or finally resolving completely without or with residual fibrotic strips was also found to be congruent among multiple studies. Prominent juxta-lesional pulmonary vessels, pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy in RT-PCR proven cases were found to have poor clinical prognosis. Additionally, we noted wide variation in terminology used to describe lesions across studies and suggest the use of standardized lexicons to describe findings related to diseases of vital importance.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vasantha Kumar Venugopal","author_inst":"CARING, Mahajan Imaging"},{"author_name":"Vidur Mahajan","author_inst":"CARING, Mahajan Imaging"},{"author_name":"Sriram Rajan","author_inst":"CARING, Mahajan Imaging"},{"author_name":"Vikash Kumar Agarwal","author_inst":"Mahajan Imaging"},{"author_name":"Ruchika Rajan","author_inst":"Teleradiology Consultant"},{"author_name":"Salsabeel Syed","author_inst":"Mahajan Imaging"},{"author_name":"Harsh Mahajan","author_inst":"CARING, Mahajan Imaging"},{"author_name":"Ruth C E Bowyer","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Massimo Mangino","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Mario Falchi","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Wolf","author_inst":"Zoe Global Limited"},{"author_name":"Claire Steves","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Tim Spector","author_inst":"King's College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"radiology and imaging"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.02.20048793","rel_title":"A globally available COVID-19 - Template for clinical imaging studies","rel_date":"2020-04-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.02.20048793","rel_abs":"Background The pandemic spread of COVID-19 has caused worldwide implications on societies and economies. Chest computed tomography (CT) has been found to support both, current diagnostic and disease monitoring. A joint approach to collect, analyze and share clinical and imaging information about COVID-19 in the highest quality possible is urgently needed. Methods An evidence-based reporting template was developed for assessing COVID-19 pneumonia using an FDA-approved medical software. The annotation of qualitative and quantitative findings including radiomics features is performed directly on primary imaging data. For data collection, secondary information from the patient history and clinical data such as symptoms and comorbidities are queried. Results License-royalty free, cloud-based web platform and on-premise deployments are offered. Hospitals can upload, assess, report and if pseudonymized share their COVID-19 cases. The aggregation of radiomics in correlation with rt-PCR, patient history, clinical and radiological findings, systematically documented in a single database, will lead to optimized diagnosis, risk stratification and response evaluation. A customizable analytics dashboard allows the explorative real-time data analysis of imaging features and clinical information. Conclusions The COVID-19-Template is based on a systematic, computer-assisted and context-guided approach to collect, analyze and share data. Epidemiological and clinical studies for therapies and vaccine candidates can be implemented in compliance with high data quality, integrity and traceability.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gabriel Alexander Salg","author_inst":"University Hospital Heidelberg, Department of Surgery, New Technologies and Data Science, Heidelberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Maria Katharina Ganten","author_inst":"Mint Medical GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Matthias Baumhauer","author_inst":"Mint Medical GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Claus Peter Heussel","author_inst":"University Hospital Heidelberg, Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, Heidelberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jens Kleesiek","author_inst":"German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Department of Radiology, Computational Radiology, Heidelberg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Salsabeel Syed","author_inst":"Mahajan Imaging"},{"author_name":"Harsh Mahajan","author_inst":"CARING, Mahajan Imaging"},{"author_name":"Ruth C E Bowyer","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Massimo Mangino","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Mario Falchi","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Wolf","author_inst":"Zoe Global Limited"},{"author_name":"Claire Steves","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Tim Spector","author_inst":"King's College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"radiology and imaging"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.01.20050443","rel_title":"Can N95 respirators be reused after disinfection?

Heating can be applied up to 50 cycles (85 {degrees}C, 30% RH) without observation in the degradation of meltblown filtration performance. Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation was a secondary choice which was able to withstand 10 cycles of treatment and showed small degradation by 20 cycles. However, UV can also potentially impact the material strength and fit of respirators. Finally, treatments involving liquids and vapors require caution, as steam, alcohol, and household bleach may all lead to degradation of the filtration efficiency, leaving the user vulnerable to the viral aerosols.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lei Liao","author_inst":"4C Air, inc."},{"author_name":"Wang Xiao","author_inst":"4C Air, Inc."},{"author_name":"Mervin Zhao","author_inst":"4C Air, Inc."},{"author_name":"Xuanze Yu","author_inst":"4C Air, Inc."},{"author_name":"Haotian Wang","author_inst":"4C Air, Inc."},{"author_name":"Qiqi Wang","author_inst":"4C Air, Inc."},{"author_name":"Steven Chu","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Yi Cui","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Massimo Mangino","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Mario Falchi","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Wolf","author_inst":"Zoe Global Limited"},{"author_name":"Claire Steves","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Tim Spector","author_inst":"King's College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"occupational and environmental health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.05.20053983","rel_title":"Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 infection in pregnant women: a systematic review and meta-analysis","rel_date":"2020-04-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.05.20053983","rel_abs":"Background: On December 2019, Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was detected in Wuhan, China, and then spread around the world.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that RT-PCR has the sensitivity to detect one positive case in a mixed sample 32 cases [9]. In this paper we propose non-adaptive and adaptive group testing strategies based on generalized binary splitting (GBS) [2] where we restrict the group test to the largest group that can be used. The method starts by choosing a group from the population to be tested, performing a test on the combined sample from the entire group and progressively splitting the group further into subgroups. Compared to individual testing at 4% prevalence we save 74% at 1% we save 91% and at 1% we save 97% of tests. We analyze the number of times each sample is used and show the method is still efficient if we resort to testing a case individually if the sample is running low. Abstract In addition we recommend clinical screening to filter out individuals with symptoms and show this leaves us with a population with lower prevalence. Our approach is particularly applicable to vulnerable confined populations such as nursing homes, prisons, military ships and cruise ships.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cassidy Mentus","author_inst":"University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Martin Romeo","author_inst":"Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolina"},{"author_name":"Christian DiPaola","author_inst":"UMass Memorial"},{"author_name":"Ying Huang","author_inst":"The Second Hospital of Nanjing, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Te Miao","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Hui-Ling Yen","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Shenglan Xiao","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Lunbiao Cui","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xiaosong Wu","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Wei Shao","author_inst":"The Second Hospital of Nanjing, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yan Song","author_inst":"The Second Hospital of Nanjing, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Li Sha","author_inst":"The Second Hospital of Nanjing, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lian Zhou","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yan Xu","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Baoli Zhu","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yuguo Li","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.05.20054155","rel_title":"The relationship of COVID-19 severity with cardiovascular disease and its traditional risk factors: A systematic review and meta-analysis","rel_date":"2020-04-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.05.20054155","rel_abs":"Background: Whether cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its traditional risk factors predict severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is uncertain, in part, because of potential confounding by age and sex. Methods: We performed a systematic review of studies that explored pre-existing CVD and its traditional risk factors as risk factors of severe COVID-19 (defined as death, acute respiratory distress syndrome, mechanical ventilation, or intensive care unit admission). We searched PubMed and Embase for papers in English with original data ([&ge;]10 cases of severe COVID-19). Using random-effects models, we pooled relative risk (RR) estimates and conducted meta-regression analyses. Results: Of the 661 publications identified in our search, 25 papers met our inclusion criteria, with 76,638 COVID-19 patients including 11,766 severe cases. Older age was consistently associated with severe COVID-19 in all eight eligible studies, with RR >~5 in >60-65 vs. <50 years. Three studies showed no change in the RR of age after adjusting for covariate(s). In univariate analyses, factors robustly associated with severe COVID-19 were male sex (10 studies; pooled RR=1.73, [95%CI 1.50-2.01]), hypertension (8 studies; 2.87 [2.09-3.93]), diabetes (9 studies; 3.20 [2.26-4.53]), and CVD (10 studies; 4.97 [3.76-6.58]). RR for male sex was likely to be independent of age. For the other three factors, meta-regression analyses suggested confounding by age. Only four studies reported multivariable analysis, but most of them showed adjusted RR ~2 for hypertension, diabetes, and CVD. No study explored renin-angiotensin system inhibitors as a risk factor for severe COVID-19. Conclusions: Despite the potential for confounding, these results suggest that hypertension, diabetes, and CVD are independently associated with severe COVID-19 and, together with age and male sex, can be used to inform objective decisions on COVID-19 testing, clinical management, and workforce planning.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kunihiro Matsushita","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Ning Ding","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Minghao Kou","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Xiao Hu","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Mengkun Chen","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Yumin Gao","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Yasuyuki Honda","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"David Dowdy","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Yejin Mok","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Junichi Ishigami","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Lawrence J Appel","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Li Sha","author_inst":"The Second Hospital of Nanjing, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lian Zhou","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yan Xu","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Baoli Zhu","author_inst":"Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yuguo Li","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.05.20051540","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 titers in wastewater are higher than expected from clinically confirmed cases","rel_date":"2020-04-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.05.20051540","rel_abs":"Wastewater surveillance may represent a complementary approach to measure the presence and even prevalence of infectious diseases when the capacity for clinical testing is limited.

Adapting the classical epidemic modelling framework, two distinct routes of COVID-19 transmission are incorporated into a model: (a) direct person-to-person contact transmission, and (b) indirect airborne and fomites-driven transmission. The indirect non-contact transmission route needs to explored in models of COVID-19 spread, because evidences show that this route of transmission is entirely viable with hugely uncertain level of relative contribution. This theoretical study based on model simulations demonstrates the following: (1) Not incorporating indirect transmission route in the model leads to underestimation of the basic reproduction number, and hence will impact on the COVID-19 mitigation decisions; (2) Lockdown measures can suppress the primary infection peak, but will lead to a secondary peak whose relative strength and time of occurrence depend on the success and duration of the lockdown measures; (3) To make lockdown effective, a considerable level of reduction in both contact and non-contact transmission rates over a long period is required; (4) To bring down the infection cases below any hypothetical health-care capacity, reduction of non-contact transmission rate is key, and hence active measures should be taken to reduce non-contact transmission (e.g., extensive uses of areal and aerosol disinfectant in public spaces to improve contaminated surfaces and air); (5) Any premature withdrawal of lockdown following the sign of a brief retracement in the infection cases can backfire, and can lead to a quicker, sharper and higher secondary peak, due to reactivation of the two transmission routes. Based on these results, this study recommends that any exit policy from lockdown, should take into account the level of transmission reduction in both routes, the absolute scale of which will vary among countries depending on their health-service capacity, but should be computed using accurate time-series data on infection cases and transmission rates.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shovonlal Roy","author_inst":"University of Reading"},{"author_name":"Mehak Arora","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Vishwesh Bharadiya","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Parul Berry","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Mudit Agarwal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Mohak Gupta","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Giridara Gopal Parameswaran","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Priyamadhaba Behera","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences Raebareli"},{"author_name":"Newsha Ghaeli","author_inst":"Biobot Analytics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Noriko Endo","author_inst":"Biobot Analytics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Claire Duvallet","author_inst":"Biobot Analytics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Katya Moniz","author_inst":"Center for Microbiome Informatics and Therapeutics, Departments of Biological Engineering and Civil & Environmental Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Tech"},{"author_name":"Timothy Erickson","author_inst":"Division of Medical Toxicology, Department of Emergency Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Peter Chai","author_inst":"Division of Medical Toxicology, Department of Emergency Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Janelle Thompson","author_inst":"Singapore Center for Environmental Life Sciences Engineering, Asian School of the Environment, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Eric Alm","author_inst":"Center for Microbiome Informatics and Therapeutics, Department of Biological Engineering and Civil & Environmental Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Techn"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.04.20050427","rel_title":"Fast spread of COVID-19 in Europe and the US and its implications: even modest public health goals require comprehensive intervention","rel_date":"2020-04-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.04.20050427","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic caused more than 800,000 infections and 40,000 deaths by the end of March 2020.

We developed an inference approach to control for confounding factors in data collection, such as under-reporting and changes in surveillance intensities, and fitted a mathematical model to infection and death count data collected from eight European countries and the US. In all countries, the early epidemic grew exponentially at rates between 0.19-0.29\/day (epidemic doubling times between 2.4-3.7 days). This suggests a highly infectious virus with an R0 likely between 4.0 and 7.1. We show that similar levels of intervention efforts are needed, no matter the goal is mitigation or containment.

The objective of this study was to predict the risk of positive COVID-19 diagnosis with machine learning, using as predictors only results from emergency care admission exams. We collected data from a sample of 235 adult patients from the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein in Sao Paulo, Brazil, from 17 to 30 of March, 2020, of which 102 (43%) received a positive diagnosis of COVID-19 from RT-PCR tests. Five machine learning algorithms (neural networks, random forests, gradient boosting trees, logistic regression and support vector machines) were trained on a random sample of 70% of the patients, and performance was tested on new unseen data (30%). The best predictive performance was obtained by the support vector machines algorithm (AUC: 0.85; Sensitivity: 0.68; Specificity: 0.85; Brier Score: 0.16). In conclusion, we found that targeted decisions for receiving COVID-19 tests using only routinely-collected data is a promising new area with the use of machine learning algorithms.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andre Filipe de Moraes Batista","author_inst":"Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein"},{"author_name":"Joao Luiz Miraglia","author_inst":"Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein"},{"author_name":"Thiago Henrique Rizzi Donato","author_inst":"Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Dias Porto Chiavegatto Filho","author_inst":"School of Public Health of the University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Mudit Agarwal","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Mohak Gupta","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Giridara Gopal Parameswaran","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Priyamadhaba Behera","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences Raebareli"},{"author_name":"Newsha Ghaeli","author_inst":"Biobot Analytics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Noriko Endo","author_inst":"Biobot Analytics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Claire Duvallet","author_inst":"Biobot Analytics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Katya Moniz","author_inst":"Center for Microbiome Informatics and Therapeutics, Departments of Biological Engineering and Civil & Environmental Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Tech"},{"author_name":"Timothy Erickson","author_inst":"Division of Medical Toxicology, Department of Emergency Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Peter Chai","author_inst":"Division of Medical Toxicology, Department of Emergency Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Janelle Thompson","author_inst":"Singapore Center for Environmental Life Sciences Engineering, Asian School of the Environment, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Eric Alm","author_inst":"Center for Microbiome Informatics and Therapeutics, Department of Biological Engineering and Civil & Environmental Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Techn"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.03.20051847","rel_title":"Reduction in time delay of isolation in COVID-19 cases in South Korea","rel_date":"2020-04-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.03.20051847","rel_abs":"Korean public health authorities raised the public alert to its highest level on February 23, 2020 to mitigate the 2019 novel coronavirus disease epidemic.

To minimize any systematic effects of reporting biases, we analyzed the rate of the day-by-day increase in both confirmed cases and deaths in the first 30-day period of country-wise outbreaks. The 30-day window was adjusted to begin at the country-wise onset of the pandemic. Linear mixed models revealed a significant effect of mandated BCG policies on the growth rate of both cases and deaths after controlling for median age, gross domestic product per capita, population density, population size, net migration rate, and various cultural dimensions (e.g., individualism and the tightness vs. looseness of social norms).

Research Design and Methods: The Stochastic Simulation Model was built using the EpiModel package in R. As a proof of concept study, we ran the simulation on Kasaragod, the most affected district in Kerala. We added 3 compartments to the SEIR model to obtain a SEIQHRF (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Quarantined-Hospitalised-Recovered-Fatal) model. Results: Implementing SD only delayed the appearance of peak prevalence of COVID-19 cases. Doubling of hospital beds could not reduce the fatal cases probably due to its overwhelming number compared to the hospital beds. Increasing detection rates could significantly flatten the curve and reduce the peak prevalence of cases (increasing detection rate by 5 times could reduce case number to half). Conclusions: An effective strategy to contain the epidemic spread of COVID-19 in India is to increase detection rates in combination with SD measures and increase in hospital beds.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pramit Ghosh","author_inst":"Purulia Government Medical College, Purulia, West Bengal, India"},{"author_name":"Salah Basheer","author_inst":"Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Kozhikode, Kerala, India"},{"author_name":"Sandip Paul","author_inst":"CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology"},{"author_name":"Partha Chakrabarti","author_inst":"CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology"},{"author_name":"Jit Sarkar","author_inst":"CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology"},{"author_name":"Mohak Gupta","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Giridara Gopal Parameswaran","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Priyamadhaba Behera","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences Raebareli"},{"author_name":"Newsha Ghaeli","author_inst":"Biobot Analytics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Noriko Endo","author_inst":"Biobot Analytics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Claire Duvallet","author_inst":"Biobot Analytics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Katya Moniz","author_inst":"Center for Microbiome Informatics and Therapeutics, Departments of Biological Engineering and Civil & Environmental Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Tech"},{"author_name":"Timothy Erickson","author_inst":"Division of Medical Toxicology, Department of Emergency Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Peter Chai","author_inst":"Division of Medical Toxicology, Department of Emergency Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Janelle Thompson","author_inst":"Singapore Center for Environmental Life Sciences Engineering, Asian School of the Environment, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Eric Alm","author_inst":"Center for Microbiome Informatics and Therapeutics, Department of Biological Engineering and Civil & Environmental Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Techn"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.06.20053918","rel_title":"Thoughts on Higher Medical Education Under Major Public Health Emergencies: Thinking Ahead After COVID-19 Outbreak","rel_date":"2020-04-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.06.20053918","rel_abs":"Objective: To explore the most suitable teaching and learning pattern in medical school during COVID-19 Outbreak. Design: This study is a case-control study. We had tried to apply a new blended teaching model based on 5G network that combined team-based learning (TBL) and online interaction to the students before the outbreak and then universities responded to the COVID-19 outbreak by closing campuses and shifting to other forms of distance learning. In other word, the courses started using blended teaching model before COVID-19 outbreak and might last using other forms of distance learning throughout the pandemic. Five Point Likert Scale Questionnaires which contains 20 items were used, and the effect of the two kinds of teaching patterns was compared by evaluating the indicators of core competencies of students including professionalism, attitude towards learning, knowledge and learning skills, teamwork skills, motivation in learning, adaptability and acceptance of the courses and network environment. Setting: Our study based on a single center. Participants: Fifty fourth-year medical students receiving the 5+3 pattern courses regarding internal medicine were enrolled in the study. Exposure(s) :The teaching and learning patter started using blended teaching model before COVID-19 outbreak and might last using other forms of distance learning throughout the pandemic. Main Outcome: According to the descriptive statistical analysis of the first part of the questionnaire (question 1-16), the average score of adaptability and acceptance of the courses is 2.60 lower than 3, indicating that students are more adapted to other forms of distance learning during COVID-19 outbreak; the average score of the rest of the questions is higher than 3, indicating that blended teaching model based on 5G network is superior to other forms of distance learning. The number of male students who are inclined to the blended teaching model based on 5G network is 0.13 times as much as that of female students (95%CI:0.028~0.602, p=0.009). Results: Online forms of distance learning were accepted by the students. Female students had higher expectations on the course and were more likely to adapt well to the change during the COVID-19 outbreak. However, all students preferred the blended teaching model based on 5G network that combined team-based learning (TBL) and online interaction before the pandemic.
