A very large group of patients infected by HBV has been reported worldwide, especially in China. In order to answer whether specific treatment strategy on the patients coinfected with HBV and SARS-CoV-2, it requires profound understanding of the clinical characteristics on those patients. However, the impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection on HBV patients remain largely unknown. Approach & Results In this retrospective investigation, we included 123 COVID-19 patients admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from January 5 to March 7, 2020. All enrolled patients are the laboratory confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia cases according to the criteria reported previously. A total of 123 patients were analyzed for their Clinical records, laboratory results including the diagnosis of HBV infection and liver function. Among 123 confirmed COVID-19 patients, the mean age was 51 years old and 59.3% were females (73\/123). Fifteen were previously HBV infected patients, 66.7% of them were males (10\/15), patients with HBV infection appeared to have a higher incidence of liver cirrhosis and an increased level of total bilirubin. Seven (46.7%) patients with HBV infection were defined as severe cases, while the severity rate was 24.1% for the patients without HBV infection (26\/108). The mortality of patients with HBV infection was 13.3% (2\/15) compared to 2.8% (3\/108) for the patients without HBV infection. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 infection may cause liver function damage in COVID-19 cases and the patients with HBV infection are likely to have more severe disease outcome.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaoping Chen","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Qunqun Jiang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhiyong Ma","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Jiaxin Ling","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biochemistry and Microbiology, Zoonosis Science Center, University of Uppsala"},{"author_name":"Wenjia Hu","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Qian Cao","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Pingzheng Mo","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Rongrong Yang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Shicheng Gao","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xien Gui","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yong Xiong","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Jinlin Li","author_inst":"Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Karolinska Institutet, 171 65, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Yongxi Zhang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.26.20042184","rel_title":"Serological diagnostic kit of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using CHO-expressed full-length SARS-CoV-2 S1 proteins","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.26.20042184","rel_abs":"WHO has declared COVID-19 a pandemic with more than 300,000 confirmed cases and more than 14,000 deaths. There is urgent need for accurate and rapid diagnostic kits. Here we report the development and validation of a COVID-19\/SARS-CoV-2 S1 serology ELISA kit for the detection of total anti-virus antibody (IgG+IgM) titers in sera from either the general population or patients suspected to be infected. For indirect ELISA, CHO-expressed recombinant full length SARS-CoV-2-S1 protein with 6*His tag was used as the coating antigen to capture the SARS-CoV-2-S1 antibodies specifically. The specificity of the ELISA kit was determined to be 97.5%, as examined against total 412 normal human sera including 257 samples collected prior to the outbreak and 155 collected during the outbreak. The sensitivity of the ELISA kit was determined to be 97.5% by testing against 69 samples from hospitalized and\/or recovered COVID-19 patients. The overall accuracy rate reached 97.3%. Most importantly, in one case study, the ELISA test kit was able to identify an infected person who had previously been quarantined for 14 days after coming into contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient, and discharged after testing negative twice by nucleic acid test. With the assays developed here, we can screen millions of medical staffs in the hospitals and people in residential complex, schools, public transportations, and business parks in the epidemic centers of the outbreaks to fish out the \"innocent viral spreaders\", and help to stop the further spreading of the virus.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rongqing Zhao","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Maohua Li","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Hao Song","author_inst":"Research Network of Immunity and Health (RNIH)"},{"author_name":"Jianxin Chen","author_inst":"Zhenge Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Wenlin Ren","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Yingmei Feng","author_inst":"Beijing You an Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jin-Wen Song","author_inst":"The Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ya Peng","author_inst":"Research Network of Immunity and Health (RNIH)"},{"author_name":"Bin Su","author_inst":"Beijing You an Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xianghua Guo","author_inst":"Beijing You an Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yanjun Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Hepatology"},{"author_name":"Jingong Chen","author_inst":"Zhenge Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Jianli Li","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Hunter Sun","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Zhonghu Bai","author_inst":"School of Biotechnology, Jiangnan University"},{"author_name":"Wen Jing Cao","author_inst":"Bengbu Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jin Zhu","author_inst":"Quzhou People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qinlu Zhang","author_inst":"ShaanXi Provincial Engineering Research Center for Nano-BioMedical Detection"},{"author_name":"Yufei Sun","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Sean Sun","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Xinkun Mao","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Junchi Su","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Hui Chen","author_inst":"School of Biotechnology, Jiangnan Univ"},{"author_name":"Ailiang He","author_inst":"Zhenge Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Ronghua Jin","author_inst":"Beijing You an Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Le Sun","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.22.20040642","rel_title":"The Effect of Large-Scale Anti-Contagion Policies on the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.22.20040642","rel_abs":"Governments around the world are responding to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic with unprecedented policies designed to slow the growth rate of infections. Many actions, such as closing schools and restricting populations to their homes, impose large and visible costs on society, but their benefits cannot be directly observed and are currently understood only through process-based simulations. Here, we compile new data on 1,717 local, regional, and national non-pharmaceutical interventions deployed in the ongoing pandemic across localities in China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, France, and the United States (US). We then apply reduced-form econometric methods, commonly used to measure the effect of policies on economic growth, to empirically evaluate the effect that these anti-contagion policies have had on the growth rate of infections. In the absence of policy actions, we estimate that early infections of COVID-19 exhibit exponential growth rates of roughly 38% per day. We find that anti-contagion policies have significantly and substantially slowed this growth. Some policies have different impacts on different populations, but we obtain consistent evidence that the policy packages now deployed are achieving large, beneficial, and measurable health outcomes. We estimate that across these six countries, interventions prevented or delayed on the order of 62 million confirmed cases, corresponding to averting roughly 530 million total infections. These findings may help inform whether or when these policies should be deployed, intensified, or lifted, and they can support decision-making in the other 180+ countries where COVID-19 has been reported.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Solomon Hsiang","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Daniel Allen","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Annan-Phan","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Kendon Bell","author_inst":"Manaaki Whenua Landcare Research"},{"author_name":"Ian Bolliger","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Trinetta Chong","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Hannah Druckenmiller","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Andrew Hultgren","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Luna Yue Huang","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Emma Krasovich","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Peiley Lau","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Jaecheol Lee","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Esther Rolf","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Jeanette Tseng","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Tiffany Wu","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Wen Jing Cao","author_inst":"Bengbu Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jin Zhu","author_inst":"Quzhou People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qinlu Zhang","author_inst":"ShaanXi Provincial Engineering Research Center for Nano-BioMedical Detection"},{"author_name":"Yufei Sun","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Sean Sun","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Xinkun Mao","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Junchi Su","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Hui Chen","author_inst":"School of Biotechnology, Jiangnan Univ"},{"author_name":"Ailiang He","author_inst":"Zhenge Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Ronghua Jin","author_inst":"Beijing You an Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Le Sun","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.21.20040667","rel_title":"COVID-19 in Canada: Predictions for the future and control lessons from Asia","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.21.20040667","rel_abs":"COVID-19 has spread with unequal efficiency in various parts of the world. In several European countries including Italy, the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases has followed a consistent, exponential pattern of spread. However, some countries, notably Taiwan and Hong Kong, have achieved a different outcome and have managed to bring the COVID-19 outbreak in their countries rapidly under control, without entering the exponential pattern and with very few cases. They have used several different approaches to COVID-19 outbreak control, including the innovative use of smartphone technology and the widespread use of surgical face masks. We show through our models, that Canada has followed the same, consistent COVID-19 exponential growth pattern that is seen in Italy. Both nationally and in its most heavily affected provinces, there is exponential growth of COVID-19 cases, making it possible to make predictions for the future, if no further interventions are made in public health policy. In particular, we argue for the urgent introduction of surgical face masks in health care and other settings and the harnessing of the power of smartphone technology on a national scale.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cornelius Christian","author_inst":"Brock University"},{"author_name":"Francis Christian","author_inst":"University of Saskatchewan"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Annan-Phan","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Kendon Bell","author_inst":"Manaaki Whenua Landcare Research"},{"author_name":"Ian Bolliger","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Trinetta Chong","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Hannah Druckenmiller","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Andrew Hultgren","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Luna Yue Huang","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Emma Krasovich","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Peiley Lau","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Jaecheol Lee","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Esther Rolf","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Jeanette Tseng","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Tiffany Wu","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Wen Jing Cao","author_inst":"Bengbu Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jin Zhu","author_inst":"Quzhou People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qinlu Zhang","author_inst":"ShaanXi Provincial Engineering Research Center for Nano-BioMedical Detection"},{"author_name":"Yufei Sun","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Sean Sun","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Xinkun Mao","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Junchi Su","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Hui Chen","author_inst":"School of Biotechnology, Jiangnan Univ"},{"author_name":"Ailiang He","author_inst":"Zhenge Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Ronghua Jin","author_inst":"Beijing You an Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Le Sun","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.23.20041913","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 infection in 86 healthcare workers in two Dutch hospitals in March 2020","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.23.20041913","rel_abs":"Background On February 27, 2020, the first patient with COVID-19 was reported in the Netherlands. During the following weeks, nine healthcare workers (HCWs) were diagnosed with COVID-19 in two Dutch teaching hospitals, eight of whom had no history of travel to China or Northern-Italy. A low-threshold screening regimen was implemented to determine the prevalence and clinical presentation of COVID-19 among HCWs in these two hospitals. Methods HCWs who suffered from fever or respiratory symptoms were voluntarily tested for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR on oropharyngeal samples. Structured interviews were conducted to document symptoms for all HCWs with confirmed COVID-19. Findings Thirteen-hundred fifty-three (14%) of 9,705 HCWs employed were tested, 86 (6%) of whom were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Most HCWs suffered from relatively mild disease and only 46 (53%) reported fever. Seventy-nine (92%) HCWs met a case definition of fever and\/or coughing and\/or shortness of breath. None of the HCWs identified through the screening reported a travel history to China or Northern Italy, and 3 (3%) reported to have been exposed to an inpatient known with COVID-19 prior to the onset of symptoms. Interpretation Within two weeks after the first Dutch case was detected, a substantial proportion of HCWs with fever or respiratory symptoms were infected with SARS-CoV-2, probably caused by acquisition of the virus in the community during the early phase of local spread. The high prevalence of mild clinical presentations, frequently not including fever, asks for less stringent use of the currently recommended case-definition for suspected COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marjolein Kluytmans","author_inst":"Amphia Hospital"},{"author_name":"Anton Buiting","author_inst":"Elisabeth-TweeSteden Hospital"},{"author_name":"Suzan Pas","author_inst":"Bravis Hospital"},{"author_name":"Robbert Bentvelsen","author_inst":"Amphia Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wouter van den Bijllaardt","author_inst":"Amphia Hospital"},{"author_name":"Anne van Oudheusden","author_inst":"Elisabeth-TweeSteden Hospital"},{"author_name":"Miranda van Rijen","author_inst":"Amphia Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jaco Verweij","author_inst":"Elisabeth-TweeSteden Hospital"},{"author_name":"Marion Koopmans","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jan Kluytmans","author_inst":"Amphia Hospital"},{"author_name":"Peiley Lau","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Jaecheol Lee","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Esther Rolf","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Jeanette Tseng","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Tiffany Wu","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Wen Jing Cao","author_inst":"Bengbu Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jin Zhu","author_inst":"Quzhou People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qinlu Zhang","author_inst":"ShaanXi Provincial Engineering Research Center for Nano-BioMedical Detection"},{"author_name":"Yufei Sun","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Sean Sun","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Xinkun Mao","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Junchi Su","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Hui Chen","author_inst":"School of Biotechnology, Jiangnan Univ"},{"author_name":"Ailiang He","author_inst":"Zhenge Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Ronghua Jin","author_inst":"Beijing You an Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Le Sun","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.23.20040493","rel_title":"Modelling SARS-CoV-2 Dynamics: Implications for Therapy","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.23.20040493","rel_abs":"The scientific community is focussed on developing antiviral therapies to mitigate the impacts of the ongoing novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak. This will be facilitated by improved understanding of viral dynamics within infected hosts. Here, using a mathematical model in combination with published viral load data collected from the same specimen (throat \/ nasal swabs or nasopharyngeal \/ sputum \/ tracheal aspirate), we compare within-host dynamics for patients infected in the current outbreak with analogous dynamics for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infections. Our quantitative analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics are more severe than those for mild cases of MERS-CoV, but are similar to severe cases, and that the viral dynamics of SARS-CoV infection are similar to those of MERS-CoV in mild cases but not in severe case. Consequently, SARS-CoV-2 generates infection dynamics that are more severe than SARS-CoV. Furthermore, we used our viral dynamics model to predict the effectiveness of unlicensed drugs that have different methods of action. The effectiveness was measured by AUC of viral load. Our results indicated that therapies that block de novo infections or virus production are most likely to be effective if initiated before the peak viral load (which occurs around three days after symptom onset on average), but therapies that promote cytotoxicity are likely to have only limited effects. Our unique mathematical approach provides insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in humans, which are useful for development of antiviral therapies.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kwang Su Kim","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"},{"author_name":"Keisuke Ejima","author_inst":"Indiana University"},{"author_name":"Yusuke Ito","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"},{"author_name":"Shoya Iwanami","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"},{"author_name":"Hirofumi Ohashi","author_inst":"Department of Virology II, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Yoshiki Koizumi","author_inst":"National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Yusuke Asai","author_inst":"National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Shinji Nakaoka","author_inst":"Faculty of Advanced Life Science, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Koichi Watashi","author_inst":"Department of Virology II, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Robin N Thompson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Shingo Iwami","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"},{"author_name":"Jaecheol Lee","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Esther Rolf","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Jeanette Tseng","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Tiffany Wu","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Wen Jing Cao","author_inst":"Bengbu Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jin Zhu","author_inst":"Quzhou People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qinlu Zhang","author_inst":"ShaanXi Provincial Engineering Research Center for Nano-BioMedical Detection"},{"author_name":"Yufei Sun","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Sean Sun","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Xinkun Mao","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Junchi Su","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Hui Chen","author_inst":"School of Biotechnology, Jiangnan Univ"},{"author_name":"Ailiang He","author_inst":"Zhenge Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Ronghua Jin","author_inst":"Beijing You an Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Le Sun","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.23.20040501","rel_title":"Climate affects global patterns of COVID-19 early outbreak dynamics","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.23.20040501","rel_abs":"Environmental factors, including seasonal climatic variability, can strongly impact on spatio-temporal patterns of infectious disease outbreaks, but relationships between Covid-19 dynamics and climate remain controversial.

After propensity score matching with demographics, the clinical and laboratory characteristics of parturients with or without COVID-19 were analysed. The anaesthetic regimen and clinical outcomes of themselves and their infants were compared in these two groups of parturients. Results: A total of 1,588 patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection undergoing cesarean delivery were retrospectively included. After achieving a balanced cohort through propensity score matching, 89 patients (COVID-19 group), who were diagnosed with COVID-19 by SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test and CT scan matched with 173 patients without COVID-19 (Control group). The SARS-CoV-2 infected parturients in the early stages of COVID-19 outbreak was much more than during the later stage. The main clinical characteristics of parturients with COVID-19 were fever (34.8%), cough (33.7%), an increased plasma CRP (52.8%) and a decreased lymphocyte counting (33.7%). A high rate of emergency and a high incidence of anaesthesia-related complications, such as pharyngalgia, multiple puncture, intraoperative hypotension, nausea, vomiting, vertigo and chills in the COVID-19 parturients. In addition, the parturients with COVID-19 had a long duration of operation and hospital stay, and an increased intraoperative oxytocin utilization and postoperative oxygen therapy. The newborns from the SARS-CoV-2 infected mothers, who received general anaesthesia, had a high risk of Apgar score [&le;]8 at 1 and 5 minutes after delivery and a higher rate of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission. Conclusions: Anaesthesia-related complications occur more frequently in the COVID-19 parturients and their newborns have a high risk of distress.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yuan Zhang","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Rong Chen","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Jie Wang","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology,"},{"author_name":"Yuan Gong","author_inst":"Yichang Central People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qin Zhou","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Hui-hui Cheng","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhong-yuan Xia","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xiangdong Chen","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Qing-tao Meng","author_inst":"Department of Anaesthesiology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Daqing Ma","author_inst":"Imperial College London, Chelsea & Westminster Hospital"},{"author_name":"Na Li","author_inst":"Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Hubei Province"},{"author_name":"Jaecheol Lee","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Esther Rolf","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Jeanette Tseng","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Tiffany Wu","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Wen Jing Cao","author_inst":"Bengbu Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jin Zhu","author_inst":"Quzhou People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qinlu Zhang","author_inst":"ShaanXi Provincial Engineering Research Center for Nano-BioMedical Detection"},{"author_name":"Yufei Sun","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Sean Sun","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Xinkun Mao","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Junchi Su","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Hui Chen","author_inst":"School of Biotechnology, Jiangnan Univ"},{"author_name":"Ailiang He","author_inst":"Zhenge Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Ronghua Jin","author_inst":"Beijing You an Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Le Sun","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"anesthesia"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.22.20040949","rel_title":"Quantifying treatment effects of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for COVID-19: a secondary analysis of an open label non-randomized clinical trial (Gautret et al, 2020)","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.22.20040949","rel_abs":"Human infections with a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) were first identified via syndromic surveillance in December of 2019 in Wuhan China.

An open-label clinical trial has just concluded, suggesting improved resolution of viremia with use of two existing therapies: hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as monotherapy, and in combination with azithromycin (HCQ-AZ). The results of this important trial have major implications for global policy in the rapid scale-up and response to this pandemic. The authors present results with p-values for differences in proportions between the study arms, but their analysis is not able to provide effect size estimates. To address this gap, more modern analytical methods including survival models, have been applied to these data, and show modest to no impact of HCQ treatment, with more significant effects from the HCQ-AZ combination, potentially suggesting a role for co-infections in COVID-19 pathogenesis. The trial of Gautret and colleagues, with consideration of the effect sizes, and p-values from multiple models, does not provide sufficient evidence to support wide-scale rollout of HCQ monotherapy for the treatment of COVID-19; larger randomized studies should be considered.

We find that the lockdown of Wuhan reduced inflow into Wuhan by 76.64%, outflows from Wuhan by 56.35%, and within-Wuhan movements by 54.15%. We also estimate the dynamic effects of up to 22 lagged population inflows from Wuhan and other Hubei cities, the epicenter of the 2019-nCoV outbreak, on the destination cities' new infection cases. We find, using simulations with these estimates, that the lockdown of the city of Wuhan on January 23, 2020 contributed significantly to reducing the total infection cases outside of Wuhan, even with the social distancing measures later imposed by other cities. We find that the COVID-19 cases would be 64.81% higher in the 347 Chinese cities outside Hubei province, and 52.64% higher in the 16 non-Wuhan cities inside Hubei, in the counterfactual world in which the city of Wuhan were not locked down from January 23, 2020. We also find that there were substantial undocumented infection cases in the early days of the 2019-nCoV outbreak in Wuhan and other cities of Hubei province, but over time, the gap between the officially reported cases and our estimated \"actual\" cases narrows significantly.

Fast diagnosis of COVID-19, and finding high-risk patients with worse prognosis for early prevention and medical resources optimization is important. Here, we proposed a fully automatic deep learning system for COVID-19 diagnostic and prognostic analysis by routinely used computed tomography. We retrospectively collected 5372 patients with computed tomography images from 7 cities or provinces. Firstly, 4106 patients with computed tomography images and gene information were used to pre-train the DL system, making it learn lung features. Afterwards, 1266 patients (924 with COVID-19, and 471 had follow-up for 5+ days; 342 with other pneumonia) from 6 cities or provinces were enrolled to train and externally validate the performance of the deep learning system. In the 4 external validation sets, the deep learning system achieved good performance in identifying COVID-19 from other pneumonia (AUC=0.87 and 0.88) and viral pneumonia (AUC=0.86). Moreover, the deep learning system succeeded to stratify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups whose hospital-stay time have significant difference (p=0.013 and 0.014). Without human-assistance, the deep learning system automatically focused on abnormal areas that showed consistent characteristics with reported radiological findings. Deep learning provides a convenient tool for fast screening COVID-19 and finding potential high-risk patients, which may be helpful for medical resource optimization and early prevention before patients show severe symptoms.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shuo Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Big Data-Based Precision Medicine, School of Medicine and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, 100191, China."},{"author_name":"Yunfei Zha","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Hubei, 430060, China."},{"author_name":"Weimin Li","author_inst":"Department of respiratory and critical care medicine, West China hospital of Sichuan University, Sichuan, 610041, China."},{"author_name":"Qingxia Wu","author_inst":"College of Medicine and Biomedical Information Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning 110819, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaohu Li","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Anhui 230022, China."},{"author_name":"Meng Niu","author_inst":"Department of Interventional Radiology, the First Hospital of China Medical University, Liaoning 110001, China."},{"author_name":"Meiyun Wang","author_inst":"Department of Medical Imaging, Henan Provincial Peoples Hospital and the Peoples Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450003, Henan, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaoming Qiu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Huangshi Central Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Hubei Polytechnic University, Edong Healthcare Group, Hubei, 435000, China."},{"author_name":"Hongjun Li","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100069, China."},{"author_name":"He Yu","author_inst":"Department of respiratory and critical care medicine, West China hospital of Sichuan University, Sichuan, 610041, China."},{"author_name":"Wei Gong","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Hubei, 430060, China."},{"author_name":"Yan Bai","author_inst":"Department of Medical Imaging, Henan Provincial Peoples Hospital and the Peoples Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450003, Henan, China."},{"author_name":"Li Li","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100069, China."},{"author_name":"Yongbei Zhu","author_inst":"Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Big Data-Based Precision Medicine, School of Medicine and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, 100191, China."},{"author_name":"Liusu Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Big Data-Based Precision Medicine, School of Medicine and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, 100191, China."},{"author_name":"Jie Tian","author_inst":"Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Big Data-Based Precision Medicine, School of Medicine and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, 100191, China."},{"author_name":"Jin Zhu","author_inst":"Quzhou People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qinlu Zhang","author_inst":"ShaanXi Provincial Engineering Research Center for Nano-BioMedical Detection"},{"author_name":"Yufei Sun","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Sean Sun","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Xinkun Mao","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Junchi Su","author_inst":"AnyGo Technology Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Hui Chen","author_inst":"School of Biotechnology, Jiangnan Univ"},{"author_name":"Ailiang He","author_inst":"Zhenge Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Ronghua Jin","author_inst":"Beijing You an Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Le Sun","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.25.20037721","rel_title":"Risk Factors Associated with Clinical Outcomes in 323 COVID-19 Patients in Wuhan, China","rel_date":"2020-03-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.25.20037721","rel_abs":"Background With evidence of sustained transmission in more than 190 countries, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a global pandemic. As such, data are urgently needed about risk factors associated with clinical outcomes. Methods A retrospective chart review of 323 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan was conducted. Patients were classified into three disease severity groups (non-severe, severe, and critical), based on their initial clinical presentation. Clinical outcomes were designated as favorable and unfavorable, based on disease progression and response to treatments. Logistic regression models were performed to identify factors associated with clinical outcomes, and logrank test was conducted for the association with clinical progression. Results Current standard treatments did not show significant improvement on patient outcomes in the study. By univariate logistic regression model, 27 risk factors were significantly associated with clinical outcomes. Further, multivariate regression indicated that age over 65 years, smoking, critical disease status, diabetes, high hypersensitive troponin I (>0.04 pg\/mL), leukocytosis (>10 x 109\/L) and neutrophilia (>75 x 109\/L) predicted unfavorable clinical outcomes. By contrast, the use of hypnotics was significantly associated with favorable outcomes. Survival analysis also confirmed that patients receiving hypnotics had significantly better survival. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first indication that hypnotics could be an effective ancillary treatment for COVID-19. We also found that novel risk factors, such as higher hypersensitive troponin I, predicted poor clinical outcomes.

These hotlines have struggled with the volume of callers, leading to wait times of hours or, even, an inability to contact health authorities. Symptoma is a symptom-to-disease digital health assistant that can differentiate more than 20,000 diseases with an accuracy of more than 90%. We tested the accuracy of Symptoma to identify COVID-19 using a set of diverse clinical cases combined with case reports of COVID-19. We showed that Symptoma can accurately distinguish COVID-19 in 96.32% of clinical cases. When considering only COVID-19 symptoms and risk factors, Symptoma identified 100% of those infected when presented with only three signs. Lastly, we showed that Symptomas accuracy far exceeds that of simple \"yes-no\" questionnaires widely available online. In summary, Symptoma provides unparalleled accuracy in systematically identifying cases of COVID-19 while also considering over 20,000 other diseases. Furthermore, Symptoma allows free text input, furthered with disease-specific follow up questions, in 36 languages. Combined, these results and accessibility give Symptoma the potential to be a key tool in the global fight against COVID-19.

Our approach was to design a tool with parameters that hospital leaders could adjust to reflect their local data and easily modify to conduct sensitivity analyses. We developed a model to facilitate hospital planning with estimates of the number of Intensive Care (IC) beds, Acute Care (AC) beds, and ventilators necessary to accommodate patients who require hospitalization for COVID-19 and how these compare to the available resources. Inputs to the model include estimates of the characteristics of the patient population and hospital capacity. We deployed this model as an interactive online tool.6 The model is implemented in R 3.5, RStudio, RShiny 1.4.0 and Python 3.7. The parameters used may be modified as data become available, for use at other institutions, and to generate sensitivity analyses. We illustrate the use of the model by estimating the demand generated by COVID-19+ arrivals for a hypothetical acute care medical center. The model calculated that the number of patients requiring an IC bed would equal the number of IC beds on Day 23, the number of patients requiring a ventilator would equal the number of ventilators available on Day 27, and the number of patients requiring an AC bed and coverage by the Medicine Service would equal the capacity of the Medicine service on Day 21. In response to the COVID-19 epidemic, hospitals must understand their current and future capacity to care for patients with severe illness. While there is significant uncertainty around the parameters used to develop this model, the analysis is based on transparent logic and starts from observed data to provide a robust basis of projections for hospital managers. The model demonstrates the need and provides an approach to address critical questions about staffing patterns for IC and AC, and equipment capacity such as ventilators.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Teng Zhang","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Engineering"},{"author_name":"Kelly McFarlane","author_inst":"Stanford University Graduate School of Business, Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline Vallon","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Engineering"},{"author_name":"Linying Yang","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Engineering"},{"author_name":"Jin Xie","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Engineering"},{"author_name":"Jose Blanchet","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Engineering"},{"author_name":"Peter Glynn","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Engineering"},{"author_name":"Kristan Staudenmayer","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kevin Schulman","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David Scheinker","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Engineering, Stanford University School of Medicine, Lucile Packard Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wen-xiong Yu","author_inst":"Tianyou Hospital Affiliated to Wuhan University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jia Liu","author_inst":"Tianyou Hospital Affiliated to Wuhan University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Chen Shao","author_inst":"Tianyou Hospital Affiliated to Wuhan University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jun-jie Hao","author_inst":"Tianyou Hospital Affiliated to Wuhan University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Chuan-zhen Wang","author_inst":"Tianyou Hospital Affiliated to Wuhan University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yao Ma","author_inst":"Tianyou Hospital Affiliated to Wuhan University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhanwei Wang","author_inst":"University of Hawaii Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Richard Yanagihara","author_inst":"John A.

RBD promote viral entry into the host cells and is an important therapeutic target. In this study, we discovered that theaflavin showed the lower idock score (idock score: -7.95 kcal\/mol). To confirm the result, we discovered that theaflavin showed FullFitness score of -991.21 kcal\/mol and estimated {Delta}G of -8.53 kcal\/mol for the most favorable interaction with contact area of SARS-CoV-2 RBD by SwissDock service. Regarding contact modes, hydrophobic interactions contribute significantly in binding and additional hydrogen bonds were formed between theaflavin and Arg454, Phe456, Asn460, Cys480, Gln493, Asn501 and Val503 of SARS-CoV-2 RBD, near the direct contact area with ACE2.

The rapid global spread of COVID-19 represents perhaps the most significant public health emergency in a century. As the pandemic progressed, a continued paucity of evidence on routes of SARS-CoV-2 transmission has resulted in shifting infection prevention and control guidelines between clasically-defined airborne and droplet precautions. During the initial isolation of 13 individuals with COVID-19 at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, we collected air and surface samples to examine viral shedding from isolated individuals. We detected viral contamination among all samples, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 may spread through both direct (droplet and person-to-person) as well as indirect mechanisms (contaminated objects and airborne transmission). Taken together, these finding support the use of airborne isolation precautions when caring for COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joshua L Santarpia","author_inst":"University of Nebraska Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Danielle N Rivera","author_inst":"National Strategic Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Vicki Herrera","author_inst":"University of Nebraska Medical Center"},{"author_name":"M.

Serum albumin, high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C), and C-reactive protein have been known to be associated with the severity and mortality of community-acquired pneumonia. However, the characteristics and role of metabolic and inflammatory indicators in COVID-19 is unclear. Methods: We included 97 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory indices; radiological features; and treatment were analysed. The differences in the clinical and laboratory parameters between mild and severe COVID-19 patients and the role of these indicators in severity prediction of COVID-19 were investigated. Results: All were Wuhan residents with contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases. The median age was 39 years (IQR: 30-59). The most common presenting symptoms were fever (58.8%), cough (55.7%), and fatigue (33%). Other features were lymphopenia, impaired fasting glucose, hypoproteinaemia, hypoalbuminemia, low high-density lipoproteinemia. Decrease in lymphocyte count, serum total protein, serum albumin, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), ApoA1, CD3+T%, and CD8+T% were found to be valuable in predicting the transition of COVID-19 from mild to severe illness. Chest computed tomography (CT) images showed that the absorption of bilateral lung lesions synchronized with the recovery of metabolic and inflammatory indicators. Conclusions: Hypoproteinaemia, hypoalbuminemia, low high-density lipoproteinemia, and decreased ApoA1, CD3+T%, and CD8+T% could predict severity of COVID-19. Lymphocyte count, total serum protein, and HDL-C may be potentially useful for the evaluation of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shuke Nie","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Xueqing Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Kang Zhao","author_inst":"The third people's Hospital of Hubei province"},{"author_name":"Zhaohui Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhentao Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zhan Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Disease and Intensive Care, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Kevin K Crown","author_inst":"National Strategic Research Institute"},{"author_name":"David Brett-Major","author_inst":"University of Nebraska Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Schnaubelt","author_inst":"University of Nebraska Medical Center"},{"author_name":"M.

Methods: We performed detailed flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood samples from 28 COVID-19 patients treated at Xian No.8 Hospital and the First Affiliated Hospital of Xian Jiaotong University in early 2020 in an attempt to identify factors that could help predict severity of disease and patient outcome. Findings: While we did not detect significant differences in the number of monocytes between patients with COVID-19 and normal healthy individuals,we did identify significant morphological and functional differences, which are more pronounced in patients requiring prolonged hospitalization and ICU admission. Patients with COVID-19 have larger than normal monocytes, easily identified on forward scatter, side scatter analysis by routine flow cytometry,with the presence of a distinct population of monocytes with high forward scatter (FSC-high). On more detailed analysis, these FSC-high monocytes are CD11b+, CD14+, CD16+, CD68+, CD80+, CD163+, CD206+ and secrete IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-alpha, consistent with an inflammatory phenotype. Conclusions: The detection and serial monitoring of this subset of inflammatory monocytes using flow cytometry could be of great help in guiding the prognostication and treatment of patients with COVID-19 and merits further evaluation.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dan Zhang","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Rui Guo","author_inst":"Xi'an No.8 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Lei","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong Univerisity"},{"author_name":"Hongjuan Liu","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Yawen Wang","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Yili Wang","author_inst":"Xi'an No.8 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tongxin Dai","author_inst":"Xi'an No.8 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tianxiao Zhang","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiatong Univeristy"},{"author_name":"Yanjun Lai","author_inst":"Xi'an No.9 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jingya Wang","author_inst":"Tianjin Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhiqiang Liu","author_inst":"Tianjin Medical Univerisity"},{"author_name":"Aili He","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Michael O'Dwyer","author_inst":"National Univeristy of Ireland Galway"},{"author_name":"Jinsong Hu","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Chuan-zhen Wang","author_inst":"Tianyou Hospital Affiliated to Wuhan University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yao Ma","author_inst":"Tianyou Hospital Affiliated to Wuhan University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhanwei Wang","author_inst":"University of Hawaii Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Richard Yanagihara","author_inst":"John A.

Here, we account for importations from Wuhan and from other cities in China, combining COVID-19 prevalence estimates in 18 Chinese cities with estimates of flight passenger volume to predict for each day between early December 2019 to late February 2020 the number of cases exported from China. We predict that the main source of global case importation in early January was Wuhan, but due to the Wuhan lockdown and the rapid spread of the virus, the main source of case importation from mid February became Chinese cities outside of Wuhan. For destinations in Africa in particular, non-Wuhan cities were an important source of case imports (1 case from those cities for each case from Wuhan, range of model scenarios: 0.1-9.8). Our model predicts that 18.4 (8.5 - 100) COVID-19 cases were imported to 26 destination countries in Africa, with most of them (90%) predicted to have arrived between 7th January (+\/-10 days) and 5th February (+\/- 3 days), and all of them predicted prior to the first case detections. We finally observed marked heterogeneities in expected imported cases across those locations. Our estimates shed light on shifting sources and local risks of case importation which can help focus surveillance efforts and guide public health policy during the final stages of the pandemic. We further provide a time window for the seeding of local epidemics in African locations, a key parameter for estimating expected outbreak size and burden on local health care systems and societies, that has yet to be defined in these locations.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tigist Ferede Menkir","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

During the current COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing guidelines require alternative data collection in order protect both research staff and participants. Home-collected respiratory specimens are less resource intensive, can be collected earlier after symptom onset, and provide a low-contact means of data collection. A prospective, multi-year, community-based cohort study is an ideal setting to examine the utility of home-collected specimens for identification of influenza. Methods: We describe the feasibility and reliability of home-collected specimens for the detection of influenza. We collected data and specimens between October 2014 and June 2017 from the Household Influenza Vaccine Evaluation (HIVE) Study. Cohort participants were asked to collect a nasal swab at home upon onset of acute respiratory illness. Research staff also collected nose and throat swab specimens in the study clinic within 7 days of onset. We estimated agreement using Cohen's kappa and calculated sensitivity and specificity of home-collected compared to staff-collected specimens. Results: We tested 336 paired staff- and home-collected respiratory specimens for influenza by RT-PCR; 150 staff-collected specimens were positive for influenza A\/H3N2, 23 for influenza A\/H1N1, 14 for influenza B\/Victoria, and 31 for influenza B\/Yamagata. We found moderate agreement between collection methods for influenza A\/H3N2 (0.70) and B\/Yamagata (0.69) and high agreement for influenza A\/H1N1 (0.87) and B\/Victoria (0.86). Sensitivity ranged from 78-86% for all influenza types and subtypes. Specificity was high for influenza A\/H1N1 and both influenza B lineages with a range from 96-100%, and slightly lower for A\/H3N2 infections (88%). Conclusions: Collection of nasal swab specimens at home is both feasible and reliable for identification of influenza virus infections.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ryan E Malosh","author_inst":"University of Michigan School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Joshua G Petrie","author_inst":"University of Michigan School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Amy P Callear","author_inst":"University of Michigan School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Arnold S Monto","author_inst":"University of Michigan School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Emily Toth Martin","author_inst":"University of Michigan School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Caroline Buckee","author_inst":"Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Alexander Watts","author_inst":"BlueDot"},{"author_name":"Kamran Khan","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Ryan Sherbo","author_inst":"BlueDot"},{"author_name":"Ada W.C.

Before the implementation of control measures (e.g. social distancing, travel bans, etc) and under the assumption that infection elicits protective immunity, epidemiological theory indicates that the ongoing epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 will conform to this pattern. Here, we calibrate a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model to data on cumulative reported SARS-CoV-2 associated deaths from the United Kingdom (UK) and Italy under the assumption that such deaths are well reported events that occur only in a vulnerable fraction of the population. We focus on model solutions which take into consideration previous estimates of critical epidemiological parameters such as the basic reproduction number (R0), probability of death in the vulnerable fraction of the population, infectious period and time from infection to death, with the intention of exploring the sensitivity of the system to the actual fraction of the population vulnerable to severe disease and death. Our simulations are in agreement with other studies that the current epidemic wave in the UK and Italy in the absence of interventions should have an approximate duration of 2-3 months, with numbers of deaths lagging behind in time relative to overall infections. Importantly, the results we present here suggest the ongoing epidemics in the UK and Italy started at least a month before the first reported death and have already led to the accumulation of significant levels of herd immunity in both countries. There is an inverse relationship between the proportion currently immune and the fraction of the population vulnerable to severe disease. This relationship can be used to determine how many people will require hospitalisation (and possibly die) in the coming weeks if we are able to accurately determine current levels of herd immunity. There is thus an urgent need for investment in technologies such as virus (or viral pseudotype) neutralization assays and other robust assays which provide reliable read-outs of protective immunity, and for the provision of open access to valuable data sources such as blood banks and paired samples of acute and convalescent sera from confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 to validate these. Urgent development and assessment of such tests should be followed by rapid implementation at scale to provide real-time data. These data will be critical to the proper assessment of the effects of social distancing and other measures currently being adopted to slow down the case incidence and for informing future policy direction.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jose Lourenco","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Robert Paton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Mahan Ghafari","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Moritz Kraemer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Craig Thompson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Paul Klenerman","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Sunetra Gupta","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Ryan Sherbo","author_inst":"BlueDot"},{"author_name":"Ada W.C.

Methods: Using an age-structured compartmental model of COVID-19 transmission in the population of Ontario, Canada, we compared a base case with limited testing, isolation, and quarantine to scenarios with: enhanced case finding; restrictive social distancing measures; or a combination of enhanced case finding and less restrictive social distancing. Interventions were either implemented for fixed durations or dynamically cycled on and off, based on projected ICU bed occupancy. We present median and credible intervals (CrI) from 100 replicates per scenario using a two-year time horizon. Results: We estimated that 56% (95% CrI: 42-63%) of the Ontario population would be infected over the course of the epidemic in the base case. At the epidemic peak, we projected 107,000 (95% CrI: 60,760-149,000) cases in hospital and 55,500 (95% CrI: 32,700-75,200) cases in ICU. For fixed duration scenarios, all interventions were projected to delay and reduce the height of the epidemic peak relative to the base case, with restrictive social distancing estimated to have the greatest effect. Longer duration interventions were more effective. Dynamic interventions were projected to reduce the proportion of the population infected at the end of the two-year period. Dynamic social distancing interventions could reduce the median number of cases in ICU below current estimates of Ontario's ICU capacity. Interpretation: Without significant social distancing or a combination of moderate social distancing with enhanced case finding, we project that ICU resources would be overwhelmed. Dynamic social distancing could maintain health system capacity and also allow periodic psychological and economic respite for populations.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ashleigh Tuite","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"David N Fisman","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Amy L Greer","author_inst":"University of Guelph"},{"author_name":"Moritz Kraemer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Craig Thompson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Paul Klenerman","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Sunetra Gupta","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Ryan Sherbo","author_inst":"BlueDot"},{"author_name":"Ada W.C.

A total of 81,021 laboratory-confirmed cases, including 3,194 deaths (3.9%) had been reported in China by March 14, 2020, meanwhile, 61,518 laboratory-confirmed cases and 2,199 deaths were reported outside China. Common symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia included fever, fatigue and dry cough. Faced with such a sudden outbreak of new infectious diseases, we have no history to learn from and no evidence to count on. Traditional models often predict inconsistent results. Aiming at estimate the epidemic trend timely after the outbreak, we mainly used 7-day moving average of log-transformed daily new cases (LMA) to establish a new index named \"epidemic trend index\", which will be used to predict the evolutionary trend of the epidemic situation and support epidemic control decision making processes. We used SARS epidemic data from Hong Kong in 2003 to verify the practicability of the new index, which shows that the index is acceptable. The epidemic trend index was then applied to the COVID-19 epidemic analysis in China. The results show that during the epidemic, the trend direction of different districts of China changed on different date. In the whole country and in Hubei Province alone, the epidemic reached the peak on February 9. While the peak appeared earlier, i.e. on February 5 in other provinces. It indicated that decisive outbreak control measures of the Chinese government are effective. While local governments should adjust management measures based on local risk level of epidemic. Although the epidemic has eased since late February, continued efforts in epidemic control are still needed to accelerate the end of the epidemic in China. However, the global COVID-19 epidemic outside China continues to expand as indicated by the epidemic trend index we proposed. In order to cope with the novel coronavirus pandemic, people all over the world should work together and governments of all countries should take efficient measures in the light of China's experience and according to national circumstances and local conditions.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yun-ting He","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hao He","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jing Zhai","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xiao-jin Wang","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, Clinical Research Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bing-shun Wang","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, Clinical Research Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Peter Simmonds","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Paul Klenerman","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Sunetra Gupta","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Ryan Sherbo","author_inst":"BlueDot"},{"author_name":"Ada W.C.

We aimed to investigate whether COVID-19 and SARS exhibited similar spatial and temporal features at the provincial level in mainland China. Methods: The number of people infected by COVID-19 and SARS were extracted from daily briefings on newly confirmed cases during the epidemics, as of Mar. 4, 2020 and Aug. 3, 2003, respectively. We depicted the spatiotemporal patterns of the COVID-19 and SARS epidemics using spatial statistics such as Moran's I and the local indicators of spatial association (LISA). Results: Compared to SARS, COVID-19 had a higher incidence. We identified 3 clusters (predominantly located in south-central China, highest RR=135.08) for COVID-19 and 4 clusters (mainly in Northern China, highest RR=423.51) for SARS. Fewer secondary clusters were identified after the \"Wuhan lockdown\". The LISA cluster map detected a significantly high-low (Hubei) and low-high spatial clustering (Anhui, Hunan, and Jiangxi, in Central China) for COVID-19. Two significant high-high (Beijing and Tianjin) and low-high (Hebei) clusters were detected for SARS, although the global Moran's I value was not significant. Conclusions: The different spatiotemporal clustering patterns between COVID-19 and SARS could point to changes in social and demographic factors, local government containment strategies or differences in transmission mechanisms between these coronaviruses.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xi Zhang","author_inst":"Clinical Research Unit, Xin Hua Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, P.R.

The virus was first detected in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States in January, 2020, with subsequent COVID-19 outbreaks detected in all 50 states by early March. To uncover the sources of SARS-CoV-2 introductions and patterns of spread within the U.S., we sequenced nine viral genomes from early reported COVID-19 patients in Connecticut. Our phylogenetic analysis places the majority of these genomes with viruses sequenced from Washington state. By coupling our genomic data with domestic and international travel patterns, we show that early SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Connecticut was likely driven by domestic introductions. Moreover, the risk of domestic importation to Connecticut exceeded that of international importation by mid-March regardless of our estimated impacts of federal travel restrictions. This study provides evidence for widespread, sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within the U.S. and highlights the critical need for local surveillance.","rel_num_authors":36,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joseph R Fauver","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Mary E.

Methods: Adult suspected patients aged >18 years within 14 days who underwent chest CT scan and reverse-transcription polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) tests were enrolled. The enrolled patients were confirmed and grouped according to results of RT-PCR tests. The data of basic demographics, single chest CT features, and combined chest CT features were analyzed for confirmed and non-confirmed groups. Results: A total of 130 patients were enrolled with 54 cases positive and 76 cases negative. The typical CT imaging features of positive group were ground glass opacity (GGO), crazy-paving pattern and air bronchogram. The lesions were mostly distributed bilaterally, close to the lower lungs or the pleura. When features combined, GGO with bilateral pulmonary distribution and GGO with pleural distribution were more common, of which were 31 cases (57.4%) and 30 cases (55.6%) respectively. The combinations were almost presented statistically significant (P<0.05) except for the combination of GGO with consolidation. Most combinations presented relatively low sensitivity but extremely high specificity. The average specificity of these combinations is around 90%. Conclusions: The combinations of GGO could be useful in the identification and differential diagnosis of COVID-19, which alerts clinicians to isolate patients for treatment promptly and repeat RT-PCR tests until incubation ends.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Congliang Miao","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mengdi Jin","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Li Miao","author_inst":"High-tech Hospital, First Hospital Affiliated to Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"Xinying Yang","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Peng Huang","author_inst":"People's Hospital of Yichun city"},{"author_name":"Huanwen Xiong","author_inst":"High-tech Hospital, First Hospital Affiliated to Nanchang University"},{"author_name":"Peijie Huang","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Qi Zhao","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jiang Du","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jiang Hong","author_inst":"Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jafar Razeq","author_inst":"Connecticut State Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Randy Downing","author_inst":"Connecticut State Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Nagarjuna R.
