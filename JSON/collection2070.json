COVID-19 testing was performed in 63 of 537 kidney or kidney-pancreas transplanted patients, versus 43 of 383 kidney or kidney-pancreas waitlisted patients as of June 4, 2020 (12% versus 11%, p=0.81). COVID-19 was identified in 14 of 537 kidney or kidney-pancreas transplanted patients, versus 9 of 383 kidney or kidney-pancreas waitlisted patients (2.6% versus 2.3%, p=0.81). Hospitalization occurred in 11 of 14 transplanted patients, and 4 of 9 waitlisted patients with COVID-19 (79% versus 44%, p=0.18). Intensive care unit admission occurred in 5 of 14 transplanted patients, and 1 of 9 waitlisted patients with COVID-19 (36% versus 11%, p=0.34). Two transplanted patients with COVID-19 were mechanically ventilated and died, whereas no waitlisted patients with COVID-19 died or were mechanically ventilated. Our study provides preliminary data that can be used for power calculations to inform multicenter studies designed to validate these findings.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carlos Santos","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yoona Rhee","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Edward Hollinger","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Oyedolamu Olaitan","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Erik Schadde","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Vasil Peev","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Samuel Saltzberg","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Martin Hertl","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.20.20157891","rel_title":"Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) Significantly Reduces Respiratory Morbidity in COVID-19 Pneumonia: A Prospective Randomized Trial","rel_date":"2020-07-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.20.20157891","rel_abs":"Background. Interventions mitigating progression to mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 would markedly improve outcome and reduce healthcare utilization. We hypothesized that immunomodulation with IVIG would improve oxygenation and reduce length of hospital stay and progression to mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods. Patients with COVID-19 were randomized 1:1 to prospectively receive standard of care (SOC) plus intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 0.5 g\/kg\/day x 3 days with methylprednisolone 40 mg 30 minutes before infusion versus SOC alone. Results. 16 subjects received IVIG plus SOC and 17 SOC alone. The median age was 51 years for SOC and 58 years for IVIG. APACHE II scores and Charlson comorbidity indices were similar for IVIG and SOC (median 7.5 vs 7 and 2 for both, respectively). Seven SOC versus 2 IVIG subjects required mechanical ventilation (p=0.12, Fisher exact test). Among subjects with A-a gradient of >200 mm Hg at enrollment, the IVIG group showed i) a lower rate of progression to requiring mechanical ventilation (2\/14 vs 7\/12, p=0.038 Fisher exact test), ii) shorter median hospital length of stay (11 vs 19 days, p=0.01 Mann Whitney U), iii) shorter median ICU stay (2.5 vs 12.5 days, p=0.006 Mann Whitey U), and iv) greater improvement in PaO2\/FiO2 at 7 days (median [range] change from time of enrollment +131 [+35 to +330] vs +44.5 [-115 to +157], p=0.01, Mann Whitney-U test) than SOC. Conclusion. This pilot prospective randomized study comprising largely of Latino patients showed that IVIG significantly improved hypoxia and reduced hospital length of stay and progression to mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients with A-a gradient >200 mm Hg.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"George Sakoulas","author_inst":"UCSD School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Matthew Geriak","author_inst":"Sharp Memorial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ravina Kullar","author_inst":"Expert Stewardship, Inc"},{"author_name":"Kristina Greenwood","author_inst":"Sharp Center for Research"},{"author_name":"MacKenzie Habib","author_inst":"Sharp Center for Research"},{"author_name":"Anuja Vyas","author_inst":"Sharp Memorial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mitra Ghafourian","author_inst":"Sharp Memorial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Venkata Naga Kiran Dintyala","author_inst":"Sharp Memorial Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fadi Haddad","author_inst":"Sharp Grossmont Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.20.20158048","rel_title":"Hospital-Based Donor Recruitment and Pre-Donation Serologic Testing for COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma","rel_date":"2020-07-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.20.20158048","rel_abs":"Background: Major blood centers perform serologic testing on potential COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors retrospectively after blood donation. A hospital-based recruitment program for COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) donors may be an efficient way to prospectively identify potential donors. Study Design and Methods: Patients who recovered from known or suspected COVID-19 were identified and recruited through medical record searches and public appeals. Participants were screened with a modified donor history questionnaire (DHQ), and if eligible, were consented and tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG and IgM). Participants who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG were referred to a local blood center for convalescent plasma collection. Results: Of 179 individuals screened, 128 completed serologic testing and 89 were referred for convalescent plasma donation to a local blood center (49.7% of those screened). IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 23\/51 (45.1%) of participants with suspected COVID-19 and in 66\/77 (85.7%) of participants with self-reported PCR-confirmed COVID-19. Testing was performed at a median of 38 days since last symptoms. Participant age positively correlated with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM levels. Time since last symptoms did not correlate with IgG or IgM levels. A wide range of SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were observed. Conclusion: A hospital based CCP donor recruitment program can prospectively identify potential CCP donors. Variability in SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels has implications for selection of CCP units for transfusion.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joanna Balcerek","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Evelin Trejo","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Kendall Levine","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Paul Couey","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Zoe V Kornberg","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Camille Rogine","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Young","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Li","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Brian R Shy","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Jordan E Taylor","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Sara Bakhtary","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Terence Friedlander","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Kara Lake Lynch","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Caryn Bern","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Esensten","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.21.20158154","rel_title":"High stability of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA under minimal storage conditions for detection by Real-Time PCR","rel_date":"2020-07-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.21.20158154","rel_abs":"Reliable diagnosis, executed by Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR), builds the current basis in SARS-CoV-2 containment.

We simulated four levels of transmission rate, 14% (average baseline), 8% (average for face mask use), 5.4% (average for 3ft distancing), and 2.5% (average for 6ft distancing and face mask use), interpolating results to the full range to understand the impact of uncertainty in effectiveness, feasibility, and adherence of face mask use and physical distancing. We evaluated contact rates between 1 and 25, to identify the threshold that, if exceeded, could lead to several deaths. When transmission rate was 8%, for trace and test at 50%, the contact rate threshold was 8. However, any time delays in trace, test, and isolation quickly raised the number of deaths. Keeping contact rate to 3 or below was more robust to testing delays, keeping deaths below 1 up to a delay of 5 days from the time of infection to diagnosis and isolation. For a contact rate of 3, the number of trace and tests peaked to about 70 per day and relaxed to 25 with the addition of 10% mass test. When transmission rate was 5.4%, for trace and test at 50%, the contact rate threshold was 10. However, keeping contact rate to 4 or below was more robust to delays in testing, keeping deaths below 1 up to a delay of 6 days from the time of infection to diagnosis and isolation. For contact rate of 4, the number of trace and tests peaked at 50 per day and relaxed to 10 per day with the addition of 10% mass test.

The sequential introduction of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) resulted in successful containment of the epidemic. A better understanding of how the timing of implementing NPIs influences the dynamics and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics will be crucial for the management of a potential resurgence in Switzerland. METHODS: We developed a dynamic transmission model that describes infection, hospitalization, recovery and death due to SARS-CoV-2 in Switzerland. Using a maximum likelihood framework, we fitted the model to aggregated daily numbers of hospitalized patients, ICU occupancy and death from 25 February to 10 May 2020. We estimated critical parameters of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Switzerland and explored counterfactual scenarios of an earlier and later implementation of NPIs. RESULTS: We estimated the basic reproduction number R0 = 2.61 (95% compatibility interval, CI: 2.51-2.71) during the early exponential phase of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Switzerland. After the implementation of NPIs, the effective reproduction number approached Re = 0.64 (95% CI: 0.61-0.66). Based on the observed doubling times of the epidemic before and after the implementation of NPIs, we estimated that one week of early exponential spread required 3.1 weeks (95% CI: 2.8-3.3 weeks) of 'lockdown' to reduce the number of infections to the same level. Introducing the same sequence of NPIs one week earlier or later would have resulted in substantially lower (399, 95% prediction interval, PI: 347-458) and higher (8,683, 95% PI: 8,038-9,453) numbers of deaths, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of NPIs in March 2020 prevented thousands of SARS-CoV-2-related deaths in Switzerland. Early implementation of NPIs during SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks can reduce the number of deaths and the necessary duration of strict control measures considerably.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christian L Althaus","author_inst":"Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Daniel Probst","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, National Center for Competence in Research NCCR TransCure, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Anthony Hauser","author_inst":"Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Julien L Riou","author_inst":"Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Pieter A Breur","author_inst":"SLAC"},{"author_name":"Eric Charles","author_inst":"SLAC"},{"author_name":"David M Gaba","author_inst":"VA Palo Alto healthcare system and Stanford University school of medicine"},{"author_name":"Ryan Herbst","author_inst":"SLAC"},{"author_name":"Christina M Ignarra","author_inst":"SLAC"},{"author_name":"Steffen Luitz","author_inst":"SLAC"},{"author_name":"Eric H Miller","author_inst":"SLAC"},{"author_name":"Brian Mong","author_inst":"SLAC"},{"author_name":"Tom A Shutt","author_inst":"SLAC"},{"author_name":"Matthias Wittgen","author_inst":"SLAC"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Esensten","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.20.20157933","rel_title":"A data-driven metapopulation model for the Belgian COVID-19 epidemic: assessing the impact of lockdown and exit strategies","rel_date":"2020-07-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.20.20157933","rel_abs":"In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, several countries adopted measures of social distancing to a different degree. For many countries, after successfully curbing the initial wave, lockdown measures were gradually lifted. In Belgium, such relief started on May 4th with phase 1, followed by several subsequent phases over the next few weeks. We analysed the expected impact of relaxing stringent lockdown measures taken according to the phased Belgian exit strategy. We developed a stochastic, data-informed, meta-population model that accounts for mixing and mobility of the age-structured population of Belgium. The model is calibrated to daily hospitalization data and serological data and is able to reproduce the outbreak at the national level. We consider different scenarios for relieving the lockdown, quantified in terms of relative reductions in pre-pandemic social mixing and mobility. We validate our assumptions by making comparisons with social contact data collected during and after the lockdown. Our model is able to successfully describe the initial wave of COVID-19 in Belgium and identifies interactions during leisure\/other activities as pivotal in the exit strategy. Indeed, we find a smaller impact of school re-openings as compared to restarting leisure activities and re-openings of work places. We also assess the impact of case isolation of new (suspected) infections, and find that it allows re-establishing relatively more social interactions while still ensuring epidemic control. Scenarios predicting a second wave of hospitalizations were not observed, suggesting that the per-contact probability of infection has changed with respect to the pre-lockdown period. Community contacts are found to be most influential, followed by professional contacts and school contacts, respectively, for an impending second wave of COVID-19. Regular re-assessment is crucial to adjust to evolving behavioral changes that can affect epidemic diffusion. In addition to social distancing, sufficient capacity for extensive testing and contact tracing is essential for successful mitigation.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pietro Coletti","author_inst":"Data Science Institute, I-BioStat, UHasselt"},{"author_name":"Pieter Libin","author_inst":"Data Science Institute, I-BioStat, UHasselt"},{"author_name":"Oana Petrof","author_inst":"Data Science Institute, I-BioStat, UHasselt"},{"author_name":"Lander Willem","author_inst":"Antwerp University"},{"author_name":"Abrams Steven","author_inst":"Data Science Institute, I-BioStat, UHasselt"},{"author_name":"Sereina A.

While the duration and strength of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is currently unknown, specific antibody titres to related coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been shown to wane in recovered individuals, and immunity to seasonal circulating coronaviruses is estimated to be shorter than one year. Using an age-structured, deterministic model, we explore different potential immunity dynamics using contact data from the UK population. In the scenario where immunity to SARS-CoV-2 lasts an average of three months for non-hospitalised individuals, a year for hospitalised individuals, and the effective reproduction number (Rt) after lockdown is 1.2 (our worst case scenario), we find that the secondary peak occurs in winter 2020 with a daily maximum of 409,000 infectious individuals; almost three-fold greater than in a scenario with permanent immunity. Our models suggests that longitudinal serological surveys to determine if immunity in the population is waning will be most informative when sampling takes place from the end of the lockdown until autumn 2020. After this period, the proportion of the population with antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is expected to increase due to the secondary peak. Overall, our analysis presents considerations for policy makers on the longer term dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK and suggests that strategies designed to achieve herd immunity may lead to repeated waves of infection if immunity to re-infection is not permanent.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas Crellen","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Li Pi","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Emma Davis","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Timothy M Pollington","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Tim C D Lucas","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Diepreye Ayabina","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Anna Borlase","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jaspreet Toor","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kiesha Prem","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Graham F Medley","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Petra Klepac","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"T Deirdre Hollingsworth","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tom A Shutt","author_inst":"SLAC"},{"author_name":"Matthias Wittgen","author_inst":"SLAC"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Esensten","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.20.20158071","rel_title":"Evaluating temperature and humidity gradients of COVID-19 infection rates in light of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions","rel_date":"2020-07-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.20.20158071","rel_abs":"We evaluate potential temperature and humidity impact on the infection rate of COVID-19 with a data up to June 10th 2020, which comprises a large geographical footprint.

The indicators were selected by a literature review and categorized into: demographic, social, economic, health infrastructure, population at risk and epidemiological. The variables were collected in Brazilian government databases at the municipal level and evaluated according to MCDA, through the Program to Support Decision Making based on indicators (PRADIN). Based on this approach, the study performed simulations by category of indicators and a general simulation that allowed to divide the municipalities into groups of 1 to 5, with 1 being the least vulnerable and 5 being the most vulnerable. The groupings of municipalities were exposed in their respective mesoregions of MG in a thematic map, using the software Tabwin 32. The results revealed that the mesoregion of Norte de Minas stands out with more than 40% of its municipalities belonging to group 5, according to economic, social and health infrastructure indicators. Similarly, the Jequitinhonha mesoregion exhibited almost 60% of the municipalities in this group for economic and health infrastructure indicators. For demographic and epidemiological criteria, the Metropolitana de Belo Horizonte mesoregion is the most vulnerable, with 42.9% and 26.7% of the municipalities in group 5, respectively. Considering the presence of a population at risk, Zona da Mata reported 42.3% of the municipalities in the most vulnerable group. In the joint analysis of data, the Jequitinhonha, Vale do Mucuri and Vale do Rio Doce mesoregions were the most vulnerable in the state of MG. Thus, through the outlined profile, the present study proved how socioeconomic diversity affects the vulnerability of the municipalities to face COVID-19 outbreak, highlighting the need for interventions directed to each reality.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Igor Silva Campos","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Uberlandia"},{"author_name":"Vinicius Ferreira Aratani","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Uberlandia"},{"author_name":"Karina Baltor Cabral","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Uberlandia"},{"author_name":"Jean Ezequiel Limongi","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Uberlandia"},{"author_name":"Stefan Vilges de Oliveira","author_inst":"Federal University of Uberlandia"},{"author_name":"Jacques Naude","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"},{"author_name":"Xifeng Ruan","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"},{"author_name":"Kentaro Hayashi","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"},{"author_name":"Kgomotso Monnakgotla","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"},{"author_name":"Salah-Eddine Dahbi","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"},{"author_name":"Finn D Stevenson","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"},{"author_name":"T Deirdre Hollingsworth","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tom A Shutt","author_inst":"SLAC"},{"author_name":"Matthias Wittgen","author_inst":"SLAC"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Esensten","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.20.20158139","rel_title":"Confirmed and Unreported COVID-19 Death Counts: An Assessment of Reporting Discrepancy","rel_date":"2020-07-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.20.20158139","rel_abs":"Objective: To assess the reporting discrepancy between officially confirmed COVID-19 death counts and unreported COVID-19-like illness (CLI) death counts. Study Design: The study is based on secondary time-series data. Methods: We used publicly available data to explore the differences between confirmed COVID-19 death counts and deaths with probable COVID-19 symptoms in Bangladesh between March 8, 2020, and July 18, 2020. Both tabular analysis and statistical tests were performed. Results: During the week ending May 9, 2020, the unreported CLI death count was higher than the confirmed COVID-19 death count; however, it was lower in the following weeks. On average, unreported CLI death counts were almost equal to the confirmed COVID-19 death counts during the study period. However, the reporting authority neither considers CLI deaths nor adjusts for potential seasonal influenza-like illness or other related deaths, which might produce incomplete and unreliable COVID-19 data and respective mortality rates. Conclusions: Deaths with probable COVID-19 symptoms needs to be included in provisional death counts in order to estimate an accurate COVID-19 mortality rate and to offer data-driven pandemic response strategies. An urgent initiative is needed to prepare a comprehensive guideline for reporting COVID-19 deaths.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mazbahul G Ahamad","author_inst":"University of Nebraska-Lincoln"},{"author_name":"Fahian Tanin","author_inst":"Independent Researcher"},{"author_name":"Byomkes Talukder","author_inst":"York University"},{"author_name":"Jean Ezequiel Limongi","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Uberlandia"},{"author_name":"Stefan Vilges de Oliveira","author_inst":"Federal University of Uberlandia"},{"author_name":"Jacques Naude","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"},{"author_name":"Xifeng Ruan","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"},{"author_name":"Kentaro Hayashi","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"},{"author_name":"Kgomotso Monnakgotla","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"},{"author_name":"Salah-Eddine Dahbi","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"},{"author_name":"Finn D Stevenson","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"},{"author_name":"T Deirdre Hollingsworth","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tom A Shutt","author_inst":"SLAC"},{"author_name":"Matthias Wittgen","author_inst":"SLAC"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Esensten","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.20.20157925","rel_title":"Factors Associated with COVID-19 Mitigation Behavior among US Adults","rel_date":"2020-07-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.20.20157925","rel_abs":"In January 2020, the US declared the coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency and subsequently the CDC issued guidelines for personal mitigation behavior, such as mask-wearing, hand-washing, and social-distancing.

We hypothesize that health risk factors, presence of symptoms, and psychological wellbeing predict mitigation behavior. Understanding what factors are associated with mitigation behavior will be important for policy makers in their efforts to curb the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic prompted strong mitigation behavior by adults, especially among females, non-whites, urban dwellers, and the psychological unwell. Other positive predictors were post-secondary education and higher income. Health symptoms and clinical risk factors did not predict increased mitigation practices, nor did age 65+ and proximity to infected persons. Our study findings are congruent with a report that pointed to a lack of increased pandemic mitigation practices in households with confirmed infections and health risks. Our results also point to lower levels of psychological resilience, lower socio-economic status, and non-urban location as potential explanatory factors for lack of mitigation behavior.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Debra Lemke","author_inst":"McDaniel College"},{"author_name":"Klaus Lemke","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Byomkes Talukder","author_inst":"York University"},{"author_name":"Jean Ezequiel Limongi","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Uberlandia"},{"author_name":"Stefan Vilges de Oliveira","author_inst":"Federal University of Uberlandia"},{"author_name":"Jacques Naude","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"},{"author_name":"Xifeng Ruan","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"},{"author_name":"Kentaro Hayashi","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"},{"author_name":"Kgomotso Monnakgotla","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"},{"author_name":"Salah-Eddine Dahbi","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"},{"author_name":"Finn D Stevenson","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"},{"author_name":"T Deirdre Hollingsworth","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tom A Shutt","author_inst":"SLAC"},{"author_name":"Matthias Wittgen","author_inst":"SLAC"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Esensten","author_inst":"University of California San Francisco"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.25.192310","rel_title":"\u03b2-Coronaviruses use lysosomal organelles for cellular egress.","rel_date":"2020-07-25","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.25.192310","rel_abs":"{beta}-Coronaviruses are a family of positive-strand enveloped RNA viruses that include the severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV2 (SARS-CoV2).

Using imaging methodologies in combination with virus-specific reporters, we demonstrate that {beta}-Coronaviruses utilize lysosomal trafficking for egress from cells. This pathway is regulated by the Arf-like small GTPase Arl8b; thus, virus egress is insensitive to inhibitors of the biosynthetic secretory pathway. Coronavirus infection results in lysosome deacidification, inactivation of lysosomal degradation and disruption of antigen presentation pathways. This coronavirus-induced exploitation of lysosomes provides insights into the cellular and immunological abnormalities observed in patients and suggests new therapeutic modalities.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nihal Altan-Bonnet","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Gregoire Yves Altan-Bonnet","author_inst":"National Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Sourish Ghosh","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Teegan Dellibovi-Ragheb","author_inst":"FDA"},{"author_name":"Eowyn Pak","author_inst":"Dartmouth College"},{"author_name":"Qi Qiu","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Matthew Fisher","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Peter Takvorian","author_inst":"State University of New Jersey-Rutgers University- Newark"},{"author_name":"Christopher Bleck","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Victor Hsu","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Anthony Fehr","author_inst":"University of Kentucky"},{"author_name":"Stanley Perlman","author_inst":"University of Iowa"},{"author_name":"Marco Straus","author_inst":"Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Gary Whittaker","author_inst":"Cornell University"},{"author_name":"C AM de Haan","author_inst":"Utrecht University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.25.221135","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 differs from SARS-CoV in the requirements for receptor expression and proteolytic activation to trigger cell-cell fusion and is not inhibited by Bromhexine","rel_date":"2020-07-25","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.25.221135","rel_abs":"The SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects cells through interaction of its spike protein (SARS-CoV-2-S) with the ACE2 receptor and activation by proteases, in particular TMPRSS2. Viruses can also spread through fusion of infected with uninfected cells. We therefore analyzed cell-cell fusion activity of SARS-CoV-2-S with regard to the requirements for ACE2 expression, proteolytic activation, and sensitivity to inhibitors and compared it to SARS-CoV-S. We compared S-protein-driven fusion with target cells recombinantly overexpressing ACE2, TMPRSS2, or both. SARS-CoV-2-S-driven fusion was moderately increased by TMPRSS2 and strongly by ACE2, while the reverse observation was made for SARS-CoV-S. TMPRSS2-mediated effects were inhibited by the serine protease inhibitor Camostat. Effector-target-cell fusion by SARS-CoV-2-S was only affected by Camostat when receptor expression was limiting or when the S1\/S2 cleavage site was mutated. Mutational ablation of the SARS-CoV-2-S S2 cleavage site abrogated any effects of TMPRSS2 on fusion. Mutation of the SARS-CoV-2-S S1\/S2 cleavage site reduced effector-target-cell fusion when ACE2 or TMPRSS2 were limiting. When both factors were abundant, initial target-effector-cell fusion was unaltered, but syncytia remained smaller over time. Overall, its polybasic cleavage site renders SARS-CoV-2-S-mediated cell-cell fusion less dependent on TMPRSS2 activity on target cells. Unexpectedly, we observed enhancement of SARS-CoV-2-S-mediated fusion by Bromhexine, another TMPRSS2 inhibitor. This effect required intact proteolytic cleavage sites, suggesting interference of Bromhexine with proteolytic priming, but not in a therapeutically desired way. Infection with SARS-CoV-2-S-pseudotyped particles clearly differed in the requirements for proteolytic activation from cell-cell fusion. TMPRSS2 strongly enhanced infection, which was reversed by Camostat but not by Bromhexine.\n\nIMPORTANCECell-cell fusion allows the virus to infect additional target cells without the need to produce free virus. Fusion likely also contributes to tissue damage by creating virus-infected syncytia. Our results demonstrate that the S2 cleavage site is essential for activation by TMPRSS2 in trans and unravel important differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Bromhexine, an inhibitor of the TMPRSS2 protease, is currently tested in clinical trials against COVID-19. Our results indicate that Bromhexine does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2-S-mediated particle entry and enhances fusion. We therefore caution against overly optimistic use of Bromhexine in higher dosage in clinical trials or as a therapy, at least until its effects on SARS-CoV-2 spike activation are better understood. The related compound Ambroxol, which similar to Bromhexine is clinically used as an expectorant, did not exhibit activating effects on SARS-CoV-2-S-mediated fusion and may therefore currently represent a better choice in therapeutic regimens for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bojan F H\u00f6rnich","author_inst":"Nachwuchsgruppe Herpesviren, Abteilung Infektionsbiologie, Deutsches Primatenzentrum - Leibniz-Institut f\u00fcr Primatenforschung, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Anna K Gro\u00dfkopf","author_inst":"Nachwuchsgruppe Herpesviren, Abteilung Infektionsbiologie, Deutsches Primatenzentrum - Leibniz-Institut f\u00fcr Primatenforschung, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Sarah Schlagowski","author_inst":"Nachwuchsgruppe Herpesviren, Abteilung Infektionsbiologie, Deutsches Primatenzentrum - Leibniz-Institut f\u00fcr Primatenforschung, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Matthias Tenbusch","author_inst":"Virologisches Institut, Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Frank Neipel","author_inst":"Virologisches Institut, Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Alexander S Hahn","author_inst":"Nachwuchsgruppe Herpesviren, Abteilung Infektionsbiologie, Deutsches Primatenzentrum - Leibniz-Institut f\u00fcr Primatenforschung, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Matthew Fisher","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Peter Takvorian","author_inst":"State University of New Jersey-Rutgers University- Newark"},{"author_name":"Christopher Bleck","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Victor Hsu","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Anthony Fehr","author_inst":"University of Kentucky"},{"author_name":"Stanley Perlman","author_inst":"University of Iowa"},{"author_name":"Marco Straus","author_inst":"Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Gary Whittaker","author_inst":"Cornell University"},{"author_name":"C AM de Haan","author_inst":"Utrecht University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.22.20159830","rel_title":"Clustering, diffusion and evolution of COVID19 infections during lock-down","rel_date":"2020-07-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.22.20159830","rel_abs":"Epidemics such as the spreading of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are highly non linear, and therefore difficult to predict.

We improve upon the simplest possible compartmental model, the SIR model, by adding an additional compartment associated with the clustered individuals. The so-obtained SBIR model compares satisfactorily with results on the pandemic propagation in a number of European countries, during and immediately after lock-down. Especially, the decay exponent of the number of new cases after the first peak of the epidemic, is observed to be very similar for countries in which a strict lock-down was applied.

Heterologous polyclonal antibodies of animal origin have been used to fight against infectious agents and are a possible alternative to the use of CP in SARS-CoV-2 disease. However, heterologous polyclonal antibodies trigger human natural xenogeneic antibody responses particularly directed against animal-type carbohydrate epitopes, mainly the N-glycolyl form of the neuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) and the Gal 1,3-galactose (-Gal), ultimately forming immune complexes and potentially leading to serum sickness or allergy. To circumvent these drawbacks, we engineered animals lacking the genes coding for the cytidine monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH) and 1,3-galactosyltransferase (GGTA1) enzymes to produce glyco-humanized polyclonal antibodies (GH-pAb) lacking Neu5Gc and -Gal epitopes. We also found that pig IgG Fc domains fail to interact with human Fc receptors and thereby should confer the safety advantage to avoiding macrophage dependent exacerbated inflammatory responses or elicit antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), two drawbacks possibly associated with antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we immunized CMAH\/GGTA1 double knockout (DKO) pigs with the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD) to elicit neutralizing antibodies. Animals rapidly developed a hyperimmune response with anti-SARS-CoV-2 end-titers binding dilutions over one to a million and end-titers neutralizing dilutions of 1:10,000. The IgG fraction purified and formulated following clinical Good Manufacturing Practices, named XAV-19, neutralized Spike\/angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) interaction at a concentration < 1g\/mL and inhibited infection of human cells by SARS-CoV-2 in cytopathic assays. These data and the accumulating safety advantages of using glyco-humanized swine antibodies in humans warrant clinical assessment of XAV-19 to fight against COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":29,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bernard Vanhove","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Odile Duvaux","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Juliette Rousse","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Pierre-Joseph Royer","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Gwenaelle Evanno","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Carine Ciron","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Elsa Lheriteau","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Laurent Vacher","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Nadine Gervois","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Romain Oger","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Yannick Jacques","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Sophie Conchon","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Apolline Salama","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Roberto Duchi","author_inst":"Avantea"},{"author_name":"Irina Lagutina","author_inst":"Avantea"},{"author_name":"Andrea Perota","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Philippe Delahaut","author_inst":"CER Groupe"},{"author_name":"Matthieu Ledure","author_inst":"CER Groupe"},{"author_name":"Melody Paulus","author_inst":"CER Groupe"},{"author_name":"Ray So","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Chris Ka Pun Mok","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Roberto Bruzzone","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Marc Bouillet","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Sophie Brouard","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Cozzi","author_inst":"Padua University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cesare Galli","author_inst":"Avantea"},{"author_name":"Dominique Blanchard","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Jean-Marie Bach","author_inst":"Oniris"},{"author_name":"Jean-Paul Soulillou","author_inst":"University of Nantes"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.24.205583","rel_title":"Rapid generation of circulating and mucosal decoy ACE2 using mRNA nanotherapeutics for the potential treatment of SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-07-25","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.24.205583","rel_abs":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enters through the airways and infects the lungs, causing lethal pulmonary damage in vulnerable patients. This virus contains spike proteins on its envelope that binds to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) expressed on the surface of airway cells, enabling entry of the virus for causing infection1,2. In severe cases, the virus enters the circulatory system, contributing to multiorgan failure. Soluble form of hACE2 binds to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and prevents viral entry into target cells3. Moreover, soluble recombinant ACE2 ameliorates lung injury4 but its short half-life limits its therapeutic utility5. Here, we engineered synthetic mRNA to encode a soluble form of hACE2 (hsACE2) to prevent viral infection. Novel lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) were used to package mRNA and transfect mammalian cells for enhanced production of secreted proteins. Intravenously administered LNP led to hepatic delivery of the mRNA. This elicited secretion of hsACE2 into the blood circulation within 2 h, and levels of circulating hsACE2 peaked at 6 h and gradually decreased over several days. Since the primary site of entry and pathogenesis for SARS-CoV-2 is the lungs, we instilled LNPs into the lungs and were able to detect hsACE2 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid within 24 h and lasted for 48 h. Through co-immunoprecipitation, we found that mRNA-generated hsACE2 was able to bind with the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Furthermore, hsACE2 was able to strongly inhibit (over 90%) SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection. Our proof of principle study shows that mRNA-based nanotherapeutics can be potentially deployed for pulmonary and extrapulmonary neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 and open new treatment opportunities for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jeongwhan Kim","author_inst":"Oregon State University"},{"author_name":"Anindit Mukherjee","author_inst":"Oregon State University"},{"author_name":"Dylan Nelson","author_inst":"Oregon State University"},{"author_name":"Antony Jozic","author_inst":"Oregon State University"},{"author_name":"Gaurav Sahay","author_inst":"Oregon State University"},{"author_name":"Carine Ciron","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Elsa Lheriteau","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Laurent Vacher","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Nadine Gervois","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Romain Oger","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Yannick Jacques","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Sophie Conchon","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Apolline Salama","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Roberto Duchi","author_inst":"Avantea"},{"author_name":"Irina Lagutina","author_inst":"Avantea"},{"author_name":"Andrea Perota","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Philippe Delahaut","author_inst":"CER Groupe"},{"author_name":"Matthieu Ledure","author_inst":"CER Groupe"},{"author_name":"Melody Paulus","author_inst":"CER Groupe"},{"author_name":"Ray So","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Chris Ka Pun Mok","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Roberto Bruzzone","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Marc Bouillet","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Sophie Brouard","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Cozzi","author_inst":"Padua University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cesare Galli","author_inst":"Avantea"},{"author_name":"Dominique Blanchard","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Jean-Marie Bach","author_inst":"Oniris"},{"author_name":"Jean-Paul Soulillou","author_inst":"University of Nantes"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"bioengineering"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.21.20159350","rel_title":"Reducing COVID-19 hospitalization risk through behavior change","rel_date":"2020-07-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.21.20159350","rel_abs":"Our objective was to determine strategies that could potentially reduce the risk of hospitalizations from COVID-19 due to underlying conditions. We used data (N=444,649) from the 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to identify potentially modifiable risk factors associated with reporting any of the underlying conditions (cardiovascular disease, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, hypertension or obesity) found to increase risk of US hospitalizations for COVID-19. Risk factors included lifetime smoking, sedentary lifestyle, and inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption. Multiple logistic regression in Stata produced adjusted odds ratios (AORs) used to estimate population attributable-risk (PAR) in Excel. PARs for the 3 risk factors ranged from 12.4% for inactivity to 15.6% for diet for a combined PAR of 36.3%, implying that total elimination of these 3 risk factors could potentially reduce underlying conditions as much as 36%. This suggests that reducing COVID-19 hospitalizations might be a measurable and feasible US goal for the coronavirus pandemic. The simple lifestyle changes of increasing physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption could reduce obesity, a key underlying condition and risk factor for 4 others. Reducing obesity and inactivity may also boost immunity. With uncertainly around how long the pandemic might last, other proposed strategies include wearing face masks when social distancing is not feasible, and addressing the special issues for nursing home residents. Such actions have the potential to lessen the impact of COVID-19 in the short term along with providing long term health benefits regarding chronic conditions.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"MARY L ADAMS","author_inst":"On Target Health Data LLC"},{"author_name":"David L Katz","author_inst":"True Health Initiative"},{"author_name":"Joseph Grandpre","author_inst":"Wyoming Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Douglas Shenson","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Gaurav Sahay","author_inst":"Oregon State University"},{"author_name":"Carine Ciron","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Elsa Lheriteau","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Laurent Vacher","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Nadine Gervois","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Romain Oger","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Yannick Jacques","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Sophie Conchon","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Apolline Salama","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Roberto Duchi","author_inst":"Avantea"},{"author_name":"Irina Lagutina","author_inst":"Avantea"},{"author_name":"Andrea Perota","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Philippe Delahaut","author_inst":"CER Groupe"},{"author_name":"Matthieu Ledure","author_inst":"CER Groupe"},{"author_name":"Melody Paulus","author_inst":"CER Groupe"},{"author_name":"Ray So","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Chris Ka Pun Mok","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Roberto Bruzzone","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Marc Bouillet","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Sophie Brouard","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Cozzi","author_inst":"Padua University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cesare Galli","author_inst":"Avantea"},{"author_name":"Dominique Blanchard","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Jean-Marie Bach","author_inst":"Oniris"},{"author_name":"Jean-Paul Soulillou","author_inst":"University of Nantes"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.22.20159707","rel_title":"A reference for mortality in Spain from 2001 to 2019 records with an accurate estimate of excess deaths during the 2020 spring covid-19 outbreak","rel_date":"2020-07-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.22.20159707","rel_abs":"Spanish official records of mortality and population in the 21st century are analyzed to determine the reference value of all cause, all age, all sex per capita death rate in the country.

This study presents an analysis of the excess mortality across the 107 Italian provinces, stratified by sex, age group, and period of the outbreak. Methods: The analysis was performed using a two-stage interrupted time series design using daily mortality data for the period January 2015 - May 2020. In the first stage, we performed province-level quasi-Poisson regression models, with smooth functions to define a baseline risk while accounting for trends and weather conditions and to flexibly estimate the variation in excess risk during the outbreak. Estimates were pooled in the second stage using a mixed-effects multivariate meta-analysis. Results: In the period 15 February - 15 May 2020, we estimated an excess of 47,490 (95% empirical confidence intervals: 43,984 to 50,362) deaths in Italy, corresponding to an increase of 29.5% (95%eCI: 26.8 to 31.9%) from the expected mortality. The analysis indicates a strong geographical pattern, with the majority of excess deaths occurring in northern regions, where few provinces experienced up to 800% increase during the peak in late March. There were differences by sex, age, and area both in the overall impact and in its temporal distribution. Conclusions: This study offers a detailed picture of excess mortality during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. The strong geographical and temporal patterns can be related to implementation of lockdown policies and multiple direct and indirect pathways in mortality risk.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matteo Scortichini","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rochelle Schneider dos Santos","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Francesca De' Donato","author_inst":"Lazio Regional Health Service"},{"author_name":"Manuela De Sario","author_inst":"Lazio Regional Health Service"},{"author_name":"Paola Michelozzi","author_inst":"Lazio Regional Health Service"},{"author_name":"Marina Davoli","author_inst":"Lazio Regional Health Service"},{"author_name":"Pierre Masselot","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Francesco Sera","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Antonio Gasparrini","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Romain Oger","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Yannick Jacques","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Sophie Conchon","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Apolline Salama","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Roberto Duchi","author_inst":"Avantea"},{"author_name":"Irina Lagutina","author_inst":"Avantea"},{"author_name":"Andrea Perota","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Philippe Delahaut","author_inst":"CER Groupe"},{"author_name":"Matthieu Ledure","author_inst":"CER Groupe"},{"author_name":"Melody Paulus","author_inst":"CER Groupe"},{"author_name":"Ray So","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Chris Ka Pun Mok","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Roberto Bruzzone","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Marc Bouillet","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Sophie Brouard","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Cozzi","author_inst":"Padua University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cesare Galli","author_inst":"Avantea"},{"author_name":"Dominique Blanchard","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Jean-Marie Bach","author_inst":"Oniris"},{"author_name":"Jean-Paul Soulillou","author_inst":"University of Nantes"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.21.20159236","rel_title":"We are at risk too: The disparate impacts of the pandemic on younger generations","rel_date":"2020-07-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.21.20159236","rel_abs":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in profound global impact with high rates of morbidity and mortality.

Across generational groups, this study examined: (1) rates of precautions and adaptive and maladaptive health behaviours, (2) differences in levels of anxiety, and (3) rates of and changes in COVID-related concerns over time during the early outbreak of COVID-19 in Canada. Methods: We analyzed data from two Canadian population-based datasets: the Canadian Perspective Survey Series: Impact of COVID-19 survey (N=4,627; March 29-April 3, 2020), and Crowdsourcing: Impacts of COVID-19 on Canadians: Your Mental Health (N=45,989; April 24-May 11, 2020). We categorized generational age group, participants self-reported changes in behaviours and COVID-related concerns, and a validated measure assessed anxiety symptoms. Results: There are age differences in behavioural responses to the pandemic; adaptive health habits (e.g., exercise) were stable across groups, while maladaptive health habits (e.g., substance use) were highest among younger groups. COVID-related precautions were also highest among the younger generations, with Generation X exhibiting the highest rate of precautionary behaviour. Results also revealed that anxiety and worry are prevalent in response to the pandemic across all generations, with the highest rate of clinically significant anxiety among Millennials (36.0%). Finally, COVID-related concerns are greatest for younger generations and appear to be decreasing with time.

However, there is a dearth of data describing the impact of COVID-19 infection in patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (ESRD-HD). Methods This retrospective case series analyzed 362 adult patients consecutively hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 illness between March 12, 2020 and May 13, 2020, at a teaching hospital in the New York City metropolitan area. Primary outcome was severe pneumonia as defined by the World Health Organization. Secondary outcomes were: 1) the Combined Outcome of Acute respiratory distress syndrome or in-hospital Death (COAD), and 2) the need for High-levels of Oxygen supplementation (HiO2). Results Patients with ESRD-HD had lower odds for poor outcomes including severe pneumonia [Odds Ratio (OR) 0.4, Confidence Interval (CI) (0.2-0.9) p=.04], HiO2 [OR 0.3, CI (0.1-0.8) p=.02] and COAD [OR 0.4, CI (0.2-1.05) p=.06], when compared to patients without ESRD. In contrast, higher odds for severe pneumonia, COAD and HiO2 were seen with advancing age. African-Americans were over-represented in the hospitalized patient cohort, when compared to their representation in the community (35% vs 18%). Hispanics had higher odds for severe-illness and HiO2 when compared to Caucasians. Conclusions Patients with ESRD-HD had a milder course of illness with a lower likelihood of severe pneumonia and a lesser need for aggressive oxygen supplementation when compared to patients not on chronic dialysis. This protective effect, might have a pathophysiologic basis and needs to be further explored.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ashutossh Naaraayan","author_inst":"Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital"},{"author_name":"Abhishek Nimkar","author_inst":"Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital"},{"author_name":"Amrah Hasan","author_inst":"Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sushil Pant","author_inst":"Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital"},{"author_name":"Momcilo Durdevic","author_inst":"Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital"},{"author_name":"Henrik Elenius","author_inst":"Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital"},{"author_name":"Corina Nava Suarez","author_inst":"Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital"},{"author_name":"Prasanta Basak","author_inst":"Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kameswari Lakshmi","author_inst":"Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michael Mandel","author_inst":"Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital"},{"author_name":"Stephen Jesmajian","author_inst":"Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sophie Conchon","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Apolline Salama","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Roberto Duchi","author_inst":"Avantea"},{"author_name":"Irina Lagutina","author_inst":"Avantea"},{"author_name":"Andrea Perota","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Philippe Delahaut","author_inst":"CER Groupe"},{"author_name":"Matthieu Ledure","author_inst":"CER Groupe"},{"author_name":"Melody Paulus","author_inst":"CER Groupe"},{"author_name":"Ray So","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Chris Ka Pun Mok","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Roberto Bruzzone","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Marc Bouillet","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Sophie Brouard","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Cozzi","author_inst":"Padua University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cesare Galli","author_inst":"Avantea"},{"author_name":"Dominique Blanchard","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Jean-Marie Bach","author_inst":"Oniris"},{"author_name":"Jean-Paul Soulillou","author_inst":"University of Nantes"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"nephrology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.21.20159376","rel_title":"Cerebral Microvascular Injury in Severe COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-07-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.21.20159376","rel_abs":"IMPORTANCE: Microvascular lesions are common in patients with severe COVID-19. Radiologic-pathologic correlation in one case suggests a combination of microvascular hemorrhagic and ischemic lesions that may reflect an underlying hypoxic mechanism of injury, which requires validation in larger studies. OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence, distribution, and clinical and histopathologic correlates of microvascular lesions in patients with severe COVID-19. DESIGN: Observational, retrospective cohort study: March to May 2020. SETTING: Single academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive patients (16) admitted to the intensive care unit with severe COVID-19, undergoing brain MRI for evaluation of coma or focal neurologic deficits. EXPOSURES: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Hypointense microvascular lesions identified by a prototype ultrafast high-resolution susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) MRI sequence, counted by two neuroradiologists and categorized by neuroanatomic location. Clinical and laboratory data (most recent measurements before brain MRI). Brain autopsy and cerebrospinal fluid PCR for SARS-CoV 2 in one patient who died from severe COVID-19. RESULTS: Eleven of 16 patients (69%) had punctate and linear SWI lesions in the subcortical and deep white matter, and eight patients (50%) had >10 SWI lesions. In 4\/16 patients (25%), lesions involved the corpus callosum. Brain autopsy in one patient revealed that SWI lesions corresponded to widespread microvascular injury, characterized by perivascular and parenchymal petechial hemorrhages and microscopic ischemic lesions. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: SWI lesions are common in patients with neurological manifestations of severe COVID-19 (coma and focal neurologic deficits). The distribution of lesions is similar to that seen in patients with hypoxic respiratory failure, sepsis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Collectively, these radiologic and histopathologic findings suggest that patients with severe COVID-19 are at risk for multifocal microvascular hemorrhagic and ischemic lesions in the subcortical and deep white matter.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"John Conklin","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Matthew P.

Gender identity is not reported, therefore data are absent on the impact of COVID-19 on transgender people, including transgender people with HIV. Baseline data from the American Cohort to Study HIV Acquisition Among Transgender Women in High Risk Areas (LITE) Study provide an opportunity to examine pre-COVID vulnerability among transgender women. Setting: Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Miami, New York City, Washington, DC Methods: Baseline data from LITE were analysed for demographic, psychosocial, and material factors that may affect risk for COVID-related harms. Results: The 1020 participants had high rates of poverty, unemployment, food insecurity, homelessness, and sex work. Transgender women with HIV (n=273) were older, more likely to be Black, had lower educational attainment, and were more likely to experience material hardship. Mental and behavioural health symptoms were common and did not differ by HIV status. Barriers to healthcare included being mistreated mistreatment, uncomfortable providers, and past negative experiences; as well as material hardships, such as cost and transportation. However, most reported access to material and social support - demonstrating resilience. Conclusions: Transgender women with HIV may be particularly vulnerable to pandemic harms. Mitigating this harm would have positive effects for everyone, given the highly infectious nature of this coronavirus. Collecting gender identity in COVID-19 data is crucial to inform an effective public health response. Transgender-led organizations' response to this crisis serve as an important model for effective community-led interventions.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tonia Poteat","author_inst":"Department of Social Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Sari Reisner","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School; Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.

The rapid and sensitive immunoassays are urgently demanded for detecting specific antibodies as assistant diagnosis for primary screening of asymptomatic individuals, close contacts,suspected or recovered patients of COIVD-19 during the pandemic period. Methods: The recombinant receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-RBD) was used as the antigen to detect specific IgM and the mixture of recombinant nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (NP) and S-RBD were used to detect specific IgG by the newly designed quantum-dot lateral flow immunoassay strip (QD-LFIA), respectively. Results: A rapid and sensitive QD-LFIA based portable fluorescence smart-phone system was developed for detecting specific IgM\/IgG to SARS-CoV-2 from 100 serum samples of COVID-19 patients and 450 plasma samples from healthy blood donors. Among 100 COVID-19 patients diagnosed with NAT previously, 3 were severe, 35 mild and 62 recovered cases. By using QD-LFIA, 78 (78%) and 99 (99%) samples from 100 COVID-19 patients serum were detected positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG, respectively, but only one sample (0.22%) was cross-reactive with S-RBD from 450 healthy blood donor plasmas that were collected from different areas of China. Conclusion: An ultrasensitive and specific QD-LFIA based portable fluorescence smart-phone system was developed fo r detection of specific IgM and IgG to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which could be used for investigating the prevalence or assistant diagnosis of COVID-19 in humans.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bochao Liu","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jinfeng Li","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xi Tang","author_inst":"The First People Hospital of Foshan"},{"author_name":"Ze Wu","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jinhui Lu","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chaolan Liang","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Shuiping Hou","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ling Zhang","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Tingting Li","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhao","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yongshui Fu","author_inst":"Guangzhou Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Yuebin Ke","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chengyao Li","author_inst":"Southern medical university"},{"author_name":"Haitham Alabsi","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Erica Normandin","author_inst":"Broad Institute, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Bennett Shaw","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jacob Lemieux","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Pardis Sabeti","author_inst":"Broad Institute, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University"},{"author_name":"John A.

Objective: To determine, whether COVID-19 is associated with a vigorous total IgA response and whether IgA autoantibodies are associated with complications of severe illness. Since thrombotic events are frequent in severe COVID-19 and resemble hypercoagulation of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), our approach focused on antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). Materials and methods: In this retrospective cohort study we compared clinical data and aPL from 64 patients with COVID-19 from three independent centers (two in Switzerland, one in Liechtenstein). Samples were collected from April 9, 2020 to May 1, 2020. Total IgA and aPL were measured with FDA-approved commercially available clinical diagnostic kits. Results: Clinical records of the 64 patients with COVID-19 were reviewed and divided into a cohort with mild illness (mCOVID, n=26 [41%]), a discovery cohort with severe illness (sdCOVD, n=14 [22%]) and a confirmation cohort with severe illness (scCOVID, n=24 [38%]). Severe illness was significantly associated with increased total IgA (sdCOVID, P=0.01; scCOVID, P<0.001). Total IgG levels were similar in both cohorts. Among aPL, both cohorts with severe illness significantly correlated with elevated anti-Cardiolipin IgA (sdCOVID and scCOVID, P<0.001), anti-Cardiolipin IgM (sdCOVID, P=0.003; scCOVID, P<0.001), and anti-Beta2 Glycoprotein-1 IgA (sdCOVID and scCOVID, P<0.001). Systemic lupus erythematosus was excluded from all patients as a potential confounder of APS. Conclusions: Higher total IgA and IgA-aPL were consistently associated with severe illness. These novel data strongly suggest that a vigorous antiviral IgA-response triggered in the bronchial mucosa induces systemic autoimmunity.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Omar Hasan Ali","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"David Bomze","author_inst":"Kantonsspital St. Gallen, St. Gallen, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Lorenz Risch","author_inst":"Labormedizinisches Zentrum Dr. Risch, Vaduz, Liechtenstein"},{"author_name":"Silvio D Brugger","author_inst":"University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Matthias Paprotny","author_inst":"Landesspital Liechtenstein, Vaduz, Liechtenstein"},{"author_name":"Myriam Weber","author_inst":"Landesspital Liechtenstein, Vaduz, Liechtenstein"},{"author_name":"Sarah Thiel","author_inst":"Landesspital Liechtenstein, Vaduz, Liechtenstein"},{"author_name":"Lukas Kern","author_inst":"Kantonsspital St. Gallen, St. Gallen, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Werner C Albrich","author_inst":"Kantonsspital St. Gallen, St. Gallen, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Philipp Kohler","author_inst":"Kantonsspital St. Gallen, St. Gallen, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Christian R Kahlert","author_inst":"Kantonsspital St. Gallen, St. Gallen, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Pietro Vernazza","author_inst":"Kantonsspital St. Gallen, St. Gallen, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Philipp K Buehler","author_inst":"University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Reto A Schuepbach","author_inst":"University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Alejandro Gomez-Mejia","author_inst":"University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Alexandra M Popa","author_inst":"Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Andreas Bergthaler","author_inst":"Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Josef M Penninger","author_inst":"University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada"},{"author_name":"Lukas Flatz","author_inst":"Kantonsspital St. Gallen, St. Gallen, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Emery N.

We quantified immunoglobulin M (IgM) and G (IgG) antibodies recognizing the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) or the nucleocapsid (N) protein, and neutralizing antibodies during a period of six months following COVID-19 disease onset in 349 symptomatic COVID-19 patients, which were among the first world-wide being infected. The positivity rate and magnitude of IgM-S and IgG-N responses increased rapidly. High levels of IgM-S\/N and IgG-S\/N at 2-3 weeks after disease onset were associated with virus control and IgG-S titers correlated closely with the capacity to neutralize SARS-CoV-2. While specific IgM-S\/N became undetectable 12 weeks after disease onset in most patients, IgG-S\/N titers showed an intermediate contraction phase, but stabilized at relatively high levels over the six months observation period. At late time points the positivity rates for binding and neutralizing SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies was still over 70%. Taken together, our data indicate sustained humoral immunity in recovered patients who suffer from symptomatic COVID-19, suggesting prolonged immunity.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jun Wu","author_inst":"1 Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan,China;

We performed comparative evaluation of the 19 sets of primers using 4 RNA standards and 29 clinical samples from COVID-19 patients. Six of 15 sets of primers were firstly identified to have faster amplification when tested with four RNA standards, and were further subjected to parallel comparison with the remaining four primer sets using 29 clinical samples. Among these 10 primer sets, Set-4 had the highest positive detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 (82.8%), followed by Set-10, Set-11, Set-13 and Set-14 (75.9%), and Set-14 showed the fastest amplification speed (< 8.5 minutes), followed by Set-17 (< 12.5 minutes). Based on the overall detection performance, Set-4, Set-10, Set-11, Set-13, Set-14 and Set-17 that target Nsp3, S, S, E, N and N gene regions of SARS-CoV-2, respectively, are determined to be better than the other primer sets. Two RT-LAMP assays with the Set-14 primers in combination with any one of four other primer sets (Set-4, Set-10, Set-11, and Set-13) are recommended to be used in the COVID-19 surveillance.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yajuan Dong","author_inst":"College of Life Sciences, Henan Normal University"},{"author_name":"Xiuming Wu","author_inst":"Pathogen Discovery and Evolution Unit, Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Shenwei Li","author_inst":"Shanghai International Travel Healthcare Center"},{"author_name":"Renfei Lu","author_inst":"Clinical Laboratory, Nantong Third Hospital Affiliated to Nantong University"},{"author_name":"Zhenzhou Wan","author_inst":"Medical Laboratory of Taizhou Fourth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jianru Qin","author_inst":"College of Life Sciences, Henan Normal University"},{"author_name":"Guoying Yu","author_inst":"College of Life Sciences, Henan Normal University"},{"author_name":"Xia Jin","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Chiyu Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center"},{"author_name":"Qi Chen","author_inst":"Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Wuhan 430079, China"},{"author_name":"Yang Wu","author_inst":"Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Wuhan 430079, China"},{"author_name":"Jia Liu","author_inst":"1 Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan,China; 2 Joint International L"},{"author_name":"Xuecheng Yang","author_inst":"1 Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan,China; 2 Joint International L"},{"author_name":"Wei Li","author_inst":"1 Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan,China; 2 Joint International L"},{"author_name":"Bin Zhu","author_inst":"1 Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan,China; 2 Joint International L"},{"author_name":"Wenqing Zhou","author_inst":"1 Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan,China; 2 Joint International L"},{"author_name":"Huan Wang","author_inst":"1 Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan,China; 2 Joint International L"},{"author_name":"Shumeng Li","author_inst":"1 Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan,China; 2 Joint International L"},{"author_name":"Sihong Lu","author_inst":"1 Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan,China; 2 Joint International L"},{"author_name":"Di Liu","author_inst":"7 Pritzker School of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, USA"},{"author_name":"Huadong Li","author_inst":"Jin Yin-tan Hospital, Wuhan 430022, China"},{"author_name":"Adalbert Krawczyk","author_inst":"9 Department of Infectious Diseases, University Hospital of Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen 45147, Germany."},{"author_name":"Mengji Lu","author_inst":"2 Joint International Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan,China;10 Institute for Virology, University Hos"},{"author_name":"Dongliang Yang","author_inst":"1 Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan,China; 2 Joint International L"},{"author_name":"Fei Deng","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, China"},{"author_name":"Ulf Dittmer","author_inst":"2 Joint International Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan,China;10 Institute for Virology, University Hos"},{"author_name":"Mirko Trilling","author_inst":"2 Joint International Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan,China;10 Institute for Virology, University Hos"},{"author_name":"Xin Zheng","author_inst":"1 Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan,China; 2 Joint International L"},{"author_name":"Jean-Paul Soulillou","author_inst":"University of Nantes"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"}]}
