Methods: During the COVID-19 pandemic, participants completed phone call or video calls with study personnel where they were asked to report on their physical activity and anxiety levels using the 24-hour physical activity recall and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children. GDM-exposure was assessed using electronic medical records. Results: Children who reported higher levels of moderate to vigorous physical activity or vigorous physical activity, reported lower anxiety symptoms. Children exposed to GDM in utero reported higher anxiety scores and lower engagement in vigorous physical activity compared to unexposed children. Moreover, the pathway through which children exposed to GDM in utero, reported higher anxiety was partially explained by reduced engagement in vigorous physical activity (75%, p=0.05). Conclusions: Engaging in physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic may be beneficial for reducing anxiety, particularly among children exposed to GDM in utero, who are at increased risk for adverse psychological outcomes.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jasmin Alves","author_inst":"University of Southern California"},{"author_name":"Alexandra G Yunker","author_inst":"University of Southern California"},{"author_name":"Alexis DeFendis","author_inst":"University of Southern California"},{"author_name":"Anny H Xiang","author_inst":"Kaiser Permanente Southern California"},{"author_name":"Kathleen A Page","author_inst":"University of Southern California"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pediatrics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.06.20169409","rel_title":"Public perceptions and preventive behaviours during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic: a comparative study between Hong Kong and the United Kingdom","rel_date":"2020-08-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.06.20169409","rel_abs":"Background: In the absence of treatments and vaccines, the mitigation of COVID-19 relies on population engagement in non-pharmaceutical interventions, which is driven by their risk perception, anxiety level and knowledge. There may also be regional discrepancies in these drivers due to different historical exposure to disease outbreaks, government responses and cultures. As such, this study compared psycho-behavioral responses in two regions during the early phase of the pandemic. Methods: Comparable cross-sectional surveys were administered among adults in Hong Kong (HK) and the United Kingdom (UK) during the early phase of each respective epidemic. Explanatory variables included demographics, risk perception and knowledge of COVID-19, anxiety level and preventive behaviors. Responses were weighted according to census data. Logistic regression models, including interaction terms to quantify regional differences, were used to assess the association between explanatory variables and the adoption of social-distancing measures. Results: Data of 3431 complete responses (HK:1663; UK:1768) were analysed. Perceived severity differed by region (HK: 97.5%; UK: 20.7%). A large proportion of respondents were abnormally\/borderline anxious (HK:64.8%; UK:45.9%) and regarded direct contact with infected individuals as the transmission route of COVID-19 (HK:94.0-98.5%; UK:69.2-93.5%), with HK identifying additional routes. HK reported high levels of adoption of social-distancing (HK:32.4-93.7%; UK:17.6-59.0%) and mask-wearing (HK:98.8%; UK:3.1%). The impact of perceived severity and perceived ease of transmission on the adoption of social-distancing varied by region. In HK, they had no impact, whereas in the UK, those who perceived severity as 'high' were more likely to adopt social-distancing (aOR:1.58-3.01), and those who perceived transmission as 'easy' were prone to both general social-distancing (aOR:2.00, 95% CI:1.57, 2.55) and contact avoidance (aOR:1.80, 95% CI: 1.41, 2.30). The impact of anxiety on adopting social-distancing did not vary by region. Discussion: These results suggest that health officials should ascertain and consider baseline levels of risk perception and knowledge in the populations, as well as prior sensitisation to infectious disease outbreaks, during the development of mitigation strategies. Risk communication should be done through suitable media channels - and trust should be maintained - while early intervention remains the cornerstone of effective outbreak response.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Leigh Bowman","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Kin On Kwok","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Rozlyn Redd","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Yuanyuan Yi","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Helen Ward","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Wan In Wei","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Christina J Atchison","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Samuel Yeung Shan Wong","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.06.20169870","rel_title":"BEHAVIORAL CHANGES DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC: RESULTS OF A NATIONAL SURVEY IN SINGAPORE","rel_date":"2020-08-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.06.20169870","rel_abs":"Introduction: As part of infection control measures for COVID-19, individuals have been encouraged to adopt both preventive (e.g., handwashing) and avoidant behavioural changes (e.g., avoiding crowds). In this study, we examined whether demographics predicted the likelihood that a person would adopt these behaviours in Singapore. Materials and Methods: 1145 participants responded to an online survey conducted between 7 March - 21 April 2020. As part of the survey, we collected demographic information and asked participants to report which of 17 behaviour changes they had undertaken because of the outbreak. We ran regression models to predict, using demographic information: (1) the total number of behavioural changes undertaken, (2) the number of preventive changes undertaken, and (3) the number of avoidant changes undertaken. Finally, we sought to identify predictors of persons who: (4) declared that they had not undertaken any of these measures following the outbreak. Results: Females and those who were younger adopted more preventive behaviours: whereas females were more likely to increase handwashing frequency, younger individuals were more likely to wear face masks prior to legislation. Females and those who were married adopted more avoidant behaviours, with both groups avoiding crowded areas and staying home more than usual. Females also voluntarily reduced physical contact, whereas those who were married chose outdoor venues and relied on online shopping. Conclusion: Our characterisation of behavioural changes provides a baseline for public health advisories. Moving forward, local health authorities can focus their efforts to encourage segments of the population who do not readily adopt infection control measures against COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Victoria JE Long","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Jean CJ Liu","author_inst":"Yale-NUS College"},{"author_name":"Rozlyn Redd","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Yuanyuan Yi","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Helen Ward","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Wan In Wei","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Christina J Atchison","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Samuel Yeung Shan Wong","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.06.239574","rel_title":"Generation of tonsil organoids as an ex vivo model for SARS-CoV-2 infection","rel_date":"2020-08-07","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.06.239574","rel_abs":"Palatine tonsil (hereinafter referred to as \"tonsil\") plays role in the immune systems first line of defense against foreign pathogens.

By reanalyzing 54 GEO datasets comprising transcriptomic data of 3428 samples, this study revealed that i) smoking is associated with an increased expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and a decreased expression of cathepsin L; ii) infection of rhinovirus as well as poly(I:C) stimulation leads to high expression of all three SARS-CoV-2 entry-related genes; iii) expression of ACE2 and cathepsin L in nasal epithelial cells are decreased in patients with asthma and allergic rhinitis.

Critical to the rapid evaluation of vaccines and antivirals is the development of tractable animal models of infection. The use of common laboratory strains of mice to this end is hindered by significant divergence of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the receptor required for entry of SARS-CoV-2. In the current study, we designed and utilized an mRNA-based transfection system to induce expression of the hACE2 receptor in order to confer entry of SARS-CoV-2 in otherwise non-permissive cells. By employing this expression system in an in vivo setting, we were able to interrogate the adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in type 1 interferon receptor deficient mice. In doing so, we showed that the T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 is enhanced when hACE2 is expressed during infection. Moreover, we demonstrated that these responses are preserved in memory and are boosted upon secondary infection. Interestingly, we did not observe an enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses with hACE2 induction. Importantly, using this system, we functionally identified the CD4+ and CD8+ peptide epitopes targeted during SARS-CoV-2 infection in H2b restricted mice. Antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in mice of this MHC haplotype primarily target peptides of the spike and membrane proteins, while the antigen-specific CD4+ T cells target peptides of the nucleocapsid, membrane, and spike proteins. The functional identification of these T cell epitopes will be critical for evaluation of vaccine efficacy in murine models of SARS-CoV-2. The use of this tractable expression system has the potential to be used in other instances of emerging infections in which the rapid development of an animal model is hindered by a lack of host susceptibility factors.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mariah Hassert","author_inst":"Saint Louis University"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Geerling","author_inst":"Saint Louis University"},{"author_name":"E.

As with other coronaviruses, a preponderance of evidence suggests the virus originated in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.) and likely underwent a recombination event in an intermediate host prior to entry into human populations. A significant concern is that SARS-CoV-2 could become established in secondary reservoir hosts outside of Asia. To assess this potential, we challenged deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) with SARS-CoV-2 and found robust virus replication in the upper respiratory tract, lungs and intestines, with detectable viral RNA for up to 21 days in oral swabs and 14 days in lungs. Virus entry into the brain also occurred, likely via gustatory-olfactory-trigeminal pathway with eventual compromise to the blood brain barrier. Despite this, no conspicuous signs of disease were observed and no deer mice succumbed to infection. Expression of several innate immune response genes were elevated in the lungs, notably IFN, Cxcl10, Oas2, Tbk1 and Pycard. Elevated CD4 and CD8{beta} expression in the lungs was concomitant with Tbx21, IFN{gamma} and IL-21 expression, suggesting a type I inflammatory immune response. Contact transmission occurred from infected to naive deer mice through two passages, showing sustained natural transmission. In the second deer mouse passage, an insertion of 4 amino acids occurred to fixation in the N-terminal domain of the spike protein that is predicted to form a solvent-accessible loop. Subsequent examination of the source virus from BEI Resources indicated the mutation was present at very low levels, demonstrating potent purifying selection for the insert during in vivo passage. Collectively, this work has determined that deer mice are a suitable animal model for the study of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, and that they have the potential to serve as secondary reservoir hosts that could lead to periodic outbreaks of COVID-19 in North America.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anna Fagre","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Juliette Lewis","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Miles Eckley","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Shijun Zhan","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Savannah M Rocha","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Nicole R Sexton","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Bradly Burke","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Brian J Geiss","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Olve Peersen","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Rebekah Kading","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Joel Rovnak","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Gregory D Ebel","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Ronald B Tjalkens","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Tawfik Aboellail","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Tony Schountz","author_inst":"Colorado State University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.05.20168666","rel_title":"Paediatric Attendances and Acuity in the Emergency Department during the COVID-19 Pandemic","rel_date":"2020-08-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.05.20168666","rel_abs":"Aim: To investigate the difference in both numbers and acuity of presentations to the Paediatric Emergency Department (PED) during the peak time period of the current global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Results: There was a 90% decrease in attendances to PED, with a 10.23% reduction re-attendance rate. Children presenting were younger during the pandemic, with a median age difference of 2 years. They were more likely to present in an ambulance (9.63%), be admitted to hospital (5.75%) and be assigned the highest two Manchester triage categories (6.26%). There was a non-significant trend towards longer lengths of stay. The top 10 presenting complaints remained constant (although the order changed) between time periods. There was no difference in mortality or admission to PICU. Implications: Our data demonstrates that there has been a significant decrease in numbers of children seeking emergency department care. It suggests that presenting patients were proportionally sicker during the pandemic; however, we would argue that this is more in keeping with appropriate acuity for PED presentations, as there were no differences in PICU admission rate or mortality.

Comparisons of prevalence estimates between different communities can inform policy decisions regarding safe travel between countries, help to assess when to implement (or remove) disease control measures and identify the risk of over-burdening healthcare providers. Estimating the true prevalence can, however, be challenging because officially reported figures are likely to be significant underestimates of the true burden of COVID-19 within a community. Previous methods for estimating the prevalence fail to incorporate differences between populations (such as younger populations having higher rates of asymptomatic cases) and so comparisons between, for example, countries, can be misleading. Here, we present an improved methodology for estimating COVID-19 prevalence. We take the reported number of cases and deaths (together with population size) as raw prevalence for the population. We then apply an age-adjustment to this which allows the age-distribution of that population to influence the case-fatality rate and the proportion of asymptomatic cases. Finally, we calculate the likely underreporting factor for the population and use this to adjust our prevalence estimate further. We use our method to estimate the prevalence for 166 countries (or the states of the United States of America, hereafter referred to as US state) where sufficient data were available. Our estimates show that as of the 30th July 2020, the top three countries with the highest estimated prevalence are Brazil (1.26%, 95% CI: 0.96 - 1.37), Kyrgyzstan (1.10%, 95% CI: 0.82 - 1.19) and Suriname (0.58%, 95% CI: 0.44 - 0.63). Brazil is predicted to have the largest proportion of all the current global cases (30.41%, 95%CI: 27.52 - 30.84), followed by the USA (14.52%, 95%CI: 14.26 - 16.34) and India (11.23%, 95%CI: 11.11 - 11.24). Amongst the US states, the highest prevalence is predicted to be in Louisiana (1.07%, 95% CI: 1.02 - 1.12), Florida (0.90%, 95% CI: 0.86 - 0.94) and Mississippi (0.77%, 95% CI: 0.74 - 0.81) whereas amongst European countries, the highest prevalence is predicted to be in Montenegro (0.47%, 95% CI: 0.42 - 0.50), Kosovo (0.35%, 95% CI: 0.29 - 0.37) and Moldova (0.28%, 95% CI: 0.23 - 0.30). Our results suggest that Kyrgyzstan (0.04 tests per predicted case), Brazil (0.04 tests per predicted case) and Suriname (0.29 tests per predicted case) have the highest underreporting out of the countries in the top 25 prevalence. In comparison, Israel (34.19 tests per predicted case), Bahrain (19.82 per predicted case) and Palestine (9.81 tests per predicted case) have the least underreporting. The results of this study may be used to understand the risk between different geographical areas and highlight regions where the prevalence of COVID-19 is increasing most rapidly. The method described is quick and easy to implement. Prevalence estimates should be updated on a regular basis to allow for rapid fluctuations in disease patterns.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Virag Patel","author_inst":"Animal and Plant Health Agency"},{"author_name":"Catherine McCarthy","author_inst":"Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)"},{"author_name":"Rachel A Taylor","author_inst":"Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)"},{"author_name":"Ruth Moir","author_inst":"Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)"},{"author_name":"Louise A Kelly","author_inst":"Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), University of Strathclyde"},{"author_name":"Emma L Snary","author_inst":"Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)"},{"author_name":"Bradly Burke","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Brian J Geiss","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Olve Peersen","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Rebekah Kading","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Joel Rovnak","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Gregory D Ebel","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Ronald B Tjalkens","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Tawfik Aboellail","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Tony Schountz","author_inst":"Colorado State University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.04.20168583","rel_title":"COVID-19: Beliefs in misinformation in the Australian community","rel_date":"2020-08-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.04.20168583","rel_abs":"Objectives: To investigate prevalence of beliefs in COVID-19 misinformation and examine whether demographic, psychosocial and cognitive factors are associated with these beliefs, and how they change over time. Study design: Prospective national longitudinal community online survey. Setting: Australian general public. Participants: Adults aged over 18 years (n=4362 baseline\/Wave 1; n=1882 Wave 2; n=1369 Wave 3). Main outcome measure: COVID-19 misinformation beliefs. Results: Stronger agreement with misinformation beliefs was significantly associated with younger age, male gender, lower education, and primarily speaking a language other than English at home (all p<0.01). After controlling for these variables, misinformation beliefs were significantly associated (p<0.001) with lower digital health literacy, lower perceived threat of COVID-19, lower confidence in government, and lower trust in scientific institutions. The belief that the threat of COVID-19 is greatly exaggerated increased between Wave 1-2 (p=0.002), while belief that herd immunity benefits were being covered up decreased (p<0.001). Greatest support from a list of Australian Government identified myths was for those regarding hot temperatures killing the virus (22%) and Ibuprofen exacerbates COVID-19 (13%). Lower institutional trust and greater rejection of official government accounts were associated with greater support for COVID-19 myths after controlling for sociodemographic variables. Conclusion: These findings highlight important gaps in communication effectiveness. Stronger endorsement of misinformation was associated with male gender, younger age, lower education and language other than English spoken at home.

Using hot and cold sites has led to a low rate of post-operative diagnosis of COVID-19 infection and allowed safe continuation of important emergency and cancer operations in our centre. Objective: The primary objective was to determine the safety of the continuation of surgical admissions and procedures during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic using hot and cold surgical sites. The secondary objective is to determine risk factors of contracting COVID-19 to help guide further prevention. Setting: A single surgical department at a tertiary care referral centre in London, United Kingdom. Participants: All consecutive patients admitted under the care of the urology team over a 3-month period from 1st March to 31st May 2020 over both hot acute admission sites and cold elective sites were included. Exposures: COVID-19 was prevalent in the community over the three months of the study at the height of the pandemic. The majority of elective surgery was carried out in a cold site requiring patients to have a negative COVID-19 swab 72 hours prior to admission and to self-isolate for 14 days pre-operatively, whilst all acute admissions were admitted to the hot site. Main outcomes and measures: COVID-19 was detected in 1.6% of post-operative patients. There was 1 (0.2%) post-operative mortality due to COVID-19. Results: A total of 611 patients, 451 (73.8%) male and 160 (26.2%) female, with a median age of 57 (interquartile range 44-70) were admitted under the surgical team. Of these, 101 (16.5%) were admitted on the cold site and 510 (83.5%) on the hot site. Surgical procedures were performed in 495 patients of which 8 (1.6%) contracted COVID-19 post-operatively with 1 (0.2%) post-operative mortality due to COVID-19. Overall, COVID-19 was detected in 20 (3.3%) patients with 2 (0.3%) deaths. On multivariate analysis, length of stay was associated with contracting COVID-19 in our cohort (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.13-1.39). Conclusions and Relevance: Continuation of surgical procedures using hot and cold sites throughout the COVID-19 pandemic was safe practice, although the risk of COVID-19 remained and is underlined by a post-operative mortality. Reducing length of stay may be able to reduce contraction of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":60,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luke Stroman","author_inst":"Guy's Hospital, London"},{"author_name":"Beth

Design We examined the reliability and internal validity of the ELCSA scale in three repeated waves of a cross-sectional surveys with Rasch models. We estimated the monthly prevalence of food insecurity in the general population and in households with and without children, and compared them with a national 2018 survey. We tested concurrent validity by testing associations of HFI with socioeconomic status and anxiety. Setting ENCOVID-19 is a monthly telephone cross-sectional survey collecting information on the well-being of Mexican households during the pandemic lockdown. Surveys used probabilistic samples and we used data from April (n=833), May (n=850), and June 2020 (n=1,674). Participants Mexicans 18 years or older who had a mobile telephone. Results ELCSA had adequate model fit and HFI was associated, within each wave, with more poverty and anxiety. The COVID-19 lockdown was associated with an important reduction in food security; decreasing stepwise from 38.9% in 2018 to 24.9% in June 2020 in households with children.

We examined the extent of air pollution reduction that was attained under these extreme circumstances, whether these reductions occurred everywhere in the US, and the local factors that drove them. Employing counterfactual time series analysis based on seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average models, we found that these extreme lockdown measures led to a reduction in the weekly PM2.5 average by up to 3.4 micrograms per cubic meter and the weekly NO2 average by up to 11 ppb. These values represent a substantial fraction of the annual mean NAAQS values of 12 micrograms per cubic meter and 53 ppb, respectively. We found evidence of a statistically significant decline in NO2 concentrations following the state-level emergency declaration in almost all states. However, statistically significant declines in PM2.5 occurred mostly in the West Coast and the Northeast. Certain states experienced a decline in NO2 but an increase in PM2.5 concentrations, indicating that these two pollutants arise from dissimilar sources in these states. Finally, we found evidence that states with a higher percentage of mobile source emissions prior to the emergency measures experienced a greater decline in NO2 levels during the pandemic. Although the current social and economic restrictions are not sustainable, our results provide a benchmark to estimate the extent to which air pollution reductions can be achieved. We also identify factors that contributed to the magnitude of pollutant reductions, which can help guide future state-level policies to sustainably reduce air pollution.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pooja Tyagi","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Danielle Braun","author_inst":"Harvard

ensuring the fit of sealing face masks such as N95 and FFP3 masks. Increased demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic has led to shortages in testing equipment and has forced many institutions to abandon fit testing. Three key materials are required for qualitative fit testing: the test solution, nebulizer, and testing hood. Accessible alternatives to the testing solution have been studied. This exploratory qualitative study evaluates alternatives to the nebulizer and hoods for performing qualitative fit testing. Methods: Four devices were trialled to replace the test kit nebulizer. Two enclosures were tested for their ability to replace the test hood. Three researchers evaluated promising replacements under multiple mask fit conditions to assess functionality and accuracy. Results: The aroma diffuser and smaller enclosures allowed participants to perform qualitative fit tests quickly and with high accuracy. Discussion & Conclusion: Aroma diffusers show significant promise in their ability to allow individuals to quickly, easily, and inexpensively perform qualitative fit testing. Our findings indicate that aroma diffusers and homemade testing hoods may allow for qualitative fit testing when conventional apparatus is unavailable. Additional research is needed to evaluate the safety and reliability of these devices.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eugenia O'Kelly","author_inst":"Cambridge University,

reinforced the need to develop epidemiological models capable of describing the progression of the disease to be of use in the formulation of mitigation policies. Here, this problem is addressed using a metapopulation approach to show that the delay in the transmission of the spread between different subsets of the total population, can be incorporated into a SIR framework through a time-dependent transmission rate. Thus, the reproduction number decreases with time despite the population dynamics remains uniform and the depletion of susceptible individuals is small. The obtained results are consistent with the early subexponential growth observed in the cumulated number of confirmed cases even in the absence of containment measures. We validate our model by describing the evolution of the COVID-19 using real data from different countries with an emphasis in the case of Mexico and show that it describes correctly also the long-time dynamics of the spread. The proposed model yet simple is successful at describing the onset and progression of the outbreak and considerably improves accuracy of predictions over traditional compartmental models. The insights given here may probe be useful to forecast the extent of the public health risks of epidemics and thus improving public policy-making aimed at reducing such risks.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carlos I Mendoza","author_inst":"National Autonomous University of Mexico"},{"author_name":"Anmol Arora","author_inst":"University of

been struggling to control the COVID-19 pandemic despite imposing months of lockdown and other public health measures (as of June 30, 2020). In-depth epidemiological information from these countries is lacking. From the perspective of Bangladesh, this study aims to understand the epidemiological features and gaps in public health preparedness. Method This study used publicly available data (8 March-30 June 2020) from the respective health departments of Bangladesh and Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Centre. Descriptive statistics was used to report the incidence, case fatality rates (CFR), and trend analysis. Spatial distribution maps were created using ArcGIS Desktop. Infection dynamics were analyzed via SIR models. Findings In 66 days of nationwide lockdown and other public health efforts, a total of 47,153 cases and 650 deaths were reported. However, the incidence was increased by around 50% within a week after relaxing the lockdown. Males were disproportionately affected in terms of infections (71%) and deaths (77%) than females. The CFR for males was higher than females (1.38% vs 1.01%). Over 50% of infected cases were reported among young adults (20-40-year age group). Geospatial analysis between 7 June 2020 and 20 June 2020 showed that the incidences increased 4 to 10-fold in 12 administrative districts while it decreased in the epicenter. As compared to the EU and USA, trends of the cumulative incidence were slower in South Asia with lower mortality. Conclusion Our findings on gaps in public health preparedness and epidemiological characteristics would contribute to facilitating better public health decisions for managing current and future pandemics like COVID-19 in the settings of developing countries.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Md.

Comparatively less important is (iii) the time of test analysis and contact tracing. When the share of contacts successfully traced is higher, the Test & Trace Time rises somewhat in importance. These results are robust to a wide range of values for how infectious presymptomatic patients are, to the amount of asymptomatic patients, to the network degree distribution and to base epidemic growth rate. We also provide mathematical arguments for why these simulation results hold in more general settings. Since real world Test & Trace systems and policies could affect all three parameters, Symptom Onset to Test Time should be considered, alongside test turnaround time and contact tracing coverage, as a key determinant of Test & Trace success.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ofir Reich","author_inst":"Google"},{"author_name":"Md Mahbub Hasan","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Foundation, Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Enayetur Raheem","author_inst":"Biomedical Research Foundation, Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Md.

We examined the progression of COVID-19 in four island nations that fared well over the first three months of the pandemic: New Zealand, Australia, Iceland, and Taiwan. Using Bayesian phylodynamic methods, we estimated the effective reproduction number of COVID-19 in the four islands as 1-1.4 during early stages of the pandemic, and show that it declined below 1 as human movement was restricted. Our reconstruction of COVID-19's phylogenetic history indicated that this disease was introduced many times into each island, and that introductions slowed down markedly when the borders closed. Finally, we found that New Zealand clusters identified via standard health surveillance largely agreed with those defined by genomic data. Our findings can assist public health decisions in countries with circulating SARS-CoV-2, and support efforts to mitigate any second waves or future

percentage of people with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the general population, however, most existing reports have used a convenience sample, which may bias their estimates. Methods: We sought a representative sample of Connecticut residents, aged [&ge;]18 years and residing in non-congregate settings, who completed a survey between June 4 and June 23, 2020 and underwent serology testing for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies between June 10 and July 29, 2020. We also oversampled non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic subpopulations. We estimated the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies and the prevalence of symptomatic illness and self-reported adherence to risk mitigation behaviors among this population. Results: Of the 567 respondents (mean age 50 [{+\/-}17] years; 53% women; 75% non-Hispanic White individuals) included at the state-level, 23 respondents tested positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, resulting in weighted seroprevalence of 4.0 (90% confidence interval [CI] 2.0-6.0). The weighted seroprevalence for the oversampled non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic populations was 6.4% (90% CI 0.9-11.9) and 19.9% (90% CI 13.2-26.6), respectively. The majority of respondents at the state-level reported following risk mitigation behaviors: 73% avoided public places, 75% avoided gatherings of families or friends, and 97% wore a facemask, at least part of the time. Conclusions: These estimates indicate that the vast majority of people in Connecticut lack antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and there is variation by race\/ethnicity. There is a need for continued adherence to risk mitigation behaviors among Connecticut residents to prevent resurgence of COVID-19 in this region.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shiwani Mahajan","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rajesh Srinivasan","author_inst":"The Gallup

spectrum ranging from mild respiratory symptoms to severe and fatal disease, and older individuals are known to be affected more severely. Neutralizing antibody for viruses is critical for their elimination, and increased cytokine\/chemokine levels are thought to be related to COVID-19 severity. However, the trend of the neutralizing antibody production and cytokine\/chemokine levels during the clinical course of COVID-19 patients with differing levels of severity has not been established. Methods: We serially collected 45 blood samples from 12 patients with different levels of COVID-19 severity, and investigated the trend of neutralizing antibody production using authentic SARS-CoV-2 and cytokine\/chemokine release in the patients' clinical courses. Results: All 12 individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 had the neutralizing antibody against it, and the antibodies were induced at approx. 4-10 days after the patients' onsets. The antibodies in the critical and severe cases showed high neutralizing activity in all clinical courses. Most cytokine\/chemokine levels were clearly high in the critical patients compared to those with milder symptoms. Conclusion: Neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were induced at a high level in the severe COVID-19 patients, indicating that abundant virus replication occurred. Cytokines\/chemokines were expressed more in the critical patients, indicating that high productions of cytokines\/chemokines have roles in the disease severity. These results may indicate that plasma or neutralizing antibody therapy could be a first-line treatment for older patients to eliminate the virus, and corticosteroid therapy could be effective to suppress the cytokine storm after the viral genome's disappearance.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lidya Handayani Tjan","author_inst":"Kobe University"},{"author_name":"Tatsuya

spurred the need for reliable, rapid, and cost-effective diagnostic methods which can easily be applied to large numbers of people. However, current standard protocols for the detection of viral nucleic acids while sensitive, require a high level of automation, sophisticated laboratory equipment and trained personnel to achieve throughputs that allow whole communities to be tested on a regular basis. Here we present Cap-iLAMP (capture and improved loop-mediated isothermal amplification). This method combines a hybridization capture-based RNA extraction of non-invasive gargle lavage samples to concentrate samples and remove inhibitors with an improved colorimetric RT-LAMP assay and smartphone-based color scoring. Cap-iLAMP is compatible with point-of-care testing and enables the detection of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples in less than one hour. In contrast to direct addition of the sample to improved LAMP (iLAMP), Cap-iLAMP does not result in false positives and single infected samples can be detected in a pool among 25 uninfected samples, thus reducing the technical cost per test to ~1 Euro per individual.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lukas Bokelmann","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary

component of the pathogen and thus inherently limit the representation of pathogen peptides for cellular immunity based memory. We find that SARS-CoV-2 subunit peptides may not be robustly displayed by the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules in certain individuals. We introduce an augmentation strategy for subunit vaccines that adds a small number of peptides to a vaccine to improve the population coverage of pathogen peptide display. We augment a subunit vaccine by selecting additional pathogen peptides to maximize the total number of vaccine peptide hits against the distribution of MHC haplotypes in a population. For each subunit we design independent MHC class I and MHC class II peptide sets for augmentation, and alternatively design a combined set of peptides for MHC class I and class II display. We evaluate the population coverage of 9 different subunits of SARS-CoV-2, including 5 functional domains and 4 full proteins, and augment each of them to fill a predicted coverage gap. We predict that a SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain subunit vaccine will have fewer than six peptide-HLA hits with [&le;] 50 nM binding affinity per individual in 51.31% (class I) and 32.99% (class II) of the population, and with augmentation, the uncovered population is predicted to be reduced to 0.54% (class I) and 1.46% (class II). We find that a joint set of pathogen peptides for MHC class I and class II display is predicted to produce a more compact vaccine design than using independent sets for MHC class I and class II.

geographically remote Pacific island with easily sealable borders, implemented a nation-wide lockdown of all non-essential services to curb the spread of COVID-19. New Zealand has now effectively eliminated the virus, with low numbers of new cases limited to new arrivals in managed quarantine facilities at the border. Here, we generated 649 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from infected patients in New Zealand with samples collected between 26 February and 22 May 2020, representing 56% of all confirmed cases in this time period. Despite its remoteness, the viruses imported into New Zealand represented nearly all of the genomic diversity sequenced from the global virus population. The proportion of D614G variants in the virus spike protein increased over time due to an increase in their importation frequency, rather than selection within New Zealand. These data also helped to quantify the effectiveness of public health interventions. For example, the effective reproductive number, Re, of New Zealand's largest cluster decreased from 7 to 0.2 within the first week of lockdown. Similarly, only 19% of virus introductions into New Zealand resulted in a transmission lineage of more than one additional case. Most of the cases that resulted in a transmission lineage originated from North America, rather than from Asia where the virus first emerged or from the nearest geographical neighbour, Australia. Genomic data also helped link more infections to a major transmission cluster than through epidemiological data alone, providing probable sources of infections for cases in which the source was unclear. Overall, these results demonstrate the utility of genomic pathogen surveillance to inform public health and disease mitigation.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jemma L

a global health- and economic crisis. Lifting confinement restriction and resuming to normality depends greatly on COVID-19 immunity screening. Detection of antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which causes COVID-19 by serological methods is important to diagnose a current or resolved infection. In this study, we applied a rapid COVID-19 IgM\/IgG antibody test and performed serology assessment of antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. In PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients (n=45), the total antibody detection rate is 92% in hospitalized patients and 79% in non-hospitalized patients. We also studied antibody response in relation to time after symptom onset and disease severity, and observed an increase in antibody reactivity and distinct distribution patterns of IgM and IgG following disease progression. The total IgM and IgG detection is 63% in patients with < 2 weeks from disease onset; 85% in non-hospitalized patients with > 2 weeks disease duration; and 91% in hospitalized patients with > 2 weeks disease duration. We also compared different blood sample types and suggest a potentially higher sensitivity by serum\/plasma comparing with whole blood measurement. To study the specificity of the test, we used 69 sera\/plasma samples collected between 2016-2018 prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and obtained a test specificity of 97%. In summary, our study provides a comprehensive validation of the rapid COVID-19 IgM\/IgG serology test, and mapped antibody detection patterns in association with disease progress and hospitalization. Our study supports that the rapid COVID-19 IgM\/IgG test may be applied to assess the COVID-19 status both at the individual and at a population level.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yang De Marinis","author_inst":"Lund University"},{"author_name":"Torgny Sunnerhagen","author_inst":"Lund

We report systemic and mucosal antibody responses in convalescent individuals who experienced varying disease severity. Robust antibody responses to diverse SARS-CoV-2 antigens and evidence of elevated responses to endemic CoV were observed among convalescent donors. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA and IgG responses were often negatively correlated, particularly in mucosal samples, suggesting subject-intrinsic biases in isotype switching. Assessment of antibody-mediated effector functions revealed an inverse correlation between systemic and mucosal neutralization activity and site-dependent differences in the isotype of neutralizing antibodies. Serum neutralization correlated with systemic anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM response magnitude, while mucosal neutralization was associated with nasal SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA. These findings begin to map how diverse Ab characteristics relate to Ab functions and outcomes of infection, informing public health assessment strategies and vaccine development

syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has overwhelmed health systems worldwide and highlighted limitations of diagnostic testing. Several types of diagnostics including RT-PCR-based assays, antigen detection by lateral flow assays and antibody-based assays have been developed and deployed in a short time. However, many of these assays are lacking in sensitivity and\/or specificity. Here, we describe an immunoaffinity purification followed by high resolution mass spectrometry-based targeted assay capable of detecting viral antigen in nasopharyngeal swab samples of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. Based on our discovery experiments using purified virus, recombinant viral protein and nasopharyngeal swab samples from COVID-19 positive patients, nucleocapsid protein was selected as a target antigen. We then developed an automated antibody capture-based workflow coupled to targeted high-field asymmetric ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) - parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) assays on an Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer. An ensemble machine learning-based model for determining COVID-19 positive samples was created using fragment ion intensities in the PRM data. This resulted in 97.8% sensitivity and 100% specificity with RT-PCR-based molecular testing as the gold standard. Our results demonstrate that direct detection of infectious agents from clinical samples by mass spectrometry-based assays have potential to be deployed as diagnostic assays in clinical laboratories.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Santosh Renuse","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Patrick M Vanderboom","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Anthony D.
