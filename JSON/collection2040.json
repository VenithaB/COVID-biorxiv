An alternate entry receptor for the virus was recently proposed to be basigin\/CD147. These early studies have already prompted a clinical trial and multiple published hypotheses of the role of this host receptor in viral infection and pathogenesis. We sought to independently characterize the basigin-spike protein interaction. After conducting several lines of experiments, we report that we are unable to find evidence supporting the role of basigin as a putative spike-binding receptor. Recombinant forms of both the entire ectodomain and S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that directly bind ACE2 do not interact with basigin expressed on the surface of human cells. Using specialized assays tailored to detect receptor interactions as weak or weaker than the proposed basigin-spike binding, we report no evidence for direct binding of the viral spike to either of the two common isoforms of basigin. Given the pressing need for clarity on which targets of SARS-CoV-2 may lead to promising therapeutics, we present these findings to allow more informed decisions about the translational relevance of this putative mechanism in the race to understand and treat COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jarrod Shilts","author_inst":"Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"Gavin James Wright","author_inst":"Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"contradictory results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.26.219741","rel_title":"The SARS-CoV-2 Spike Variant D614G Favors an Open Conformational State","rel_date":"2020-07-26","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.26.219741","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic underwent a rapid transition with the emergence of a SARS-CoV-2 variant that carried the amino acid substitution D614G in the Spike protein that became globally prevalent. The G-form is both more infectious in vitro and associated with increased viral loads in infected people. To gain insight into the mechanism underlying these distinctive characteristics, we employed multiple replicas of microsecond all-atom simulations to probe the molecular-level impact of this substitution on Spikes closed and open states. The open state enables Spike interactions with its human cellular receptor, ACE2. Here we show that changes in the inter-protomer energetics due to the D614G substitution favor a higher population of infection-capable (open) states. The inter-protomer interactions between S1 and S2 subunits in the open state of the D-form are asymmetric. This asymmetry is resolved in the G-form due to the release of tensile hydrogen bonds resulting in an increased population of open conformations. Thus, the increased infectivity of the G-form is likely due to a higher rate of profitable binding encounters with the host receptor. It is also predicted to be more neutralization sensitive due to enhanced exposure of the receptor binding domain, a key target region for neutralizing antibodies.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rachael A Mansbach","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Srirupa Chakraborty","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratoy"},{"author_name":"Kien Nguyen","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"David Montefiori","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Bette Korber","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"S.

COVID-19 is a viral disease that is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which has no approved vaccine. The available control measures are non-pharmacological interventions like wearing face masks, social distancing, and lockdown which are being advocated for by the WHO. This work assesses the impact of non-pharmaceutical control measures (social distancing and use of face-masks) and mass testing on the spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria. A community-based transmission model for COVID-19 in Nigeria is formulated with observing social distancing, wearing face masks in public and mass testing. The model is parameterized using Nigeria data on COVID-19 in Nigeria. The basic reproduction number is found to be less than unity( R_0<1) when the compliance with intervention measures is moderate (50%[&le;]<70%) and the testing rate per day is moderate (0.5[&le;]{sigma}_2<0.7) or when the compliance with intervention measures is strict ([&ge;]70%) and the testing rate per day is poor ({sigma}_2=0.3). This implies that Nigeria will be able to halt the spread of COVID-19 under these two conditions. However, it will be easier to enforce strict compliance with intervention measures in the presence of poor testing rate due to the limited availability of testing facilities and manpower in Nigeria. Hence, this study advocates that Nigerian governments (Federal and States) should aim at achieving a testing rate of at least 0.3 per day while ensuring that all the citizens strictly comply with wearing face masks and observing social distancing in public.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chinwendu Emilian Madubueze","author_inst":"University of Agriculture, Makurdi"},{"author_name":"Nkiru M.

The number of cases changes quickly and varies depending upon which source you use to track, so in the current epidemiological context, the early recognition is critical for the rapid identification of suspected cases (with SARS-CoV-2 infection-like symptoms and signs) to be immediately subjected to quarantine measures. Although surveys are widely used for identifying COVID-19 cases, outcomes and associated risks, no validated epidemiological tool exists for surveying SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population so far. Methods Our study is the phase II of the EPICOVID19 national survey, launched in April 2020 including a national convenience sample of 201121 adults, who voluntarily filled the EPICOVID19 questionnaire. The phase II questionnaire was mailed to all subjects who underwent tests for COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and who accepted to be involved in the second phase of the study, focused on the results reported for NPS and\/or serological IgG\/IgM tests. We evaluated the capability of the self-reported symptoms collected through the EPICOVID19 questionnaire to discriminate the COVID-19 among symptomatic subjects, in order to identify possible cases to undergo instrumental measurements and clinical examinations. We defined a method for the identification of a total score and validated it with reference to the serological and molecular clinical diagnosis, using four standard steps: identification of critical factors, confirmation of presence of latent variable, development of optimal scoring algorithm and validation of the scoring algorithm. Findings 2703 subjects [66% response rate] completed the Phase II questionnaire. Of 2703 individuals, 694 (25.7%) were NPS(+) and of these 84 (12.1% of the 694 NPS(+)) were asymptomatic. In the individuals who performed serological testing, of the 472 who did IgG(+) and 421 who did IgM(+), 22.9% and 11.6% tested positive, respectively. Among IgG(+) 1 of 108 subjects was asymptomatic (0.9%) while 5\/49 subjects among IgM(+) were asymptomatic (10.2%). Compared with NPS(-), among NPS(+) subjects there was a higher rate for Fever (421 [60.7%] vs 391[19.5% ]; p<0.0001), Loss of Taste and\/or Smell (365 [52.6%] vs 239 [11.9% ]; p<0.0001) and Cough (352 [50.7%] vs 580 [28.9% ]; p<0.0001). Also for other symptoms the frequencies were significantly higher in NPS(+) subjects than in NPS(-) ones (p<0.001). Among groups with serological tests, the symptoms with higher percentages in the subjects IgG(+) were Fever (65 [60.2%] vs 43[11.8% ]; p<0.0001) and Pain in muscles, bones, joints (73 [67.6%] vs 71 [19.5% ]; p<0.0001). For the COVID-19 self-reported symptoms items, exploratory (proportion variance explained [89.9%]) and confirmatory factor analysis results (SMSR 0.072; RMSEA 0.052) highlights the presence of one latent variable (factor) underlying the symptoms. We define the one-factor solution as EPICOVID19 diagnostic scale and optimal score for each items was identified: Respiratory problems (1.03), Chest pain (1.07), Loss of Taste and\/or Smell (0.97) and Tachycardia (palpitations) (1.05) were the most important symptoms. The cut-off score was 2.56 (Sensitivity 76.56%; Specificity 68.24%) in NPS(+) and 2.59 (Se 80.37; Sp 80.17) in IgG(+) subjects.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luca Bastiani","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Clinical Physiology"},{"author_name":"Loredana Fortunato","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Clinical Physiology"},{"author_name":"Stefania Pieroni","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Clinical Physiology"},{"author_name":"Fabrizio Bianchi","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Clinical Physiology"},{"author_name":"Fulvio Adorni","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Biomedical Technologies"},{"author_name":"Federica Prinelli","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Biomedical Technologies"},{"author_name":"Andrea Giacomelli","author_inst":"ASST-FBF-Sacco, University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Gabriele Pagani","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Unit, Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences L.Sacco"},{"author_name":"Stefania Maggi","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Neuroscience"},{"author_name":"Caterina Trevisan","author_inst":"University of Padova, Department of Medicine (DIMED)"},{"author_name":"Marianna Noale","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Neuroscience"},{"author_name":"Nithiya Jesuthasan","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Biomedical Technologies"},{"author_name":"Aleksandra Sojic","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Biomedical Technologies"},{"author_name":"Carla Pettenati","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Biomedical Technologies"},{"author_name":"Massimo Andreoni","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Clinic, Department of System Medicine"},{"author_name":"Raffaele Antonelli Incalzi","author_inst":"Unit of Geriatrics, Department of Medicine, Biomedical Campus of Rome"},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Unit, Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences L.Sacco"},{"author_name":"Sabrina Molinaro","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Clinical Physiology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.22.20159806","rel_title":"Estimating Variation of Covid-19 infection in the Population:Results from Understanding Society (UKHLS) first monthly covid-19 survey","rel_date":"2020-07-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.22.20159806","rel_abs":"The analysis in this paper uses the new Understanding Society COVID-19 survey.

Combining these probabilities we find that the chances of infection increase with a persons education level, are lower and declining with age among those aged over 55, and were higher in the West Midlands and London and lower in the North East than in the rest of the country, and tended to increase with regional population density. There is also evidence that the infection rate was lower among those of a Caribbean origin.

As the risk of contracting directly-transmitted infections depends on who interacts with whom, mathematical models often use contact matrices to characterise the spread of infectious pathogens. These contact matrices are usually generated from diary-based contact surveys. However, the majority of places in the world do not have representative empirical contact studies, so synthetic contact matrices have been constructed using more widely available setting-specific survey data on household, school, classroom, and workplace composition combined with empirical data on contact patterns in Europe. In 2017, the largest set of synthetic contact matrices to date were published for 152 geographical locations. In this study, we update these matrices with the most recent data and extend our analysis to 177 geographical locations. Due to the observed geographic differences within countries, we also quantify contact patterns in rural and urban settings where data is available. Further, we compare both the 2017 and 2020 synthetic matrices to out-of-sample empirically-constructed contact matrices, and explore the effects of using both the empirical and synthetic contact matrices when modelling physical distancing interventions for the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that the synthetic contact matrices reproduce the main traits of the contact patterns in the empirically-constructed contact matrices. Models parameterised with the empirical and synthetic matrices generated similar findings with few differences observed in age groups where the empirical matrices have missing or aggregated age groups. This finding means that synthetic contact matrices may be used in modelling outbreaks in settings for which empirical studies have yet to be conducted.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kiesha Prem","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kevin van Zandvoort","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Petra Klepac","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nicholas G Davies","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"- Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Alex R Cook","author_inst":"Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Mark Jit","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stefania Maggi","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Neuroscience"},{"author_name":"Caterina Trevisan","author_inst":"University of Padova, Department of Medicine (DIMED)"},{"author_name":"Marianna Noale","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Neuroscience"},{"author_name":"Nithiya Jesuthasan","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Biomedical Technologies"},{"author_name":"Aleksandra Sojic","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Biomedical Technologies"},{"author_name":"Carla Pettenati","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Biomedical Technologies"},{"author_name":"Massimo Andreoni","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Clinic, Department of System Medicine"},{"author_name":"Raffaele Antonelli Incalzi","author_inst":"Unit of Geriatrics, Department of Medicine, Biomedical Campus of Rome"},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Unit, Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences L.Sacco"},{"author_name":"Sabrina Molinaro","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Clinical Physiology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.22.20159798","rel_title":"The Epidemiology Workbench: a Tool for Communities to Strategize in Response to COVID-19 and other Infectious Diseases","rel_date":"2020-07-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.22.20159798","rel_abs":"COVID-19 poses a dramatic challenge to health, community life, and the economy of communities across the world. While the properties of the virus are similar from place to place, the impact has been dramatically different from place to place, due to such factors as population density, mobility, age distribution, etc. Thus, optimum testing and social distancing strategies may also be different from place to place. The Epidemiology Workbench provides access to an agent-based model in which demographic, geographic, and public health information a community together with a social distancing and testing strategy may be input, and a range of possible outcomes computed, to inform local authorities on coping strategies. The model is adaptable to other infectious diseases, and to other strains of coronavirus. The tool is illustrated by scenarios for the cities of Urbana and Champaign, Illinois, the home of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Our calculations suggest that massive testing along with some form of shelter-at-home during the weeks of mass ingress is the most effective strategy to combat the likely increase in local cases due to mass ingress of a student population carrying a higher viral load than that currently present in the community.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Santiago N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Corrales","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Eric Jakobsson","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Petra Klepac","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nicholas G Davies","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"- Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Alex R Cook","author_inst":"Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Mark Jit","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stefania Maggi","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Neuroscience"},{"author_name":"Caterina Trevisan","author_inst":"University of Padova, Department of Medicine (DIMED)"},{"author_name":"Marianna Noale","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Neuroscience"},{"author_name":"Nithiya Jesuthasan","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Biomedical Technologies"},{"author_name":"Aleksandra Sojic","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Biomedical Technologies"},{"author_name":"Carla Pettenati","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Biomedical Technologies"},{"author_name":"Massimo Andreoni","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Clinic, Department of System Medicine"},{"author_name":"Raffaele Antonelli Incalzi","author_inst":"Unit of Geriatrics, Department of Medicine, Biomedical Campus of Rome"},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Unit, Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences L.Sacco"},{"author_name":"Sabrina Molinaro","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Clinical Physiology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.24.20159947","rel_title":"Effect of manual and digital contact tracing on COVID-19 outbreaks: a study on empirical contact data","rel_date":"2020-07-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.24.20159947","rel_abs":"In the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdowns have succeeded in limiting contagions in many countries, at however heavy societal costs: more targeted non-pharmaceutical interventions are desirable to contain or mitigate potential resurgences. Contact tracing, by identifying and quarantining people who have been in prolonged contact with an infectious individual, has the potential to stop the spread where and when it occurs, with thus limited impact. The limitations of manual contact tracing (MCT), due to delays and imperfect recall of contacts, might be compensated by digital contact tracing (DCT) based on smartphone apps, whose impact however depends on the app adoption. To assess the efficiency of such interventions in realistic settings, we use here datasets describing contacts between individuals in several contexts, with high spatial and temporal resolution, to feed numerical simulations of a compartmental model for COVID-19. We find that the obtained reduction of epidemic size has a robust behavior: this benefit is linear in the fraction of contacts recalled during MCT, and quadratic in the app adoption, with no threshold effect. The combination of tracing strategies can yield important benefits, and the cost (number of quarantines) vs. benefit curve has a typical parabolic shape, independent on the type of tracing, with a high benefit and low cost if app adoption and MCT efficiency are high enough. Our numerical results are qualitatively confirmed by analytical results on simplified models. These results may inform the inclusion of MCT and DCT within COVID-19 response plans.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alain Barrat","author_inst":"Aix Marseille Univ, Universite de Toulon, CNRS, CPT"},{"author_name":"Ciro Cattuto","author_inst":"University of Turin, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Mikko Kivel\u00e4","author_inst":"Aalto University, Finland"},{"author_name":"Sune Lehmann","author_inst":"Technical University of Denmark, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Jari Saram\u00e4ki","author_inst":"Aalto University, Finland"},{"author_name":"- Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Alex R Cook","author_inst":"Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Mark Jit","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stefania Maggi","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Neuroscience"},{"author_name":"Caterina Trevisan","author_inst":"University of Padova, Department of Medicine (DIMED)"},{"author_name":"Marianna Noale","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Neuroscience"},{"author_name":"Nithiya Jesuthasan","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Biomedical Technologies"},{"author_name":"Aleksandra Sojic","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Biomedical Technologies"},{"author_name":"Carla Pettenati","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Biomedical Technologies"},{"author_name":"Massimo Andreoni","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Clinic, Department of System Medicine"},{"author_name":"Raffaele Antonelli Incalzi","author_inst":"Unit of Geriatrics, Department of Medicine, Biomedical Campus of Rome"},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Unit, Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences L.Sacco"},{"author_name":"Sabrina Molinaro","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Clinical Physiology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.22.20159731","rel_title":"Alternative Approaches for Modelling COVID-19:High-Accuracy Low-Data Predictions","rel_date":"2020-07-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.22.20159731","rel_abs":"Background: Numerous models have tried to predict the spread of COVID-19. Many involve myriad assumptions and parameters which cannot be reliably calculated under current conditions. We describe machine-learning and curve-fitting based models using fewer assumptions and readily available data. Methods: Instead of relying on highly parameterized models, we design and train multiple neural networks with data on a national and state level, from 9 COVID-19 affected countries, including Indian and US states and territories. Further, we use an array of curve-fitting techniques on government-reported numbers of COVID-19 infections and deaths, separately projecting and collating curves from multiple regions across the globe, at multiple levels of granularity, combining heavily-localized extrapolations to create accurate national predictions. Findings: We achieve an R2 of 0.999 on average through the use of curve-fits and fine-tuned statistical learning methods on historical, global data. Using neural network implementations, we consistently predict the number of reported cases in 9 geographically- and demographically-varied countries and states with an accuracy of 99.53% for 14 days of forecast and 99.1% for 24 days of forecast. Interpretation: We have shown that curve-fitting and machine-learning methods applied on reported COVID-19 data almost perfectly reproduce the results of far more complex and data-intensive epidemiological models. Using our methods, several other parameters may be established, such as the average detection rate of COVID-19. As an example, we find that the detection rate of cases in India (even with our most lenient estimates) is 2.38% - almost a fourth of the world average of 9%.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dewang K Agarwal","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Soham De","author_inst":"Ashoka University"},{"author_name":"Ojas Shukla","author_inst":"DPS International Gurgaon"},{"author_name":"Archit Checker","author_inst":"Ashoka University"},{"author_name":"Apoorvi Mittal","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Ankita Borah","author_inst":"Ashoka University"},{"author_name":"Debayan Gupta","author_inst":"Ashoka University"},{"author_name":"Mark Jit","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stefania Maggi","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Neuroscience"},{"author_name":"Caterina Trevisan","author_inst":"University of Padova, Department of Medicine (DIMED)"},{"author_name":"Marianna Noale","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Neuroscience"},{"author_name":"Nithiya Jesuthasan","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Biomedical Technologies"},{"author_name":"Aleksandra Sojic","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Biomedical Technologies"},{"author_name":"Carla Pettenati","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Biomedical Technologies"},{"author_name":"Massimo Andreoni","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Clinic, Department of System Medicine"},{"author_name":"Raffaele Antonelli Incalzi","author_inst":"Unit of Geriatrics, Department of Medicine, Biomedical Campus of Rome"},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Unit, Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences L.Sacco"},{"author_name":"Sabrina Molinaro","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Clinical Physiology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.22.20159293","rel_title":"Air pollution, sociodemographic and health conditions effects on COVID-19 mortality in Colombia: an ecological study","rel_date":"2020-07-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.22.20159293","rel_abs":"Objective: To determine the association between chronic exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), sociodemographic aspects, and health conditions and COVID-19 mortality in Colombia. Methods: Ecological study using data at the municipality level, as units of analysis. COVID-19 data were obtained from official reports up to and including July 17th, 2020. PM2.5 long-term exposure was defined as the 2014-2018 average of the estimated concentrations at municipalities obtained from the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service Reanalysis (CAMSRA) model.

Results: Estimated mortality rate ratios (MRR) for long-term average PM2.5 were not statistically significant in either of the two components of the hurdle model (i.e., the likelihood of reporting at least one death or the count of fatal cases). We found that having 10% or more of the population over 65 years of age (MRR=3.91 95%CI 2.24-6.81), the poverty index (MRR=1.03 95%CI 1.01-1.05), and the prevalence of hypertension over 6% (MRR=1.32 95%CI1.03-1.68) are the main factors associated with death rate at the municipality level. Having a higher hospital beds capacity is inversely correlated to mortality. Conclusions: There was no evidence of an association between long-term exposure to PM2.5 and mortality rate at the municipality level in Colombia. Demographics, health system capacity, and social conditions did have evidence of an ecological effect on COVID-19 mortality.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Laura A Rodriguez-Villamizar","author_inst":"Universidad Industrial de Santander"},{"author_name":"Luis Carlos Belalcazar-Ceron","author_inst":"Universidad Nacional de Colombia"},{"author_name":"Julian Alfredo Fernandez-Nino","author_inst":"Universidad del Norte"},{"author_name":"Diana Marcela Marin-Pineda","author_inst":"Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana"},{"author_name":"Oscar Alberto Rojas-Sanchez","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Lizbeth Alexandra Acuna-Merchan","author_inst":"Fondo Colombiano de Enfermedades de Alto Costo"},{"author_name":"Nathaly Ramirez-Garcia","author_inst":"Fondo Colombiano de Enfermedades de Alto Costo"},{"author_name":"Sonia Cecilia Mangones-Matos","author_inst":"Universidad Nacional de Colombia"},{"author_name":"Jorge Mario Vargas-Gonzalez","author_inst":"Universidad Nacional de Colombia"},{"author_name":"Julian Herrera-Torres","author_inst":"Universidad Nacional de Colombia"},{"author_name":"Dayana Milena Agudelo-Castaneda","author_inst":"Universidad del Norte"},{"author_name":"Juan Gabriel Pineros-Jimenez","author_inst":"Universidad de Antioquia"},{"author_name":"Nestor Y Rojas-Roa","author_inst":"Universidad Nacional de Colombia"},{"author_name":"Victor Mauricio Herrera-Galindo","author_inst":"Universidad Autonoma de Bucaramanga"},{"author_name":"Massimo Andreoni","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Clinic, Department of System Medicine"},{"author_name":"Raffaele Antonelli Incalzi","author_inst":"Unit of Geriatrics, Department of Medicine, Biomedical Campus of Rome"},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Unit, Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences L.Sacco"},{"author_name":"Sabrina Molinaro","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Clinical Physiology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.21.20159061","rel_title":"The Global Health Security Index is not predictive of coronavirus pandemic responses among Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries","rel_date":"2020-07-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.21.20159061","rel_abs":"ABSTRACT The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has devastated many countries with ripple effects felt in various sectors of the global economy. In November 2019, the Global Health Security (GHS) Index was released as the first detailed assessment and benchmarking of 195 countries to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats. This paper presents the first comparison of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD countries' performance during the pandemic, with the pre-COVID-19 pandemic preparedness as determined by the GHS Index. Using a rank-based analysis, four indices were compared between select countries, including total cases, total deaths, recovery rate, and total tests performed, all standardized for comparison. Our findings suggest a discrepancy between the GHS index rating and the actual performance of countries during this pandemic, with an overestimation of the preparedness of some countries scoring highly on the GHS index and underestimation of the preparedness of other countries with relatively lower scores on the GHS index.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Enoch J Abbey","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Banda A.

This new disease had a very rapid global spread, causing multiple deaths in a short time, and which led to putting the entire world on health alert. In patients who have this disease, they present bilateral opacities in frosted multilobar glass with peripheral distribution. Some authors have suggested the use of ultrasound at the point of care for its early recognition. In this study, we evaluated the findings of lung ultrasound in 25 patients admitted to the General Hospital Dr. Enrique Cabrera, Mexico, with a diagnosis confirmed by RT-PCR of SARS CoV2. This small retrospective study suggests that artifacts like glass rockets with or without the Birolleau variant (White lung), confluent B-lines, thick irregular pleural lines, and variable size (subpleural) consolidations are typical findings of lung ultrasound in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. The presence of these findings is useful when evaluating patients with suspected COVID-19. In resource-limited and austere settings where chest radiography, CT, and RT-PCR are not available or the response time is long, lung ultrasound performed by trained personnel can be an aid in the diagnosis of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luis Fernando L Paredes Sr.","author_inst":"Cardiology Department, Hospital General Enrique Cabrera, Mexico City."},{"author_name":"Ivan I Ilescas Jr.","author_inst":"General Hospital \"Enrique Cabrera\""},{"author_name":"Modupe O.

Implications of so-called Long Covid on neurological services and primary care and similarities with other neurological disorders are discussed. Methods: Firstly, a systematic overview of current reviews of neurological symptoms of COVID-19 was conducted. Secondly the implications of these findings are discussed in relation to the potential effect on neurological services and the similarities in the experience of patients with COVID-19 and those with other neurological disorders. Results: Twenty-nine systematic reviews were identified within seven databases, published between 11th April 2020 and 27th August 2020. The results indicated (so far), that COVID-19 exhibits two types of neurological symptoms; life threatening symptoms such as Guillain Barre Syndrome and encephalitis, and less devastating symptoms such as fatigue and myalgia. These so-called lesser symptoms appear to be emerging as longer-term for some sufferers and have been recently labelled Long Covid. When compared, these Long Covid symptoms are very similar to other neurological conditions such as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) and Functional Neurological Disorder (FND). Conclusions: Implications for neurological healthcare services in the UK may include longer waiting times and a need for more resources (including more qualified health professionals). There is also a possible change-effect on perceptions of other neurological conditions such as CFS and FND, particularly for health professionals. Future research is recommended to explore changes in perceptions of neurological symptoms because of COVID-19, particularly for health professionals.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tamar Wildwing","author_inst":"Canterbury Christ Church University"},{"author_name":"Nicole Holt","author_inst":"Canterbury Christ Church University"},{"author_name":"Modupe O.

Under such circumstances, individual activities in social media and other online platforms will increase tremendously resulting in the circulation of information in the community. These pieces of information can be infodemic monikers misleading the community. Thus exploring the trends of public interest in searching COVID 19 related issues and checking information circulating in the public is highly crucial. Objective: This study aimed to explore users' concerns towards coronavirus related online web search and to investigate the extent of infodemic monikers (misinformation) adopted for identifying the virus in the early stage of COVID 19 spread in Ethiopia. Methods: Google Trends was employed in exploring the tendency towards coronavirus related web search activities in Ethiopia from March 13 to May 8, 2020. Keywords of the different names of COVID 19 and health related issues were used to investigate the trends of public interest in searching from Google over time. Relative search volume (RSV), Average peak comparison (APC), and associated graphs were used to compare the trends of online search interests. Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated to check for the presence of correlation. Result: During the study period, the top names users adopted to identify the virus in Ethiopia were corona, virus, coronavirus, corona virus, China coronavirus, and COVID 19. In almost all search activities, the users employed infodemic monikers to identify the virus (overall relative search percentage of 99%). Updates related issues (APC=60, 95% CI, 55, 66) were the most commonly trending health related searches on Google followed by mortality (APC=27, 95% CI, 24, 30) and symptoms (APC=55, 95% CI, 50, 60) related issues. The regional comparison showed the highest cumulative peak for the Oromia region (cumulative total RSVs, 536) followed by the Tigray region (cumulative total RSVs, 512) on querying health related information from Google. No significant correlation was detected between COVID 19 cases per region\/city and the maximum peaks of health related searches. Conclusion: This study revealed an initial increase in the public interest of COVID 19 related Google search, but this interest was declined over time. Tremendous circulation of infodemic monikers for the identification of the virus was also noticed in the country. The authors recommend for the government and other stakeholders to work immensely to keep the people alert on coronavirus-related issues and to promote the official names of the virus, like COVID 19, SARS CoV 2 in the public to decrease the circulation of misleading and misinformation amid the outbreak.

However they are not typically viewed as essential as China policymakers focus on economic growth. Only 38% of the heads of the public health departments of Chinese cities have a medical background. We find that cities with medical professionals as the head of public health departments had lower infection rates and death rates from COVID-19.

Extensive global uptake of this resource has resulted in a large, standardised collection of comprehensive clinical data from hundreds of sites across dozens of countries. Data are analysed regularly and reported publicly to inform patient care and public health response. This report is a part of a series and includes the results of data analysis on 13 July 2020. We thank all of the data contributors for their ongoing support. Report highlights include: ISARIC collaborators recorded symptoms from nearly 60,000 patients in hospital with COCID-19. Most had fever, cough or shortness of breath. Children and older adults were less likely to display typical symptoms, and over 40% of patients >80 years experienced confusion. The ISARIC international database continues to grow. Data have been entered for 85,973 individuals from 545 sites across 42 countries. For the 60,430 cases who meet eligibility criteria for this report: o The median age is 73 years. o A total of 16% of patients were admitted at some point during their illness into an intensive care unit. o Antibiotic use is high (83.1% of patients received antibiotics - the choice of antibiotic and specific indication have not yet been determined.) o Fever, shortness of breath, a non-productive cough and fatigue were the most common symptoms. o Altered consciousness\/confusion was also relatively frequent (14,284\/60,430) and most common in elderly patients. Overall, elderly patients are less likely to present with URTI symptoms.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mark Pritchard","author_inst":"ISARIC, Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK; Oxford University Hospitals NHS Found"},{"author_name":"Emmanuelle Dankwa","author_inst":"Department of Statistics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hall","author_inst":"Big Data Institute, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"J Kenneth Baillie","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Royal Infirmary Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK; Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Gail Carson","author_inst":"ISARIC, Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Annemarie B Docherty","author_inst":"Intensive Care Unit, Royal Infirmary Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK; Centre for Medical Informatics, Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"},{"author_name":"Christl Donnelly","author_inst":"Department of Statistics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK; MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Im"},{"author_name":"Jake Dunning","author_inst":"ISARIC, Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health, NDM, University of Oxford; National Heart and Lung Institute, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College Lond"},{"author_name":"Christophe Fraser","author_inst":"Oxford Big Data Institute, Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Information and Discovery, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"},{"author_name":"Hayley Hardwick","author_inst":"National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Health Protection Research Unit in Emerging and Zoonotic Infections, Liverpool, UK; Institute of Infection and Glob"},{"author_name":"Ewen M Harrison","author_inst":"Centre for Medical Informatics, Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"},{"author_name":"Karl Holden","author_inst":"Institute of Translational Medicine, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK"},{"author_name":"Christiana Kartsonaki","author_inst":"MRC Population Health Research Unit, Clinical Trial Service Unit and Epidemiological Studies Unit (CTSU).

Data from different testing sites indicates different rates of positivity. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) allows for semi-quantitative estimates of viral load as time to crossing threshold (Ct) is inversely related to viral load. Objectives The objective of our study was to evaluate SARS-CoV2 RNA loads between paired nasopharyngeal (NP) and deep lung (endotracheal aspirate or BAL) samples from critically ill patients. Methods SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results were retrospectively reviewed for 51 critically ill patients from 5 intensive care units in 3 hospitals ; Addenbrookes Hospital Cambridge (3 units), Royal Papworth Cambridge (1 unit), and Royal Sunderland Hospital (1 unit). At the times when paired NP and deep lung samples were obtained, one patient had been on oxygen only, 6 patients on non-invasive ventilation, 18 patients on ECMO, and 26 patients mechanically ventilated. Results Results collected showed significant gradient between NP and deep lung viral loads. Median Ct value was 29 for NP samples and 24 for deep lung samples. Of 51 paired samples, 16 were negative (below limit of detection) on NP swabs but positive (above limit of detection) on deep lung sample, whilst 2 were negative on deep sample but positive on NP (both patients were on ECMO). Conclusions It has been suggested that whilst SARS-CoV1 tends to replicate in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV2 replicates more vigorously in the upper respiratory tract. These data challenge that assumption. These data suggest that viral migration to, and proliferation in, the lower respiratory tract may be a key factor in the progression to critical illness and the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Factors which promote this migration should be examined for association with severe COVID-19. From a practical point of view, patients with suspected severe COVID-19 should have virological samples obtained from the lower respiratory tract where-ever possible, as upper respiratory samples have a significant negative rate.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Islam Hamed","author_inst":"John Farman Intensive Care Unit, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Nesreen Shaban","author_inst":"John Farman Intensive Care Unit, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Marwan Nassar","author_inst":"John Farman Intensive Care Unit, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Sam Love","author_inst":"John Farman Intensive Care Unit, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Martin D Curran","author_inst":"Clinical Microbiology and Public Health Laboratory, Public Health England, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Stephen Webb","author_inst":"Royal Papworth Hospital, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Huina Yang","author_inst":"Royal Papworth Hospital, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Anthony Rostron","author_inst":"Sunderland Royal Hospital, South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust, UK"},{"author_name":"Katherine Watson","author_inst":"Sunderland Royal Hospital, South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust, UK"},{"author_name":"Vilas Navapurkar","author_inst":"John Farman Intensive Care Unit, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Razeenn Mahroof","author_inst":"John Farman Intensive Care Unit, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Andrew Conway Morris","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Christiana Kartsonaki","author_inst":"MRC Population Health Research Unit, Clinical Trial Service Unit and Epidemiological Studies Unit (CTSU).

Methods: We report the case of a high transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 linked to an indoor choir rehearsal in France in March 2020 at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: A total of 27 participants, including 25 male singers, a conductor and an accompanist attended a choir practice on March 12, 2020. The practice was indoor and took place in a non-ventilated space of 45 m2. No choir member reported having been symptomatic for COVID-19 between March 2 and March 12.The mean age of the participants was 66.9 (range 35-86) years. 70% of the participants (19 of 27) were diagnosed with COVID-19 from 1 to 12 days after the rehearsal with a median of 5.1 days. 36% of the cases needed a hospitalization (7\/19), and 21% (4\/19) were admitted to an ICU. The index cases were possibly multiple. Discussion: The choir practice was planned in March 2020 at a period when the number of new cases of COVID-19 began to grow exponentially in France because SARS-CoV-2 was actively circulating. The secondary attack rate (70%) was much higher than it is described within households (10-20%) and among close contacts made outside households (0-5%). Singing might have contributed to enhance SARS-CoV-2 person-to-person transmission through emission of droplets and aerosolization in a closed non ventilated space with a relative high number of people including multiple pre-symptomatic suspected index cases. Conclusion: Indoor choir practice should be suspended during SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. Further studies are necessary to test the spread of the virus by the act of singing. As the benefits of the barrier measures and social distancing are known to be effective in terms of a reduction in the incidence of the COVID-19, experts recommendations concerning the resuming of choir practice are necessary.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nathalie CHARLOTTE","author_inst":"SSR Val Rosay"},{"author_name":"Nesreen Shaban","author_inst":"John Farman Intensive Care Unit, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Marwan Nassar","author_inst":"John Farman Intensive Care Unit, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Sam Love","author_inst":"John Farman Intensive Care Unit, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Martin D Curran","author_inst":"Clinical Microbiology and Public Health Laboratory, Public Health England, Cambridge, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Stephen Webb","author_inst":"Royal Papworth Hospital, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Huina Yang","author_inst":"Royal Papworth Hospital, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Anthony Rostron","author_inst":"Sunderland Royal Hospital, South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust, UK"},{"author_name":"Katherine Watson","author_inst":"Sunderland Royal Hospital, South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust, UK"},{"author_name":"Vilas Navapurkar","author_inst":"John Farman Intensive Care Unit, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Razeenn Mahroof","author_inst":"John Farman Intensive Care Unit, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Andrew Conway Morris","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Christiana Kartsonaki","author_inst":"MRC Population Health Research Unit, Clinical Trial Service Unit and Epidemiological Studies Unit (CTSU).

The model thereby enables a dynamic inspection of the pandemic and allows estimating key figures, like the number of overall detected and undetected COVID-19 cases and the infection fatality rate. As proof of concept, the novel SIVRT model was used to simulate the first phase of the pandemic in Luxembourg. An overall number of infections of 13.000 and an infection fatality rate of 1,3% was estimated, which is in concordance with data from population-wide testing. Furthermore based on the data as of end of May 2020 and assuming a partial deconfinement, an increase of cases is predicted from mid of July 2020 on.

This virus can cause a disease that ranges in spectrum from asymptomatic to severe respiratory disease with multiorgan failure, and the most severe cases are associated with some comorbidities and patient age. However, there are patients who do not have those risk factors who still develop serious disease. In this study, we identified the presence of other respiratory viruses in positive cases of COVID-19 in Mexico to determine if any coinfections were correlated with more severe manifestations of COVID-19. We analysed 103 confirmed cases of COVID-19 using RT-qPCR for the detection of 16 other respiratory viruses.Of the cases analysed, 14 (13.6%) were cases of coinfection, and 92% of them never required hospitalization, even when comorbidities and advanced age were involved. There were not significant differences between the presence of comorbidities and the mean ages of the groups. These results suggest that coinfection is not related to more severe COVID-19 and that, depending on the virus involved, it could even lead to a better prognosis. We believe that our findings may lay the groundwork for new studies aimed at determining the biological mechanism by which this phenomenon occurs and for proposing corresponding strategies to limit the progression to severe cases of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Larissa Fernandes-Matano","author_inst":"Divisi\u00f3n de Laboratorios de Vigilancia e Investigaci\u00f3n Epidemiol\u00f3gica.

We developed an agent-based model to precise the impact of digital contact tracing and household isolation on COVID-19 transmission. The model, calibrated on French population, integrates demographic, contact-survey and epidemiological information to describe the risk factors for exposure and transmission of COVID-19. We explored realistic levels of case detection, app adoption, population immunity and transmissibility. Assuming a reproductive ratio R=2.6 and 50% detection of clinical cases, a ~20% app adoption reduces peak incidence of ~36%. With R=1.7, >30% app adoption lowers the epidemic to manageable levels. Higher coverage among adults, playing a central role in COVID-19 transmission, yields an indirect benefit for elderly. These results may inform the inclusion of digital contact tracing within a COVID-19 response plan.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jes\u00fas A.

Outdoor temperature is an important factor behind the current surge in US Covid-19 cases. Correlation of northern state infection data and outdoor temperatures is used to identify the change in disease transmission efficiency as northern states passed through the lower temperature bound (50F) in spring, and more recently transitioned to temperatures above the higher bound (70F). At current disease transmission efficiency levels, social distancing must be increased above a UMD Social Distance Index (SDI) level of 36 to stop the accelerated increase of daily infection cases. At current disease transmission efficiency (G=0.19) and SDI of 33, the US will approach 150,000 infections per day in September before declining as average US temperature falls below 70F. A primary reason for enhanced disease transmission below 50F and above 70F is attributed to inadequate indoor ventilation. Swing season occurs when outdoor temperatures are between 50F and 70F, and is the time of year when homes and buildings are opened to the outdoors. Increased fresh air ventilation (greater than 40cfm per person), improved air filtration (MERV11 and greater filters), and UVGI (Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation, 0.02WUV per cfm airflow) coupled with wearing face masks, 6ft distancing and surface sanitation are estimated to reduce indoor disease transmission probability to a third of the transmission probability resulting from standard building ventilation practice.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ty Newell","author_inst":"University of Illinois"},{"author_name":"Beatriz Arregui-Garc\u013aa","author_inst":"INSERM, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9"},{"author_name":"Piotr Bentkowski","author_inst":"INSERM, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9"},{"author_name":"Livio Bioglio","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science, University of Turin"},{"author_name":"Francesco Pinotti","author_inst":"INSERM, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9"},{"author_name":"Pierre-Yves Bo\u00eblle","author_inst":"INSERM, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9"},{"author_name":"Alain Barrat","author_inst":"Aix Marseille Univ, Universite de Toulon, CNRS, CPT, Turing Center for Living Systems"},{"author_name":"Vittoria Colizza","author_inst":"INSERM, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9"},{"author_name":"Chiara Poletto","author_inst":"INSERM, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9"},{"author_name":"Terrance J.Y.

Serological surveys have been conducted to establish prevalence for covid-19 antibody in various cohorts and communities. However, the prevalence among healthcare workers is still being analyzed. The present study reports on initial sero-surveillance conducted on healthcare workers at a regional hospital system in Orange County, California, during May and June, 2020. Study participants were recruited from the entire hospital employee workforce and the independent medical staff. Data were collected for job title, location, covid-19 symptoms, a PCR test history, travel record since January 2020, and existence of household contacts with covid-19. A blood sample was collected from each subject for serum analysis for IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Of 3,013 tested individuals, a total 2,932 were included in the analysis due to some missing data. Observed prevalence of 1.06% (31 antibody positive cases), adjusted prevalence of 1.13% for test sensitivity and specificity were identified. Significant group differences between positive vs. negative were observed for age (z = 2.65, p = .008), race (p = .037), presence of fever (p < .001) and loss of smell (p < .001). Possible explanation for this low prevalence includes a relatively low local geographic community prevalence (~4.4%) at the time of testing, the hospital's timely procurement of personal protective equipment, rigorous employee education, patient triage and treatment protocol development and implementation. In addition, possible greater presence of cross-reactive adaptive T cell mediated immunity in healthcare workers vs. the general population may have contributed. Determining antibody prevalence in front-line workers, and duration of antibody presence may help stratify the workforce for risk, establish better health place policies and procedures, and potentially better mitigate transmission.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael Brant-Zawadzki","author_inst":"Hoag Center for Research and Education, Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian"},{"author_name":"Deborah Fridman","author_inst":"Hoag Center for Research and Education, Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian"},{"author_name":"Philip Robinson","author_inst":"Infection Prevention, Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian"},{"author_name":"Matthew Zahn","author_inst":"Orange County Health Care Agency"},{"author_name":"Randy German","author_inst":"Laboratory Administrative Services, Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian"},{"author_name":"Marcus Breit","author_inst":"Hoag Family Cancer Institute, Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian"},{"author_name":"Junko Hara","author_inst":"Hoag Center for Research and Education, Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian"},{"author_name":"Vittoria Colizza","author_inst":"INSERM, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9"},{"author_name":"Chiara Poletto","author_inst":"INSERM, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9"},{"author_name":"Terrance J.Y.

Objective: To develop and test the feasibility of a family medicine-led remote monitoring model of care (COVIDCare@Home program) to manage patients with COVID-19 in the community. Methods: This multi-faceted, family medicine-led, interprofessional team-based remote monitoring program was developed at Womens College Hospital in Toronto, Ontario. A cross-sectional chart review of the first cohort of patients was conducted and learnings from the implementation of CovidCare@Home are described. Results: During the study period, April 8 to May 11, 2020, there were 97 patients (average age 48.6, 62% female) with 424 recorded virtual visits with a median virtual length of stay of 8 days (IQR 5). 5.2% required escalation to an in-person visit with no patients requiring hospitalization. 16% of patients required support with mental and social health needs. Interpretations: A family medicine-led, team-based remote monitoring program can safely be used to manage outpatients diagnosed with COVID-19. Attention to mental and social health needs is critical for this population. Future efforts should consider how to design programs to best support populations disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, something which primary care is well-positioned to do. Further analysis will describe the effectiveness, impact, and satisfaction with the program among patients and providers.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Payal Agarwal","author_inst":"Womens College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Geetha Mukerji","author_inst":"Womens College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Celia Laur","author_inst":"Womens College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shivani Chandra","author_inst":"Womens College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nick Pimlott","author_inst":"Womens College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ruth Heisey","author_inst":"Womens College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Stovel","author_inst":"Womens College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Elaine Goulbourne","author_inst":"Womens College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sacha Bhatia","author_inst":"Womens College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Onil Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"Womens College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Danielle Martin","author_inst":"Womens College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sonika Humar","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Ilona Bahinskaya","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Natalia Pinzon","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Jianhua Zhang","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Lawrence E Heisler","author_inst":"Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Paul M Krzyzanowski","author_inst":"Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Bernard Lam","author_inst":"Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Ilinca M Lungu","author_inst":"Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Dorin Manase","author_inst":"University Health Network Digital Department, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Krista M Pace","author_inst":"University Health Network Digital Department, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Pouria Mashouri","author_inst":"University Health Network Digital Department,Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Michael Brudno","author_inst":"University Health Network Digital Department, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Michael Garrels","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Tony Mazzulli","author_inst":"Sinai Health System, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Myron Cybulsky","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Atul Humar","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.22.20158311","rel_title":"Hospital Trainees Worries, Perceived Sufficiency of Information and Reported Psychological Health During The COVID-19 Pandemic","rel_date":"2020-07-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.22.20158311","rel_abs":"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has been unsurpassed in clinical severity or infectivity since the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic and continues to impact the world. During the A\/H1N1 influenza pandemic, healthcare workers presented frequent concerns regarding their ownand their families health, as well as high levels of psychological distress. Objectives: To assess hospital trainees concerns, perceived sufficiency of information, behaviour and reported psychological health during the COVID-19 pandemic in the NHS Design: Cross-sectional 39-point questionnaire study conducted in May 2020 Setting: A large NHS foundation trust in London Participants: 204 hospital trainee doctors Outcome measures: Quantitative analysis of trainees worries and concerns while working during the COVID-19 pandemic were assessed across 8 domains: trainee demographics; concerns and worries regarding COVID-19; perceived sufficiency of information about the COVID-19 pandemic; social distancing; use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and training in PPE; COVID-19 acquisition and risk; reported psychological health; and medical education. Results: 91.7% looked after COVID-19 patients. 91.6% were worried about COVID-19; the most frequent concern was that of family and friends dying from COVID-19 (74.6%). 22.2% reported being infected with COVID-19. 6.8% of trainees were so concerned about COVID-19 infection that they would avoid going to work. Perceived sufficiency of information about COVID-19 was moderately high. 25.9% reported that they were able to socially distance at work compared to 94.4% able to socially distance outside work. 98.2% reported using PPE and 24.7% were confident the provided PPE protected them against infection with COVID-19. 41.9% reported that their psychological health had been affected by their work with the commonest being anxiety (56.6%), emotional distress (50.9%) and burnout (37.7%). 95.6% felt it is important to have a service that provides psychological support during this pandemic and 62.5% reported they would consider using this at work. Conclusions: A significant proportion of hospital trainees are worried about the COVID-19 pandemic with high levels of reported psychological distress. Given that almost a third would not use psychological support services at work, hospital leaders and liaison psychiatry need to explore the reasons for not wanting to use services at work and highlight the provision of psychological services provided outside work such that provided by the London deaneries professional support unit (PSU). Seeking solutions to support trainee wellbeing in addition to this, such as larger offices, adequate rest facilities and alternative methods of teaching, with their input would enable empowerment of trainees and improve their health and morale while working in a pandemic.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nikoo Aziminia","author_inst":"Barnet Hospital, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Aria Khani","author_inst":"Barnet Hospital, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Colette Smith","author_inst":"Institute for Global Health, University College London, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Ameet Bakhai","author_inst":"Barnet Hospital, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Clifford Lisk","author_inst":"Barnet Hospital, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Ruth Heisey","author_inst":"Womens College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Stovel","author_inst":"Womens College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Elaine Goulbourne","author_inst":"Womens College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sacha Bhatia","author_inst":"Womens College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Onil Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"Womens College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Danielle Martin","author_inst":"Womens College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sonika Humar","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Ilona Bahinskaya","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Natalia Pinzon","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Jianhua Zhang","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Lawrence E Heisler","author_inst":"Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Paul M Krzyzanowski","author_inst":"Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Bernard Lam","author_inst":"Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Ilinca M Lungu","author_inst":"Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Dorin Manase","author_inst":"University Health Network Digital Department, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Krista M Pace","author_inst":"University Health Network Digital Department, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Pouria Mashouri","author_inst":"University Health Network Digital Department,Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Michael Brudno","author_inst":"University Health Network Digital Department, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Michael Garrels","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Tony Mazzulli","author_inst":"Sinai Health System, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Myron Cybulsky","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"},{"author_name":"Atul Humar","author_inst":"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health systems and quality improvement"}]}
