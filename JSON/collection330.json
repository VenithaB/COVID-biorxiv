Methods: A stochastic version of the SEIR model CovidSIM v1.1, designed specifically for COVID-19 was utilised. It was populated with parameters for SARS-CoV-2 transmission, shipping characteristics, and plausible control measures. Results: When no control interventions were in place, an outbreak of COVID-19 in our case study destination country (New Zealand; NZ) was estimated to occur after a median time of 23 days (assuming a global average for source country incidence of 2.66 new infections per 1000 population per week, a crew of 20, a voyage length of 10 days, 1 day of shore leave both in NZ and abroad, and 108 port visits by international merchant ships per week). For this example the uncertainty around when outbreaks occur is wide (an outbreak occurs with 95% probability between 1 and 124 days). The combined use of a PCR test on arrival, self-reporting of symptoms with contact tracing, and mask use during shore leave, increased this median time to 1.0 year (14 days to 5.4 years). Scenario analyses found that onboard infection chains could persist for well over 4 weeks even with crews of only 5 members. Conclusion: Introduction of SARS-CoV-2 through shore leave from international shipping crews is likely, even after long voyages. The risk can be substantially mitigated by control measures such as PCR testing and mask use.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nick Wilson","author_inst":"University of Otago, Wellington"},{"author_name":"Tony Blakely","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Michael Baker","author_inst":"University of Otago, Wellington"},{"author_name":"Martin Eichner","author_inst":"Epimos"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.10.20179135","rel_title":"The influence of pH on SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity","rel_date":"2020-09-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.10.20179135","rel_abs":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can infect a broad range of human tissues by using the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Individuals with comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19 display higher levels of ACE2 in the lungs compared to those without comorbidities, and conditions such as cell stress, elevated glucose levels and hypoxia may also increase the expression of ACE2. Here we showed that patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE) have a higher expression of ACE2 in BE tissues compared to normal squamous esophagus, and that the lower pH associated with BE may drive this increase in expression. Human primary monocytes cultured in reduced pH displayed increased ACE2 expression and viral load upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also showed in two independent cohorts of COVID-19 patients that previous use of proton pump inhibitors is associated with 2- to 3-fold higher risk of death compared to those not using the drugs.

We hypothesised that people with asthma are likely to be more vulnerable to worse mental health during lockdown. Methods We examined COVID-19 surveys (completed April\/May 2020), nested within two generations of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC): index-generation ALSPAC-G1 (n= 2942, mean age=28) and the parents generation ALSPAC-G0 (n=3737, mean age=59). We used Poisson and logistic regression models to estimate the effect of asthma on wellbeing, anxiety and depression, and factors related to COVID-19 and lockdown. Models were adjusted for validated pre-pandemic measures of mental health and socio-economic factors. Results Asthma was associated with a 13% increase in depression score in ALSPAC-G1 (p=0.005) and 15% increase in ALSPAC-G0 (p=0.05) compared to participants without asthma, anxiety scores increased by 14% in ALSPAC-G1 (p=0.005) and by 16% in ALSPAC-G0 (p=0.02). Asthma was associated with a similar increase of anxiety and depression scores during COVID-19 in both generations (Z test p values >0.80). Discussion People with asthma have worse mental health & wellbeing during lockdown compared to people without asthma. Although the effect of asthma on mental health is of similar magnitude between the generations, younger participants with asthma declined to lower levels of mental health despite reporting less symptoms, COVID-19 infection and self-isolation. This has important implications given repeated lockdowns. Young people with asthma should be closely monitored and supported to mitigate the impact of lockdown on their mental health.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel H Higbee","author_inst":"University of Bristol.

Using a within-subjects design with objective measurement (via validated accelerometers), we assessed rheumatoid arthritis patients' physical activity and sedentary behavior levels prior to and during the social distancing measures implemented in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Methods: Post-menopausal women diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis were assessed before (from March 2018 to March 2020) and during (from 24th May to 7th July 2020) social distancing measures to contain COVID-19 pandemic, using a within-subjects, repeated-measure design. Physical activity and sedentary behavior were assessed using postural-based accelerometry (ActivPAL micro). Findings: Mean age was 60.9 years (95%CI: 58.0, 63.7) and BMI was 29.5 Kg\/m2 (95%CI: 27.2, 31.9). Disease activity ranged from remission to moderate activity. Most of the patients were using disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs and prednisone. Hypertension and dyslipidemia were the most frequent comorbidities During social distancing, there were reductions in total stepping time (15.7% [-0.3 h\/day, 95%CI: -0.4, -0.1; p=0.004]), in light-intensity activity (13.0% [-0.2 h\/day, 95%CI: -0.4, -0.04; p=0.016]) and in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (38.8% [-4.5 min\/day, 95%CI: -8.1, -0.9; p=0.015]), but no changes in total standing time or total sedentary time. However, time spent in prolonged bouts of sitting <30 min increased by 34% (1.0 h\/day, 95%CI: 0.3, 1.7; p=0.006) and sitting bouts <60 min increased by 85% (1.0 h\/day, 95%CI: 0.5, 1.6) Sit-stand transitions were reduced by 10% (-5.1\/day, 95%CI: -10.3, 0.0; p=0.051). Conclusion: Imposed social distancing measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak were associated with decreased physical activity and increased prolonged sitting among rheumatoid arthritis patients. Since this has the potential to increase the burden of cardiovascular disease in such high-risk patients, attention to maintaining physical activity is an urgent consideration during the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ana Jessica Pinto","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Diego Rezende","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Sofia Mendes Sieczkowska","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Kamila Meireles","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Karina Bonfiglioli","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Ana C M Ribeiro","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Eloisa Bonfa","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Neville Owen","author_inst":"Baker Heart & Diabetes Institute"},{"author_name":"David W Dunstan","author_inst":"Baker Heart & Diabetes Institute"},{"author_name":"Hamilton Roschel","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Bruno Gualano","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Flora A Gandolfi","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Sao Jose do Rio Preto"},{"author_name":"Stefanie P Murano","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Jose L Proenca-Modena","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Fernando A Val","author_inst":"Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Dr Heitor Vieira Dourado"},{"author_name":"Gisely C Melo","author_inst":"Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Dr Heitor Vieira Dourado"},{"author_name":"Wuelton M Monteiro","author_inst":"Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Dr Heitor Vieira Dourado"},{"author_name":"Mauricio L Nogueira","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Sao Jose do Rio Preto"},{"author_name":"Marcus VG Lacerda","author_inst":"Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Dr Heitor Vieira Dourado"},{"author_name":"Pedro M Moraes-Vieira","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Helder I Nakaya","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"rheumatology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.11.20191734","rel_title":"The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on emergency and elective hip surgeries in Norway","rel_date":"2020-09-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.11.20191734","rel_abs":"Objective: To assess the effects of Covid-19 pandemic lockdown restrictions on the number of emergency and elective hip joint surgeries, and explore whether these procedures are more\/less affected by lockdown restrictions than other hospital care. Methods: In 1.344.355 persons aged [&ge;]35 years in the Norwegian emergency preparedness (BEREDT C19) register, we studied the daily number of persons having 1) emergency surgeries due to hip fractures, and 2) electively planned surgeries due to hip osteoarthritis before and after Covid-19 lockdown restrictions were implemented nationally on March 13th 2020, for different age and sex groups. Incidence Rate Ratios [IRR] reflect the after-lockdown number of surgeries divided by the before-lockdown number of surgeries. Results: After-lockdown elective hip surgeries were one third the number of before-lockdown (IRR ~0.3), which is a greater drop than the drop seen in all-cause elective hospital care (IRR ~0.6) (no age\/sex differences). Men aged 35-69 had half the number of emergency hip fracture surgeries (IRR ~0.6), whereas women aged [&ge;]70 had the same number of emergency hip fracture surgeries after lockdown (IRR ~1).

To highlight the critical importance of unofficially reported newspaper-based deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) like illness (CLI) together with officially confirmed death counts to support improvements in COVID 19 death surveillance. Methods. Both hospital-based official COVID 19 and unofficial CLI death counts were collected from daily newspapers between March 8 and August 22, 2020. We performed both exploratory and time-series analyses to understand the influence of combining newspaper-based CLI death counts with confirmed hospital death counts on the trends and forecasting of COVID-19 death counts. An autoregressive integrated moving average based approach was used to forecast the number of weekly death counts for six weeks ahead. Results. Between March 8 and August 22, 2020, 2,156 CLI deaths were recorded based on newspaper reporting for a count that was 55% of the officially confirmed death count (n = 3,907). This shows that newspaper reports tend to cover a significant number of COVID-19 related deaths. Our forecast also indicates an approximate total of 406 CLI expected for the six weeks ahead, which could contribute to a total of 2,413 deaths including 2,007 confirmed deaths expected from August 23 to October 3, 2020. Conclusions. Analyzing existing trends in and forecasting the expected number of newspaper based CLI deaths indicates yet-unreported COVID-19 death counts, which could be a critical source to estimate provisional COVID 19 death counts and mortality surveillance. Public Health Implications. Considering unofficial newspaper-based CLI death counts is essential to identify COVID-19 death severity and surveillance needs to advance public health research efforts to prepare appropriate response strategies for low- and middle-income countries.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mazbahul G Ahamad","author_inst":"University of Nebraska-Lincoln"},{"author_name":"Monir U Ahmed","author_inst":"Shahjalal University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Byomkesh Talukder","author_inst":"York University"},{"author_name":"Fahian Tanin","author_inst":"Independent Researcher"},{"author_name":"Karina Bonfiglioli","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Ana C M Ribeiro","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Eloisa Bonfa","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Neville Owen","author_inst":"Baker Heart & Diabetes Institute"},{"author_name":"David W Dunstan","author_inst":"Baker Heart & Diabetes Institute"},{"author_name":"Hamilton Roschel","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Bruno Gualano","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Flora A Gandolfi","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Sao Jose do Rio Preto"},{"author_name":"Stefanie P Murano","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Jose L Proenca-Modena","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Fernando A Val","author_inst":"Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Dr Heitor Vieira Dourado"},{"author_name":"Gisely C Melo","author_inst":"Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Dr Heitor Vieira Dourado"},{"author_name":"Wuelton M Monteiro","author_inst":"Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Dr Heitor Vieira Dourado"},{"author_name":"Mauricio L Nogueira","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Sao Jose do Rio Preto"},{"author_name":"Marcus VG Lacerda","author_inst":"Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Dr Heitor Vieira Dourado"},{"author_name":"Pedro M Moraes-Vieira","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Helder I Nakaya","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.11.20192880","rel_title":"Gender disparities in access to care for time-sensitive conditions during COVID-19 pandemic in Chile","rel_date":"2020-09-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.11.20192880","rel_abs":"Introduction: During the COVID-19 pandemic reduction on the utilisation of healthcare services are reported in different contexts. Nevertheless, studies have not explored specifically gender disparities on access to healthcare. Aim: To evaluate disparities in access to care in Chile during the COVID-19 pandemic from a gender-based perspective. Methods: We conducted a quasi-experimental design using a difference-in-difference approach. We compared the number of weekly confirmed cases of a set of oncologic and cardiovascular time-sensitive conditions at a national level. We defined weeks 12 to 26 as an intervention period and the actual year as a treatment group. We selected this period because preventive interventions, such as school closures or teleworking, were implemented at this point. To test heterogeneity by sex, we included an interaction term between difference-in-difference estimator and sex. Results: A sizable reduction in access to care for patients with time-sensitivity conditions was observed for oncologic (IRR 0.56; 95% CI 0.50-0.63) and cardiovascular diseases (IRR 0.64; 95% CI 0.62-0.66). Greater reduction occurred in women compared to men across diseases groups, particularly marked on myocardial infarction (0.89; 95% CI 0.85-0.93), stroke (IRR 0.88 IC95% 0.82-0.93), and colorectal cancer (IRR 0.79; 95% CI 0.69-0.91). Compared to men, a greater absolute reduction in women for oncologic diseases (782; 95% CI 704-859) than cardiovascular diseases (172; 95% CI 170-174) occurred over 14 weeks. Conclusion: We confirmed a large drop in new diagnosis for time-sensitive conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile. This reduction was greater for women. Our findings should alert policy-makers about the urgent need to integrate a gender perspective into the pandemic response and its aftermath.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jorge Pacheco","author_inst":"Universidad de Concepcion"},{"author_name":"Francisca Crispi","author_inst":"Universidad de Chile.

To interrogate this, we examined the respiratory secretions collected from eight intubated patients with COVID-19, six control patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), a different respiratory disease also associated with thick adherent secretions, and eight healthy controls. In this sample set we found that hyaluronan content is increased approximately 20-fold in both CF and COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. The hyaluronan in COVID-19 samples was comprised of low-molecular weight fragments, the hyaluronan form most strongly linked with pro-inflammatory functions. Hyaluronan is similarly abundant in histologic sections from cadaveric lung tissue from COVID-19 patients. These findings implicate hyaluronan in the thick respiratory secretions characteristic of COVID-19 infection. Therapeutic strategies targeting hyaluronan should be investigated further for potential use in patients with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gernot Kaber","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Michael J.

Since the start of July, cases have increased, while deaths have continued to decrease. Methods We report results from 594,000 swabs tested for SARS-CoV-2 virus obtained from a representative sample of people in England over four rounds collected regardless of symptoms, starting in May 2020 and finishing at the beginning of September 2020. Swabs for the most recent two rounds were taken between 24th July and 11th August and for round 4 between 22nd August and 7th September. We estimate weighted overall prevalence, doubling times between and within rounds and associated reproduction numbers. We obtained unweighted prevalence estimates by sub-groups: age, sex, region, ethnicity, key worker status, household size, for which we also estimated odds of infection. We identified clusters of swab-positive participants who were closer, on average, to other swab-positive participants than would be expected. Findings Over all four rounds of the study, we found that 72% (67%, 76%) of swab-positive individuals were asymptomatic at the time of swab and in the week prior. The epidemic declined between rounds 1 and 2, and rounds 2 and 3. However, the epidemic was increasing between rounds 3 and 4, with a doubling time of 17 (13, 23) days corresponding to an R value of 1.3 (1.2, 1.4). When analysing round 3 alone, we found that the epidemic had started to grow again with 93% probability. Using only the most recent round 4 data, we estimated a doubling time of 7.7 (5.5, 12.7) days, corresponding to an R value of 1.7 (1.4, 2.0). Cycle threshold values were lower (viral loads were higher) for rounds 1 and 4 than they were for rounds 2 and 3. In round 4, we observed the highest prevalence in participants aged 18 to 24 years at 0.25% (0.16%, 0.41%), increasing from 0.08% (0.04%, 0.18%) in round 3. We observed the lowest prevalence in those aged 65 and older at 0.04% (0.02%, 0.06%) which was stable compared with round 3. Participants of Asian ethnicity had elevated odds of infection. We identified clusters in and around London, transient clusters in the Midlands, and an expanding area of clustering in the North West and more recently in Yorkshire and the Humber. Interpretation Although low levels of transmission persisted in England through to mid-summer 2020, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is now increasing. We found evidence of accelerating transmission at the end of August and beginning of September. Representative community antigen sampling can increase situational awareness and help improve public health decision making even at low prevalence.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Steven Riley","author_inst":"Dept Inf Dis Epi, Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Kylie E.

We aimed to investigate the burden of superinfections in COVID-19 patients. Methods In this prospective single centre cohort study in an intensive care setting patients aged [&ge;] 18 years with COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome were assessed for concomitant microbial infections by longitudinal analysis of tracheobronchial secretions, bronchoalveolar lavages and blood. Our primary outcome was ventilator-free survival on day 28 in patients with and without clinically relevant superinfection. Further outcomes included the association of superinfection with ICU length of stay, incidence of bacteremia, viral reactivations, and fungal colonization. Results In 45 critically ill COVID-19 patients, we identified 19 patients with superinfections (42.2%) by longitudinal analysis of 433 TBS, 35 BAL and 455 blood samples, respectively. On average, superinfections were detected on day 10 after ICU admission. The most frequently isolated clinically relevant bacteria were Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ventilator-free survival was substantially lower in patients with superinfection (subhazard ratio 0.37, 95%-CI 0.15-0.90, p=0.028). Patients with pulmonary superinfections more often had bacteraemia, virus reactivations, yeast colonization, and needed ICU treatment for a significantly longer time. Conclusions The detection of superinfections was frequent and associated with reduced ventilator-free survival. Despite empirical antibiotic therapy, superinfections lead to an extended ICU stay in COVID 19 patients. Longitudinal microbiological sampling in COVID-19 patients could allow targeted antimicrobial therapy, and therefore minimize the use of broad-spectrum and reserve antibiotics.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Philipp K Buehler","author_inst":"Institute for Intensive Care Medicine, University Hospital Zurich and University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Annelies S Zinkernagel","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Daniel Andrea Hofmaenner","author_inst":"Institute for Intensive Care Medicine, University Hospital Zurich and University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Pedro David Wendel Garcia","author_inst":"Institute for Intensive Care Medicine, University Hospital Zurich and University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Claudio T Acevedo","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Alejandro Gomez-Mejia","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Srikanth Mairpady Shambat","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Federica Andreoni","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Maibach Maibach","author_inst":"University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Jan Bartussek","author_inst":"University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Matthias Hilty","author_inst":"Institute for Intensive Care Medicine, University Hospital Zurich and University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Pascal M Frey","author_inst":"Department of General Internal Medicine, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Reto A Schuepbach","author_inst":"Institute for Intensive Care Medicine, University Hospital Zurich and University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Silvio Daniel Brugger","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Paul Elliott","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Carlos E.

Methods: In this prospective cohort study, we followed 3,086 COVID-19 patients hospitalized on or before April 13, 2020 within an academic health system in New York (The Mount Sinai Health System) until June 2, 2020. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate demographic, clinical, and laboratory factors as independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. The analysis was stratified by self-reported race and ethnicity. Findings: A total of 3,086 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized, of whom 680 were excluded (78 due to missing race or ethnicity data, 144 were Asian, and 458 were of other unspecified race\/ethnicity). Of the 2,406 patients included, 892 (37.1%) were Hispanic, 825 (34.3%) were black, and 689 (28.6%) were white. Black and Hispanic patients were younger than White patients (median age 67 and 63 vs. 73, p<0.001 for both), and they had different comorbidity profiles. Older age and baseline hypoxia were associated with increased mortality across all races. There were suggestive but non-significant interactions between Black race and diabetes (p=0.09), and obesity (p=0.10). Among inflammatory markers associated with COVID-19 mortality, there was a significant interaction between Black race and interleukin-1-beta (p=0.04), and a suggestive interactions between Hispanic ethnicity and procalcitonin (p=0.07) and interleukin-8 (p=0.09). Interpretation: In this large, racially and ethnically diverse cohort of COVID-19 patients in New York City, we identified similarities and important differences across racial and ethnic groups in risk factors for in-hospital mortality.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tomi Jun","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sharon Nirenberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Patricia Kovatch","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kuan-lin Huang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Claudio T Acevedo","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Alejandro Gomez-Mejia","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Srikanth Mairpady Shambat","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Federica Andreoni","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Maibach Maibach","author_inst":"University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Jan Bartussek","author_inst":"University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Matthias Hilty","author_inst":"Institute for Intensive Care Medicine, University Hospital Zurich and University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Pascal M Frey","author_inst":"Department of General Internal Medicine, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Reto A Schuepbach","author_inst":"Institute for Intensive Care Medicine, University Hospital Zurich and University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Silvio Daniel Brugger","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Paul Elliott","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Carlos E.

Characterized by dysmorphic mitochondria and increased cytoplasmic cytochrome c, apoptosis of these cells was inhibited by preventing VDAC aggregation or blocking caspase activation. Further, we observed a marked increase in Hexokinase II+ polymorphonuclear-myeloid derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSC). While PMN-MDSC were also found in the PBMC of patients with other viral infections, the Hexokinase II+ PMN-MDSC were found exclusively in the acute COVID-19 patients with moderate or severe disease. Finally, we identified a population of monocytic MDSC (M-MDSC) expressing high carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1a) and VDAC, which were present in the PBMC of the acute COVID-19 patients, but not recovered COVID-19 patients and whose presence correlated with severity of disease.

To evaluate the effectiveness of our hospital's current nosocomial infection control, we conducted a serological survey of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody (immunoglobulin G) among the staff of our hospital, which is treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Methods: The study design was cross-sectional. We measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G in the participants using a laboratory-based quantitative test (Abbott immunoassay), which has a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 99.6%, respectively. To investigate the factors associated with seropositivity, we also obtained some information from the participants with an anonymous questionnaire. Results: We invited 1133 staff members in our hospital, and 925 (82%) participated. The mean age of the participants was 40.0{+\/-}11.8 years, and most were women (80.0%). According to job title, there were 149 medical doctors or dentists (16.0%), 489 nurses (52.9%), 140 medical technologists (14.2%), 49 healthcare providers (5.3%), and 98 administrative staff (10.5%). The overall prevalence of seropositivity for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG was 0.43% (4\/925), which was similar to the control seroprevalence of 0.54% (16\/2970)) in the general population in Osaka during the same period according to a government survey conducted with the same assay. Seropositive rates did not significantly differ according to job title, exposure to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients, or any other investigated factors.

It is widely recognized that mass testing is an efficient way to contain the infection spread as well as the development of informed policies for disease management. However, the current COVID-19 worldwide infection rates increased demand in the rapid and reliable screening of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We compared the performance of qRT-PCR in direct heat-inactivated, heat-inactivated\/pelleted samples against RNA in a group of 74 subjects (44 positive and 30 negative). In addition, we compared the sensitivity of heat-inactivated\/pelleted in another group of 196 COVID-19 positive samples. Our study suggests that swab sample heat-inactivation and pelleting show higher accuracy for SARS-CoV-2 detection PCR assay compared to heat-inactivation only (89% vs 83% of the detection in RNA). The accuracy of detection using direct samples varied depending on the sample transport and storage media as well as the viral titer. Our study suggests that purified RNA provides more accurate results, however, direct qRT-PCR may help to significantly increase testing capacity. Switching to the direct sample testing is justified if the number of tests is doubled at least.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Diana Avetyan","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Biology NAS RA"},{"author_name":"Andranik Chavushyan","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Biology NAS RA"},{"author_name":"Hovsep Ghazaryan","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Biology NAS RA"},{"author_name":"Ani Melkonyan","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Biology NAS RA"},{"author_name":"Ani Stepanyan","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Biology NAS RA"},{"author_name":"Roksana Zakharyan","author_inst":"Russian-Armenian University"},{"author_name":"Varduhi Hayrapetyan","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Biology NAS RA"},{"author_name":"Sofi Atshemyan","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Biology NAS RA"},{"author_name":"Gevorg Martirosyan","author_inst":"Davidyants Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Gayane Melik-Andreasyan","author_inst":"National Center of Disease Control and Prevention, Ministry of Health RA"},{"author_name":"Shushan Sargsyan","author_inst":"National Center of Disease Control and Prevention, Ministry of Health RA"},{"author_name":"Armine Ghazazyan","author_inst":"National Center of Disease Control and Prevention, Ministry of Health RA"},{"author_name":"Naira Aleksanyan","author_inst":"National Center of Disease Control and Prevention, Ministry of Health RA"},{"author_name":"Xiushan Yin","author_inst":"Shenyang University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Arsen Arakelyan","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Biology NAS RA"},{"author_name":"Denise Haslwanter","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rohit Jangra","author_inst":"Mount Sinai School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alev Celikgil","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Duncan Kimmel","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James H Lee","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Margarette Mariano","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Antonio Nakouzi","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jose Quiroz","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Johanna Rivera","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Wendy A Szymczak","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Karen Tong","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jason Barnhill","author_inst":"United States Military Academy at West Point"},{"author_name":"Mattias NE Forsell","author_inst":"Ume\u00e5 University"},{"author_name":"Clas Ahlm","author_inst":"Ume\u00e5 University"},{"author_name":"Daniel T.

Extravascular lung water index (EVLWI) is a marker of pulmonary oedema which is associated with mortality in ARDS. In this study we evaluate whether EVLWI is higher in patients with COVID-19 associated ARDS as compared to controls and whether EVLWI has the potential to monitor disease progression. METHODS: From the day of intubation, EVLWI, cardiac function were monitored by transpulmonary thermodilution in n=25 patients with COVID-19 and compared to a control group of 49 non-COVID-19 ARDS-patients. RESULTS: EVLWI in COVID-19-patients was noticeably elevated and significantly higher than in the control group (17 (11-38) vs. 11 (6-26) mL\/kg; p<0.001). High pulmonary vascular permeability index values (2.9 (1.0-5.2) versus 1.9 (1.0-5.2); p=0.003) suggest inflammatory oedema. By contrast, the cardiac parameters SVI, GEF and GEDVI were comparable. High EVLWI values were associated with viral persistence, prolonged intensive care treatment and mortality (23.2{+\/-}6.7% vs. 30.3{+\/-}6.0%, p=0.025). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the control group, COVID-19 results in markedly elevated EVLWI-values in patients with ARDS. EVLWI reflects a non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema in COVID-19 associated ARDS and could serve as parameter to monitor ARDS progression.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sebastian Rasch","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, University hospital rechts der Isar, Department of Internal Medicine II, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, G"},{"author_name":"Paul Schmidle","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Department of Dermatology and Allergology, Biedersteiner Str. 29, 80802 Munich"},{"author_name":"Senguel Sancak","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, University hospital rechts der Isar, Department of Internal Medicine II, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, G"},{"author_name":"Alexander Herner","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, University hospital rechts der Isar, Department of Internal Medicine II, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, G"},{"author_name":"Christina Huberle","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, University hospital rechts der Isar, Department of Internal Medicine II, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, G"},{"author_name":"Dominik Schulz","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, University hospital rechts der Isar, Department of Internal Medicine II, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, G"},{"author_name":"Ulrich Mayr","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, University hospital rechts der Isar, Department of Internal Medicine II, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, G"},{"author_name":"Jochen Schneider","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, University hospital rechts der Isar, Department of Internal Medicine II, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, G"},{"author_name":"Christoph Spinner","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, University hospital rechts der Isar, Department of Internal Medicine II, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, G"},{"author_name":"Fabian Geisler","author_inst":"Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, University hospital rechts der Isar, Department of Internal Medicine II, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, G"},{"author_name":"Roland M.

In this study, we have applied Mendelian randomization (MR) to systematically evaluate the effect of 10 cardiometabolic risk factors and genetic liability to lifetime smoking on 97 circulating host proteins postulated to either interact or contribute to the maladaptive host response of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We applied the inverse variance weighted (IVW) approach and several robust MR methods in a two-sample setting to systemically estimate the genetically predicted effect of each risk factor in turn on levels of each circulating protein. Multivariable MR was conducted to simultaneously evaluate the effects of multiple risk factors on the same protein. We also applied MR using cis-regulatory variants at the genomic location responsible for encoding these proteins to estimate whether their circulating levels may influence SARS-CoV-2 severity. Findings: In total, we identified evidence supporting 105 effects between risk factors and circulating proteins which were robust to multiple testing corrections and sensitivity analyses. For example, body mass index provided evidence of an effect on 23 circulating proteins with a variety of functions, such as inflammatory markers c-reactive protein (IVW Beta=0.34 per standard deviation change, 95% CI=0.26 to 0.41, P=2.19x10-16) and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IVW Beta=0.23, 95% CI=0.17 to 0.30, P=9.04x10-12). Further analyses using multivariable MR provided evidence that the effect of BMI on lowering immunoglobulin G, an antibody class involved in protecting the body from infection, is substantially mediated by raised triglycerides levels (IVW Beta=-0.18, 95% CI=-0.25 to -0.12, P=2.32x10-08, proportion mediated=44.1%). The strongest evidence that any of the circulating proteins highlighted by our initial analysis influence SARS-CoV-2 severity was identified for soluble glycoprotein 130 (odds ratio=1.81, 95% CI=1.25 to 2.62, P=0.002), a signal transductor for interleukin-6 type cytokines which are involved in the bodys inflammatory response. However, based on current case samples for severe SARS-CoV-2 we were unable to replicate findings in independent samples.

Since many infections, even among the elderly and other vulnerable populations, are asymptomatic, the prevalence of antibodies could help determine how far along the path to herd immunity the general population has progressed. Also, in order to clarify the clinical manifestations of current or recent past COVID-19 illness, it may be useful to determine if there are any common alterations in routine clinical laboratory values. Methods: We performed SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests on 50,130 consecutive life insurance applicants who were having blood drawn for the purpose of underwriting (life risk assessment). Subjects were also tested for lipids, liver function tests, renal function studies, as well as serum proteins. Other variables included height, weight, blood pressure at the time of the blood draw, and history of common chronic diseases (hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, and cancer). Results: The overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 3.0%, and was fairly consistent across the age range and similar in males and females. Several of the routine laboratory tests obtained were significantly different in antibody-positive vs. antibody-negative subjects, including albumin, globulins, bilirubin, and the urine albumin:creatinine ratio. The BMI was also significantly higher in the antibody-positive group. Geographical distribution revealed a very high level of positivity in the state of New York compared to all other areas (17.1%). Using state population data from the US Census, it is estimated that this level of seropositivity would correspond to 6.98 million (99% CI: 6.56-7.38 million) SARS-CoV-2 infections in the US, which is 3.8 times the cumulative number of cases in the US reported to the CDC as of June 1, 2020. Conclusions: The estimated number of total SARS-CoV-2 infections based on positive serology is substantially higher than the total number of cases reported to the CDC. Certain laboratory values, particularly serum protein levels, are associated with positive serology, though these associations are not likely to be clinically meaningful.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Steven J.

Participants: We included 1306 COVID-19 patients (678 men and 628 women) who had serum TT and SHBG measurements and were free of cardiovascular disease or cancer at baseline (2006-2010). Main outcome measures: The death cases of COVID-19 were identified from National Health Service death records updated at 31 July 2020. Unconditional logistic regression was performed to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for mortality. Results: We documented 315 deaths of COVID-19 (194 men and 121 women). After adjusting for potential confounders, we did not find any statistically significant associations for TT (OR per 1-SD increase = 1.03, 95% CI: 0.85-1.25), FT (OR per 1-SD increase = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.77-1.17), or SHBG (OR per 1-SD increase = 1.09, 95% CI: 0.87-1.37) with COVID-19 mortality in men.

This allows us to exploit the sophisticated functionality of a commercial chemical engineering simulator capable of parameter regression with piecewise continuous integration and event and discontinuity management. Our results provide insights into the outcomes of on-going disease suppression measures, while visualisation of reported data also provides up-to-date condition monitoring of the status of the pandemic.

This study aimed to assess the early impact of COVID-19 on immunization activities by comparing current trends to trends over the past year when vaccine coverage of major antigens (BCG, OPV, DTC, MMR, IPV, and Td) had improved considerably. Methods: The study was carried out at the Expanded Vaccination Program (EPI) of the Republic of Guinea from February 2019 to June 2019. It was a comparative retrospective cohort study on the trends in administrative coverage of the different antigens used in the framework of vaccination. We performed interrupted time series (STI) analysis using the delayed dependent variable model ANCOVA type II Sum Squares with significance for a p-value less than 0.05 to confirm the link between the occurrence of Covid-19 and the collapse of vaccine coverage. These analyzes were performed on global vaccine-preventable disease surveillance data extracted from the District Immunization Data Management Tool (DVD-MT) designed by WHO. Estimates of the target population were obtained from the National Health Information System (SNIS), and surveillance data for Covid-19 patients were obtained from the National Health Security Agency (ANSS). Results: Overall, the EPI recorded a median vaccination coverage of less than 80% for all the vaccines introduced and the analysis of the interrupted time series shows that the interruption of the vaccination program was significant for all the vaccines. This finding is factual at both the national and district levels. However, there are disparities at this level, even though some districts have yet to report cases of COVID-19 but have experienced drop-in vaccination coverage. The comparison of vaccination coverage for DTP3, for example, shows a sharp drop in the prefectures of Yomou, N'Nzerekore, Macenta, Kankan, Mandiana, Dinguiraye, Mamou, Koubia, Mali, and Conakry, where it varies between 0 and 80% compared to 2019 where it was above 80%. Conclusion: Our results express the need for a resilient health system that could adapt quickly and effectively to pandemics and which in turn makes it possible to strengthen EPI activities in Guinea during this period of a health crisis, in particular for children.

Design: A national cross-sectional community survey. Participants: Australian adults aged 18 years and over (n=1369). Main outcome measures: Telehealth experiences. Results: Of the 596 telehealth users, the majority of respondents (62%) rated their telehealth experience as \"just as good\" or \"better\" than a traditional in-person medical appointment. On average, respondents perceived that telehealth would be moderately to very useful for medical appointments after the COVID-19 pandemic is over (M=3.67 out of 5, SD=1.1). Being male (p=0.007), having a history of both depression and anxiety (p=0.037), or lower patient activation (individuals' willingness to take on the role of managing their health\/healthcare) (p=0.037) were associated with a poorer telehealth experience. Six overarching themes were identified from free-text responses of why telehealth experience was poorer than a traditional in-person medical appointment: communication is not as effective; limitations with technology; issues with obtaining prescriptions and pathology; reduced confidence in doctor; additional burden for complex care; and inability to be physically examined. Conclusions: Telehealth appointments were reported to be comparable to traditional in-person medical appointments by most of our sample. Telehealth should continue to be offered as a mode of healthcare delivery while the pandemic continues and may be worthwhile beyond the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jennifer MJ Isautier","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Tessa Copp","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Julie Ayre","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Erin Cvejic","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz","author_inst":"University of Wollongong"},{"author_name":"Carys Batcup","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Carissa Bonner","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Rachael Dodd","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Brooke Nickel","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Kristen Pickles","author_inst":"The University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Samuel Cornell","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Thomas Dakin","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Kirsten J McCaffery","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Aboubacar Sidiki Magassouba","author_inst":"Expanded Immunization Program (Consultant), Guinea"},{"author_name":"Arsen Arakelyan","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Biology NAS RA"},{"author_name":"Denise Haslwanter","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rohit Jangra","author_inst":"Mount Sinai School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alev Celikgil","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Duncan Kimmel","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James H Lee","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Margarette Mariano","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Antonio Nakouzi","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jose Quiroz","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Johanna Rivera","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Wendy A Szymczak","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Karen Tong","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jason Barnhill","author_inst":"United States Military Academy at West Point"},{"author_name":"Mattias NE Forsell","author_inst":"Ume\u00e5 University"},{"author_name":"Clas Ahlm","author_inst":"Ume\u00e5 University"},{"author_name":"Daniel T.

SARS-CoV-2 serological tests could help in the selection of donors. We assessed COVID-19 seroprevalence in a population of tissue donors, at the onset of the outbreak in France, before systematic screening of donors for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Methods: 235 tissue donors at the Lille Tissue bank between November 1, 2019 and March 16, 2020 were included. Archived serum samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using two FDA-approved kits. Results: Most donors were at higher risks for severe COVID-19 illness including age over 65 years (142\/235) and\/or presence of co-morbidities (141\/235). According to the COVID-19 risk assessment of transmission, 183 out of 235 tissue donors presented with a low risk level and 52 donors with an intermediate risk level of donor derived infection. Four out of the 235 (1.7%) tested specimens were positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies: 2 donors with anti-N protein IgG and 2 other donors with anti-S protein total Ig. None of them had both type of antibodies. Conclusion: Regarding the seroprevalence among tissue donors, we concluded that the transmission probability to recipient via tissue products was very low at the beginning of the outbreak.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicolas Germain","author_inst":"CHU Lille, Tissue Bank of Lille, Biology Pathology Center, F-59000 LILLE, FRANCE"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Herwegh","author_inst":"CHU Lille, Tissue Bank of Lille, Biology Pathology Center, F-59000 LILLE, FRANCE"},{"author_name":"Anne Sophie Hatzfeld","author_inst":"CHU Lille, Tissue Bank of Lille, Biology Pathology Center, F-59000 LILLE, FRANCE"},{"author_name":"Laurence Bocket","author_inst":"CHU Lille, Virology laboratory, Biology Pathology Center, F-59000 LILLE, FRANCE"},{"author_name":"Brigitte Prevost","author_inst":"CHU Lille, Virology laboratory, Biology Pathology Center, F-59000 LILLE, FRANCE"},{"author_name":"Pierre Marie Danze","author_inst":"CHU Lille, Tissue Bank of Lille, Biology Pathology Center, F-59000 LILLE, FRANCE"},{"author_name":"Philippe Marchetti","author_inst":"CHU Lille, Tissue Bank of Lille, Biology Pathology Center, F-59000 LILLE, FRANCE"},{"author_name":"Rachael Dodd","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Brooke Nickel","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Kristen Pickles","author_inst":"The University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Samuel Cornell","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Thomas Dakin","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Kirsten J McCaffery","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Aboubacar Sidiki Magassouba","author_inst":"Expanded Immunization Program (Consultant), Guinea"},{"author_name":"Arsen Arakelyan","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Biology NAS RA"},{"author_name":"Denise Haslwanter","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rohit Jangra","author_inst":"Mount Sinai School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alev Celikgil","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Duncan Kimmel","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James H Lee","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Margarette Mariano","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Antonio Nakouzi","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jose Quiroz","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Johanna Rivera","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Wendy A Szymczak","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Karen Tong","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jason Barnhill","author_inst":"United States Military Academy at West Point"},{"author_name":"Mattias NE Forsell","author_inst":"Ume\u00e5 University"},{"author_name":"Clas Ahlm","author_inst":"Ume\u00e5 University"},{"author_name":"Daniel T.

By combining data on facility-level COVID-19 deaths with facility-level data on the neighborhoods where nursing home staff reside for a sample of eighteen states, this paper finds that staff neighborhood characteristics are a large and significant predictor of COVID-19 outbreaks. One standard deviation increases in average staff tract population density, public transportation use, and non-white share were associated with 1.3 (SE .33), 1.4 (SE .35), and 0.9 (SE .24) additional deaths per 100 beds, respectively. These effects are larger than all facility management or quality variables, and larger than the effect of the nursing home's own neighborhood characteristics. These results suggest that staff communities are likely to be an important source of infection, and that disparities in nursing home outbreaks may be related to differences in the types of neighborhoods nursing home staff live in.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Karen Shen","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Herwegh","author_inst":"CHU Lille, Tissue Bank of Lille, Biology Pathology Center, F-59000 LILLE, FRANCE"},{"author_name":"Anne Sophie Hatzfeld","author_inst":"CHU Lille, Tissue Bank of Lille, Biology Pathology Center, F-59000 LILLE, FRANCE"},{"author_name":"Laurence Bocket","author_inst":"CHU Lille, Virology laboratory, Biology Pathology Center, F-59000 LILLE, FRANCE"},{"author_name":"Brigitte Prevost","author_inst":"CHU Lille, Virology laboratory, Biology Pathology Center, F-59000 LILLE, FRANCE"},{"author_name":"Pierre Marie Danze","author_inst":"CHU Lille, Tissue Bank of Lille, Biology Pathology Center, F-59000 LILLE, FRANCE"},{"author_name":"Philippe Marchetti","author_inst":"CHU Lille, Tissue Bank of Lille, Biology Pathology Center, F-59000 LILLE, FRANCE"},{"author_name":"Rachael Dodd","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Brooke Nickel","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Kristen Pickles","author_inst":"The University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Samuel Cornell","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Thomas Dakin","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Kirsten J McCaffery","author_inst":"University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Aboubacar Sidiki Magassouba","author_inst":"Expanded Immunization Program (Consultant), Guinea"},{"author_name":"Arsen Arakelyan","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Biology NAS RA"},{"author_name":"Denise Haslwanter","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rohit Jangra","author_inst":"Mount Sinai School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alev Celikgil","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Duncan Kimmel","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James H Lee","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Margarette Mariano","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Antonio Nakouzi","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jose Quiroz","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Johanna Rivera","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Wendy A Szymczak","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Karen Tong","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jason Barnhill","author_inst":"United States Military Academy at West Point"},{"author_name":"Mattias NE Forsell","author_inst":"Ume\u00e5 University"},{"author_name":"Clas Ahlm","author_inst":"Ume\u00e5 University"},{"author_name":"Daniel T.

Rapid and early detection of the virus is the master key to cease the rapid spread and break the human transmission chain. There are very few studies in search of an alternate and convenient diagnostic tool which can substitute nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimen for detection of SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to analyse the comparison and agreement between the feasibility of using the saliva in comparison to NPS for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Methods A total number of 74 patients were enrolled for this study. We analysed and compared the NPS and saliva specimen collected within 48 h after the symptom onset. We used real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), gene sequencing for the detection and determination SARS-CoV-2 specific genes. Phylogenetic tree was constructed to establish the isolation of viral RNA from saliva. We use Bland-Altman model to identify the agreement between two sampling methods. Findings This study shows a lower CT mean value for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 ORF1 gene (27.07; 95% CI, 25.62 to 28.52) in saliva methods than that of NPS (28.24; 95% CI, 26.62 to 29.85) sampling method. Bland-Altman analysis produces relatively smaller bias and high agreement between these specimen tools. Phylogenetic analysis with the RdRp and Spike gene confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the saliva samples. Interpretation: In conclusion, our study highlights that saliva represents a promising tool in COVID-19 diagnosis and would reduce the exposure risk of frontline health workers which is one of biggest concern in primary healthcare settings.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dr. Debdutta Bhattacharya","author_inst":"ICMR - Regional Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Dr. Debaprasad Parai","author_inst":"ICMR- Regional Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Usha Kiran Rout","author_inst":"ICMR- Regional Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Rashmi Ranjan Nanda","author_inst":"ICMR- Regional Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Dr. Srikanta Kanungo","author_inst":"ICMR- Regional Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Dr. Girish Chandra Dash","author_inst":"ICMR-Regional Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Dr. Subrat Kumar Palo","author_inst":"ICMR- Regional Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Dr. Siddharth Giri","author_inst":"ICMR- Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Hari Ram Choudhary","author_inst":"ICMR- Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Dr. Jaya Singh Kshatri","author_inst":"ICMR- Regional Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Dr. Jyotirmayee Turuk","author_inst":"ICMR- Regional Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Dr. Bijay Mishra","author_inst":"ICMR- Regional Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Dr. Saroj Dash","author_inst":"ICMR- Regional Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Dr. Sanghamitra Pati","author_inst":"ICMR- Regional Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar"},{"author_name":"Arsen Arakelyan","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Biology NAS RA"},{"author_name":"Denise Haslwanter","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rohit Jangra","author_inst":"Mount Sinai School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alev Celikgil","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Duncan Kimmel","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James H Lee","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Margarette Mariano","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Antonio Nakouzi","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jose Quiroz","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Johanna Rivera","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Wendy A Szymczak","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Karen Tong","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jason Barnhill","author_inst":"United States Military Academy at West Point"},{"author_name":"Mattias NE Forsell","author_inst":"Ume\u00e5 University"},{"author_name":"Clas Ahlm","author_inst":"Ume\u00e5 University"},{"author_name":"Daniel T.

Sensitivities varied by the day of sample collection, from 31.7%-55.4% (Days 0-9), 65.9%-92.9% (Days 10-14), and 81.0%-95.2% (>14 days) after the onset of symptoms, respectively. Only three tests evaluated met French Health Authorities' thresholds for SARS-CoV-2 serological tests ([&ge;]90% sensitivity + [&ge;]98% specificity). Overall, the performances between tests varied greatly, with only a third meeting acceptable specificity and sensitivity thresholds. Knowing the analytical performance of these tests will allow clinicians to use them with more confidence, could help determine the general population's immunological status, and may diagnose some patients with false-negative RT-PCR results.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Laurent Dortet","author_inst":"Hopital de Bicetre"},{"author_name":"Jean-Baptiste Ronat","author_inst":"MSF France"},{"author_name":"Christelle Vauloup-Fellous","author_inst":"Service de Virologie, H\u00f4pital Paul-Brousse, Inserm U 1193 ; Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay Villejuif, APHP Paris-Saclay"},{"author_name":"C\u00e9line Langendorf","author_inst":"Epicentre (South Africa)"},{"author_name":"David-Alexis Mendels","author_inst":"xrapid-group"},{"author_name":"C\u00e9cile Emeraud","author_inst":"Hopital de Bicetre"},{"author_name":"Saoussen Oueslati","author_inst":"INSERM U914"},{"author_name":"Delphine Girlich","author_inst":"Service de Bacteriologie"},{"author_name":"Anthony Chauvin","author_inst":"APHP, H\u00f4pitaux universitaires Lariboisi\u00e8re-Saint Louis-Fernand-WIdal"},{"author_name":"Ali Afdjei","author_inst":"Emergency Department, H\u00f4pital Parly-2,"},{"author_name":"Sandrine Bernabeu","author_inst":"Paris-Sud University, LabEx Lermit, Faculty of Medecine"},{"author_name":"Samuel Le Pape","author_inst":"Service de Virologie, H\u00f4pital Paul-Brousse, Inserm U 1193 ; Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay Villejuif, APHP Paris-Saclay"},{"author_name":"Rim Kallala","author_inst":"Service de Virologie, H\u00f4pital Paul-Brousse"},{"author_name":"Alice Rochard","author_inst":"APHP, Hopital de Bicetre"},{"author_name":"Celine Verstuyft","author_inst":"Facult\u00e9 de M\u00e9decine Paris-Sud, Univ Paris-Sud, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay; INSERM U1184; Service de G\u00e9n\u00e9tique mol\u00e9culaire, Pharmacog\u00e9n\u00e9tique et H"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Fortineau","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Anne-Marie Roque-Afonso","author_inst":"Service de Virologie, H\u00f4pital Paul-Brousse, Inserm U 1193 ; Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay Villejuif, APHP Paris-Saclay"},{"author_name":"Thierry Naas","author_inst":"APHP"},{"author_name":"Duncan Kimmel","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"James H Lee","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Margarette Mariano","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Antonio Nakouzi","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jose Quiroz","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Johanna Rivera","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Wendy A Szymczak","author_inst":"Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Karen Tong","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jason Barnhill","author_inst":"United States Military Academy at West Point"},{"author_name":"Mattias NE Forsell","author_inst":"Ume\u00e5 University"},{"author_name":"Clas Ahlm","author_inst":"Ume\u00e5 University"},{"author_name":"Daniel T.
