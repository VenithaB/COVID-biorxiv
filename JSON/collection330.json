Onehundred and sixty-ninepatients were recruited from January 27 to March 17, 2020 at five hospitals in Hubei and Guangxi. Theywere divided into four groups according to age and into two groups according to presence ofcomorbidities. Multivariate statistical analyses were performed for the prognosis of the disease. Fifty-two patients (30.8%) had comorbidities, and the percentage of critical COVID-19was higher in the comorbidities group (11.6%vs.0.9%, p<0.05). Older patients had higher proportion of severe or critical disease.The resultsshowed that lymphocyte count was significantly associated with thenumber ofdays from positive COVID-19 nucleic acid testto negative test; number of days from onset of symptoms to confirmation of diagnosis was significantly associated with the time it took forsymptoms to improve; andnumber of days from onset of symptomsto confirmation of diagnosis and disease severity were significantly associated withchest computed tomography improvement. We concluded that age, comorbidities, lymphocyte count, and SpO2may predictthe risk of severity of COVID-19.Early isolation, early diagnosis, and early initiation of management canslow down the progression and spread ofCOVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wen Zeng","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xin Feng","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jie Huang","author_inst":"Tuberculosis Ward 1, The Fourth People's Hospital of Nanning City"},{"author_name":"Chuan Du","author_inst":"Hubei No.3 People's Hospital of Jianghan University"},{"author_name":"Dongming Qu","author_inst":"Nanxishan Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region"},{"author_name":"Xiang Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Huangpi District Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"jianquan Zhang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.25.20201996","rel_title":"The quantitative landscape of the neutralizing antibody response to SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-09-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.25.20201996","rel_abs":"Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) appear promising interventions against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Over 100 NAbs have been identified so far and several are in clinical trials. Yet, which NAbs would be the most potent remains unclear. Here, we analysed reported in vitro dose-response curves (DRCs) of >70 NAbs and estimated corresponding 50% inhibitory concentrations, slope parameters, and instantaneous inhibitory potentials (IIPs), presenting a comprehensive quantitative landscape of NAb responses to SARS-CoV-2. NAbs with high IIPs are likely to be potent. To assess the applicability of the landscape in vivo, we analysed available DRCs of NAbs from individual patients and found that the responses closely resembled the landscape. Further, we created virtual patient plasma samples by randomly sampling NAbs from the landscape and found that they recapitulated plasma dilution assays from convalescent patients. The landscape thus offers a facile tool for benchmarking NAbs and would aid the development of NAb-based therapies for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pranesh Padmanabhan","author_inst":"The University of Queensland"},{"author_name":"Rajat Desikan","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Narendra M Dixit","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Chuan Du","author_inst":"Hubei No.3 People's Hospital of Jianghan University"},{"author_name":"Dongming Qu","author_inst":"Nanxishan Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region"},{"author_name":"Xiang Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Huangpi District Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"jianquan Zhang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.25.20201921","rel_title":"Improved Sensitivity, Safety, and Rapidity of COVID-19 Tests by Replacing Viral Storage Solution with Lysis Buffer","rel_date":"2020-09-28","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.25.20201921","rel_abs":"Conducting numerous, rapid, and reliable PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 is essential for our ability to monitor and control the current COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we tested the sensitivity and efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 detection in clinical samples collected directly into a mix of lysis buffer and RNA preservative, thus inactivating the virus immediately after sampling. We tested 79 COVID-19 patients and 20 healthy controls. We collected two samples (nasopharyngeal swabs) from each participant: one swab was inserted into a test tube with Viral Transport Medium (VTM), following the standard guideline used as the recommended method for sample collection; the other swab was inserted into a lysis buffer supplemented with nucleic acid stabilization mix (coined NSLB). We found that RT-qPCR tests of patients were significantly more sensitive with NSLB sampling, reaching detection threshold 2.1{+\/-}0.6 (Mean{+\/-}SE) PCR cycles earlier then VTM samples from the same patient. We show that this improvement is most likely since NSLB samples are not diluted in lysis buffer before RNA extraction. Re-extracting RNA from NSLB samples after 72 hours at room temperature did not affect the sensitivity of detection, demonstrating that NSLB allows for long periods of sample preservation without special cooling equipment. We also show that swirling the swab in NSLB and discarding it did not reduce sensitivity compared to retaining the swab in the tube, thus allowing improved automation of COVID-19 tests. Overall, we show that using NSLB instead of VTM can improve the sensitivity, safety, and rapidity of COVID-19 tests at a time most needed.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Oran Erster","author_inst":"Central Virology Laboratory, Ministry of Health, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, P.O.

For 11 such countries, the hypothesis that COVID-19 cases have declined mainly through low susceptibility levels, stemming largely from high levels of infection leading to (at least temporary) immunity, warrants serious consideration. The Reed-Frost model, perhaps the simplest description for the evolution of cases in an epidemic, with only a few constant parameters, fits the observed case data remarkably well, and yields parameter values that are reasonable. The model results give infection levels of 45% and 79%, above the herd immunity threshold for each country under their current social distancing conditions. Reproduction numbers range between 1.4 and 2.0, indicating that epidemic curves were flattened but not suppressed. Between 0.05% and 2.86% of cases have been detected according to the estimates; values which are consistent with findings from serological studies. Overall infection fatality ratios for two of three countries studied are lower than expected from reported infection fatality ratios by age (which are based on studies of several high-income countries). COVID-19 may have lower age-specific fatality risks in some countries, due to differences in immune-response, prior exposure to coronaviruses, disease characteristics or other factors. We find that the hypothesis of control through low susceptibility would not have fit the evolution of reported cases in several European countries, even just after the initial peaks; instead, these countries reduced COVID-19 cases initially through disease control measures; and subsequent resurgences of cases obviously prove that those countries have infection levels well below those required for herd immunity. Our hypothesis that the 11 countries we studied have low susceptibility levels should now be tested further through immunity studies, and efforts should continue to determine the duration and extent of immunity to SARS CoV2 after infection.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Axel S Lexmond","author_inst":"University of Pretoria"},{"author_name":"Carlijn JA Nouwen","author_inst":"Personal capacity"},{"author_name":"Othmane Fourtassi","author_inst":"Personal capacity"},{"author_name":"John Paul Callan","author_inst":"Personal capacity"},{"author_name":"Itay Varkovitzky","author_inst":"Directorate of Defense Research & Development, Israeli Ministry of Defense, Israel"},{"author_name":"Rachel Shirazi","author_inst":"Central Virology Laboratory, Ministry of Health, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, P.O.

Our model assesses the trade-off between social performance and limited medical resources by determining individuals' propensities. The proposed strategy also helps decision makers to find optimal lockdown and exit strategy for each region. Moreover, the financial loss is minimized. In addition, a study of a COVID-19 dataset for Los Angeles County is performed to validate our model and its results.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hamid R.

The quantification of COVID-19 transmissibility is desired for purposes of assessing the potential for a place to start an outbreak and the extent of transmission in the absence of control measures. It is well known that the transmissibility can be measured by reproduction number. For this reason, the large amount of research focuses on the estimations of reproduction number of COVID-19. However, these previous results are controversial and even misleading. To alleviate this problem, Liu et al advised to use averaging technique. Unfortunately, the fluctuant consequence principally arises from data error or model limitations rather than stochastic noise, where the averaging technique doesn't work well. The most likely estimation in USA and Wuhan is about 8.21 and 7.9.

COVID-19 is caused by a SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of the study is to contribute to the surveillance of the pandemic by bringing new knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among healthcare workers and evaluating whether certain job functions is associated with a higher risk of being infected, and to clarify if such association is mediated by the number of individuals that the employees meet during a workday. Finally, we will investigate regional and national differences in seroprevalence. Methods: A bi-national prospective observational cohort study including 3,272 adults employed at Falck in Sweden and Denmark. Participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies every second week for a period of 8 weeks from June 22, 2020 until August 10, 2020. Descriptive statistics as well as multivariable logistic regression analyses were applied. Results: Of the 3,272 Falck employees participating in this study, 159 (4.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The seroprevalence was lower among Danish Falck employees than among those from Sweden (2.8% in Denmark and 8.3% in Sweden). We also found that number of customer or patient contacts during a workday was the most prominent predictor for seropositivity, and that ambulance staff was the most vulnerable staff group. Conclusions: Our study presents geographical variations in seroprevalence within the Falck organization and shows evidence that social interaction is one of the biggest risk factors for getting infected with SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jannie Laursen","author_inst":"Department of Global Business Quality Management, Falck, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Janne Petersen","author_inst":"Center for Clinical Research and Prevention, Copenhagen University Hospital, Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg.

A machine learning framework was developed to estimate time courses of actual new COVID-19 cases and current infections in 50 countries and 50 U.S. states from reported test results and deaths, as well as published epidemiological parameters. Severe under-reporting of cases was found to be universal. Our framework projects for countries like Belgium, Brazil, and the U.S. ~10% of the population has been once infected. In the U.S. states like Louisiana, Georgia, and Florida, more than 4% of the population is estimated to be currently infected, as of September 3, 2020, while in New York the fraction is 0.12%. The estimation of the actual fraction of currently infected people is crucial for any definition of public health policies, which up to this point may have been misguided by the reliance on confirmed cases.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jungsik Noh","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Gaudenz Danuser","author_inst":"UT Southwestern Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ioannis Bakolis","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Matthew Broadbent","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Nicola Byrne","author_inst":"South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Sabine Landau","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Dorit Oriya Shorka","author_inst":"Hadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel"},{"author_name":"Yuval Cohen","author_inst":"Directorate of Defense Research & Development, Israeli Ministry of Defense, Israel"},{"author_name":"Tzahi Bar","author_inst":"Independent Researcher, Israel"},{"author_name":"Rafi Yechieli","author_inst":"Independent Researcher, Israel"},{"author_name":"Michal Tepperberg Oikawa","author_inst":"Central Virology Laboratory, Ministry of Health, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, P.O.

To examine whether the risk for contracting COVID-19 is elevated among OSA patients. Design and setting: Registry based retrospective case-control study using Finnish nationwide health registries and the FinnGen Study cohort. Participants: Information regarding OSA diagnosis and COVID-19 infection was extracted from the FinnGen study (N=260,405) with a total of 305 patients who had a recorded PCR-validated COVID-19 infection including 26 (8.5%) individuals who were also OSA patients. Severe COVID-19 (N=83, 27.2%) was defined as an infection requiring hospitalization. Among the hospitalized individuals there were 16 (19.3%) with OSA diagnosis. In addition, we also included in our analysis previously reported risk factors for both severe COVID-19 or risk factors and comorbidities for OSA from FinnGen. Main outcome measures: OSA diagnosis, information concerning COVID-19 infection such as hospitalization, were derived from Finnish National Hospital Discharge Registry, Causes of Death Registry and the National Infectious Diseases Registry. Results: We show that OSA is a risk factor for COVID-19 hospitalization independent from age, sex, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease (CHD), asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), (p-unadjusted=1.04x10^-4, OR-adjusted=5.24 [95%CI 1.33 to 23.43], p-adjusted=0.022). OSA was not associated with the risk of contracting COVID-19 (p=0.49). Conclusion: While an OSA patients risk of contracting COVID-19 is the same as non-OSA individuals, the OSA patients have a five-fold risk to be hospitalized when affected by COVID-19 than non-OSA individuals. Our findings suggest that, in assessment of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection, OSA needs to be recognized as one of the comorbidity risk factors for developing a severe form of the disease.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Satu Strausz","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Tuomo Kiiskinen","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Martin Broberg","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Sanni Ruotsalainen","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Jukka Koskela","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Adel Bachour","author_inst":"Sleep Unit, Heart and Lung Center, Helsinki University Hospital (HUH), Finland"},{"author_name":"Aarno Palotie","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Tuula Palotie","author_inst":"Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Diseases, Helsinki University Hospital (HUH), Finland"},{"author_name":"Samuli Ripatti","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Hanna M Ollila","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Michal Tepperberg Oikawa","author_inst":"Central Virology Laboratory, Ministry of Health, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, P.O.

We explore the impact of having in-person sports on COVID-19 transmission on a college campus, specifically the excess cases within the campus community can be anticipated. Methods: Using a stochastic compartmental model representing the interactions between the university community, we model the impact of transient influxes of visitors attending sporting events and ancillary activities (bars, dining out, etc.). We consider a number of scenarios, varying the extent to which visitors interact with the campus, the number of infectious visitors, and the extent to which the campus has controlled COVID-19 absent events. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis, exploring the model's outcomes over a wide range of uncertainty. Results: Events caused an increase in the number of cases among the campus community, ranging from a 25% increase in a scenario where the campus already had an uncontrolled COVID-19 outbreak and visitors had a low prevalence of COVID-19 and mixed lightly with the campus community to an 822% increase where the campus had controlled their COVID-19 outbreak and visitors had both a high prevalence of COVID-19 and mixed heavily with the campus community. The model was insensitive to parameter uncertainty, save for the duration a symptomatic individual was infectious. Conclusion: In-person sporting events represent a threat to the health of the campus community. This is the case even in circumstances where COVID-19 seems controlled both on-campus and among the larger population visitors are drawn from.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stephanie S Johnson","author_inst":"Washington State University"},{"author_name":"Katelin C Jackson","author_inst":"Washington State University"},{"author_name":"Matthew S Mietchen","author_inst":"Washington State University"},{"author_name":"Samir Sbai","author_inst":"Washington State University"},{"author_name":"Elissa J Schwartz","author_inst":"Washington State University"},{"author_name":"Eric Lofgren","author_inst":"Washington State University"},{"author_name":"Aarno Palotie","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Tuula Palotie","author_inst":"Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Diseases, Helsinki University Hospital (HUH), Finland"},{"author_name":"Samuli Ripatti","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Hanna M Ollila","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Michal Tepperberg Oikawa","author_inst":"Central Virology Laboratory, Ministry of Health, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, P.O.

From fitting such a model to the trajectory of mortality from COVID-19 in 11 European countries up to 4 May 2020 Flaxman et al. concluded that \"major non-pharmaceutical interventions -- and lockdowns in particular -- have had a large effect on reducing transmission\". We show that relaxing the assumption of homogeneity to allow for individual variation in susceptibility or connectivity gives a model that has better fit to the data and more accurate 14-day forward prediction of mortality. Allowing for heterogeneity reduces the estimate of \"counterfactual\" deaths that would have occurred if there had been no interventions from 3.2 million to 262,000, implying that most of the slowing and reversal of COVID-19 mortality is explained by the build-up of herd immunity. The estimate of the herd immunity threshold depends on the value specified for the infection fatality ratio (IFR): a value of 0.3% for the IFR gives 15% for the average herd immunity threshold.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marco Colombo","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Joseph Mellor","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Helen M Colhoun","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"M.

SARS-CoV-2 infects the lungs and may cause several immune-related complications such as lymphocytopenia and cytokine storm which are associated with the severity of the disease and predict mortality . The mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may result in immune system dysfunction is not fully understood. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infects human CD4+ T helper cells, but not CD8+ T cells, and is present in blood and bronchoalveolar lavage T helper cells of severe COVID-19 patients. We demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S) directly binds to the CD4 molecule, which in turn mediates the entry of SARS- CoV-2 in T helper cells in a mechanism that also requires ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Once inside T helper cells, SARS-CoV-2 assembles viral factories, impairs cell function and may cause cell death. SARS-CoV-2 infected T helper cells express higher amounts of IL-10, which is associated with viral persistence and disease severity. Thus, CD4-mediated SARS-CoV-2 infection of T helper cells may explain the poor adaptive immune response of many COVID- 19 patients.","rel_num_authors":65,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gustavo G.

While Latin America has been heavily affected by the pandemic, only a few seroprevalence studies have been conducted there. Methods A cross-sectional survey was performed between 15 July 2020 and 23 July 2020 in 4 medical biology laboratories and 5 health centers of French Guiana, representing a period shortly after the epidemic peak. Samples were screened for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG directed against domain S1 of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using the anti-SARS-CoV-2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) from Euroimmun. Results The overall seroprevalence was 15.4% [9.3%-24.4%] among 480 participants, ranging from 4.0% to 25.5% across the different municipalities. The seroprevalence did not differ according to gender (p=0.19) or age (p=0.51). Among SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals, we found that 24.6% [11.5%-45.2%] reported symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Conclusions Our findings revealed high levels of infection across the territory but a low number of resulting deaths, which can be explained by the young population structure.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Claude Flamand","author_inst":"Epidemiology unit, Institut Pasteur in French Guiana"},{"author_name":"Antoine Enfissi","author_inst":"Laboratory of virology, Institut Pasteur in French Guiana"},{"author_name":"Sarah Bailly","author_inst":"Epidemiology unit, Institut Pasteur in French Guiana"},{"author_name":"Christelle ALVES SARMENTO","author_inst":"Epidemiology unit, Institut Pasteur in French Guiana"},{"author_name":"Emmanuel Beillard","author_inst":"Medical Biology Laboratory, Institut Pasteur in French Guiana"},{"author_name":"Melanie Gaillet","author_inst":"Health Centers Department, Cayenne Hospital Center"},{"author_name":"Celine Michaud","author_inst":"Health Centers Department, Cayenne Hospital Center"},{"author_name":"Veronique Servas","author_inst":"Health Centers Department, Cayenne Hospital Center"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Clement","author_inst":"Clinical Core of the Center for Translational Sciences, Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Anais Perilhou","author_inst":"Clinical Core of the Center for Translational Sciences, Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Thierry Carage","author_inst":"Carage Medical Biology Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Didier Musso","author_inst":"Laboratoires Eurofins Labazur Guyane"},{"author_name":"Jean-Francois Carod","author_inst":"Medical Biology laboratory, Centre Hospitalier Ouest Guyanais"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Eustache","author_inst":"Epidemiology unit, Institut Pasteur in French Guiana"},{"author_name":"Celine Tourbillon","author_inst":"Epidemiology unit, Institut Pasteur in French Guiana"},{"author_name":"Elodie Boizon","author_inst":"Epidemiology unit, Institut Pasteur in French Guiana"},{"author_name":"Samantha James","author_inst":"Epidemiolody unit, Institut Pasteur in French Guiana"},{"author_name":"Felix Djossou","author_inst":"Infectious and Tropical Diseases Unit, Cayenne Hospital Center"},{"author_name":"Henrik Salje","author_inst":"Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases Unit, Institut Pasteur, UMR2000, CNRS"},{"author_name":"Simon Cauchemez","author_inst":"Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases Unit, Institut Pasteur, UMR2000, CNRS"},{"author_name":"Dominique Rousset","author_inst":"Laboratory of Virology, Institut Pasteur in French Guiana"},{"author_name":"Ana F.

OBJECTIVES This study aimed to described the clinical outcomes and further explored risk factors of in-hospital death for COVID-19 classified as critical type. METHODS This was a single-center retrospective cohort study. From February 5, 2020 to March 4, 2020, 98 consecutive patients classified as critical COVID-19 were included in Huo Shen Shan Hospital. The final date of follow-up was March 29, 2020. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality during hospitalization. Multivariable Cox regression model was used to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. RESULTS Of the 98 patients, 43 (43.9%) died in hospital, 37(37.8%) discharged, and 18(18.4%) remained in hospital. The mean age was 68.5 (63, 75) years, and 57 (58.2%) were female. The most common comorbidity was hypertension (68.4%), followed by diabetes (17.3%), angina pectoris (13.3%). Except the sex (Female: 68.8% vs 49.1%, P=0.039) and angina pectoris (20.9% vs 7.3%, P = 0.048), there was no difference in other demographics and comorbidities between non-survivor and survivor groups. The proportion of elevated alanine aminotransferase, creatinine, D-dimer and cardiac injury marker were 59.4%, 35.7%, 87.5% and 42.9%, respectively, and all showed the significant difference between two groups. The acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury (AKI), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were observed in 42.9%, 27.8% and 26.5% of the patients. Compared with survivor group, non-survivor group had more acute cardiac injury (79.1% vs 14.5%, P<0.0001), AKI (50.0% vs 10.9%, P<0.0001), and ARDS (37.2% vs 18.2%, P=0.034). Multivariable Cox regression showed increasing hazard ratio of in-hospital death associated with acute cardiac injury (HR, 6.57 [95% CI, 1.89-22.79]) and AKI (HR, 2.60 [95% CI, 1.15-5.86]). CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 classified as critical type had a high prevalence of acute cardiac and kidney injury, which were associated with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fei Li","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, China"},{"author_name":"Yue Cai","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, China"},{"author_name":"Chao Gao","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, China"},{"author_name":"Lei Zhou","author_inst":"Clinical Laboratory, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, China"},{"author_name":"Renjuan Chen","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, China"},{"author_name":"Kan Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, China"},{"author_name":"Weiqin Li","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Jinling Hospital, Nanjing, China"},{"author_name":"Ruining Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, China"},{"author_name":"Xijing Zhang","author_inst":"Surgical ICU, Department of Anesthesiology, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, China"},{"author_name":"Duolao Wang","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yi Liu","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, China"},{"author_name":"Ling Tao","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, China"},{"author_name":"Jean-Francois Carod","author_inst":"Medical Biology laboratory, Centre Hospitalier Ouest Guyanais"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Eustache","author_inst":"Epidemiology unit, Institut Pasteur in French Guiana"},{"author_name":"Celine Tourbillon","author_inst":"Epidemiology unit, Institut Pasteur in French Guiana"},{"author_name":"Elodie Boizon","author_inst":"Epidemiology unit, Institut Pasteur in French Guiana"},{"author_name":"Samantha James","author_inst":"Epidemiolody unit, Institut Pasteur in French Guiana"},{"author_name":"Felix Djossou","author_inst":"Infectious and Tropical Diseases Unit, Cayenne Hospital Center"},{"author_name":"Henrik Salje","author_inst":"Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases Unit, Institut Pasteur, UMR2000, CNRS"},{"author_name":"Simon Cauchemez","author_inst":"Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases Unit, Institut Pasteur, UMR2000, CNRS"},{"author_name":"Dominique Rousset","author_inst":"Laboratory of Virology, Institut Pasteur in French Guiana"},{"author_name":"Ana F.

Objective: We aimed to investigate the clinical manifestation include signs and symptoms, laboratory results, and perinatal outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19. Materials and Methods: We searched PubMed via LitCovid hub, Embase, Scopus, Web of sciences, and Google scholar on 07 April 2020. Meta-analysis was performed via CMA software using the Mantel-Haenszel method. The event rate with 95% CI was calculated for each variable. Results: Ten studies were selected. The pooled prevalence for fever, post-partum fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue, dyspnea, sore throat, and diarrhea were 66.8 %, 37.1 %, 35.5 %, 24.6 %, 14.9%, 14.6 %, 11.5%, and 7.6 %, respectively. Laboratory test results were 49.8 % for lymphopenia, 47.7 % for leukocytosis, 83.7 % for elevated neutrophil ratio, 57 % for elevated C-reactive protein, and 71.4 % for decreased lymphocyte ratio. The rate of cesarean section for delivery in all cases was 84%. Only one case was the newborn of a mother with COVID-19 positive. Also, there was only one death due to Decreased lymphocyte ratio. Conclusion: Fever was the most common signs and symptoms in pregnant women with COVID-19. Among the laboratory tests, the highest amount was related to elevated neutrophil ratio. It seems that due to the differences between pregnant women and the general population, special measures should be considered to treat these patients.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Soheil Hassanipour","author_inst":"Gastrointestinal and Liver Diseases Research Center, Guilan University of Medical Sciences, Rasht, Iran."},{"author_name":"Saeed Bagheri Faradonbeh","author_inst":"Health Management and Economics Research Center, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."},{"author_name":"Khalil Momeni","author_inst":"Department of Public Health, Faculty of Health, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."},{"author_name":"Zahra Heidarifard","author_inst":"Msc of HTA, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."},{"author_name":"Mohammad-Javad Khosousi","author_inst":"Caspian Digestive Disease Research Center, Guilan University of Medical Sciences, Rasht, Iran."},{"author_name":"Leila Khosousi","author_inst":"Reproductive Health Research Center, Guilan University of Medical Sciences, Rasht, Iran."},{"author_name":"Hosein Ameri","author_inst":"Health Policy and Management Research Center, School of Public Health, Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences, Yazd, Iran."},{"author_name":"Morteza Arab-Zozani","author_inst":"Social Determinants of Health Research Center, Birjand University of Medical Sciences, Birjand, Iran."},{"author_name":"Xijing Zhang","author_inst":"Surgical ICU, Department of Anesthesiology, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, China"},{"author_name":"Duolao Wang","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yi Liu","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, China"},{"author_name":"Ling Tao","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, China"},{"author_name":"Jean-Francois Carod","author_inst":"Medical Biology laboratory, Centre Hospitalier Ouest Guyanais"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Eustache","author_inst":"Epidemiology unit, Institut Pasteur in French Guiana"},{"author_name":"Celine Tourbillon","author_inst":"Epidemiology unit, Institut Pasteur in French Guiana"},{"author_name":"Elodie Boizon","author_inst":"Epidemiology unit, Institut Pasteur in French Guiana"},{"author_name":"Samantha James","author_inst":"Epidemiolody unit, Institut Pasteur in French Guiana"},{"author_name":"Felix Djossou","author_inst":"Infectious and Tropical Diseases Unit, Cayenne Hospital Center"},{"author_name":"Henrik Salje","author_inst":"Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases Unit, Institut Pasteur, UMR2000, CNRS"},{"author_name":"Simon Cauchemez","author_inst":"Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases Unit, Institut Pasteur, UMR2000, CNRS"},{"author_name":"Dominique Rousset","author_inst":"Laboratory of Virology, Institut Pasteur in French Guiana"},{"author_name":"Ana F.

Eligible studies were randomised trials evaluating the effect of remdesivir versus placebo or no treatment. We conducted searches in the LOVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19, a system that maps PICO questions to a repository maintained through regular searches in electronic databases, preprint servers, trial registries and other resources relevant to COVID-19. All the searches covered the period until 25 August 2020. No date or language restrictions were applied. Two reviewers independently evaluated potentially eligible studies according to predefined selection criteria, and extracted data on study characteristics, methods, outcomes, and risk of bias, using a predesigned, standardised form. We performed meta-analyses using random-effect models and assessed overall certainty in evidence using the GRADE approach. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will resubmit it every time the conclusions change or whenever there are substantial updates. Results Our search strategy yielded 574 references. Finally, we included 3 randomised trials evaluating remdesivir in addition to standard care versus standard care alone. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of remdesivir on mortality (RR 0.7, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.05; very low certainty evidence) and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.24; very low certainty evidence). On the other hand, remdesivir likely results in a large reduction in the incidence of adverse effects in patients with COVID-19 (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.84; moderate certainty evidence). Conclusions The evidence is insufficient for the outcomes critical for making decisions about the role of remdesivir in the treatment of patients with COVID-19, so it is not possible to balance the potential benefits, if any, with the adverse effects and costs.

Complete blood count changes, including new cell activation parameters, from 982 confirmed COVID-19 adult patients from 11 European hospitals were retrospectively analysed for distinctive patterns based on age, gender, clinical severity, symptom duration and hospital days. The observed haemocytometric patterns formed the basis to develop a multi-haemocytometric-parameter prognostic score to predict, during the first three days after presentation, which patients will recover without ventilation or deteriorate within a two-week timeframe, needing intensive care or with fatal outcome. The prognostic score, with ROC curve AUC at baseline of 0.753 (95% CI 0.723-0.781) increasing to 0.875 (95% CI 0.806-0.926) on day 3, was superior to any individual parameter at distinguishing between clinical severity. Findings were confirmed in a validation cohort. Aim is that the score and haemocytometry results are simultaneously provided by analyser software, enabling wide applicability of the score as haemocytometry is commonly requested in COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joachim Linssen","author_inst":"Sysmex Europe GMBH, Hamburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Anthony Ermens","author_inst":"Amphia Hospital Breda, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Marvin Berrevoets","author_inst":"Elisabeth-Tweesteden Hospital Tilburg, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Michela Seghezzi","author_inst":"Hospital Papa Giovanni XXIII Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giulia Previtali","author_inst":"Hospital Papa Giovanni XXIII Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Simone van der Sar-van der Brugge","author_inst":"Amphia Hospital Breda, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Henk Russcher","author_inst":"Erasmus MC, University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Annelies Verbon","author_inst":"Erasmus MC, University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Judith M.E.P.

Among other results from these models has been the view that closing schools had little impact on infection rates in several countries1. We took a different approach. Making one assumption, we simply plotted cases, hospitalizations and deaths, on a log2 Y axis and a linear date-based X axis, and analyzed them using segmented regression, a powerful method that has largely been overlooked during this pandemic. Here we show that the data fit straight lines with correlation coefficients ranging from 92% - 99%, and that these lines broke at interesting intervals, revealing that school closings dropped infection rates in half, lockdowns dropped the rates 3 to 4 fold, and other actions (such as closing bars and mandating masks) brought the rates even further down. Hospitalizations and deaths paralleled cases, with lags of three to ten days. The graphs, which are easy to read, reveal changes in infection rates that are not obvious using other graphing methods, and have several implications for modeling and policy development during this and future pandemics. Overall, other than full lockdowns, three interventions had the most impact: closing schools, closing bars and wearing masks: a message easily understood by the public.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Polly Matzinger","author_inst":"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Jeff Skinner","author_inst":"LIG, NIAID, NIH"},{"author_name":"Marvin Berrevoets","author_inst":"Elisabeth-Tweesteden Hospital Tilburg, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Michela Seghezzi","author_inst":"Hospital Papa Giovanni XXIII Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giulia Previtali","author_inst":"Hospital Papa Giovanni XXIII Bergamo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Simone van der Sar-van der Brugge","author_inst":"Amphia Hospital Breda, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Henk Russcher","author_inst":"Erasmus MC, University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Annelies Verbon","author_inst":"Erasmus MC, University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Judith M.E.P.

All three deadly CoVs originated from bats, the natural hosts, and transmitted to humans via various intermediate animal reservoirs. Because there is currently no universal pan-Coronavirus vaccine available, two worst-case scenarios remain highly possible: (1) SARS-CoV-2 mutates and transforms into a seasonal \"flu-like\" global pandemic; and\/or (2) Other global COVID-like pandemics will emerge in the coming years, caused by yet another spillover of an unknown zoonotic bat-derived SARS-like Coronavirus (SL-CoV) into an unvaccinated human population. Determining the antigen and epitope landscapes that are conserved among human and animal Coronaviruses as well as the repertoire, phenotype and function of B cells and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that correlate with resistance seen in asymptomatic COVID-19 patients should inform in the development of pan-Coronavirus vaccines 1. In the present study, using several immuno-informatics and sequence alignment approaches, we identified several human B-cell, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes that are highly conserved in: (i) greater than 81,000 SARS-CoV-2 human strains identified to date in 190 countries on six continents; (ii) six circulating CoVs that caused previous human outbreaks of the \"Common Cold\"; (iii) five SL-CoVs isolated from bats; (iv) five SL-CoV isolated from pangolins; (v) three SL-CoVs isolated from Civet Cats; and (vi) four MERS strains isolated from camels. Furthermore, we identified cross-reactive asymptomatic epitopes that: (i) recalled B cell, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses from both asymptomatic COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals who were never exposed to SARS-CoV-2; and (ii) induced strong B cell and T cell responses in \"humanized\" Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-DR\/HLA-A*02:01 double transgenic mice. The findings herein pave the way to develop a pre-emptive multi-epitope pan-Coronavirus vaccine to protect against past, current, and potential future outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Swayam Prakash","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Srivastava Ruchi","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Pierre-Gregoire Coulon","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Nisha R Dhanushkodi","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Aziz A Chentoufi","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Delia F Tifrea","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Robert A Edwards","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Cesar J Figueroa","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Sebastian D Schubl","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Lanny, Hsieh","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Michael J Buchmeier","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Bouziane","author_inst":"Sunomix Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Anthony B Nesburn","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Baruch D Kuppermann","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Lbachir BenMohamed","author_inst":"UC Irvine, School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Volkher Scharnhorst","author_inst":"Catharina Hospital Eindhoven, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Heidi Ammerlaan","author_inst":"Catharina Hospital Eindhoven, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Kathleen Deiteren","author_inst":"University Hospital Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Stephan J.L.

Potent drugs for the treatment of severe SARS-CoV-2 infections are not yet available. To identify host factors that support coronavirus infection, we performed genome-wide functional genetic screens with SARS-CoV-2 and the common cold virus HCoV-229E in non-transgenic human cells. These screens identified PI3K type 3 as a potential drug target against multiple coronaviruses. We discovered that the lysosomal protein TMEM106B is an important host factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, we show that TMEM106B is required for replication in multiple human cell lines derived from liver and lung and is expressed in relevant cell types in the human airways. Our results identify new coronavirus host factors that may potentially serve as drug targets against SARS-CoV-2 or to quickly combat future zoonotic coronavirus outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jim Baggen","author_inst":"KU Leuven Rega institute"},{"author_name":"Leentje Persoons","author_inst":"KU Leuven Rega institute"},{"author_name":"Sander Jansen","author_inst":"KU Leuven Rega institute"},{"author_name":"Els Vanstreels","author_inst":"KU Leuven Rega institute"},{"author_name":"Maarten Jacquemyn","author_inst":"KU Leuven Rega institute"},{"author_name":"Dirk Jochmans","author_inst":"KU Leuven Rega institute"},{"author_name":"Johan Neyts","author_inst":"KU Leuven Rega institute"},{"author_name":"Kai Dallmeier","author_inst":"KU Leuven Rega institute"},{"author_name":"Piet Maes","author_inst":"KU Leuven, Rega institute"},{"author_name":"Dirk Daelemans","author_inst":"KU Leuven Rega institute"},{"author_name":"Michael J Buchmeier","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Bouziane","author_inst":"Sunomix Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Anthony B Nesburn","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Baruch D Kuppermann","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Lbachir BenMohamed","author_inst":"UC Irvine, School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Volkher Scharnhorst","author_inst":"Catharina Hospital Eindhoven, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Heidi Ammerlaan","author_inst":"Catharina Hospital Eindhoven, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Kathleen Deiteren","author_inst":"University Hospital Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Stephan J.L.

The authors suggest that, in the setting of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to severe COVID-19, a \"differentiation bridge from plasmablasts to developing neutrophils\" connected these distantly related cell types. This conclusion is controversial as it appears to violate several basic principles in cell biology relating to cell lineage identity and fidelity. Correctly classifying cells and their developmental history is an important issue in cell biology and we suggest that this conclusion is not supported by the data as we show here that: (1) regressing out covariates such as unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) can lead to overfitting; and (2) that UMAP embeddings may reflect the expression of similar genes but not necessarily direct cell lineage relationships.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jose Alquicira-Hernandez","author_inst":"Garvan Institute of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Joseph Powell","author_inst":"Garvan-Weizmann Centre for Cellular Genomics"},{"author_name":"Tri Giang Phan","author_inst":"Garvan Institute of Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Els Vanstreels","author_inst":"KU Leuven Rega institute"},{"author_name":"Maarten Jacquemyn","author_inst":"KU Leuven Rega institute"},{"author_name":"Dirk Jochmans","author_inst":"KU Leuven Rega institute"},{"author_name":"Johan Neyts","author_inst":"KU Leuven Rega institute"},{"author_name":"Kai Dallmeier","author_inst":"KU Leuven Rega institute"},{"author_name":"Piet Maes","author_inst":"KU Leuven, Rega institute"},{"author_name":"Dirk Daelemans","author_inst":"KU Leuven Rega institute"},{"author_name":"Michael J Buchmeier","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Bouziane","author_inst":"Sunomix Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Anthony B Nesburn","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Baruch D Kuppermann","author_inst":"University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Lbachir BenMohamed","author_inst":"UC Irvine, School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Volkher Scharnhorst","author_inst":"Catharina Hospital Eindhoven, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Heidi Ammerlaan","author_inst":"Catharina Hospital Eindhoven, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Kathleen Deiteren","author_inst":"University Hospital Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Stephan J.L.

However, because the viral phylogeny is already so large - and will undoubtedly grow many fold - placing new sequences onto the tree has emerged as a barrier to real-time genomic contact tracing. Here, we resolve this challenge by building an efficient, tree-based data structure encoding the inferred evolutionary history of the virus. We demonstrate that our approach improves the speed of phylogenetic placement of new samples and data visualization by orders of magnitude, making it possible to complete the placements under real-time constraints. Our method also provides the key ingredient for maintaining a fully-updated reference phylogeny. We make these tools available to the research community through the UCSC SARS-CoV-2 Genome Browser to enable rapid cross-referencing of information in new virus sequences with an ever-expanding array of molecular and structural biology data.

SARS-CoV-2 attaches to human host cells through interaction of its receptor binding domain (RBD) located on the viral Spike (S) glycoprotein with angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) on the surface of host cells. RBD binding to ACE2 is a critical first step in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Viral attachment occurs in dynamic environments where forces act on the binding partners and multivalent interactions play central roles, creating an urgent need for assays that can quantitate SARS-CoV-2 interactions with ACE2 under mechanical load and in defined geometries. Here, we introduce a tethered ligand assay that comprises the RBD and the ACE2 ectodomain joined by a flexible peptide linker. Using specific molecular handles, we tether the fusion proteins between a functionalized flow cell surface and magnetic beads in magnetic tweezers. We observe repeated interactions of RBD and ACE2 under constant loads and can fully quantify the force dependence and kinetics of the binding interaction. Our results suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 ACE2 interaction has higher mechanical stability, a larger free energy of binding, and a lower off-rate than that of SARS-CoV-1, the causative agents of the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak. In the absence of force, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD rapidly (within [&le;]1 ms) engages the ACE2 receptor if held in close proximity and remains bound to ACE2 for 400-800 s, much longer than what has been reported for other viruses engaging their cellular receptors. We anticipate that our assay will be a powerful tool investigate the roles of mutations in the RBD that might alter the infectivity of the virus and to test the modes of action of neutralizing antibodies and other agents designed to block RBD binding to ACE2 that are currently developed as potential COVID-19 therapeutics.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Magnus S.

We report here on the use of a naive phage display antibody library to identify a panel of fully human SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Following functional profiling in vitro against an early pandemic isolate as well as a recently emerged isolate bearing the D614G Spike mutation, the clinical candidate antibody, STI-1499, and the affinity-engineered variant, STI-2020, were evaluated for in vivo efficacy in the Syrian golden hamster model of COVID-19. Both antibodies demonstrated potent protection against the pathogenic effects of the disease and a dose-dependent reduction of virus load in the lungs, reaching undetectable levels following a single dose of 500 micrograms of STI-2020. These data support continued development of these antibodies as therapeutics against COVID-19 and future use of this approach to address novel emerging pandemic disease threats.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xia Cao","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Junki Maruyama","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch, Department of Pathology, Galveston National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Heyue Zhou","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Lisa Kerwin","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Rachel Sattler","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch, Department of Pathology, Galveston National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"John T Manning","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch, Department of Pathology, Galveston National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Sachi Johnson","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Susan Richards","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Yan Li","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Weiqun Shen","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Benjamin Blair","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Na Du","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Kyndal Morais","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Kate Lawrence","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Lucy Lu","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Chin-I Pai","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Donghui Li","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Mark Brunswick","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Yanliang Zhang","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Henry Ji","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Slobodan Paessler","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch, Department of Pathology, Galveston National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Robert D Allen","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Andre van der Ven","author_inst":"Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Luciana C.

We perform shotgun transcriptome sequencing of human RNA obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs of patients with COVID-19, and identify a molecular signature associated with disease severity. Specifically, we identify globally dysregulated immune related pathways, such as cytokine-cytokine receptor signaling, complement and coagulation cascades, JAK-STAT, and TGF-{beta} signaling pathways in all, though to a higher extent in patients with severe symptoms. The excessive release of cytokines and chemokines such as CCL2, CCL22, CXCL9 and CXCL12 and certain interferons and interleukins related genes like IFIH1, IFI44, IFIT1 and IL10 were significantly higher in patients with severe clinical presentation compared to mild and moderate presentations. Moreover, early induction of the TGF-{beta} signaling pathway might be the primary cause of pulmonary fibrosis in patients with severe disease. Differential gene expression analysis identified a small set of regulatory genes that might act as strong predictors of patient outcome. Our data suggest that rapid transcriptome analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs can be a powerful approach to quantify host molecular response and may provide valuable insights into COVID-19 pathophysiology.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammed Uddin","author_inst":"Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Tom Loney","author_inst":"Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Norbert Nowotny","author_inst":"Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hanan Alsuwaidi","author_inst":"Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Rupa Varghese","author_inst":"Dubai Health Authority"},{"author_name":"Zulfa Deesi","author_inst":"Dubai Health Authority"},{"author_name":"Abdulmajeed Alkhajeh","author_inst":"Dubai Health Authority"},{"author_name":"Hamda Khansaheb","author_inst":"Dubai Health Authority"},{"author_name":"Alawi Alsheikh-Ali","author_inst":"Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Weiqun Shen","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Benjamin Blair","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Na Du","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Kyndal Morais","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Kate Lawrence","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Lucy Lu","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Chin-I Pai","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Donghui Li","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Mark Brunswick","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Yanliang Zhang","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Henry Ji","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Slobodan Paessler","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch, Department of Pathology, Galveston National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Robert D Allen","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Andre van der Ven","author_inst":"Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Luciana C.

Nevertheless, stable and homogeneous sample preparation is one of the bottlenecks in biophysical and pharmacological studies of membrane proteins because membrane proteins are typically unstable and poorly expressed. To overcome such obstacles, GFP fusion-based Fluorescence-detection Size-Exclusion Chromatography (FSEC) has been widely employed for membrane protein expression screening for over a decade. However, fused GFP itself may occasionally affect the expression and\/or stability of the targeted membrane protein, leading to both false-positive and false-negative results in expression screening. Furthermore, GFP fusion technology is not well suited for some membrane proteins depending on their membrane topology. Here, we developed an FSEC assay utilizing nanobody (Nb) technology, named FSEC-Nb, in which targeted membrane proteins are fused to a small peptide tag and recombinantly expressed. The whole-cell extracts are solubilized, mixed with anti-peptide Nb fused to GFP and applied to a size-exclusion chromatography column attached to a fluorescence detector for FSEC analysis. FSEC-Nb enables one to evaluate the expression, monodispersity and thermostability of membrane proteins without the need of purification by utilizing the benefits of the GFP fusion-based FSEC method, but does not require direct GFP fusion to targeted proteins. We applied FSEC-Nb to screen zinc-activated ion channel (ZAC) family proteins in the Cys-loop superfamily and membrane proteins from SARS-CoV-2 as examples of the practical application of FSEC-Nb. We successfully identified a ZAC ortholog with high monodispersity but moderate expression levels that could not be identified with the previously developed GFP fusion-free FSEC method. Consistent with the results of FSEC-Nb screening, the purified ZAC ortholog showed monodispersed particles by both negative staining EM and cryo-EM. Furthermore, we identified two membrane proteins from SARS-CoV-2 with high monodispersity and expression level by FSEC-Nb, which may facilitate structural and functional studies of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, our results show FSEC-Nb as a powerful tool for membrane protein expression screening that can provide further opportunity to prepare well-behaved membrane proteins for structural and functional studies.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fei Jin","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yao Wang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Mengqi Wang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Minxuan Sun","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Motoyuki Hattori","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zulfa Deesi","author_inst":"Dubai Health Authority"},{"author_name":"Abdulmajeed Alkhajeh","author_inst":"Dubai Health Authority"},{"author_name":"Hamda Khansaheb","author_inst":"Dubai Health Authority"},{"author_name":"Alawi Alsheikh-Ali","author_inst":"Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Weiqun Shen","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Benjamin Blair","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Na Du","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Kyndal Morais","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Kate Lawrence","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Lucy Lu","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Chin-I Pai","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Donghui Li","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Mark Brunswick","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Yanliang Zhang","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Henry Ji","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Slobodan Paessler","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch, Department of Pathology, Galveston National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Robert D Allen","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Andre van der Ven","author_inst":"Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Luciana C.

The spike glycoprotein on the surface of coronavirus mediates its entry into host cells and is the target of all current antibody design efforts to neutralize the virus. The glycan shield of the spike helps the virus to evade the human immune response by providing a thick sugar-coated barrier against any antibody. To study the dynamic motion of glycans in the spike protein, we performed microsecond-long MD simulation in two different states that correspond to the receptor binding domain in open or closed conformations. Analysis of this microsecond-long simulation revealed a scissoring motion on the N-terminal domain of neighboring monomers in the spike trimer. Role of multiple glycans in shielding of spike protein in different regions were uncovered by a network analysis, where the high betweenness centrality of glycans at the apex revealed their importance and function in the glycan shield. Microdomains of glycans were identified featuring a high degree of intra-communication in these microdomains. An antibody overlap analysis revealed the glycan microdomains as well as individual glycans that inhibit access to the antibody epitopes on the spike protein. Overall, the results of this study provide detailed understanding of the spike glycan shield, which may be utilized for therapeutic efforts against this crisis.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mahdi Ghorbani","author_inst":"University of Maryland"},{"author_name":"Bernie R Brooks","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health\/NHLBI"},{"author_name":"Jeffery B.

It was reported that HCQ induced psychiatric symptoms in a few patients with autoimmune diseases, but it is still uncertain whether HCQ poses a risk to mental health. Therefore, in this study, we treated healthy mice with two different doses of HCQ that are comparable to clinically administered doses for 7 days. Psychiatric-like behaviors and the expression of related molecules in the brain were evaluated at two time points, i.e., 24 h and 10 days after drug administration. We found that HCQ increased anxiety behavior at both 24 h and 10 days and enhanced depressive behavior at 24 h. Furthermore, HCQ decreased the mRNA expression of interleukin-1beta and corticotropin-releasing hormone (Crh) in the hippocampus and decreased the mRNA expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) in both the hippocampus and amygdala. Most of these behavioral and molecular changes were sustained beyond 10 days after drug administration, and some of them were dose-dependent. Although this animal study does not prove that HCQ has a similar effect in humans, it indicates that HCQ poses a significant risk to mental health and suggests that further clinical investigation is essential. According to our data, we recommend that HCQ be carefully used as a prophylactic drug in people who are susceptible to mental disorders.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hang Xu","author_inst":"Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Science"},{"author_name":"Xiangyang Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Science"},{"author_name":"Weiwen Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Science"},{"author_name":"Jiesi Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Science"},{"author_name":"Motoyuki Hattori","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zulfa Deesi","author_inst":"Dubai Health Authority"},{"author_name":"Abdulmajeed Alkhajeh","author_inst":"Dubai Health Authority"},{"author_name":"Hamda Khansaheb","author_inst":"Dubai Health Authority"},{"author_name":"Alawi Alsheikh-Ali","author_inst":"Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Weiqun Shen","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Benjamin Blair","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Na Du","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Kyndal Morais","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Kate Lawrence","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Lucy Lu","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Chin-I Pai","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Donghui Li","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Mark Brunswick","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Yanliang Zhang","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Henry Ji","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Slobodan Paessler","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch, Department of Pathology, Galveston National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Robert D Allen","author_inst":"Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc."},{"author_name":"Andre van der Ven","author_inst":"Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Luciana C.
