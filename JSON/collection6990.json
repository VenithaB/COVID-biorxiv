Fundamental to the design of rapid state reactions is the ability to perform epidemiological model parameter inference for localised trajectory predictions. In this work, we perform Bayesian parameter inference using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods on the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) and Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) epidemiological models with time-varying spreading rates for South Africa. The results find two change points in the spreading rate of COVID-19 in South Africa as inferred from the confirmed cases. The first change point coincides with state enactment of a travel ban and the resultant containment of imported infections. The second change point coincides with the start of a state-led mass screening and testing programme which has highlighted community-level disease spread that was not well represented in the initial largely traveller based and private laboratory dominated testing data. The results further suggest that due to the likely effect of the national lockdown, community level transmissions are slower than the original imported case driven spread of the disease.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rendani Mbuvha","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Tshilidzi Marwala","author_inst":"University of Johannesburg"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.28.20083865","rel_title":"Fractional SIR Epidemiological Models","rel_date":"2020-04-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.28.20083865","rel_abs":"The purpose of this work is to make a case for epidemiological models with fractional exponent in the contribution of sub-populations to the transmission rate. More specifically, we question the standard assumption in the literature on epidemiological models, where the transmission rate dictating propagation of infections is taken to be proportional to the product between the infected and susceptible sub-populations; a model that relies on strong mixing between the two groups and widespread contact between members of the groups. We content, that contact between infected and susceptible individuals, especially during the early phases of an epidemic, takes place over a (possibly diffused) boundary between the respective sub-populations. As a result, the rate of transmission depends on the product of fractional powers instead. The intuition relies on the fact that infection grows in geographically concentrated cells, in contrast to the standard product model that relies on complete mixing of the susceptible to infected sub-populations. We validate the hypothesis of fractional exponents i) by numerical simulation for disease propagation in graphs imposing a local structure to allowed disease transmissions and ii) by fitting the model to a COVID-19 data set provided by John Hopkins University (JHUCSSE) for the period Jan-31-20 to Mar-24-20, for the countries of Italy, Germany, Iran, and France.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amirhossein Taghvaei","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Tryphon T.

To this end, we conducted a deep-dive analysis into this problem using a recently curated public dataset on covid-19 that connects infection spread over time to a rich collection of contextual determinants for all counties of the U.S and Washington, D.C. Using random forest machine learning methodology, we identified a relevant constellation of contextual factors of disease spread which manifest differently for urban and rural counties.

Every successful strategy in controlling SARS-CoV2 infection depends on the timely viral diagnosis which should include asymptomatic carriers. Consequently, strategies to increase the throughput for clinical laboratories to conduct large-scale diagnostic testing are urgently needed. Here we support the hypothesis that standard diagnostic protocol for SARS-CoV-2 virus could be conveniently applied to pooled samples obtained from different subjects. We suggest that a two-step sequential pooling procedure could identify positive subjects, ensuring at the same time significant benefits of costs and time. Simulation data are used to assess the efficiency, in terms of number of required tests, both for random assignment of the subjects to the pools and for situations when epidemiological and clinical data are used to create an \"informed\" version of the pooling. Different scenarios are examined in the simulations to measure the effect of different pool sizes and different values for the virus frequency.

Few African countries have reported case numbers above one thousand, with South Africa reporting 3,034 cases being hit hardest in Sub-Saharan Africa. Several African countries, especially South Africa, have already taken strong non-pharmaceutical interventions that include physical distancing, restricted economic, educational and leisure activities and reduced human mobility options. The required strengths and overall effectiveness of such interventions, however, are debated because of simultaneous but opposing interests in most African countries: strongly limited health care capacities and testing capabilities largely conflict with pressured national economies and socio-economic hardships on the individual level, limiting compliance to intervention targets. Here we investigate implications of interventions on the COVID-19 outbreak dynamics, focusing on South Africa before and after the national lockdown enacted on March 27, 2020. Our analysis shows that initial exponential growth of existing case numbers is consistent with doubling times of about 2.5 days. After lockdown, the growth remains exponential, now with doubling times of 18 days, but still in contrast to subexponential growth reported for Hubei\/China after lockdown. Moreover, a scenario analysis of a computational data-driven agent based mobility model for the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality (with 1.14 million inhabitants) hints that keeping current levels of intervention measures and compliance until the end of April is of insufficient length and still too weak, too unspecific or too inconsistently complied with to not overload local intensive care capacity. Yet, enduring, slightly stronger, more specific interventions combined with sufficient compliance may constitute a viable option for interventions for regions in South Africa and potentially for large parts of the African continent and the Global South.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Malte Schr\u00f6der","author_inst":"Chair for Network Dynamics, TU Dresden"},{"author_name":"Andreas Bossert","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization"},{"author_name":"Moritz Kersting","author_inst":"Georg August University G\u00f6ttingen"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Aeffner","author_inst":"University Medical Center G&oumlttingen"},{"author_name":"Justin Coetzee","author_inst":"GoMetro, Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Marc Timme","author_inst":"Chair for Network Dynamics, TU Dresden"},{"author_name":"Jan Schl\u00fcter","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.24.20078287","rel_title":"The reproductive index from SEIR model of Covid-19 epidemic in Asean","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.24.20078287","rel_abs":"As we calculate analytic to link the coefficient of third-order polynomial equations from raw data of an Asean to the SEIR model.

In this paper, we propose an extension of the epidemiological SEIR model to enable a detailed analysis of commonly discussed tailored measures of epidemic control - among them group-specific protection and the use of tracing apps. We introduce groups into the SEIR model that may differ both, in their underlying parameters as well as in their behavioral response to public health interventions. We allow for different infectiousness parameters within and across groups, different asymptomatic, hospitalization, and lethality rates, as well as different take-up rates of tracing apps. Our results visualize the sharp trade-offs between different goals of epidemic control, namely a low death toll, avoiding overload of the health system, and a short duration of the epidemic. We show that a combination of tailored mechanisms, e.g., the protection of vulnerable groups together with a \"trace & isolate\" approach, can be effective in preventing a high death toll. Protection of vulnerable groups without further measures requires unrealistically strict isolation. A key insight is that high compliance is critical for the effectiveness of a \"trace & isolate\" approach. Our model allows to analyze the interplay of group-specific social distancing and tracing also beyond our case study in scenarios with a large number of groups reflecting, e.g., sectoral, regional, or age differentiation and group-specific take-up rates for tracing apps.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Veronika Grimm","author_inst":"Friedrich-Alexander-Universitaet Erlangen-Nuernberg"},{"author_name":"Friederike Mengel","author_inst":"University of Essex"},{"author_name":"Martin Schmidt","author_inst":"Trier University"},{"author_name":"Chatcharawan Meesubthong","author_inst":"Faculty of Business Administration, Huachiew Chalermprakiet University, Samutprakan province, 10540, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Justin Coetzee","author_inst":"GoMetro, Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Marc Timme","author_inst":"Chair for Network Dynamics, TU Dresden"},{"author_name":"Jan Schl\u00fcter","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.24.20078238","rel_title":"Countries are Clustered but Number of Tests is not Vital to Predict Global COVID-19 Confirmed Cases: A Machine Learning Approach","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.24.20078238","rel_abs":"COVID-19 disease is a global pandemic and it appears as pandemic for each and every nation and territory in the earth.This paper focusses on analysing the global COVID-19 data by popular machine learning techniques to know which covariates are importantly associated with the cumulative number of confirmed cases, whether the countries are clustered with respect to the covariates considered, whether the variation in the covariates are explained by any latent factor. Regression tree, cluster analysis and principal component analysis are implemented to global COVID-19 data of 133 countries obtained from the Worldometer website as reported as on April 17, 2020. Our results suggest that there are four major clusters among the countries. First cluster consists of 8 countries where cumulative infected cases and deaths are highest. It is also revealed that there are two principal components. The countries which play vital role to explain the 60\\% variation of the total variations by the first component characterized by all variables except the rate variables include USA, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, UK, and Iran. Remaining countries contribute to explaining 20\\% variation of the total variations by the second component characterized by only three rate variables. We also found that the number of tests by the country variable among other variables country, number of active cases, number of deaths, number of recovered patients, number of serious cases, and number of new cases is an unimportant variable to predict cumulative number of confirmed cases. Hence, the number of tests might play vital role to individual country level who are in the primary level of virus spread but not to the global level.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hasinur Rahaman Khan","author_inst":"University of Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Ahmed Hossain","author_inst":"North South University, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Martin Schmidt","author_inst":"Trier University"},{"author_name":"Chatcharawan Meesubthong","author_inst":"Faculty of Business Administration, Huachiew Chalermprakiet University, Samutprakan province, 10540, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Justin Coetzee","author_inst":"GoMetro, Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Marc Timme","author_inst":"Chair for Network Dynamics, TU Dresden"},{"author_name":"Jan Schl\u00fcter","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.24.20078147","rel_title":"Variation of positiveness to enhance testing of specimens during an epidemic","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.24.20078147","rel_abs":"Rapid testing of appropriate specimens from patients suspected for a disease during an epidemic, such as the current Coronavirus outbreak, is of a great importance for the disease management and control.

We aimed to evaluate NEWS2 for severe COVID outcome and identify and validate a set of routinely-collected blood and physiological parameters taken at hospital admission to improve the score. Methods: Training cohorts comprised 1276 patients admitted to King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust with COVID-19 disease from 1st March to 30th April 2020. External validation cohorts included 5037 patients from four UK NHS Trusts (Guys and St Thomas' Hospitals, University Hospitals Southampton, University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust, University College London Hospitals), and two hospitals in Wuhan, China (Wuhan Sixth Hospital and Taikang Tongji Hospital). The outcome was severe COVID disease (transfer to intensive care unit or death) at 14 days after hospital admission. Age, physiological measures, blood biomarkers, sex, ethnicity and comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular, respiratory and kidney diseases) measured at hospital admission were considered in the models. Results: A baseline model of 'NEWS2 + age' had poor-to-moderate discrimination for severe COVID infection at 14 days (AUC in training sample = 0.700; 95% CI: 0.680, 0.722; Brier score = 0.192; 95% CI: 0.186, 0.197). A supplemented model adding eight routinely-collected blood and physiological parameters (supplemental oxygen flow rate, urea, age, oxygen saturation, CRP, estimated GFR, neutrophil count, neutrophil\/lymphocyte ratio) improved discrimination (AUC = 0.735; 95% CI: 0.715, 0.757) and these improvements were replicated across five UK and non-UK sites. However, there was evidence of miscalibration with the model tending to underestimate risks in most sites. Conclusions: NEWS2 score had poor-to-moderate discrimination for medium-term COVID outcome which raises questions about its use as a screening tool at hospital admission. Risk stratification was improved by including readily available blood and physiological parameters measured at hospital admission, but there was evidence of miscalibration in external sites. This highlights the need for a better understanding of the use of early warning scores for COVID.","rel_num_authors":39,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ewan Carr","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Bendayan","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Daniel Bean","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Matthew Stammers","author_inst":"Clinical Informatics Research Unit, University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Wenjuan Wang","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Huayu Zhang","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Thomas Searle","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Zeljko Kraljevic","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Anthony Shek","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Hang T T Phan","author_inst":"Clinical Informatics Research Unit, University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Walter Muruet","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rishi K Gupta","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Anthony J Shinton","author_inst":"UHS Digital, University Hospital Southampton"},{"author_name":"Mike Wyatt","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Ting Shi","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Xin Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, People's Liberation Army Joint Logistic Support Force 920th Hospital, Yunnan, China"},{"author_name":"Andrew Pickles","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Daniel Stahl","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rosita Zakeri","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Mahdad Noursadeghi","author_inst":"UCL Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Kevin O'Gallagher","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Matt Rogers","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, U.K."},{"author_name":"Amos Folarin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Christopher Bourdeaux","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, U.K."},{"author_name":"Chris McWilliams","author_inst":"Department of Engineering Mathematics, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Lukasz Roguski","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Florina Borca","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"James Batchelor","author_inst":"Clinical Informatics Research Unit, University of Southampton, Coxford Rd, Southampton SO16 5AF"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Wu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Jiaxing Sun","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Ashwin Pinto","author_inst":"UHS Digital, University Hospital Southampton"},{"author_name":"Bruce Guthrie","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Cormac Breen","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Abdel Douiri","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Honghan Wu","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Vasa Curcin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"James T Teo","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ajay Shah","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Richard Dobson","author_inst":"Kings College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.24.20077933","rel_title":"Comprehensive Investigation and Isolation have Effectively Suppressed the Spread of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.24.20077933","rel_abs":"The outbreak of COVID-19 since Dec. 2019 has caused severe life and economic damage worldwide, many countries are trapped by medical resource constraints or absence of targeted therapeutics, and therefore the implement of systemic policies to block this pandemic should be prioritized.

Statistic evidences strongly suggest that society should take such forceful public health interventions to cut the infection channels in the initial stage until the pandemic is interrupted.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yubo Huang","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiao Tong university"},{"author_name":"Weidong Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Daniel Bean","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Matthew Stammers","author_inst":"Clinical Informatics Research Unit, University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Wenjuan Wang","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Huayu Zhang","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Thomas Searle","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Zeljko Kraljevic","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Anthony Shek","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Hang T T Phan","author_inst":"Clinical Informatics Research Unit, University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Walter Muruet","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rishi K Gupta","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Anthony J Shinton","author_inst":"UHS Digital, University Hospital Southampton"},{"author_name":"Mike Wyatt","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Ting Shi","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Xin Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, People's Liberation Army Joint Logistic Support Force 920th Hospital, Yunnan, China"},{"author_name":"Andrew Pickles","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Daniel Stahl","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rosita Zakeri","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Mahdad Noursadeghi","author_inst":"UCL Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Kevin O'Gallagher","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Matt Rogers","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, U.K."},{"author_name":"Amos Folarin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Christopher Bourdeaux","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, U.K."},{"author_name":"Chris McWilliams","author_inst":"Department of Engineering Mathematics, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Lukasz Roguski","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Florina Borca","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"James Batchelor","author_inst":"Clinical Informatics Research Unit, University of Southampton, Coxford Rd, Southampton SO16 5AF"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Wu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Jiaxing Sun","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Ashwin Pinto","author_inst":"UHS Digital, University Hospital Southampton"},{"author_name":"Bruce Guthrie","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Cormac Breen","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Abdel Douiri","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Honghan Wu","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Vasa Curcin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"James T Teo","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ajay Shah","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Richard Dobson","author_inst":"Kings College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.25.20077842","rel_title":"The values of coagulation function in COVID-19 patients","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.25.20077842","rel_abs":"Objective: To investigate the blood coagulation function in COVID-19 patients, and the correlation between coagulopathy and disease severity. Methods: We retrospectively collected 147 clinically diagnosed COVID-19 patients at Wuhan Leishenshan Hospital of Hubei, China. We analyzed the coagulation function in COVID-19 patients through the data including thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), 2-plasmininhibitor-plasmin Complex (PIC), thrombomodulin (TM), t-PA\/PAI-1 Complex (t-PAIC), prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen (FIB), thrombin time (TT), D-Dimer (DD), and platelet (PLT). Result: The levels of TAT, PIC, TM, t-PAIC, PT, INR, FIB, and DD in COVID-19 patients were higher than health controls (p<0.05), and also higher in the patients with thrombotic disease than without thrombotic disease (p<0.05). What's more, the patients with thrombotic disease had a higher case-fatality (p<0.05). TAT, PIC, TM, t-PAIC, PT, INR, APTT, FIB, DD, and PLT were also found correlated with disease severity. Meanwhile, we found that there were significant difference in TAT, TM, t-PAIC, PT, INR, APTT, DD, and PLT in the death and survival group. Further using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis also found that t-PAIC and DD were independent risk factors for death in patients and are excellent predicting the mortality risk of COVID-19. Conclusion: The coagulation systems in COVID-19 patients are inordinate, and dynamic monitoring of them, might be a key in the control of COVID-19 death.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xin Jin","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yongwei Duan","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Tengfei Bao","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Junjuan Gu","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yawen Chen","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yuanyuan Li","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Wuhan hospital of traditional Chinese Medicine,Hubei,China"},{"author_name":"Shi Mao","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Wuhan Third Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yongfeng Chen","author_inst":"Medical management department, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Wen Xie","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Hang T T Phan","author_inst":"Clinical Informatics Research Unit, University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Walter Muruet","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rishi K Gupta","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Anthony J Shinton","author_inst":"UHS Digital, University Hospital Southampton"},{"author_name":"Mike Wyatt","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Ting Shi","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Xin Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, People's Liberation Army Joint Logistic Support Force 920th Hospital, Yunnan, China"},{"author_name":"Andrew Pickles","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Daniel Stahl","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rosita Zakeri","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Mahdad Noursadeghi","author_inst":"UCL Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Kevin O'Gallagher","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Matt Rogers","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, U.K."},{"author_name":"Amos Folarin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Christopher Bourdeaux","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, U.K."},{"author_name":"Chris McWilliams","author_inst":"Department of Engineering Mathematics, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Lukasz Roguski","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Florina Borca","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"James Batchelor","author_inst":"Clinical Informatics Research Unit, University of Southampton, Coxford Rd, Southampton SO16 5AF"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Wu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Jiaxing Sun","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Ashwin Pinto","author_inst":"UHS Digital, University Hospital Southampton"},{"author_name":"Bruce Guthrie","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Cormac Breen","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Abdel Douiri","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Honghan Wu","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Vasa Curcin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"James T Teo","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ajay Shah","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Richard Dobson","author_inst":"Kings College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.24.20078105","rel_title":"A Nationwide Survey of UK cardiac surgeons view on clinical decision making during the COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.24.20078105","rel_abs":"Background: No firm recommendations are currently available to guide decision making for patients requiring cardiac surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Systematic appraisal of national expert consensus can be used to generate interim recommendations until data from clinical observations will become available. Hence, we aimed to collect and quantitatively appraise nationwide UK senior surgeons opinion on clinical decision making for patients requiring cardiac surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We mailed a web-based questionnaire to all consultant cardiac surgeons through the Society for Cardiothoracic Surgery in Great Britain and Ireland (SCTS) mailing list on the 17th April 2020 and we pre-determined to close the survey on the 21st April 2020. This survey was primarily designed to gather information on UK surgeons opinion using 12 items. Strong consensus was predefined as an opinion shared by at least 60% of responding consultants. Results: A total of 86 consultant surgeons undertook the survey. All UK cardiac units were represented by at least one consultant. Strong consensus was achieved for the following key questions:1) before hospital admission every patient should receive nasopharyngeal swab, PCR and chest CT; 2) the use of full PPE should to be adopted in every case by the theatre team regardless patients COVID-19 status; 3) the risk of COVID-19 exposure for patients undergoing heart surgery should be considered moderate to high and likely to increase mortality if it occurs; 4) cardiac procedure should be decided based on ad-hoc multidisciplinary team discussion for every patient. The majority believed that both aortic and mitral surgery should be considered in selected cases. The role of CABG surgery during the pandemic was more controversial. Conclusions: In the current unprecedented scenario, the present survey provides information for generating interim recommendations until data from clinical observations will become available.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Umberto Benedetto","author_inst":"Bristol Heart Institute, University Hospitals bristol NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Andrew Goodwin","author_inst":"South Tees Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Simon Kendall","author_inst":"South Tees Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Rakesh Uppal","author_inst":"Barts Health NHS Turst"},{"author_name":"Enoch Akowuah","author_inst":"South Tees Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Yuanyuan Li","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Wuhan hospital of traditional Chinese Medicine,Hubei,China"},{"author_name":"Shi Mao","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Wuhan Third Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yongfeng Chen","author_inst":"Medical management department, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Wen Xie","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Hang T T Phan","author_inst":"Clinical Informatics Research Unit, University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Walter Muruet","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rishi K Gupta","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Anthony J Shinton","author_inst":"UHS Digital, University Hospital Southampton"},{"author_name":"Mike Wyatt","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Ting Shi","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Xin Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, People's Liberation Army Joint Logistic Support Force 920th Hospital, Yunnan, China"},{"author_name":"Andrew Pickles","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Daniel Stahl","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rosita Zakeri","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Mahdad Noursadeghi","author_inst":"UCL Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Kevin O'Gallagher","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Matt Rogers","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, U.K."},{"author_name":"Amos Folarin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Christopher Bourdeaux","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, U.K."},{"author_name":"Chris McWilliams","author_inst":"Department of Engineering Mathematics, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Lukasz Roguski","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Florina Borca","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"James Batchelor","author_inst":"Clinical Informatics Research Unit, University of Southampton, Coxford Rd, Southampton SO16 5AF"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Wu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Jiaxing Sun","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Ashwin Pinto","author_inst":"UHS Digital, University Hospital Southampton"},{"author_name":"Bruce Guthrie","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Cormac Breen","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Abdel Douiri","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Honghan Wu","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Vasa Curcin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"James T Teo","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ajay Shah","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Richard Dobson","author_inst":"Kings College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"cardiovascular medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.22.20075093","rel_title":"COVID-19 containment policies through time may cost more lives at metapopulation level","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.22.20075093","rel_abs":"The rapid and pandemic spread of COVID-19 has led to unprecedented containment policies in response to overloaded health care systems. Disease mitigation strategies require informed decision-making to ensure a balance between the protection of the vulnerable from disease and the maintenance of global economies. We show that temporally restricted containment efforts, that have the potential to flatten epidemic curves, can result in wider disease spread and larger epidemic sizes in metapopulations. Longer-term rewiring of metapopulation networks or the enforcement of feasible long-term measures that decrease disease transmissions appear to be more efficient than temporarily restricted intensive mitigation strategies (e.g. short-term mass quarantine).

Changes to the transmission rate (over time) would be advisable, to fall R0 below the critical threshold.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ines Abdeljaoued-Tej","author_inst":"BIMS Laboratory, LR16IPT09, Institut Pasteur de Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar, Tunisia"},{"author_name":"Joseph T Wu","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Kuang Xu","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Lawrence M Wein","author_inst":"Stanford Unversity"},{"author_name":"Enoch Akowuah","author_inst":"South Tees Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Yuanyuan Li","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Wuhan hospital of traditional Chinese Medicine,Hubei,China"},{"author_name":"Shi Mao","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Wuhan Third Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yongfeng Chen","author_inst":"Medical management department, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Wen Xie","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Hang T T Phan","author_inst":"Clinical Informatics Research Unit, University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Walter Muruet","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rishi K Gupta","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Anthony J Shinton","author_inst":"UHS Digital, University Hospital Southampton"},{"author_name":"Mike Wyatt","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Ting Shi","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Xin Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, People's Liberation Army Joint Logistic Support Force 920th Hospital, Yunnan, China"},{"author_name":"Andrew Pickles","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Daniel Stahl","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rosita Zakeri","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Mahdad Noursadeghi","author_inst":"UCL Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Kevin O'Gallagher","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Matt Rogers","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, U.K."},{"author_name":"Amos Folarin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Christopher Bourdeaux","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, U.K."},{"author_name":"Chris McWilliams","author_inst":"Department of Engineering Mathematics, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Lukasz Roguski","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Florina Borca","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"James Batchelor","author_inst":"Clinical Informatics Research Unit, University of Southampton, Coxford Rd, Southampton SO16 5AF"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Wu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Jiaxing Sun","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Ashwin Pinto","author_inst":"UHS Digital, University Hospital Southampton"},{"author_name":"Bruce Guthrie","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Cormac Breen","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Abdel Douiri","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Honghan Wu","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Vasa Curcin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"James T Teo","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ajay Shah","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Richard Dobson","author_inst":"Kings College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.24.20078030","rel_title":"Modelling the impact of control measures against the COVID-19 pandemic in Viet Nam","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.24.20078030","rel_abs":"Objectives: Health care system of many countries are facing a surging burden of COVID-19. Although Vietnam has successfully controlled the COVID-19 pandemic to date, there is a sign of initial community transmission. An estimate of possible scenarios to prepare health resources in the future is needed. We used modelling methods to estimate impacts of mitigation measures on the COVID-19 pandemic in Vietnam. Methods: SEIR model built in the COVIDSIM1.1 tool was adopted using available data for estimation. The herd immunization scenario was with no intervention implemented. Other scenarios consisted of isolation and social distancing at different levels (25%, 50%, 75% and 10%, 20%, 30%, respectively). Outcomes include epidemic apex, daily new and cumulative cases, deaths, hospitalized patients and ICU beds needed. Results: By April 8, 2020, there would be 465 infected cases with COVID-19 in Viet Nam, of those 50% were detected. Cumulatively, there would be 1,400 cases and 30 deaths by end of 2020, if 75% of cases was detected and isolated, and 30% of social distancing could be maintained. The most effective intervention scenario is the detection and isolation of 75% infected cases and reduction of 10% social contacts. This will require an expansion of testing capacity at health facilities and in the community, posing a challenge to identify high-risk groups to prioritized testing. Conclusions: In a localized epidemic setting, the expansion of testing should be the key measure to control the epidemic. Social distancing plays a significant role to prevent further transmission to the community.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thu Anh Nguyen","author_inst":"Sydney School of Medicine, The Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Australia"},{"author_name":"Quoc Cuong Nguyen","author_inst":"Save the Children International, Vientiane, Laos"},{"author_name":"Anh Thi Kim Le","author_inst":"Hanoi University of Public Health, Hanoi, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Huyen Nguyen Nguyen","author_inst":"National Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Thao Thi Huong Nguyen","author_inst":"Strategic Consultancy Company, Hanoi, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Yuanyuan Li","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Wuhan hospital of traditional Chinese Medicine,Hubei,China"},{"author_name":"Shi Mao","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Wuhan Third Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yongfeng Chen","author_inst":"Medical management department, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Wen Xie","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Hang T T Phan","author_inst":"Clinical Informatics Research Unit, University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Walter Muruet","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rishi K Gupta","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Anthony J Shinton","author_inst":"UHS Digital, University Hospital Southampton"},{"author_name":"Mike Wyatt","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Ting Shi","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Xin Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, People's Liberation Army Joint Logistic Support Force 920th Hospital, Yunnan, China"},{"author_name":"Andrew Pickles","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Daniel Stahl","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rosita Zakeri","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Mahdad Noursadeghi","author_inst":"UCL Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Kevin O'Gallagher","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Matt Rogers","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, U.K."},{"author_name":"Amos Folarin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Christopher Bourdeaux","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, U.K."},{"author_name":"Chris McWilliams","author_inst":"Department of Engineering Mathematics, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Lukasz Roguski","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Florina Borca","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"James Batchelor","author_inst":"Clinical Informatics Research Unit, University of Southampton, Coxford Rd, Southampton SO16 5AF"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Wu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Jiaxing Sun","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Ashwin Pinto","author_inst":"UHS Digital, University Hospital Southampton"},{"author_name":"Bruce Guthrie","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Cormac Breen","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Abdel Douiri","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Honghan Wu","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Vasa Curcin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"James T Teo","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ajay Shah","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Richard Dobson","author_inst":"Kings College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.24.20078303","rel_title":"Concentration-dependent mortality of chloroquine in overdose","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.24.20078303","rel_abs":"Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are used extensively in malaria and rheumatological conditions, and now in COVID-19 prevention and treatment.

Early, several RT-qPCR were designed by using only the first SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence.\n\nObjectivesA few days later, when additional SARS-CoV-2 genome were retrieved, the kit GPS CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR Test was designed to provide a highly specific detection method and commercially available worldwide. The kit was validated following criteria recommended by the UNE\/EN ISO 17025:2005 and ISO\/IEC 15189:2012.\n\nMethodsThe present study approached the in silico specificity of the GPS CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR Test and RT-qPCR designs currently published. The empirical validation parameters specificity (inclusivity\/exclusivity), quantitative phase analysis (10-106 copies), reliability (repeatability\/reproducibility) and sensitivity (detection\/quantification limits) were evaluated for a minimum of 10-15 assays. Diagnostic validation was achieved by two independent reference laboratories, the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII), (Madrid, Spain) and the Public Health England (PHE; Colindale, London, UK).\n\nResultsThe GPS RT-qPCR primers and probe showed the highest number of mismatches with the closet related non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, including some indels. The kits passed all parameters of validation with strict acceptance criteria. Results from reference laboratories 100% correlated with these obtained by suing reference methods and received an evaluation with 100% of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.\n\nConclusionsThe GPS CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR Test, available with full analytical and diagnostic validation, represents a case of efficient transfer of technology being successfully used since the pandemic was declared. The analysis suggested the GPS CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR Test is the more exclusive by far.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Antonio J Martinez-Murcia","author_inst":"Universidad Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez"},{"author_name":"Gema Bru","author_inst":"Genetic Analysis Strategies S.L."},{"author_name":"Aaron Navarro","author_inst":"Universidad Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez"},{"author_name":"Patricia Ros-T\u00e1rraga","author_inst":"Genetic Analysis Strategies S.L."},{"author_name":"Adri\u00e1n Garc\u00eda-Sirera","author_inst":"Genetic Analysis Strategies S.L."},{"author_name":"Laura P\u00e9rez","author_inst":"genetic PCR solutions"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J White","author_inst":"Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit"},{"author_name":"Yongfeng Chen","author_inst":"Medical management department, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Wen Xie","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Hang T T Phan","author_inst":"Clinical Informatics Research Unit, University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Walter Muruet","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rishi K Gupta","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Anthony J Shinton","author_inst":"UHS Digital, University Hospital Southampton"},{"author_name":"Mike Wyatt","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Ting Shi","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Xin Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, People's Liberation Army Joint Logistic Support Force 920th Hospital, Yunnan, China"},{"author_name":"Andrew Pickles","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Daniel Stahl","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rosita Zakeri","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Mahdad Noursadeghi","author_inst":"UCL Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Kevin O'Gallagher","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Matt Rogers","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, U.K."},{"author_name":"Amos Folarin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Christopher Bourdeaux","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, U.K."},{"author_name":"Chris McWilliams","author_inst":"Department of Engineering Mathematics, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Lukasz Roguski","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Florina Borca","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"James Batchelor","author_inst":"Clinical Informatics Research Unit, University of Southampton, Coxford Rd, Southampton SO16 5AF"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Wu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Jiaxing Sun","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Ashwin Pinto","author_inst":"UHS Digital, University Hospital Southampton"},{"author_name":"Bruce Guthrie","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Cormac Breen","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Abdel Douiri","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Honghan Wu","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Vasa Curcin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"James T Teo","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ajay Shah","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Richard Dobson","author_inst":"Kings College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"genetics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.24.20078824","rel_title":"Estimating COVID-19 Antibody Seroprevalence in Santa Clara County, California.

In each subpopulation, representing a locality, disease propagates according to a modified susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) dynamics. We assume that individuals reduce their number of contacts as a function of the weighted sum of cumulative number of cases within the locality and in neighboring localities. We also assume that susceptible and exposed (pre-symptomatic and infectious) individuals can travel between localities. To investigate the combined effects of mobility and contact reduction on disease progression within interconnected localities, we consider a scenario with two localities where disease originates in one and is exported to the neighboring locality via travel of undetected pre-symptomatic individuals. We establish a lower bound on the outbreak size at the origin as a function of the speed of spread. We associate the behavior change at the disease-importing locality due to the outbreak size at the origin with the level of preparedness of the locality. Using the lower bound on the outbreak size at the origin, we establish an upper bound on the outbreak size at the importing locality as a function of the speed of spread and the level of preparedness for low mobility regimes. We show the accuracy of the bounds in determining critical levels of preparedness that stop the disease from becoming endemic at neighboring localities. Finally, we show how the benefit of preparedness diminishes under high mobility rates. Our results highlight the importance of preparedness at localities where cases are beginning to rise, and demonstrate the benefits of increase in contact reduction by considering the outbreaks in neighboring localities with severe, rather than weak, outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ceyhun Eksin","author_inst":"Texas A&M"},{"author_name":"Martial Ndeffo-Mbah","author_inst":"Texas A&M"},{"author_name":"Joshua S Weitz","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Patricia Ros-T\u00e1rraga","author_inst":"Genetic Analysis Strategies S.L."},{"author_name":"Adri\u00e1n Garc\u00eda-Sirera","author_inst":"Genetic Analysis Strategies S.L."},{"author_name":"Laura P\u00e9rez","author_inst":"genetic PCR solutions"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J White","author_inst":"Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit"},{"author_name":"Yongfeng Chen","author_inst":"Medical management department, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Wen Xie","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Hang T T Phan","author_inst":"Clinical Informatics Research Unit, University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Walter Muruet","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rishi K Gupta","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Anthony J Shinton","author_inst":"UHS Digital, University Hospital Southampton"},{"author_name":"Mike Wyatt","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Ting Shi","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Xin Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, People's Liberation Army Joint Logistic Support Force 920th Hospital, Yunnan, China"},{"author_name":"Andrew Pickles","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Daniel Stahl","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rosita Zakeri","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Mahdad Noursadeghi","author_inst":"UCL Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Kevin O'Gallagher","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Matt Rogers","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, U.K."},{"author_name":"Amos Folarin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Christopher Bourdeaux","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, U.K."},{"author_name":"Chris McWilliams","author_inst":"Department of Engineering Mathematics, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Lukasz Roguski","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Florina Borca","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"James Batchelor","author_inst":"Clinical Informatics Research Unit, University of Southampton, Coxford Rd, Southampton SO16 5AF"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Wu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Jiaxing Sun","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Ashwin Pinto","author_inst":"UHS Digital, University Hospital Southampton"},{"author_name":"Bruce Guthrie","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Cormac Breen","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Abdel Douiri","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Honghan Wu","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Vasa Curcin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"James T Teo","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ajay Shah","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Richard Dobson","author_inst":"Kings College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.24.20078493","rel_title":"Forecast analysis of the epidemics trend of COVID-19 in the United States by a generalized fractional-order SEIR model","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.24.20078493","rel_abs":"Abstract In this paper, a generalized fractional-order SEIR model is proposed, denoted by SEIQRP model, which has a basic guiding significance for the prediction of the possible outbreak of infectious diseases like COVID-19 and other insect diseases in the future. Firstly, some qualitative properties of the model are analyzed. The basic reproduction number R0 is derived. When R0 < 1, the disease-free equilibrium point is unique and locally asymptotically stable. When R0 > 1, the endemic equilibrium point is also unique. Furthermore, some conditions are established to ensure the local asymptotic stability of disease-free and endemic equilibrium points. The trend of COVID-19 spread in the United States is predicted. Considering the influence of the individual behavior and government mitigation measurement, a modified SEIQRP model is proposed, defined as SEIQRPD model. According to the real data of the United States, it is found that our improved model has a better prediction ability for the epidemic trend in the next two weeks. Hence, the epidemic trend of the United States in the next two weeks is investigated, and the peak of isolated cases are predicted. The modified SEIQRP model successfully capture the development process of COVID-19, which provides an important reference for understanding the trend of the outbreak.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Conghui Xu","author_inst":"Beijing Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Yongguang Yu","author_inst":"Beijing Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"YangQuan Chen","author_inst":"University of California Merced"},{"author_name":"Zhenzhen Lu","author_inst":"Beijing Jiao Tong University"},{"author_name":"Adri\u00e1n Garc\u00eda-Sirera","author_inst":"Genetic Analysis Strategies S.L."},{"author_name":"Laura P\u00e9rez","author_inst":"genetic PCR solutions"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J White","author_inst":"Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit"},{"author_name":"Yongfeng Chen","author_inst":"Medical management department, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Wen Xie","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Hang T T Phan","author_inst":"Clinical Informatics Research Unit, University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Walter Muruet","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rishi K Gupta","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Anthony J Shinton","author_inst":"UHS Digital, University Hospital Southampton"},{"author_name":"Mike Wyatt","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Ting Shi","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Xin Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, People's Liberation Army Joint Logistic Support Force 920th Hospital, Yunnan, China"},{"author_name":"Andrew Pickles","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Daniel Stahl","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rosita Zakeri","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Mahdad Noursadeghi","author_inst":"UCL Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Kevin O'Gallagher","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Matt Rogers","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, U.K."},{"author_name":"Amos Folarin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Christopher Bourdeaux","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, U.K."},{"author_name":"Chris McWilliams","author_inst":"Department of Engineering Mathematics, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Lukasz Roguski","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Florina Borca","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"James Batchelor","author_inst":"Clinical Informatics Research Unit, University of Southampton, Coxford Rd, Southampton SO16 5AF"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Wu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Jiaxing Sun","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Ashwin Pinto","author_inst":"UHS Digital, University Hospital Southampton"},{"author_name":"Bruce Guthrie","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Cormac Breen","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Abdel Douiri","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Honghan Wu","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Vasa Curcin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"James T Teo","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ajay Shah","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Richard Dobson","author_inst":"Kings College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.24.20078485","rel_title":"On the reliability of model-based predictions in the context of the current COVID epidemic event: impact of outbreak peak phase and data paucity","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.24.20078485","rel_abs":"The pandemic spread of the COVID-19 virus has, as of 20th of April 2020, reached most countries of the world. In an effort to design informed public health policies, many modelling studies have been performed to predict crucial outcomes of interest, including ICU solicitation, cumulated death counts, etc... The corresponding data analyses however, mostly rely on restricted (openly available) data sources, which typically include daily death rates and confirmed COVID cases time series. In addition, many of these predictions are derived before the peak of the outbreak has been observed yet (as is still currently the case for many countries). In this work, we show that peak phase and data paucity have a substantial impact on the reliability of model predictions. Although we focus on a recent model of the COVID pandemics, our conclusions most likely apply to most existing models, which are variants of the so-called 'Susceptible-Infected-Removed' or SIR framework. Our results highlight the need for performing systematic reliability evaluations for all models that currently inform public health policies. They also motivate a plea for gathering and opening richer and more reliable data time series (e.g., ICU occupancy, negative test rates, social distancing commitment reports, etc).","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jean Daunizeau","author_inst":"INSERM, France"},{"author_name":"Rosalyn J Moran","author_inst":"King's College London, UK"},{"author_name":"Jeremie Mattout","author_inst":"INSERM, France"},{"author_name":"Karl Friston","author_inst":"University College London, UK"},{"author_name":"Adri\u00e1n Garc\u00eda-Sirera","author_inst":"Genetic Analysis Strategies S.L."},{"author_name":"Laura P\u00e9rez","author_inst":"genetic PCR solutions"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J White","author_inst":"Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit"},{"author_name":"Yongfeng Chen","author_inst":"Medical management department, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Wen Xie","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Hang T T Phan","author_inst":"Clinical Informatics Research Unit, University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Walter Muruet","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rishi K Gupta","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Anthony J Shinton","author_inst":"UHS Digital, University Hospital Southampton"},{"author_name":"Mike Wyatt","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Ting Shi","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Xin Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, People's Liberation Army Joint Logistic Support Force 920th Hospital, Yunnan, China"},{"author_name":"Andrew Pickles","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Daniel Stahl","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rosita Zakeri","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Mahdad Noursadeghi","author_inst":"UCL Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Kevin O'Gallagher","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Matt Rogers","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, U.K."},{"author_name":"Amos Folarin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Christopher Bourdeaux","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, U.K."},{"author_name":"Chris McWilliams","author_inst":"Department of Engineering Mathematics, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Lukasz Roguski","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Florina Borca","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"James Batchelor","author_inst":"Clinical Informatics Research Unit, University of Southampton, Coxford Rd, Southampton SO16 5AF"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Wu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Jiaxing Sun","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Ashwin Pinto","author_inst":"UHS Digital, University Hospital Southampton"},{"author_name":"Bruce Guthrie","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Cormac Breen","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Abdel Douiri","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Honghan Wu","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Vasa Curcin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"James T Teo","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ajay Shah","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Richard Dobson","author_inst":"Kings College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.24.20078550","rel_title":"The impact of the COVID19 pandemic and initial period of lockdown on the mental health and wellbeing of UK adults","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.24.20078550","rel_abs":"Mental health and wellbeing impacts of COVID19 were assessed in a convenience sample of 600 UK adults using a cross-sectional design.

The EDI has not been independently evaluated, and other proprietary models have been shown to be biased against vulnerable populations. Methods: We studied adult patients admitted with COVID-19 to non-ICU care at a large academic medical center from March 9 through May 20, 2020. We used the EDI, calculated at 15-minute intervals, to predict a composite outcome of ICU-level care, mechanical ventilation, or in-hospital death. In a subset of patients hospitalized for at least 48 hours, we also evaluated the ability of the EDI to identify patients at low risk of experiencing this composite outcome during their remaining hospitalization. Results: Among 392 COVID-19 hospitalizations meeting inclusion criteria, 103 (26%) met the composite outcome. Median age of the cohort was 64 (IQR 53-75) with 168 (43%) African Americans and 169 (43%) women. Area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) of the EDI was 0.79 (95% CI 0.74-0.84). EDI predictions did not differ by race or sex. When exploring clinically-relevant thresholds of the EDI, we found patients who met or exceeded an EDI of 68.8 made up 14% of the study cohort and had a 74% probability of experiencing the composite outcome during their hospitalization with a median lead time of 24 hours from when this threshold was first exceeded. Among the 286 patients hospitalized for at least 48 hours who had not experienced the composite outcome, 14 (13%) never exceeded an EDI of 37.9, with a negative predictive value of 90% and a sensitivity above this threshold of 91%. Conclusion: We found the EDI identifies small subsets of high- and low-risk COVID-19 patients with fair discrimination. We did not find evidence of bias by race or sex. These findings highlight the importance of independent evaluation of proprietary models before widespread operational use among COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Karandeep Singh","author_inst":"University of Michigan Medical School"},{"author_name":"Thomas S.

The chest computed tomography (CT) could be serve as an effective tool in detection of COVID-19. Its valuable to develop automatic detection of COVID-19. Material and Methods: The collected dataset consisted of 521 COVID-19 chest CT images, 397 normal chest CT images, 76 bacterial pneumonia chest CT images and 48 SARS chest CT images obtained by exhaustively searching available data on the Internet. Then, these data are divided into three sets, referred to training set, validation set and testing set. Sixteen data augmentation operations are designed to enrich the training set in deep learning training phase. Multiple experiments were conducted to analyze the performance of the model in the detection of COVID-19 both in case of no noisy labels and noisy labels. The performance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC), sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. Results: The data augmentation operations on the training set is effective for improvement of the model performance. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve is 0.9689 with (95% CI: 0.9308, 1) in case of no noisy labels, while the per-exam sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for detecting COVID-19 in the independent testing set are 90.52%, 91.58% and 91.21%, respectively. Besides, the model is robust when part of the training samples is marked incorrectly. The AUC is 92.23% in the case of noisy labels of 10% in the training set.

Recent findings have observed imaging patterns on computed tomography (CT) for patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. In this paper, we build a public available SARS-CoV-2 CTscan dataset, containing 1252 CT scans that are positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) and 1230 CT scans for patientsnon-infected by SARS-CoV-2, 2482 CT scans in total. These data have been collected from real patients in hospitals from Sao Paulo, Brazil. The aim of this dataset is to encourage the research and development of artificial intelligent methods which are able to identify if a person is infected by SARS-CoV-2 through the analysis of his\/her CT scans.

Analysis of health, healthcare access, and socioeconomic indicators at the district level","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.25.20079749","rel_abs":"Background Despite measures such as travel restrictions and lockdowns, the novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) is projected to spread across India. Considering that a vaccine for COVID-19 is will not be available soon, it is important to identify populations with high risk from COVID-19 and take measures to prevent outbreaks and build healthcare infrastructure at the local level. Methods We used data from two large nationally representative household surveys, administrative sources, and published studies to estimate the risk of COVID-19 at the district level in India. We employed principal component analysis to create an index of the health risk of COVID-19 from demographic and comorbidity indicators such as the proportions of elderly population and rates of diabetes, hypertension, and respiratory illnesses. Another principal component index examined the socioeconomic and healthcare access risk from COVID-19, based on the standard of living, proportion of caste groups, and per capita access to public healthcare in each district. Results Districts in northern, southern and western Indian states such as Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Maharashtra were at the highest health risk from COVID-19. Many of these districts have been designated as COVID-19 hotspots by the Indian government because of emergent outbreaks. Districts in eastern and central states such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Madhya Pradesh have higher socioeconomic and healthcare access risk as compared with other areas. Interpretation Districts at high risk of COVID-19 should prioritize policy measures for preventing outbreaks, and improving critical care infrastructure and socioeconomic safety nets.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arindam Nandi","author_inst":"The Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Ruchita Balasubramanian","author_inst":"The Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Ramanan Laxminarayan","author_inst":"The Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy"},{"author_name":"Michele Higa Froes","author_inst":"Public Hospital of the Government Employees of Sao Paulo (HSPM)"},{"author_name":"Daniel Kanda Abe","author_inst":"Public Hospital of the Government Employees of Sao Paulo (HSPM)"},{"author_name":"Jingxuan Li","author_inst":"Jinan University"},{"author_name":"Jenna Wiens","author_inst":"University of Michigan College of Engineering"},{"author_name":"Erkin Otles","author_inst":"University of Michigan College of Engineering"},{"author_name":"John P.
