We investigated two COVID-19 school exposure incidents in the Helsinki area. Methods: We conducted two retrospective cohort studies after schools exposures, with a household transmission extension. We defined a case as an exposed person with either a positive RT-PCR, or positive microneutralisation testing (MNT) as confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein IgG antibodies detection via fluorescent microsphere immunoassay (FMIA). We recruited close school contacts and families of school cases, calculated attack rates (AR) on school level and families, and identified transmission chains. Findings: In incident A, the index was a pupil. Participation rate was 74% (89\/121), and no cases were identified. In incident B, the index was a member of school personnel. Participation rate was 81% (51\/63). AR was 16% (8\/51): 6 pupils and 1 member of school personnel were MNT and FMIA positive; 1 pupil had a positive RT-PCR, but negative serology samples. We visited all school cases' families (n=8). The AR among close household contacts was 42% (9\/20 in 3\/8 families) but other plausible sources were always reported. At three months post-exposure, 6\/8 school cases were re-sampled and still MNT positive. Interpretation: When the index was a child, no school transmission was identified, while the occurrence of an adult case led to a 16% AR. Further cases were evidenced in 3 families, but other transmission chains were plausible. It is likely that transmission from children to adults is limited. Funding: The Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare funded this study.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Timothee Dub","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare"},{"author_name":"Elina Erra","author_inst":"City of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Lotta Hagberg","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare"},{"author_name":"Emmi Sarvikivi","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare"},{"author_name":"Camilla Virta","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare"},{"author_name":"Asko Jarvinen","author_inst":"Helsinki University Hospital and Helsinki University"},{"author_name":"Pamela Osterlund","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare"},{"author_name":"Niina Ikonen","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare"},{"author_name":"Anu Haveri","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare"},{"author_name":"Merit Melin","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare"},{"author_name":"Timo J Lukkarinen","author_inst":"City of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Hanna Nohynek","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.28.20163634","rel_title":"Mechanistic modelling of coronavirus infections and the impact of confined neighbourhoods on a short time scale","rel_date":"2020-07-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.28.20163634","rel_abs":"Background: To mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus, some countries have adopted more stringent non-pharmaceutical interventions in contrast to those widely used (for e.g. the state of Kuwait). In addition to standard practices such as enforcing curfews, social distancing, and closure of non-essential service industries, other non-conventional policies such as the total confinement of highly populated areas has also been implemented. Methods: In this paper, we model the movement of a host population using a mechanistic approach based on random walks, which are either diffusive or super-diffusive. Infections are realised through a contact process, whereby a susceptible host may be infected if in close spatial proximity of the infectious host. Our focus is only on the short-time scale prior to the infectious period, so that no further transmission is assumed. Results: We find that the level of infection depends heavily on the population dynamics, and increases in the case of slow population diffusion, but remains stable for a high or super-diffusive population. Also, we find that the confinement of homogeneous or overcrowded sub-populations has minimal impact in the short term. Conclusions: Our results indicate that on a short time scale, confinement restrictions or complete lock down of whole residential areas may not be effective. Finally, we discuss the possible implications of our findings for total confinement in the context of the current situation in Kuwait.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Danish A Ahmed","author_inst":"Gulf University for Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Ali R Ansari","author_inst":"Gulf University for Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Mudassar Imran","author_inst":"Gulf University for Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Kamaludin Dingle","author_inst":"Gulf University for Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Naveed Ahmed","author_inst":"Gulf University for Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Michael A Bonsall","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Pamela Osterlund","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare"},{"author_name":"Niina Ikonen","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare"},{"author_name":"Anu Haveri","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare"},{"author_name":"Merit Melin","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare"},{"author_name":"Timo J Lukkarinen","author_inst":"City of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Hanna Nohynek","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.29.20164343","rel_title":"Performance of Abbott Architect, Ortho Vitros, and Euroimmun Assays in Detecting Prior SARS-CoV-2 Infection","rel_date":"2020-07-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.29.20164343","rel_abs":"Background: Several serological assays have been developed to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, but evidence about their comparative performance is limited. We sought to assess the sensitivity of four anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) in individuals with evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: We obtained sera from 36 individuals with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between March and May 2020. We evaluated samples collected at around 21 days ({+\/-}14 days) after their initial PCR test using 3 commercially available ELISA assays, two anti-spike (Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics Vitros, and Euroimmun) and one anti-nucleocapsid (Abbott Architect), and a Yale-developed anti-spike ELISA test. We determined the sensitivity of the tests and compared their results. The Euroimmun and Yale ELISA had an equivocal and indeterminate category, which were considered as both negative and positive. Results: Among the 36 individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection, mean age was 43 ({+\/-}13) years and 19 (53%) were female. The sensitivities of the tests were not significantly different (Abbott Architect, Ortho Vitros, Euroimmmun, and Yale assays: 86% (95% confidence interval [CI], 71-95), 94% (95% CI, 81-99), 86% (95% CI, 71-95), and 94% (95% CI, 81-99), respectively; p-value=0.464). The sensitivities of the Euroimmun and Yale ELISA tests increased when the equivocal\/indeterminate results were considered positive (97% [95% CI, 85-100] and 100% [95% CI, 90-100], respectively), but were not significantly different from other tests (p=0.082). The cross-correlation coefficient ranged from 0.85-0.98 between three anti-spike protein assays (Ortho Vitros, Euroimmun, Yale) and was 0.58-0.71 between the three anti-spike protein assays and the anti-nucleocapsid assay (Abbott). Conclusion: The sensitivities of four anti-SARS-CoV-2 protein assays did not significantly differ, although the sample size was small. Sensitivity also depended on the interpretation of equivocal and indeterminate results. The strongest correlations were present for the three anti-spike proteins assays. These findings suggest that individual test characteristics and the correlation between different tests should be considered when comparing or aggregating data across different populations studies for serologic surveillance of past SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shiwani Mahajan","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Carrie A Redlich","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adam V Wisnewski","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Louis E Fazen","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lokinendi V Rao","author_inst":"Quest Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Karthik Kuppusamy","author_inst":"Quest Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Albert I Ko","author_inst":"Yale University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Harlan M Krumholz","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Anu Haveri","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare"},{"author_name":"Merit Melin","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare"},{"author_name":"Timo J Lukkarinen","author_inst":"City of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Hanna Nohynek","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.28.20163535","rel_title":"The basic reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2: a scoping review of available evidence","rel_date":"2020-07-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.28.20163535","rel_abs":"Background: The transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 determines both the ability of the virus to invade a population and the strength of intervention that would be required to contain or eliminate the spread of infection. The basic reproduction number, R0, provides a quantitative measure of the transmission potential of a pathogen. Objective: Conduct a scoping review of the available literature providing estimates of R0 for SARS-CoV-2, provide an overview of the drivers of variation in R0 estimates and the considerations taken in the calculation of the parameter. Design: Scoping review of available literature between the 01 December 2019 and 07 May 2020. Data sources: Both peer-reviewed and pre-print articles were searched for on PubMed, Google Scholar, MedRxiv and BioRxiv. Selection criteria: Studies were selected for review if (i) the estimation of R0 represented either the initial stages of the outbreak or the initial stages of the outbreak prior to the onset of widespread population restriction (lockdown), (ii) the exact dates of the study period were provided and (iii) the study provided primary estimates of R0. Results: A total of 20 R0 estimates were extracted from 15 studies. There was substantial variation in the estimates reported. Estimates derived from mathematical models fell within a wider range of 1.94-6.94 than statistical models which fell between the range of 2.2 to 4.4. Several studies made assumptions about the length of the infectious period which ranged from 5.8-20 days and the serial interval which ranged from 4.41-14 days. For a given set of parameters a longer duration of infectiousness or a longer serial interval equates to a higher R0. Several studies took measures to minimise bias in early case reporting, to account for the potential occurrence of super-spreading events, and to account for early sub-exponential epidemic growth. Conclusions: The variation in reported estimates of R0 reflects the complex nature of the parameter itself, including the context (i.e. social\/spatial structure), the methodology used to estimate the parameter, and model assumptions. R0 is a fundamental parameter in the study of infectious disease dynamics however it provides limited practical applicability outside of the context in which it was estimated, and should be calculated and interpreted with this in mind.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ann Barber","author_inst":"Wageningen University"},{"author_name":"John M Griffin","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Miriam Casey","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Aine Collins","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth A Lane","author_inst":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine"},{"author_name":"Quirine Ten Bosch","author_inst":"Wageningen University"},{"author_name":"Mart De Jong","author_inst":"Wageningen University"},{"author_name":"David Mc Evoy","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Andrew W Byrne","author_inst":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine"},{"author_name":"Conor G McAloon","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Francis Butler","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Kevin Hunt","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Simon J More","author_inst":"University College Dublin"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.28.20163873","rel_title":"Determining the period of communicability of SARS-CoV-2: A rapid review of the literature","rel_date":"2020-07-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.28.20163873","rel_abs":"Introduction: How long individuals may transmit virus after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is unclear. Understanding the communicability period of SARS-CoV-2 is important to inform the period of isolation required to prevent nosocomial and community spread. The objective of this study was to identify the reported communicable period of SARS-CoV-2, based on a rapid review of existing literature. Methods: Studies reporting empirical data on the period of communicability of SARS-CoV-2 through investigations of duration of communicability based on in-person contact ('contact transmission'), isolation and culture of virus ('viral isolation'), and viral shedding by detection of nucleic acids by RT-PCR ('viral shedding') were identified through searches of peer-reviewed and pre-print health sciences literature databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Google Scholar, medRxiv and arXiv) and the grey literature. Articles were screened for relevance, then data were extracted, analyzed, and synthesized. Results: Out of the 165 studies included for qualitative analysis, one study investigated contact transmission, three investigated viral isolation, 144 investigated viral shedding, and 17 studies focused on both viral shedding and viral isolation. The median length of time until viral clearance across all viral isolation studies was nine days; however, the maximum identified duration was 32 days. Studies with data on both viral isolation and viral shedding showed a prolonged maximum time until viral clearance for viral shedding (9 days vs 24 days). Discussion: Findings from this review support a minimum 10-day period of isolation; however, additional observation should be considered for individuals being released into high-risk settings.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mina Park","author_inst":"Vancouver Coastal Health"},{"author_name":"Colleen Pawliuk","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Tribesty Nguyen","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Amanda Griffitt","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Linda Dix-Cooper","author_inst":"Vancouver Coastal Health"},{"author_name":"Nadia Fourik","author_inst":"Vancouver Coastal Health"},{"author_name":"Martin Dawes","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"David Mc Evoy","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Andrew W Byrne","author_inst":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine"},{"author_name":"Conor G McAloon","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Francis Butler","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Kevin Hunt","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Simon J More","author_inst":"University College Dublin"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.28.20164038","rel_title":"Initial evaluation of a mobile SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP testing strategy","rel_date":"2020-07-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.28.20164038","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 control in the United States is hampered by limited testing.

In order to increase the reach for low cost equipment which requires a very limited technical knowledge can be beneficial to diagnose the viral infection. Such diagnostic capabilities can have a very critical role to control the transmission of the disease. Here we are reporting a state-of-the-art diagnostic tool developed by using an in vitro synthetic biology approach by employing engineered de novo riboregulators. Our design coupled with a home-made point-of-care device setting can detect and report presence of Sars-CoV-2 specific genes. The presence of Sars-CoV-2 related genes triggers translation of sfGFP mRNAs, resulting in green fluorescence output.

However, balancing the re-opening of society against the implementation of non-pharmaceutical measures needed for minimizing interpersonal contacts requires a careful assessment of the risks of infection as a function of the confinement relaxation strategies. Here, we present a stochastic coarse grained model that examines this problem. In our model, people are allowed to move between discrete positions on a one-dimensional grid with viral infection possible when two people are collocated at the same site. Our model features three sets of adjustable parameters, which characterize (i) viral transmission, (ii) viral detection, and (iii) degree of personal mobility, and as such, it is able to provide a qualitative assessment of the potential for second-wave infection outbreaks based on the timing, extent, and pattern of the lockdown relaxation strategy. In line with general expectations, our model predicts that a full lockdown yields the best results, namely, the lowest number of total infections. A less anticipated result was that when personal mobility is increased beyond a critical level, the risk of infection rapidly reaches a constant value, which depends solely on the population density. Furthermore, according to our model, confinement alone is not effective if it is not accompanied by a detection capacity (coupled with quarantine) that surpasses 40% of the patients during their symptomatic phase. The results of our simulation also showed that keeping the virus transmission probability to less than 0.4, which can be achieved in real life by respecting social distancing or wearing masks, is as effective as imposing a mild lockdown. Finally, we note that detection and quarantine of pre-symptomatic patients, even with a probability as low as 0.2, would reduce the final numbers of infections by a factor of ten or more.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shiho Ando","author_inst":"Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yuki Matsuzawa","author_inst":"Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hiromichi Tsurui","author_inst":"Juntendo University"},{"author_name":"Tetsuya Mizutani","author_inst":"Tokyo Noko Daigaku"},{"author_name":"Damien Hall","author_inst":"Nagoya Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Yutaka Kuroda","author_inst":"Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology"},{"author_name":"Aykut Ozkul","author_inst":"Ankara University"},{"author_name":"Urartu Ozgur Safak Seker","author_inst":"Bilkent University"},{"author_name":"Mitchell D Ramuta","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Cecilia G Shortreed","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Amelia K Haj","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Anna S Heffron","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Matthew R Reynolds","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Katrina N Fauser","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Corrie B Burmeister","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Kristi L Hall","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Thomas C Friedrich","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin Madison"},{"author_name":"Shelby L O'Connor","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"David H O'Connor","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.29.20164392","rel_title":"Estimating missing deaths in Delhi's COVID-19 data","rel_date":"2020-07-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.29.20164392","rel_abs":"A sero-prevalence survey in Delhi measured an infection rate of 23.48% and an implied infection fatality rate (IFR) of 0.06%.

We find significant susceptibility reductions in the metropolitan regions as a result of earlier seeding, with a relatively longer phase of exponential growth before the introduction of public health interventions. During the post-growth phase, the lower susceptibility of these regions contributed to the decline in cases, independent of intervention effects. Forward projections indicate that non-metropolitan regions will be more affected during recurrent epidemic waves compared with the initially heavier-hit metropolitan regions. Our findings have consequences for disease forecasts and resource utilisation.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas J.

A Large-scale satellite data was combined with these data with a regression analysis model to explore effects of temperature and relative humidity on COVID-19 spreading, as well as the possible transmission risk by seasonal cycles.

Further, the effect of temperature and humidity is almost linear based on our samples, with uncertainty sur-rounding any nonlinear effects. Government intervention (e.g. lockdown policies) and lower population movement contributed to the decrease the new daily case ratio. The conclusions withstand several robustness checks, such as observation scales and maximum\/minimum temperature. Weather conditions are not the decisive factor in COVID-19 transmission, in that government intervention as well as public awareness, could contribute to the miti-gation of the spreading of the virus.

However, these studies mostly compared observed to expected rates of smoking without direct comparison with individual controls. Objective To examine the association of nicotine-replacement therapy, as a surrogate of smoking, with hospitalization and all-cause mortality during the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in France. Methods We conducted a nationwide matched exposed\/unexposed cohort study using information from the French national health data system which covers the entire French population. We conducted two separate analyses, the first in individuals exposed to nicotine-replacement therapy without major smoking-related diseases (cancer, cardiovascular and\/or respiratory diseases) and the second in those presenting these conditions. We included all individuals, aged between 18 and 75 years, who had been reimbursed at least one nicotine-replacement therapy between November 15, 2019, and February 15, 2020. For each exposed individual, we randomly selected, from the entire Metropolitan French population, up to two non-exposed individuals (1:2) matched for the following variables: age (same year of birth), sex, department of residence (n=96 in Metropolitan France), and complementary universal health insurance (CMU-C). The three end points were a hospitalization with Covid-19, a death or an intubation in hospitalized patients with Covid-19, and all-cause mortality. We compared outcomes in individuals who were exposed to nicotine-replacement therapy with those in individuals who were not, using a multivariable Cox model with inverse probability weighting according to the propensity score. Results In the first analysis, 297,070 individuals without major smoking-related diseases exposed to nicotine-replacement therapy were matched with 558,228 unexposed individuals without major smoking-related diseases. Individuals were aged on average 45.6 years (standard deviation: 12.7) and 48.8% were male. From February 15, 2020 to June 7, 2020, hospitalization with Covid-19 occurred in 647 patients (151 patients in the nicotine-replacement therapy group and 496 patients in the unexposed group). In the main multivariable analysis, nicotine-replacement therapy was associated with a decreased risk of hospitalization with Covid-19 compared with unexposed individuals (hazard ratio, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.61). Nicotine-replacement therapy exposure was also associated with a decreased risk of intubation or death in hospitalized individuals with Covid-19 (13 vs. 73 patients, hazard ratio, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.57) but with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (251 vs. 231 deaths, hazard ratio, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.24 to 1.80). In the second analysis, 128,768 individuals with major smoking-related diseases exposed to nicotine-replacement therapy were matched with 243,793 unexposed individuals. Individuals were aged on average 55.3 years (standard deviation: 11.4) and 53.3% were male. In the main multivariable analysis, nicotine-replacement therapy exposure was neither associated with risk of hospitalization with Covid-19 (240 patients in the nicotine-replacement therapy group and 398 patients in the unexposed group, hazard ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.38) nor with risk of death or an intubation in hospitalized individuals with Covid-19 (48 vs. 61 patients, hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.65 to 1.54). All-cause mortality was higher in the nicotine-replacement therapy group (1040 vs. 366 deaths, hazard ratio, 3.83; 95% CI, 3.41 to 4.31). Conclusions This large-scale observational study suggests that smoking, measured by exposure to nicotine-replacement therapy, was associated with an increased risk of overall mortality during the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in France, although it was associated with a lower risk of severe Covid-19 in individuals without major related-smoking diseases. Experimental and clinical studies are needed to disentangle the potential mechanisms of nicotine and\/or smoking in Covid-19 risk. Whatever the nature of these associations, the global impact of smoking is harmful for health even over a short epidemic period.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mahmoud Zureik","author_inst":"Epi-Phare"},{"author_name":"Berangere Baricault","author_inst":"Epi-Phare"},{"author_name":"Celementine Vabre","author_inst":"Epi-Phare"},{"author_name":"Laura SEMENZATO","author_inst":"Epi-Phare"},{"author_name":"Jerome Drouin","author_inst":"Epi-Phare"},{"author_name":"Francois cuenot","author_inst":"Epi-Phare"},{"author_name":"Laetitia penso","author_inst":"Epi-Phare"},{"author_name":"Philippe Herlemont","author_inst":"Epi-Phare"},{"author_name":"Emilie Sbidian","author_inst":"Epi-Phare"},{"author_name":"Alain Weill","author_inst":"Epi-Phare"},{"author_name":"Mathieu Molimard","author_inst":"Epi-Phare"},{"author_name":"Rosemary Dray-Spira","author_inst":"Epi-Phare"},{"author_name":"Jeremie Botton","author_inst":"Epi-Phare"},{"author_name":"Katrina N Fauser","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Corrie B Burmeister","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Kristi L Hall","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Thomas C Friedrich","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin Madison"},{"author_name":"Shelby L O'Connor","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"David H O'Connor","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.28.20164087","rel_title":"COVID-19: Time-Dependent Effective Reproduction Number and Sub-notification Effect Estimation Modeling","rel_date":"2020-07-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.28.20164087","rel_abs":"Background: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers and health authorities have sought to identify the different parameters that govern their infection and death cycles, in order to be able to make better decisions.

This displacement of students from the wards has limited experiential learning opportunities. Concurrently, outpatient practices are experiencing reduced volumes of in-person visits and shifting towards virtual healthcare. This transition comes with its own logistical challenges. Here, we discuss a workflow that enabled students to engage in meaningful clinical education while helping the RWJMS outpatient practices implement remote telehealth visits. Methods: A four-week virtual elective was designed to offer clerkship students the opportunity to participate in virtual telehealth patient encounters. Students were prepared with EMR training and introduced to an outpatient workflow that supports healthcare providers in the ambulatory setting. Patients were consented to telehealth services before encounters with students. All collected clinical information was documented in the EMR, after which students transitioned patients to a virtual Doxy.me video call appointment. Clinical and educational outcomes of students' participation were evaluated. Results: Survey results showed students felt well-prepared to initiate patient encounters. They also expressed comfort while engaging with patients virtually during telehealth appointments. Students further identified educational value, citing opportunities to develop patient management plans consistent with in-person clinical experiences. A significant healthcare burden was also alleviated by student involvement. Over 1000 total scheduled appointments were serviced by students who transitioned over 80% of patients into virtual provider waiting rooms. Discussion: After piloting this elective with rising fourth-year students, pre-clerkship students were also recruited to act in a role normally associated with clinical learners (e.g., elicit patient histories, conduct a review of systems, etc.). An additional telehealth elective is being designed so medical students can contribute to inpatient care without risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2.

Healthcare workers (HCW) are at increased risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2, yet limited information is available on risk factors of infection. Methods. We pooled data on occupational surveillance of 10,654 HCW who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection in six Italian centers. Information was available on demographics, job title, department of employment, source of exposure, use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and COVID-19-related symptoms. We fitted multivariable logistic regression models to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Findings. The prevalence of infection varied across centers and ranged from 3.0% to 22.0%, being strongly correlated with that of the respective areas. Women were at lower risk of infection compared to men. Fever, cough, dyspnea and malaise were the symptoms most strongly associated with infection, together with anosmia and ageusia. No differences in the risk of infection were detected between job titles, or working in a COVID-19 designated department. Reported contact with a patient inside or outside the workplace was a risk factor. Use of a mask was strongly protective against risk of infection as was use of gloves. The use of a mask by the source of exposure (patient or colleague) had an independent effect in reducing infection risk.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paolo Boffetta","author_inst":"Stony Brook University"},{"author_name":"Francesco Violante","author_inst":"Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"},{"author_name":"Paolo Durando","author_inst":"Department of Health Sciences, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe De Palma","author_inst":"Department of Medical and Surgical Specialties, Radiological Sciences, and Public Health, University of Brescia, Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Enrico Pira","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Pediatric Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Luigi Vimercati","author_inst":"Interdisciplinary Department of Medicine, University of Bari, Bari, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alfonso Cristaudo","author_inst":"University Hospital Pisana, Pisa, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giancarlo Icardi","author_inst":"Department of Health Sciences, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy"},{"author_name":"Emma Sala","author_inst":"University Hospital Spedali Civili di Brescia, Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Maurizio Coggiola","author_inst":"University Hospital City of Health and Science of Turin, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Silvio Tafuri","author_inst":"Interdisciplinary Department of Medicine, University of Bari, Bari, Italy"},{"author_name":"Vittorio Gattini","author_inst":"University Hospital Pisana, Pisa, Italy"},{"author_name":"Pietro Apostoli","author_inst":"Department of Medical and Surgical Specialties, Radiological Sciences, and Public Health, University of Brescia, Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giovanna Spatari","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Dentistry Sciences and Morphological and Functional Imaging, University of Messina, Messina, Italy"},{"author_name":"- Working Group on SARS-CoV-2 infection in Italian healthcare workers","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Kristi L Hall","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Thomas C Friedrich","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin Madison"},{"author_name":"Shelby L O'Connor","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"David H O'Connor","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"occupational and environmental health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.24.20160101","rel_title":"Red blood cells injuries and hypersegmented neutrophils in COVID-19 peripheral blood film","rel_date":"2020-07-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.24.20160101","rel_abs":"In the current investigation, peripheral blood films of 15 COVID-19 patients (44.78{+\/-}16.55 years), proven by computed tomographic imaging and RT-PCR for coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, were analyzed at the moment of hospital admission.

We retrospectively evaluated risk factors for critical progression in Japanese COVID-19 patients. Method: Seventy-four laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were hospitalized in our hospital between February 20, 2020, and June 10, 2020. We excluded asymptomatic, non-Japanese, and child patients. We divided patients into the stable group (SG) and the progression group (PG) (patients requiring mechanical ventilation). We compared the clinical factors in both groups. We established the cutoff values (COVs) for significantly different factors via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and evaluated risk factors by univariate regression. Results: We enrolled 57 COVID-19 patients (median age 52 years, 56.1% male). The median progression time from symptom onset was eight days. Seven patients developed critical disease (PG: 12.2%), two (3.5%) of whom died; 50 had stable disease. Univariate logistic analysis identified elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (COV: 309 U\/l), decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (COV: 68 ml\/min), lymphocytopenia (COV: 980\/l), and statin use as significantly associated with disease progression. However, in Cox proportional hazards analysis, lymphocytopenia at symptom onset was not significant. Conclusions: We identified three candidate risk factors for adult Japanese patients with mild to moderate COVID-19: statin use, elevated LDH level, and decreased eGFR.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Takatoshi Higuchi","author_inst":"Toyonaka Municipal Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tsutomu Nishida","author_inst":"Toyonaka Municipal Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hiromi Iwahashi","author_inst":"Toyonaka Municipal Hospital"},{"author_name":"Osamu Morimura","author_inst":"Toyonaka Municipal Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yasushi Otani","author_inst":"Toyonaka Municipal Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yukiyoshi Okauchi","author_inst":"Toyonaka Municipal Hospital"},{"author_name":"Masaru Yokoe","author_inst":"Toyonaka Municipal Hospital"},{"author_name":"Norihiro Suzuki","author_inst":"Toyonaka Municipal Hospital"},{"author_name":"Masami Inada","author_inst":"Toyonaka Municipal Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kinya Abe","author_inst":"Toyonaka Municipal Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mokrane Iguer-Ouada","author_inst":"AME Laboratory, Faculty of Nature and Life Sciences, Abderrahmane Mira University 06000 Bejaia, Algeria."},{"author_name":"Vittorio Gattini","author_inst":"University Hospital Pisana, Pisa, Italy"},{"author_name":"Pietro Apostoli","author_inst":"Department of Medical and Surgical Specialties, Radiological Sciences, and Public Health, University of Brescia, Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giovanna Spatari","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Dentistry Sciences and Morphological and Functional Imaging, University of Messina, Messina, Italy"},{"author_name":"- Working Group on SARS-CoV-2 infection in Italian healthcare workers","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Kristi L Hall","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Thomas C Friedrich","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin Madison"},{"author_name":"Shelby L O'Connor","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"David H O'Connor","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.24.20148262","rel_title":"Incidence and outcomes of healthcare-associated COVID-19 infections: significance of delayed diagnosis and correlation with staff absence","rel_date":"2020-07-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.24.20148262","rel_abs":"Background: The sudden increase in COVID-19 admissions in hospitals during the SARS-CoV2 pandemic of 2020 has led to onward transmissions among vulnerable inpatients. Aims: This study was performed to evaluate the prevalence and clinical outcomes of Healthcare-associated COVID-19 infections (HA-COVID-19) during the 2020 epidemic and study factors which may promote or correlate with its incidence and transmission in a London Teaching Hospital Trust. Methods: Electronic laboratory, patient and staff self-reported sickness records were interrogated for the period 1st March to 18th April 2020. HA-COVID-19 was defined as symptom onset >14d of admission. Test performance of a single combined throat and nose swab (CTNS) for patient placement and the effect of delayed RNA positivity (DRP, defined as >48h delay) on patient outcomes was evaluated. The incidence of staff self-reported COVID-19 sickness absence, hospital bed occupancy, community incidence and DRP was compared HA-COVID-19. The incidence of other significant hospital-acquired bacterial infections (OHAI) was compared to previous years. Results: 58 HA-COVID-19 (7.1%) cases were identified. As compared to community-acquired cases, significant differences were observed in age (p=0.018), ethnicity (p<0.001) and comorbidity burden (p<0.001) but not in 30d mortality. CTNS negative predictive value was 60.3%. DRP was associated with greater mortality (p=0.034) and 34.5% HA-COVID-19 cases could be traced to delayed diagnosis in CA-COVID-19. Incidence of HA-COVID-19 correlated positively with DRP (R=0.7108) and staff sickness absence (R=0.7815). OHAI rates were similar to previous 2 years. Conclusion: Early diagnosis and isolation of COVID-19 would help reduce transmission. A single CTNS has limited value in segregating patients into positive and negative pathways.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kirstin Khonyongwa","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Denmark Hill,  London, UK"},{"author_name":"Surabhi K Taori","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Denmark Hill,  London, UK"},{"author_name":"Ana Soares","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Denmark Hill,  London, UK"},{"author_name":"Nergish Desai","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Denmark Hill,  London, UK"},{"author_name":"Malur Sudhanva","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Denmark Hill,  London, UK"},{"author_name":"William Bernal","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Denmark Hill,  London, UK"},{"author_name":"Silke Schelenz","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Denmark Hill,  London, UK"},{"author_name":"Lisa A Curran","author_inst":"Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Denmark Hill,  London, UK"},{"author_name":"Masami Inada","author_inst":"Toyonaka Municipal Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kinya Abe","author_inst":"Toyonaka Municipal Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mokrane Iguer-Ouada","author_inst":"AME Laboratory, Faculty of Nature and Life Sciences, Abderrahmane Mira University 06000 Bejaia, Algeria."},{"author_name":"Vittorio Gattini","author_inst":"University Hospital Pisana, Pisa, Italy"},{"author_name":"Pietro Apostoli","author_inst":"Department of Medical and Surgical Specialties, Radiological Sciences, and Public Health, University of Brescia, Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giovanna Spatari","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Dentistry Sciences and Morphological and Functional Imaging, University of Messina, Messina, Italy"},{"author_name":"- Working Group on SARS-CoV-2 infection in Italian healthcare workers","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Kristi L Hall","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Thomas C Friedrich","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin Madison"},{"author_name":"Shelby L O'Connor","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"David H O'Connor","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.27.20163287","rel_title":"The relationship between demographic, psychosocial and health-related parameters and the impact of COVID-19: a study of twenty-four Indian regions","rel_date":"2020-07-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.27.20163287","rel_abs":"Objectives: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has varied widely across nations and even in different regions of the same nation.

The relationship between these parameters and demographic, social, psychological and health-related indices in these states was examined using both bivariate and multivariate analyses. Results: A variety of factors - state population, sex ratio, and burden of diarrhoeal disease and ischemic heart disease - were associated with measures of the impact of COVID-19 on bivariate analyses. On multivariate analyses, prevalence and crude mortality rate were both significantly and negatively associated with the sex ratio.

The majority of data thus far come from hospitalised patients, with little focus on general population cases, or their symptoms. Methods: We undertook enzyme linked immunosorbent assay characterisation of IgM and IgG responses against SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein of 431 unselected general-population participants of the TwinsUK cohort from South-East England, aged 19-86 (median age 48; 85% female). 382 participants completed prospective logging of 14 COVID-19 related symptoms via the COVID Symptom Study App, allowing consideration of serology alongside individual symptoms, and a predictive algorithm for estimated COVID-19 previously modelled on PCR positive individuals from a dataset of over 2 million. Findings: We demonstrated a seroprevalence of 12% (51participants of 431). Of 48 seropositive individuals with full symptom data, nine (19%) were fully asymptomatic, and 16 (27%) were asymptomatic for core COVID-19 symptoms: fever, cough or anosmia. Specificity of anosmia for seropositivity was 95%, compared to 88% for fever cough and anosmia combined. 34 individuals in the cohort were predicted to be Covid-19 positive using the App algorithm, and of those, 18 (52%) were seropositive. Interpretation: Seroprevalence amongst adults from London and South-East England was 12%, and 19% of seropositive individuals with prospective symptom logging were fully asymptomatic throughout the study. Anosmia demonstrated the highest symptom specificity for SARS-CoV-2 antibody response.

RNA-extraction step has been a major rate-limiting step in implementing high-throughput screening for COVID-19 during this pandemic. Moreover, clinical laboratories are facing several challenges that include cost, reagents, instrumentation, turn-around time, trained personnel, and supply-chain constraints to efficiently implement and sustain testing. Cognizant of these limitations, we evaluated the extraction-free methods described in the literature and have developed an innovative, simplified and easy protocol employing limited reagents to extract RNA for subsequent RT-PCR analysis. Nasopharyngeal-swab samples were subjected to the following individual conditions: 65{degrees}C for 15 minutes; 80{degrees}C for 5 minutes; 90{degrees}C for 5 minutes or 80{degrees}C for 1 minute, and processed for direct RT-PCR. These groups were also compared with a supplemental protocol adding isopropanol-ethanol-water elution steps followed by RT-PCR assay. The direct RT-PCR assay did not detect SARS-CoV-2 within the various temperature incubation only groups, whereas, the 90{degrees}C for 5 minutes-isopropanol-ethanol-water method was found to be comparable to the FDA-EUA method. Evaluation of the performance metrics for 100 clinical samples demonstrated a sensitivity of 94.2% and a specificity of 100%. The limit of detection was ascertained to be ~40 copies\/ml by absolute-quantification. The protocol presented for this assay employs limited reagents and yields results with high sensitivity. Additionally, it presents a simplified methodology that would be easier to implement in laboratories in limited resource countries in order to meet the high current COVID-19 testing needs.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nikhil Shri Sahajpal","author_inst":"Augusta University"},{"author_name":"Ashis K Mondal","author_inst":"Augusta University"},{"author_name":"Allan Njau","author_inst":"Aga Khan University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sudha Ananth","author_inst":"Augusta University"},{"author_name":"Arvind Kothandaraman","author_inst":"PerkinElmer Inc."},{"author_name":"Madhuri Hegde","author_inst":"PerkinElmer Inc."},{"author_name":"Alka Chaubey","author_inst":"PerkinElmer"},{"author_name":"Sandeep Padala","author_inst":"Augusta University"},{"author_name":"Vamsi Kota","author_inst":"Augusta University"},{"author_name":"Kevin Caspary","author_inst":"Augusta University"},{"author_name":"Stephen Mark Tompkins","author_inst":"University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Ted M.

Our objective was to develop a decision model that supports prioritization of care from a utilitarian perspective, which is to minimize population health loss. Methods A cohort state-transition model was developed and applied to 43 semi-elective non-paediatric surgeries commonly performed in academic hospitals. Scenarios of delaying surgery from two weeks were compared with delaying up to one year, and no surgery at all. Model parameters were based on registries, scientific literature, and the World Health Organization global burden of disease study. For each surgery, the urgency was estimated as the average expected loss of Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs) per month. Results Given the best available evidence, the two most urgent surgeries were bypass surgery for Fontaine III\/IV peripheral arterial disease (0.23 QALY loss\/month, 95%-CI: 0.09-0.24) and transaortic valve implantation (0.15 QALY loss\/month, 95%-CI: 0.09-0.24). The two least urgent surgeries were placing a shunt for dialysis (0.01, 95%-CI: 0.005-0.01) and thyroid carcinoma resection (0.01, 95%-CI: 0.01-0.02): these surgeries were associated with a limited amount of health lost on the waiting list. Conclusion Expected health loss due to surgical delay can be objectively calculated with our decision model based on best available evidence, which can guide prioritization of surgeries to minimize population health loss in times of scarcity. This tool should yet be placed in the context of different ethical perspectives and combined with capacity management tools to facilitate large-scale implementation.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Benjamin Gravesteijn","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam"},{"author_name":"Eline Krijkamp","author_inst":"Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam"},{"author_name":"Jan Busschbach","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam"},{"author_name":"Geert Geleijnse","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam"},{"author_name":"Isabel Retel Helmrich","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam"},{"author_name":"Sophie Bruinsma","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam"},{"author_name":"Celine van Lint","author_inst":"Value Based Operation Room Triage team collaborators: Chris Bangma, Ivo Beetz, Patrick Bindels, Alexandra Brandt-Kerkhof, Danielle van Diepen, Clemens Dirven, T"},{"author_name":"Ernest van Veen","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam"},{"author_name":"Ewout Steyerberg","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam"},{"author_name":"Cornelis Verhoef","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam"},{"author_name":"Jan van Saase","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam"},{"author_name":"Hester Lingsma","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam"},{"author_name":"Robert Baatenburg de Jong","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam"},{"author_name":"- Value Based Operation Room Triage team collaborators","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Helin Sertkaya","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Thomas Maguire","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Edward Scourfield","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Ruth Bowyer","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Deborah Hart","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Aoife O'Byrne","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Steele","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Oliver Hemmings","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Carolina Rosadas","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Myra McClure","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Joan Capedevila-Pujol","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Jonathan wolf","author_inst":"Zoe Global"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Ourseilin","author_inst":"Zoe Global"},{"author_name":"Matthew Brown","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Michael Malim","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Timothy Spector","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Claire Steves","author_inst":"King's College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"surgery"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.27.20163212","rel_title":"Association between Alzheimer's disease and COVID-19: A bidirectional Mendelian randomization","rel_date":"2020-07-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.27.20163212","rel_abs":"Background In observational studies, Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been associated with an increased risk of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the prognosis of COVID-19 can affect nervous systems.

In Cuba, the first case of COVID-19 was reported on March 11. Elderly with multiple comorbidities are particularly susceptible to adverse clinical outcomes in the course of SARS CoV-2 infection. During the outbreak, a local transmission event took place in a nursing home in Villa Clara province, Cuba, in which nineteen elderly residents were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Based on the increased susceptibility to viral-induced cytokine release syndrome inducing respiratory and systemic complications in this population, the patients were included in an expanded access clinical trial to receive itolizumab, an anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody. Results: All the patients had underlying medical conditions. The product was well tolerated. After the first dose, the course of the disease was favorable and 18 out of 19 (94.7%) patients were discharged clinically recovered with negative RT-PCR at 13 days (median). One dose of itolizumab, circulating IL-6 decreased in the first 24-48 hours in patients with high baseline values, whereas in patients with low levels, this concentration remained over low values. To preliminary assess the effect of itolizumab, a control group was selected among the Cuban COVID-19 patients, which did not receive immunomodulatory therapy. Control subjects were well-matched regarding age, comorbidities and severity of the disease. Every three moderately ill patients treated with itolizumab, one admission in intensive care unit (ICU) was prevented. Discussion\/Conclusion: Itolizumab was well tolerated. Its effect is associated with a reduction and controlling IL-6 serum levels. Moreover, treated patients had a favorable clinical outcome, considering their poor prognosis. This treatment is associated significantly with a decrease the risk to be admitted in ICU and reduced 10 times the risk of death. This study corroborates that the timely use of itolizumab, in combination with other antiviral and anticoagulant therapies, is associated with a reduction the COVID-19 disease worsening and mortality. The humanized antibody itolizumab emerges as a therapeutic alternative for patients with COVID-19 and suggests its possible use in patients with cytokine release syndrome from other pathologies.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mayra Ramos-Suzarte","author_inst":"Center of Molecular immunology"},{"author_name":"Yayquier Diaz","author_inst":"Manuel Fajardo Universitary Hospital, Santa Clara, Villa Clara, Cuba"},{"author_name":"Yordanis Martin","author_inst":"Manuel Fajardo Universitary Hospital, Santa Clara, Villa Clara, Cuba"},{"author_name":"Nestor Antonio Calderon","author_inst":"Manuel Fajardo Universitary Hospital, Santa Clara, Villa Clara, Cuba"},{"author_name":"William Santiago","author_inst":"Manuel Fajardo Universitary Hospital, Santa Clara, Villa Clara, Cuba"},{"author_name":"Orlando Vinet","author_inst":"Manuel Fajardo Universitary Hospital, Santa Clara, Villa Clara, Cuba"},{"author_name":"Yulieski La O","author_inst":"Manuel Fajardo Universitary Hospital, Santa Clara, Villa Clara, Cuba"},{"author_name":"Jorge Perez","author_inst":"Manuel Fajardo Universitary Hospital, Santa Clara, Villa Clara, Cuba"},{"author_name":"Augusto Oyarzabal","author_inst":"Manuel Fajardo Universitary Hospital, Santa Clara, Villa Clara, Cuba"},{"author_name":"Yoan Perez","author_inst":"Manuel Fajardo Universitary Hospital, Santa Clara, Villa Clara, Cuba"},{"author_name":"Geidy Lorenzo","author_inst":"Center of Molecular Immunology, Playa, La Habana, Cuba"},{"author_name":"Meylan Cepeda","author_inst":"Center of Molecular Immunology, Playa, La Habana, Cuba"},{"author_name":"Danay Saavedra","author_inst":"Center of Molecular Immunology, Playa, La Habana, Cuba"},{"author_name":"Zayma Mazorra","author_inst":"Center of Molecular Immunology, Playa, La Habana, Cuba"},{"author_name":"Daymys Estevez","author_inst":"Center of Molecular Immunology, Playa, La Habana, Cuba"},{"author_name":"Patricia Lorenzo-Luaces","author_inst":"Center of Molecular Immunology, Playa, La Habana, Cuba"},{"author_name":"Carmen Valenzuela","author_inst":"Center of Molecular Immunology, Playa, La Habana, Cuba"},{"author_name":"Armando Caballero","author_inst":"Arnaldo Milian Castro Universitary Hospital.

Recent reports have raised the concern that antibodies in COVID-19 convalescent patients may not be long lasting and thus even these individuals may require vaccination. Vaccine candidates currently in clinical testing have focused on the SARS-CoV-2 wild type spike (S) protein (S-WT) as the major antigen of choice and while pre-clinical and early clinical testing have shown that S elicits an antibody response, we believe the optimal vaccine candidate should be capable of inducing robust, durable T-cell responses as well as humoral responses. We report here on a next generation bivalent human adenovirus serotype 5 (hAd5) vaccine capable of inducing immunity in patients with pre-existing adenovirus immunity, comprising both an S sequence optimized for cell surface expression (S-Fusion) and a conserved nucleocapsid (N) antigen designed to be transported to the endosomal subcellular compartment, with the potential to generate durable immune protection. Our studies suggest that this bivalent vaccine is optimized for immunogenicity as evidenced by the following findings: (i) The optimized S-Fusion displayed improved S receptor binding domain (RBD) cell surface expression compared to S-WT where little surface expression was detected; (ii) the expressed RBD from S-Fusion retained conformational integrity and recognition by ACE2-Fc; (iii) the viral N protein modified with an enhanced T-cell stimulation domain (ETSD) localized to endosomal\/lysosomal subcellular compartments for MHC I\/II presentation; and (iv) these optimizations to S and N (S-Fusion and N-ETSD) generated enhanced de novo antigen-specific B cell and CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses in antigen-naive pre-clinical models. Both the T-cell and antibody immune responses to S and N demonstrated a T-helper 1 (Th1) bias. The antibody responses were neutralizing as demonstrated by two independent SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays. Based on these findings, we are advancing this next generation bivalent hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD vaccine as our lead clinical candidate to test for its ability to provide robust, durable cell-mediated and humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further studies are ongoing to explore utilizing this vaccine construct in oral, intranasal, and sublingual formulations to induce mucosal immunity in addition to cell-mediated and humoral immunity. The ultimate goal of an ideal COVID-19 vaccine is to generate long-term T and B cell memory.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adrian Rice","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Mohit Verma","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Annie Shin","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Lise Zakin","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Peter Sieling","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Shiho Tanaka","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Helty Adisetiyo","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Justin Taft","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Roosheel Sandeep Patel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sofija Buta","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Marta Martin-Fernandez","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Brett Morimoto","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Gabitzsch","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jeffrey T Safrit","author_inst":"NantKwest, Inc."},{"author_name":"Joseph Balint","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Kyle Dinkins","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Patricia Spilman","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Dusan Bogunovic","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Shahrooz Rabizadeh","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Kayvan Niazi","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Patrick Soon-Shiong","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Oliver Hemmings","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Carolina Rosadas","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Myra McClure","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Joan Capedevila-Pujol","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Jonathan wolf","author_inst":"Zoe Global"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Ourseilin","author_inst":"Zoe Global"},{"author_name":"Matthew Brown","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Michael Malim","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Timothy Spector","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Claire Steves","author_inst":"King's College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.30.228213","rel_title":"No SARS-CoV-2 cross-neutralization by intravenous immunoglobulins produced from plasma collected before the 2020 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-07-30","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.30.228213","rel_abs":"The 2020 SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is caused by a zoonotic coronavirus transmitted to humans, similar to earlier events.

Here we demonstrate that S is recognized in a glycan-dependent manner by multiple innate immune receptors including the mannose receptor MR\/CD206, DC-SIGN\/CD209, L-SIGN\/CD209L, and MGL\/CLEC10A\/CD301. Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses indicate that such receptors are highly expressed in innate immune cells in tissues susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Binding of the above receptors to S is characterized by affinities in the picomolar range and consistent with S glycosylation analysis demonstrating a variety of N- and O-glycans as receptor ligands. These results indicate multiple routes for SARS-CoV-2 to interact with human cells and suggest alternative strategies for therapeutic intervention.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chao Gao","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Junwei Zeng","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Nan Jia","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Kathrin Stavenhagen","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Yasuyuki Matsumoto","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Hua Zhang","author_inst":"Laura and Isaac Perlmutter Cancer Center, New York University Langone Medical Center, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Adam J Hume","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Elke Muehlberger","author_inst":"National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories, Boston University, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Irma van Die","author_inst":"Department of Molecular Cell Biology and Immunology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Julian Kwan","author_inst":"Center for Network Systems Biology, Departments of Biochemistry and Biology, Boston University, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Andrew Emili","author_inst":"Center for Network Systems Biology, Departments of Biochemistry and Biology, Boston University, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Richard D Cummings","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Gabitzsch","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jeffrey T Safrit","author_inst":"NantKwest, Inc."},{"author_name":"Joseph Balint","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Kyle Dinkins","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Patricia Spilman","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Dusan Bogunovic","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Shahrooz Rabizadeh","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Kayvan Niazi","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Patrick Soon-Shiong","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Oliver Hemmings","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Carolina Rosadas","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Myra McClure","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Joan Capedevila-Pujol","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Jonathan wolf","author_inst":"Zoe Global"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Ourseilin","author_inst":"Zoe Global"},{"author_name":"Matthew Brown","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Michael Malim","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Timothy Spector","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Claire Steves","author_inst":"King's College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.29.227785","rel_title":"Mucin-type O-glycosylation Landscapes of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Proteins","rel_date":"2020-07-30","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.29.227785","rel_abs":"The densely glycosylated spike (S) proteins that are highly exposed on the surface of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) facilitate viral attachment, entry, and membrane fusion. We have previously reported all the 22 N-glycosites and site-specific N-glycans in the S protein protomer. Herein, we report the comprehensive and precise site-specific O-glycosylation landscapes of SARS-CoV-2 S proteins, which were characterized using high-resolution mass spectrometry. Following digestion using trypsin and trypsin\/Glu-C, and de-N-glycosylation using PNGase F, we determined the mucin-type (GalNAc-type) O-glycosylation pattern of S proteins, including unambiguous O-glycosites and the 6 most common O-glycans occupying them, via Byonic identification and manual validation. Finally, 43 O-glycosites were identified in the insect cell-expressed S protein. Most glycosites were modified by non-sialylated O-glycans such as HexNAc(1) and HexNAc(1)Hex(1). In contrast, 30 O-glycosites were identified in the human cell-expressed S protein S1 subunit. Most glycosites were modified by sialylated O-glycans such as HexNAc(1)Hex(1)NeuAc(1) and HexNAc(1)Hex(1)NeuAc(2). Our results are the first to reveal that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is a mucin-type glycoprotein; clustered O-glycans often occur in the N- and the C-termini of the S protein, and the O-glycosite and O-glycan compositions vary with the host cell type. These site-specific O-glycosylation landscapes of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein are expected to provide novel insights into the viral binding mechanism and present a strategy for the development of vaccines and targeted drugs.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yong Zhang","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wanjun Zhao","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yonghong Mao","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yaohui Chen","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Liqiang Hu","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Jingqiang Zhu","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Meng Gong","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Jingqiu Cheng","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Hao Yang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Julian Kwan","author_inst":"Center for Network Systems Biology, Departments of Biochemistry and Biology, Boston University, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Andrew Emili","author_inst":"Center for Network Systems Biology, Departments of Biochemistry and Biology, Boston University, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Richard D Cummings","author_inst":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Gabitzsch","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jeffrey T Safrit","author_inst":"NantKwest, Inc."},{"author_name":"Joseph Balint","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Kyle Dinkins","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Patricia Spilman","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Dusan Bogunovic","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Shahrooz Rabizadeh","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Kayvan Niazi","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Patrick Soon-Shiong","author_inst":"ImmunityBio, Inc."},{"author_name":"Oliver Hemmings","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Carolina Rosadas","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Myra McClure","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Joan Capedevila-Pujol","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Jonathan wolf","author_inst":"Zoe Global"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Ourseilin","author_inst":"Zoe Global"},{"author_name":"Matthew Brown","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Michael Malim","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Timothy Spector","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Claire Steves","author_inst":"King's College London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.30.228890","rel_title":"EUAdb: a resource for COVID-19 test development","rel_date":"2020-07-30","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.30.228890","rel_abs":"Due to the sheer number of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) cases, the prevalence of asymptomatic cases and the fact that undocumented cases appear to be significant for transmission of the causal virus, SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), there is an urgent need for increased SARS-CoV-2 testing capability that is both efficient and effective1. In response to the growing threat of the COVID-19 pandemic in February, 2020, the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) began issuing Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) to laboratories and commercial manufacturers for the development and implementation of diagnostic tests1. So far, the gold standard assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection is the RT-qPCR (real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction) test2. However, the authorized RT-qPCR test protocols vary widely, not only in the reagents, controls, and instruments they use, but also in the SARS-CoV-2 genes they target, what results constitute a positive SARS-CoV-2 infection, and their limit of detection (LoD). The FDA has provided a web site that lists most of the tests that have been issued EUAs, along with links to the authorization letters and summary documents describing these tests1. However, it is very challenging to use this site to compare or replicate these tests for a variety of reasons. First, at least 12 of 18 tests for EUA submissions made prior to March 31, 2020, are not listed there. To our knowledge, no EUAs have been issued for these applications. Second, the data are not standardized and are only provided as longhand prose in the summary documents. Third, some details (e.g. primer sequences) are absent from several of the test descriptions. Fourth, for tests provided by commercial manufacturers, summary documents are completely missing. To address at least the first three issues, we have developed a database, EUAdb (EUAdb.org), that holds standardized information about EUA-issued tests and is focused on RT-qPCR diagnostic tests, or \"high complexity molecular-based laboratory developed tests\"1. By providing a standardized ontology and curated data in a relational architecture, we seek to facilitate comparability and reproducibility, with the ultimate goal of consistent, universal and high-quality testing nationwide. Here, we document the basics of the EUAdb data architecture and simple data queries. The source files can be provided to anyone who wants to modify the database for his\/her own research purposes. We ask that the original source of the files be made clear and that the database not be used in its original or modified forms for commercial purposes.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alyssa Woronik","author_inst":"New York University"},{"author_name":"Henry W Shaffer","author_inst":"New York University"},{"author_name":"Karin Kiontke","author_inst":"New York University"},{"author_name":"Jon M Laurent","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Ronald Zambrano","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jef D Boeke","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"David H.A.
