At the same time, they implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) to curtail local spread. We assess the risk of importation of COVID-19 in locations that are at that point without infection or where local chains of transmission have extinguished, and evaluate the role of quarantine in this risk. ## Methods A stochastic $SLIAR$ epidemic model is used. The effect of the rate, size, and nature of importations is studied and compared to that of NPI on the risk of importation-induced local transmission chains. The effect of quarantine on the rate of importations is assessed, as well as its efficacy as a function of its duration. ## Results The rate of importations plays a critical role in determining the risk that case importations lead to local transmission chains, more so than local transmission characteristics, i.e., strength of NPI. The latter influences the severity of the outbreaks. Quarantine after arrival in a location is an efficacious way to reduce the rate of importations. ## Conclusions Locations that see no or low level local transmission should ensure that the rate of importations remains low. A high level of compliance with post-arrival quarantine followed by testing achieves this objective with less of an impact than travel restrictions or bans.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julien Arino","author_inst":"University of Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Bajeux","author_inst":"University of Manitoba"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Portet","author_inst":"University of Manitoba"},{"author_name":"James Watmough","author_inst":"University of New Brunswick"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.13.20173799","rel_title":"Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 and the model for predicting the occurrence of critically ill patients: a retrospective cohort study.","rel_date":"2020-08-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.13.20173799","rel_abs":"Background: The present study aim to comprehensively report the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the COVID-19 patients and to develop a multi-feature fusion model for predicting the critical ill probability. Methods: It was a retrospective cohort study that incorporating the laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients in the Chongqing Public Health Medical Center. The prediction model was constructed with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression method and the model was further tested in the validation cohort. The performance was evaluated by the receiver operating curve (ROC), calibration curve and decision curve analysis (DCA). Results: A total of 217 patients were included in the study. During the treatment, 34 patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) and no developed death. A model incorporating the demographic and clinical characteristics, imaging features and laboratory findings were constructed to predict the critical ill probability and it was proved to have good calibration, discrimination ability and clinic use. Conclusions: The prevalence of critical ill was relatively high and the model may help the clinicians to identify the patients with high risk for developing the critical ill, thus to conduct timely and targeted treatment to reduce the mortality rate.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jing Ouyang","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Xuefeng Shan","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Xin Wang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University, 30 Gaotanyan Street Shapingba District, Chongqing 400038, Chin"},{"author_name":"Xue Zhang","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Yaling Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Miaomiao Qi","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Chao Xia","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Dongqing Gu","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University, 30 Gaotanyan Street Shapingba District, Chongqing 400038, Chin"},{"author_name":"Yaokai Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ben Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University, 30 Gaotanyan Street Shapingba District, Chongqing 400038, Chin"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.11.20173179","rel_title":"Water, Sanitation, Hygiene and Covid-19 pandemic: a global socioeconomic analysis","rel_date":"2020-08-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.11.20173179","rel_abs":"Socioeconomic achievement of WASH (access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene) services are being acknowledged as anticipatory actors, indispensable in safeguarding health during this Covid19 pandemic. However, on a global scale, it is currently not clear whether deprivation or non obtainability of which of the various WASH services are closely related to Covid19 dynamics and up to which degree. We have analyzed data (March to June 2020) related to five Covid19 indicators for most of the countries in the world with indicators of safe water, sanitation and hygiene to understand this. We have found a strong positive correlation between lesser effects of Covid19 and better access to safe water, sanitation as well as hygiene throughout this time for most of the indicators. However, some indicators show the opposite nature of the relationship, for which we have given probable explanation accordingly. The hypothesis of an inversely proportional association between Covid-19 and poor WASH facilities on a global scale is confirmed in this study. We propose that this study should be perceived as an expanded comprehensive view on the complexities of WASH and Covid19 interrelationships, which could help to shape an agenda for research into some unanswered questions.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ajishnu Roy","author_inst":"Presidency University"},{"author_name":"Aman Basu","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Studies, Siksha Bhavana (Institute of Science), Visva-Bharati, West Bengal - 731235, India"},{"author_name":"Kousik Pramanick","author_inst":"Integrative Biology Research Unit, Department of Life Sciences, Presidency University, 86\/1, College Street, Kolkata - 700073, India"},{"author_name":"Xue Zhang","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Yaling Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Miaomiao Qi","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Chao Xia","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Dongqing Gu","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University, 30 Gaotanyan Street Shapingba District, Chongqing 400038, Chin"},{"author_name":"Yaokai Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Ben Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University, 30 Gaotanyan Street Shapingba District, Chongqing 400038, Chin"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.13.20147595","rel_title":"The operational impact of deploying SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in countries of the WHO African Region","rel_date":"2020-08-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.13.20147595","rel_abs":"Background: After SARS-CoV-2 vaccines become available, they will be deployed to many countries with limited immunization systems. Methods: We conducted a cold chain capacity assessment of a simulated country in the WHO African Region. We combined region-specific data regarding immunization, population, healthcare workforce, and cold storage capacity (upper and lower range and quartile values for national and subnational levels). We used seasonal influenza vaccines as proxies for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. We evaluated the increase in vaccine doses to be administered, doses administered per vaccinator, and cold storage volumes for SARS-CoV-2 campaigns targeting risk groups compared to routine immunization baselines. Findings: Compared to routine immunization, a SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign would increase monthly doses administered when targeting risk groups: [&ge;]65 years (29.9%), chronic diseases patients (101.5%), and healthcare workers (1.2%). SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns would increase doses administered per vaccinator for risk groups: [&ge;]65 years (32.5%), chronic diseases patients (110.4%), or healthcare workers (1.4%). Routine vaccine volumes already exceed national level storage capacity for at least 75% of African Region countries, but subnational levels would have sufficient storage capacity for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in all but the lower 25% of African Region countries. Interpretation: SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns would substantially increase doses per vaccinator and cold chain capacity requirements over routine immunization baselines. Pandemic vaccination campaigns would add volume to national level stores already at their limits, but substantial capacity exists at subnational levels for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Immediate attention to strengthening delivery systems is essential to support pandemic vaccine responses in the African Region.

Hence, this study aimed to assess the level of knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) among ophthalmic HCP towards COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted during the period of lockdown among ophthalmic HCP including consultant ophthalmologist, resident, optometrist, ophthalmic assistant, nursing staff, and other paramedics of eye care centers in Nepal. The KAP questionnaire was designed and distributed online. Data were analyzed using the Chi-square test, Pearson correlation, and binary logistic regression. All tests were performed at 95% Confidence Interval (CI) and p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Of 694 participants, the majority were male (59.1%) from the age group 31-40 years (41.5%) and tertiary eye center (68.9%). Among ophthalmic HCP, there were 29.8% consultants ophthalmologist, 22.6% residents, 23.3% optometrist, 15% ophthalmic assistant, and 9.2% other ophthalmic paramedics, 11.7% working as front-liners in COVID-19 centers. Findings showed, 98.1% had good knowledge, 59.4% had a positive attitude and only 13.3% had good practice regarding COVID-19. Binary logistic regression analysis demonstrated the age of HCP to be a significant determinant of good knowledge (Crude Odds Ratio (COR)=0.72, 95%CI=0.62-0.82), positive attitude (COR=0.92, 95%CI=0.90-0.94) and good practice (COR=1.16, 95%CI=1.10-1.21). Lower odds of poor practice was seen among junior resident (COR=0.26, 95% CI=0.14-0.47) and higher odds of poor practice was seen among HCP with job experience of 5-10 years (COR=2.38, 95% CI=1.23-4.60) towards COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: The majority of ophthalmic HCP have good knowledge, insufficient positive attitude, and inadequate evidence-based practice towards the COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal. Hence, this study conclusively recommends to modify existing guidelines and formulate new policies to improve KAP among ophthalmic HCP to effectively control the spread of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dr Zahir Ansari","author_inst":"B.P.

As universities re-open, it is imperative to understand the added value of measures to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Methods. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of common public health interventions used by universities to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We use a Markov model with Monte Carlo simulations, cycling once per day. The model computes changes in infection among interacting groups of university affiliates both on and off campus. Interventions are compared with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines at three different levels of actively infectious cases of COVID-19 in the community surrounding the university in terms of incremental cost per incremental quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Results. When there are 100 infectious cases per 100,000 people in the community (0.1%), a symptom-checking mobile application is cost-effective relative to CDC guidelines alone. If the community active infectious case rate reaches 1%, providing high quality, 2-ply masks will be cost-saving. As the community prevalence rate of infectious cases reaches 2%, thermal imaging cameras cost $965,070\/QALY gained (95% credible interval [CrI] = $198,821 QALY gained, $2.15 million\/QALY gained). One-time PCR testing on entry costs $1.08 million\/QALY gained (95% CrI = $170,703 QALY gained, $3.33 million\/QALY gained). Weekly PCR testing costs $820,119 \/QALY gained (95% CrI = $452,673 QALY gained, $1.68 million\/QALY gained). Upgrades to ventilation systems or installation of far-UVC light systems will be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000\/QALY gained if aerosols account for 86% of all on-campus transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions. The value of commonly used interventions for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 varies greatly with the rate of actively infectious cases of COVID-19 in the community surrounding the university.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zafar Zafari","author_inst":"University of Maryland"},{"author_name":"Katia Korvizhkin","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins"},{"author_name":"Lee Goldman","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Peter Muennig","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Bikram Adhikari","author_inst":"B.P.

Methods: We searched Medline, Embase, EBM Reviews, Scopus, Web of Science, and preprints up to July 20, 2020. We included observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCT) that assessed COVID-19 patients treated with CST. We pooled adjusted effect estimates of mortality and other outcomes using a random effect model, among studies at low or moderate risk for bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. Results: Out of 1067 citations screened for eligibility, one RCT and 19 cohort studies were included (16,977 hospitalized patients). Ten studies (1 RCT and 9 cohorts) with 10,278 patients examined the effect of CST on short term mortality. The pooled adjusted RR was 0.92 (95% CI 0.69-1.22, I2=81.94 %). This effect was observed across all stages of disease severity. Four cohort studies examined the effect of CST on composite outcome of death, ICU admission and mechanical ventilation need. The pooled adjusted RR was 0.41(0.23-0.73, I2=78.69%). Six cohort studies examined the effect of CST on delayed viral clearance. The pooled adjusted RR was 1.47(95% CI 1.11-1.93, I2=43.38%). Conclusion: Heterogeneous and low certainty cumulative evidence suggests that CST lacks efficacy in reducing short-term mortality while possibly delaying viral clearance in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Because of the discordant results between the single RCT and observational studies, more research should continue to identify the clinical and biochemical characteristics of patients population that could benefit from CST.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Haytham Tlayjeh","author_inst":"King Abdulaziz Medical City"},{"author_name":"Olaa Mhish","author_inst":"Alfaisal University"},{"author_name":"Mushira Enani","author_inst":"King Fahad Medical City"},{"author_name":"Alya Alruwaili","author_inst":"King Fahad Medical City"},{"author_name":"Rana Tleyjeh","author_inst":"Alfaisal University"},{"author_name":"Lukman Thalib","author_inst":"Qatar University"},{"author_name":"Leslie Hassett","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Yaseen Arabi","author_inst":"King Abdulaziz Medical City"},{"author_name":"Tarek Kashour","author_inst":"King Saud University"},{"author_name":"Imad Tleyjeh","author_inst":"King Fahad Medical City"},{"author_name":"Jean-Marie Okwo-Bele","author_inst":"Independent Consultant"},{"author_name":"Kathleen Neuzil","author_inst":"University of Maryland School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.12.20171405","rel_title":"OpenSAFELY: Do adults prescribed Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have an increased risk of death from COVID-19?","rel_date":"2020-08-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.12.20171405","rel_abs":"Importance: There has been speculation that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may negatively affect coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes, yet clinical evidence is limited.

Setting: Working on behalf of NHS England, we used routine clinical data from >17 million patients in England linked to death data from the Office for National Statistics. Participants: Study 1: General population (people with an NSAID prescription in the last three years). Study 2: people with rheumatoid arthritis\/osteoarthritis. Exposures: Current NSAID prescription within the 4 months before 1st March 2020. Main Outcome and Measure: We used Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for COVID-19 related death in people currently prescribed NSAIDs, compared with those not currently prescribed NSAIDs, adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities and other medications. Results: In Study 1, we included 535,519 current NSAID users and 1,924,095 non-users in the general population. The crude HR for current use was 1.25 (95% CI, 1.07-1.46), versus non-use.

Majority of participants (66.7%) practiced covering their mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing; 68.2% had treatment seeking behavior if they experience flue like symptoms; 69.1% practiced isolating themselves while having flue like symptoms; and 89.3% avoided hand shaking. Conclusions The findings of this study suggest that physical distancing and other COVID-19 preventive measures were inadequately implemented among people in Arba Minch town. Thus, an urgent call for action is demanding to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 as early as possible before it brings a devastating impact.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mekuria Asnakew Asfaw","author_inst":"Arba Minch University"},{"author_name":"Tsegaye Yohannes","author_inst":"Arba Minch University, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Chuchu Churko","author_inst":"Arba Minch University, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Alemayehu Bekele","author_inst":"Arba Minch University, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Teklu Wegayehu","author_inst":"Arba Minch University, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Krishnan Bhaskaran","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Brown","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher T.

The European Commission has outlined its commitment to reducing health inequalities. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a disruptive event with global, national, and local effects on every aspect of a society's life. Therefore, it is of interest to quantify and display health (in)equality induced by COVID-19 over time and on different geographic scales (global, continental, national, regional). We aimed to perform a study of (in)equality regarding COVID-19 related incidences and deaths using the Gini index (GI) that was developed to explore inequality in wealth within or between nations. The GI is a relative measure which quantifies the ratio of the mean absolute difference between observations and their mean: GI=0 describes a situation where everybody owns the same, GI=1 corresponds to one person owning the entire wealth of a society. A specific focus of our analysis is the (in)equality of case-fatality rates. We use global, nation- and statewide data to evaluate the heterogeneity at different levels. We also reflect on the suitability of the Gini index to monitor equality aspects of the pandemic. Data from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic show a considerable amount of heterogeneity in the global distribution of incidences and deaths. Only few countries contribute largely to the total incidence and death toll. Inequality may result from heterogeneous reporting systems, heterogeneous policy making to fight the pandemic, heterogeneous health systems, and demographic structures. Inequality decreases when going from continental to national or regional levels. Time trends on national level reflect local outbreaks. There is heterogeneity in case fatality rates, too. There is also a specific numeric artefact of the GI: Even if many smaller regions have no COVID-19 related deaths at all, and one region has low (but still non-negligible) number of deaths the corresponding GI is near to 1. We used the Gini index to reflect inequality between incidence and death rates of nations or geographic regions. The interpretation of the differences between reported GIs is not straightforward. However, combined with the information presented by maps, the GI is a useful tool.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kirsi Manz","author_inst":"Ludwig Maximilians University Munich"},{"author_name":"Ulrich Mansmann","author_inst":"Ludwig Maximilians University Munich"},{"author_name":"Chuchu Churko","author_inst":"Arba Minch University, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Alemayehu Bekele","author_inst":"Arba Minch University, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Teklu Wegayehu","author_inst":"Arba Minch University, Ethiopia"},{"author_name":"Krishnan Bhaskaran","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Brown","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher T.

Saliva was evaluated as a diagnostic specimen for SARS-CoV-2 using the cobas SARS-CoV-2 Test on the cobas 6800 instrument. Methods: Saliva specimens submitted from various patient populations under investigation for COVID-19 from March-July 2020 were processed in the laboratory with sterile phosphate-buffered saline in a 1:2 dilution and vortexed with glass beads. The processed saliva samples were tested using a commercial assay for detection of the SARS-CoV-2 E gene (LightMix) in comparison to the cobas SARS-CoV-2 Test. Results: 22\/64 (34.4%) of the saliva samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Positive and negative concordance between the LightMix and cobas assays were 100%. There was no cross-contamination of samples observed on the cobas 6800. The overall invalid rate for saliva on the cobas 6800 (1\/128, 0.78%) was similar to the baseline invalid rate observed for nasopharyngeal swabs\/VTM and plasma samples. Conclusions: Saliva is a feasible specimen type for SARS-CoV-2 testing on the cobas 6800, with potential to improve turnaround time and enhance testing capacity.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nancy Matic","author_inst":"Providence Health Care"},{"author_name":"Tanya Lawson","author_inst":"Providence Health Care"},{"author_name":"Gordon Ritchie","author_inst":"Providence Health Care"},{"author_name":"Aleksandra Stefanovic","author_inst":"Providence Health Care"},{"author_name":"Victor Leung","author_inst":"Providence Health Care"},{"author_name":"Sylvie Champagne","author_inst":"Providence Health Care"},{"author_name":"Marc G.

In an effort to control COVID-19 transmission in the UK, schools were closed on 23 March 2020. With social distancing in place, Primary Schools were partially re-opened on 1 June 2020, with plans to fully re-open in September 2020. The impact of social distancing and risk mitigation measures on childrens contact patterns is not known. Methods We conducted a structured expert elicitation of a sample of Primary Headteachers to quantify contact patterns within schools in pre-COVID-19 times and how these patterns were expected to change upon re-opening. Point estimates with uncertainty were determined by a formal performance-based algorithm. Additionally, we surveyed school Headteachers about risk mitigation strategies and their anticipated effectiveness. Results Expert elicitation provides estimates of contact patterns that are consistent with contact surveys. We report mean number of contacts per day for four cohorts within schools along with a range at 90% confidence for the variations of contacts among individuals. Prior to lockdown, we estimate that, mean numbers per day, younger children (Reception and Year 1) made 15 contacts [range 8..35] within school, older children (Year 6) 18 contacts [range 5..55], teaching staff 25 contacts [range 4..55) and non-classroom staff 11 contacts [range 2..27]. Compared to pre-COVID times, after schools re-opened the mean number of contacts were reduced by about 53% for young children, about 62% for older children, about 60% for classroom staff and about 64% for other staff. Contacts between teaching and non-teaching staff reduced by 80%, which is consistent with other independent estimates. The distributions of contacts per person are asymmetric indicating a heavy tail of individuals with high contact numbers. Conclusions We interpret the reduction in childrens contacts as a consequence of efforts to reduce mixing with interventions such as forming groups of children (bubbles) who are organized to learn together to limit contacts. Distributions of contacts for children and adults can be used to inform COVID-19 transmission modelling. Our findings suggest that while official DfE guidelines form the basis for risk mitigation in schools, individual schools have adopted their own bespoke strategies, often going beyond the guidelines.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stephen RJ Sparks","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"William P Aspinall","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Ellen Brooks-Pollock","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Leon Danon","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Roger Cooke","author_inst":"Delft University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Jenni Barclay","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Jane Scarrow","author_inst":"University of Grenada"},{"author_name":"Christopher F.

The two main components of the simulation model are the stochastic modeling of the admission of new patients and the patient flow through the hospital facilities. For the patient arrival process, we analyze different models based on growth curves of the twenty most affected countries (until June 15) and propose the use of the Gompertz curve. The length of stay is divided into several stages, each one modeled separately. We analyze the starting of the simulation model, which requires different procedures depending on the information available about the patients currently hospitalized. We also report the use of this simulation model during the COVID-19 outbreak in the Autonomous Community of Navarre, in Spain.

Methods: Online cross-sectional survey of 1,500 UK adults, recruited from an existing online research panel. Data were collected between 14th and 17th July 2020. We used linear regression analyses to investigate associations between intention to be vaccinated for COVID-19 when a vaccine becomes available to you and socio-demographic factors, previous influenza vaccination, general vaccine attitudes and beliefs, attitudes and beliefs about COVID-19, and attitudes and beliefs about a COVID-19 vaccination. Results: 64% of participants reported being likely to be vaccinated against COVID-19; 27% were unsure and 9% reported being unlikely to be vaccinated. Personal and clinical characteristics, previous influenza vaccination, general vaccination beliefs, and beliefs and attitudes about COVID-19 and a COVID-19 vaccination explained 77% of the variance in vaccination intention. Intention to be vaccinated was associated with more positive general COVID-19 vaccination beliefs and attitudes, weaker beliefs that the vaccination would cause side effects or be unsafe, greater perceived information sufficiency to make an informed decision about COVID-19 vaccination, greater perceived risk of COVID-19 to others but not oneself, older age, and having been vaccinated for influenza last winter (2019\/20). Conclusions: Despite uncertainty around the details of a COVID-19 vaccination, most participants reported intending to be vaccinated for COVID-19. Actual uptake will likely be lower.

In March 2020 New York City became the USA epicenter for the pandemic. On March 27, 2020 a Malayan tiger (Panthera tigris jacksoni) at the Bronx Zoo in New York City developed a cough and wheezing with subsequent inappetence. Over the next week, an additional Malayan tiger and two Amur tigers (P. t. altaica) in the same building and three lions (Panthera leo krugeri) in a separate building also became ill. The index case was immobilized, and physical examination and bloodwork results were unremarkable. Thoracic radiography and ultrasonography revealed peribronchial cuffing with bronchiectasis, and mild lung consolidation with alveolar-interstitial syndrome, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was identified by real-time, reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR) on oropharyngeal and nasal swabs and tracheal wash fluid. Cytologic examination of tracheal wash fluid revealed necrosis, and viral RNA was detected in necrotic cells by in situ hybridization, confirming virus-associated tissue damage. SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from the tracheal wash fluid of the index case, as well as the feces from one Amur tiger and one lion. Fecal viral RNA shedding was confirmed in all seven clinical cases and an asymptomatic Amur tiger. Respiratory signs abated within 1-5 days for most animals, though persisted intermittently for 16 days in the index case. Fecal RNA shedding persisted for as long as 35 days beyond cessation of respiratory signs. This case series describes the clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and management of tigers and lions infected with SARS-CoV-2, and describes the duration of viral RNA fecal shedding in these cases. This report documents the first known natural transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from humans to animals in the USA, and is the first report of SARS-CoV-2 in non-domestic felids.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Susan L.

In the present study, we demonstrate that in addition to ACE2, the S1 subunit of SARS-2-S binds to HDL and that SARS-CoV-2 hijacks the SR-B1-mediated HDL uptake pathway to facilitate its entry. SR-B1 facilitates SARS-CoV-2 entry into permissive cells by augmenting virus attachment. MAb (monoclonal antibody)-mediated blocking of SARS-2-S-HDL binding and SR-B1 antagonists strongly inhibit HDL-enhanced SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, SR-B1 is co-expressed with ACE2 in human pulmonary and extrapulmonary tissues.

Nsp10 and Nsp16 form a complex responsible for the capping of mRNA at the 5' terminus. In the methylation reaction the S-adenosyl-L-methionine serves as the donor of the methyl group that is transferred to Cap-0 at the first transcribed nucleotide to create Cap-1. The presence of Cap-1 makes viral RNAs mimic the host transcripts and prevents their degradation. To investigate the 2'-O methyltransferase activity of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp10\/16, we applied fixed-target serial synchrotron crystallography (SSX) which allows for physiological temperature data collection from thousands of crystals, significantly reducing the x-ray dose while maintaining a biologically relevant temperature. We determined crystal structures of Nsp10\/16 that revealed the states before and after the methylation reaction, for the first time illustrating coronavirus Nsp10\/16 complexes with the m7GpppAm2'-O Cap-1, where 2'OH of ribose is methylated. We compare these structures with structures of Nsp10\/16 at 297 K and 100 K collected from a single crystal. This data provide important mechanistic insight and can be used to design small molecules that inhibit viral RNA maturation making SARS-CoV-2 sensitive to host innate response.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mateusz Wilamowski","author_inst":"UChicago"},{"author_name":"Darren Sherrell","author_inst":"ANL"},{"author_name":"George Minasov","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Youngchang Kim","author_inst":"UChicago\/ANL"},{"author_name":"Ludmilla Shuvalova","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Alex Lavens","author_inst":"ANL"},{"author_name":"Ryan Chard","author_inst":"ANL"},{"author_name":"Natalia Maltseva","author_inst":"UChicago\/ANL"},{"author_name":"Robert Jedrzejczak","author_inst":"UChicago\/ANL"},{"author_name":"Monica Rosas-Lemus","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Nicklaus Saint","author_inst":"ANL"},{"author_name":"Ian T Foster","author_inst":"ANL"},{"author_name":"Karolina Michalska","author_inst":"UChicago\/ANL"},{"author_name":"Karla J Satchell","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Andrzej Joachimiak","author_inst":"UChicago\/ANL"},{"author_name":"Huilong Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), Beijing 100071, China"},{"author_name":"Zhe Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), Beijing 100071, China"},{"author_name":"Rong Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), Beijing 100071, China"},{"author_name":"Peng Du","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), Beijing 100071, China"},{"author_name":"Yulong Zong","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Taian City Central Hospital Branch, Taian 271000, China"},{"author_name":"Feng Yin","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Taian City Central Hospital Branch, Taian 271000, China"},{"author_name":"Wanchuan Zhang","author_inst":"Cancer Hospital of China Medical University, Liaoning Cancer Hospital and Institute, Shenyang 110042, China"},{"author_name":"Yumeng Peng","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), Beijing 100071, China"},{"author_name":"Haotian Lin","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), Beijing 100071, China"},{"author_name":"Rui Zhang","author_inst":"Cancer Hospital of China Medical University, Liaoning Cancer Hospital and Institute, Shenyang 110042, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), Beijing 100071, China"},{"author_name":"Qi Gao","author_inst":"Hotgen Biotech Co., Ltd.

The pandemic has impacted public health, the economy and our society on a global scale. In addition, the impacts of COVID-19 permeate into our environment and wildlife as well. Here, we discuss the essential role of wastewater treatment and management during these times. A consequence of poor wastewater management is the discharge of untreated wastewater carrying infectious SARS-CoV-2 into natural water systems that are home to marine mammals. Here, we predict the susceptibility of marine mammal species using a modelling approach. Many species of whale, dolphin and seal, as well as otters, are predicted to be highly susceptible to infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In addition, geo-mapping highlights how current wastewater management in Alaska may lead to susceptible marine mammal populations being exposed to the virus. Since over half of these susceptibility species are already at risk worldwide, the release of the virus via untreated wastewater could have devastating consequences for their already declining populations. For these reasons, we discuss approaches that can be taken by the public, policymakers and wastewater treatment facilities to reduce the risk of virus spillover in our natural water systems. Thus, we highlight the potential for reverse zoonotic transmission of COVID-19 and its impact on marine wildlife; impacts that can be mitigated with appropriate action to prevent further damage to these vulnerable populations.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sabateeshan Mathavarajah","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Dalhousie University"},{"author_name":"Amina K.

As there is a lot of variability in ACE2 expression between individuals we hypothesized that differential DNA methylation profiles could be (one of) the confounding factors explaining this variability. Here we show that epigenetic profiling of host tissue, especially in the ACE2 promoter region and its homologue ACE1, may be important risk factors for COVID-19. Our results propose that variable methylation can explain (part of) the differential susceptibility, symptom severity and death rate for COVID-19.

In this study, we present the VirusSi computational pipeline, which facilitates the rational design of siRNAs to target existing and future respiratory viruses. Mode A of VirusSi designs siRNAs against an existing virus, incorporating considerations on siRNA properties, off-target effects, viral RNA structure and viral mutations. It designs multiple siRNAs out of which the top candidate targets >99% of SARS-CoV-2 strains, and the combination of the top four siRNAs is predicted to target all SARS-CoV-2 strains. Additionally, we develop Greedy Algorithm with Redundancy (GAR) and Similarity-weighted Greedy Algorithm with Redundancy (SGAR) to support the Mode B of VirusSi, which pre-designs siRNAs against future emerging viruses based on existing viral sequences. Time-simulations using known coronavirus genomes as early as 10 years prior to the COVID-19 outbreak show that at least three SARS-CoV-2-targeting siRNAs are among the top 30 pre-designed siRNAs. Before-the-outbreak pre-design is also possible against the MERS-CoV virus and the 2009-H1N1 swine flu virus. Our data support the feasibility of pre-designing anti-viral siRNA therapeutics prior to viral outbreaks. We propose the development of a collection of pre-designed, safety-tested, and off-the-shelf siRNAs that could accelerate responses toward future viral diseases.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dingyao Zhang","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Jun Lu","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Joris R Delanghe","author_inst":"Department of Diagnostic Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Wim Van Criekinge","author_inst":"Biobix, Department of Data Analysis and Mathematical Modelling, Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Ludmilla Shuvalova","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Alex Lavens","author_inst":"ANL"},{"author_name":"Ryan Chard","author_inst":"ANL"},{"author_name":"Natalia Maltseva","author_inst":"UChicago\/ANL"},{"author_name":"Robert Jedrzejczak","author_inst":"UChicago\/ANL"},{"author_name":"Monica Rosas-Lemus","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Nicklaus Saint","author_inst":"ANL"},{"author_name":"Ian T Foster","author_inst":"ANL"},{"author_name":"Karolina Michalska","author_inst":"UChicago\/ANL"},{"author_name":"Karla J Satchell","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Andrzej Joachimiak","author_inst":"UChicago\/ANL"},{"author_name":"Huilong Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), Beijing 100071, China"},{"author_name":"Zhe Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), Beijing 100071, China"},{"author_name":"Rong Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), Beijing 100071, China"},{"author_name":"Peng Du","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), Beijing 100071, China"},{"author_name":"Yulong Zong","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Taian City Central Hospital Branch, Taian 271000, China"},{"author_name":"Feng Yin","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Taian City Central Hospital Branch, Taian 271000, China"},{"author_name":"Wanchuan Zhang","author_inst":"Cancer Hospital of China Medical University, Liaoning Cancer Hospital and Institute, Shenyang 110042, China"},{"author_name":"Yumeng Peng","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), Beijing 100071, China"},{"author_name":"Haotian Lin","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), Beijing 100071, China"},{"author_name":"Rui Zhang","author_inst":"Cancer Hospital of China Medical University, Liaoning Cancer Hospital and Institute, Shenyang 110042, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), Beijing 100071, China"},{"author_name":"Qi Gao","author_inst":"Hotgen Biotech Co., Ltd.

Extensive efforts and progress have been made to develop effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. A primary target of these vaccines is the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, and many studies utilized structural vaccinology techniques to either stabilize the protein or fix the receptor-binding domain at certain states. In this study, we extended an evolutionary protein design algorithm, EvoDesign, to create thousands of stable S protein variants without perturbing the surface conformation and B cell epitopes of the S protein. We then evaluated the mutated S protein candidates based on predicted MHC-II T cell promiscuous epitopes as well as the epitopes similarity to human peptides. The presented strategy aims to improve the S proteins immunogenicity and antigenicity by inducing stronger CD4 T cell response while maintaining the proteins native structure and function. The top EvoDesign S protein candidate (Design-10705) recovered 31 out of 32 MHC-II T cell promiscuous epitopes in the native S protein, in which two epitopes were present in all seven human coronaviruses. This newly designed S protein also introduced nine new MHC-II T cell promiscuous epitopes and showed high structural similarity to its native conformation. The proposed structural vaccinology method provides an avenue to rationally design the antigens structure with increased immunogenicity, which could be applied to the rational design of new COVID-19 vaccine candidates.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Edison Ong","author_inst":"University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqiang Huang","author_inst":"University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA"},{"author_name":"Robin Pearce","author_inst":"University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA"},{"author_name":"Yang Zhang","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Yongqun He","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Alex Lavens","author_inst":"ANL"},{"author_name":"Ryan Chard","author_inst":"ANL"},{"author_name":"Natalia Maltseva","author_inst":"UChicago\/ANL"},{"author_name":"Robert Jedrzejczak","author_inst":"UChicago\/ANL"},{"author_name":"Monica Rosas-Lemus","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Nicklaus Saint","author_inst":"ANL"},{"author_name":"Ian T Foster","author_inst":"ANL"},{"author_name":"Karolina Michalska","author_inst":"UChicago\/ANL"},{"author_name":"Karla J Satchell","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Andrzej Joachimiak","author_inst":"UChicago\/ANL"},{"author_name":"Huilong Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), Beijing 100071, China"},{"author_name":"Zhe Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), Beijing 100071, China"},{"author_name":"Rong Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), Beijing 100071, China"},{"author_name":"Peng Du","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), Beijing 100071, China"},{"author_name":"Yulong Zong","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Taian City Central Hospital Branch, Taian 271000, China"},{"author_name":"Feng Yin","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Taian City Central Hospital Branch, Taian 271000, China"},{"author_name":"Wanchuan Zhang","author_inst":"Cancer Hospital of China Medical University, Liaoning Cancer Hospital and Institute, Shenyang 110042, China"},{"author_name":"Yumeng Peng","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), Beijing 100071, China"},{"author_name":"Haotian Lin","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), Beijing 100071, China"},{"author_name":"Rui Zhang","author_inst":"Cancer Hospital of China Medical University, Liaoning Cancer Hospital and Institute, Shenyang 110042, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), Beijing 100071, China"},{"author_name":"Qi Gao","author_inst":"Hotgen Biotech Co., Ltd.

We report that the kinase SRPK1, together with the closely related SRPK2, are jointly essential for SARS-CoV-2 replication; inhibition of SRPK1\/2 with small molecules led to a dramatic decrease (more than 100,000-fold) in SARS-CoV-2 virus production in immortalized and primary human lung cells. Subsequent biochemical studies revealed that SPRK1\/2 phosphorylate the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein at sites highly conserved across human coronaviruses and, due to this conservation, even a distantly related coronavirus was highly sensitive to an SPRK1\/2 inhibitor.

SARS-CoV-2 replicates efficiently in respiratory epithelial cells motivating the development of alternative and rapidly scalable vaccine inducing mucosal protective and long-lasting immunity. We have previously developed an immunologically optimized multi-neoepitopes-based peptide vaccine platform which has already demonstrated tolerance and efficacy in hundreds of lung cancer patients. Here, we present a multi-target CD8 T cell peptide COVID-19 vaccine design targeting several structural (S, M, N) and non-structural (NSPs) SARS-CoV-2 proteins with selected epitopes in conserved regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We observed that a single subcutaneous injection of a serie of epitopes induces a robust immunogenicity in-vivo as measured by IFN{gamma} ELIspot. Upon tetramer characterization we found that this serie of epitopes induces a strong proportion of virus-specific CD8 T cells expressing CD103, CD44, CXCR3 and CD49a, the specific phenotype of tissue-resident memory T lymphocytes (Trm). Finally, we observed broad cellular responses, as characterized by IFN{gamma} production, upon restimulation with structural and non-structural protein-derived epitopes using blood T cells isolated from convalescent asymptomatic, moderate and severe COVID-19 patients. These data provide insights for further development of a second generation of COVID-19 vaccine focused on inducing lasting Th1-biased memory CD8 T cell sentinels protection using immunodominant epitopes naturally observed after SARS-CoV-2 infection resolution.\n\nStatement of SignificanceHumoral and cellular adaptive immunity are different and complementary immune defenses engaged by the body to clear viral infection. While neutralizing antibodies have the capacity to block virus binding to its entry receptor expressed on human cells, memory T lymphocytes have the capacity to eliminate infected cells and are required for viral clearance. However, viruses evolve quickly, and their antigens are prone to mutations to avoid recognition by the antibodies (phenomenon named  antigenic drift). This limitation of the antibody-mediated immunity could be addressed by the T-cell mediated immunity, which is able to recognize conserved viral peptides from any viral proteins presented by virus-infected cells. Thus, by targeting several proteins and conserved regions on the genome of a virus, T-cell epitope-based vaccines are less subjected to mutations and may work effectively on different strains of the virus. We designed a multi-target T cell-based vaccine containing epitope regions optimized for CD8+ T cell stimulation that would drive long-lasting cellular immunity with high specificity, avoiding undesired effects such as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) and antibody-induced macrophages hyperinflammation that could be observed in subjects with severe COVID-19. Our in-vivo results showed that a single injection of selected CD8 T cell epitopes induces memory viral-specific T-cell responses with a phenotype of tissue-resident memory T cells (Trm). Trm has attracted a growing interest for developing vaccination strategies since they act as immune sentinels in barrier tissue such as the respiratory tract and the lung. Because of their localization in tissues, they are able to immediately recognize infected cells and, because of their memory phenotypes, they rapidly respond to viral infection by orchestrating local protective immune responses to eliminate pathogens. Lastly, such multiepitope-based vaccination platform uses robust and well-validated synthetic peptide production technologies that can be rapidly manufactured in a distributed manner.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vanessa Gauttier","author_inst":"OSE Immunotherapeutics"},{"author_name":"Aurore Morello","author_inst":"OSE Immunotherapeutics"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Girault","author_inst":"OSE Immunotherapeutics"},{"author_name":"Caroline Mary","author_inst":"OSE Immunotherapeutics"},{"author_name":"Lyssia Belarif","author_inst":"OSE Immunotherapeutics"},{"author_name":"Arianne Desselle","author_inst":"OSE Immunotherapeutics"},{"author_name":"Emmanuelle Wilhelm","author_inst":"OSE Immunotherapeutics"},{"author_name":"Thomas Bourquard","author_inst":"MabSilico"},{"author_name":"Sabrina Pengam","author_inst":"OSE Immunotherapeutics"},{"author_name":"Geraldine Teppaz","author_inst":"OSE Immunotherapeutics"},{"author_name":"Virginie Thepenier","author_inst":"OSE Immunotherapeutics"},{"author_name":"Kevin Biteau","author_inst":"OSE Immunotherapeutics"},{"author_name":"Estelle De Barbeyrac","author_inst":"OSE Immunotherapeutics"},{"author_name":"Delphine Kiepferle","author_inst":"OSE Immunotherapeutics"},{"author_name":"Berangere Vasseur","author_inst":"OSE Immunotherapeutics"},{"author_name":"Francois-Xavier Le Flem","author_inst":"Bataillon de Marins Pompiers de Marseille (BMPM)"},{"author_name":"Didier Debieuvre","author_inst":"groupe hospitalier regional Mulhouse-Sud Alsace (GHRMSA)"},{"author_name":"Dominique Costantini","author_inst":"OSE Immunotherapeutics"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Poirier","author_inst":"OSE Immunotherapeutics"},{"author_name":"Yulong Zong","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Taian City Central Hospital Branch, Taian 271000, China"},{"author_name":"Feng Yin","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Taian City Central Hospital Branch, Taian 271000, China"},{"author_name":"Wanchuan Zhang","author_inst":"Cancer Hospital of China Medical University, Liaoning Cancer Hospital and Institute, Shenyang 110042, China"},{"author_name":"Yumeng Peng","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), Beijing 100071, China"},{"author_name":"Haotian Lin","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), Beijing 100071, China"},{"author_name":"Rui Zhang","author_inst":"Cancer Hospital of China Medical University, Liaoning Cancer Hospital and Institute, Shenyang 110042, China"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), Beijing 100071, China"},{"author_name":"Qi Gao","author_inst":"Hotgen Biotech Co., Ltd.

Emerging data indicates that SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells are detectable in the majority of individuals recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, optimal virus-specific epitopes, the role of pre-existing heterologous immunity as well as their kinetics and differentiation program during disease control have not been defined in detail. Here, we show that both pre-existing and newly induced SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T-cell responses are potentially important determinants of immune protection in mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. In particular, our results can be summarized as follows: First, immunodominant SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T-cell epitopes are targeted in the majority of individuals with convalescent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Second, MHC class I tetramer analyses revealed the emergence of phenotypically diverse and functionally competent pre-existing and newly induced SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD8+ T cells that showed similar characteristics compared to influenza-specific CD8+ T cells. Third, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T-cell responses are more robustly detectable than antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2-spike protein. This was confirmed in a longitudinal analysis of acute-resolving infection that demonstrated rapid induction of the SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells within a week followed by a prolonged contraction phase that outlasted the waning humoral immune response indicating that CD8+ T-cell responses might serve as a more precise correlate of antiviral immunity than antibody measurements after convalescence. Collectively, these data provide new insights into the fine specificity, heterogeneity, and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD8+ T cells, potentially informing the rational development of a protective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":32,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Isabel Schulien","author_inst":"Department of Medicine II (Gastroenterology, Hepatology, Endocrinology and Infectious Diseases), Freiburg University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, Univer"},{"author_name":"Janine Kemming","author_inst":"Department of Medicine II (Gastroenterology, Hepatology, Endocrinology and Infectious Diseases), Freiburg University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, Univer"},{"author_name":"Valerie Oberhardt","author_inst":"Department of Medicine II (Gastroenterology, Hepatology, Endocrinology and Infectious Diseases), Freiburg University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, Univer"},{"author_name":"Katharina Wild","author_inst":"Department of Medicine II (Gastroenterology, Hepatology, Endocrinology and Infectious Diseases), Freiburg University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, Univer"},{"author_name":"Lea M.
