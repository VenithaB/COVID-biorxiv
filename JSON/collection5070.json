We introduce the concept of 'accessible population for transmission of the disease', which can be a small fraction of the total population, for instance when interventions are in force. This assumption, together with the structure of the set of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations for the populations, allows us to decouple the equations into just two equations. This further reduces to a logistic type of equation for the total infected population. The equation can be solved analytically and therefore allows for a clear interpretation of the growth and inhibiting factors in terms of the parameters in the full model. The validity of the 'accessible population' assumption and the efficacy of the reduced logistic model is demonstrated by the ease of fitting the United Kingdom data for the total number of infected cases. The model can also be used to forecast further progression of the disease. The approach further helps us to analyze the original model equations. We show that the original model equations provide a very good fit with the United Kingdom data for the cumulative number of infections. The active infected population of the model is seen to exhibit a turning point around mid-May, suggesting the beginning of a slow-down in the spread of infections. However, the rate of slowing down beyond the turning point is small and therefore the cumulative number of infections is likely to saturate to about 3.8 x 105 only towards the end of July or beginning of August, provided the lock-down conditions continue to prevail. Noting that the fits obtained from the reduced logistic equation and the full model equations are equally good, the underlying causes for the limited forecasting ability of the reduced logistic equation is elucidated. The model and the procedure adopted here are expected to be useful in fitting the data for other countries and forecasting the progression of the disease.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Garani Ananthakrishna","author_inst":"Materials Research Centre, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru 560012, India"},{"author_name":"Jagadish Kumar","author_inst":"Utkal University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.27.20111955","rel_title":"Age separation dramatically reduces COVID-19 mortality rate in a computational model of a large population","rel_date":"2020-05-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.27.20111955","rel_abs":"COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global lock down in many countries throughout the world. Faced with a new reality, and until a vaccine or efficient treatment is found, humanity must figure out ways to keep economy going on one hand, yet keep the population safe on the other hand, especially those that are susceptible to this virus. Here we use a network simulation, with parameters that were drawn from what is known about the virus, to explore 5 different scenarios of partial lock down release. We find that separating age groups by reducing interactions between age groups, protects the general population and reduces mortality rates. Furthermore, addition of new connections within the same age group to compensate for the lost connections outside the age group, still has a strong beneficial influence and reduces the total death toll by 66%. While complete isolation from society may be the most protective scenario for the elderly population, it would have an emotional and possibly cognitive impact that might outweigh its benefit. We therefore propose creating age-related social recommendations or even restrictions, thereby allowing social connections but still strong protection for the older population.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Liron Mizrahi","author_inst":"University of Haifa"},{"author_name":"Shani Stern","author_inst":"University of Haifa"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.27.20115212","rel_title":"Monitoring and forecasting the number of reported and unreported cases of the COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil using Particle Filter","rel_date":"2020-05-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.27.20115212","rel_abs":"In this paper, we combine algorithm of Liu & West for the Particle Filter (PF) with SIRU-type epidemic model to monitor and forecast cases of Covid-19 in Brazil from February up to September.

To aid in this effort, we develop a risk calculator for COVID-19 mortality based on various socio-demographic factors and pre-existing conditions for the US adult population by combining information from the UK-based OpenSAFELY study, with mortality rates by age and ethnicity available across US states. We tailor the tool to produce absolute risks for individuals in future time frames by incorporating information on pandemic dynamics at the community level as available from forecasting models. We apply this risk calculation model to available data on prevalence and co-occurrences of the risk-factors from a variety of data sources to project risk for the general adult population across 477 US cities (defined as Census Places) and for the 65 years and older Medicare population across 3,113 US counties, respectively. Validation analyses based on these projected risks and data on tens of thousands of recent deaths show that the model is well calibrated for the US population. Projections show that the model can identify relatively small fractions of the population (e.g. 4.3%) which will lead to a disproportionately large number of deaths (e.g. 49.8%), and thus will be useful for effectively targeting individuals for early vaccinations, but there will be wide variation in risk distribution across US communities. We provide a web-based tool for individualized risk calculations and interactive maps for viewing the city-, county- and state-level risk projections.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jin Jin","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Neha Agarwala","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Maryland, Baltimore County"},{"author_name":"Prosenjit Kundu","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Harvey","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Yuqi Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Eliza Wallace","author_inst":"PolicyMap Corp"},{"author_name":"Nilanjan Chatterjee","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.27.20107656","rel_title":"The expediency of local modelling to aid national responses to SARS-CoV-2.","rel_date":"2020-05-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.27.20107656","rel_abs":"Background: With the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic gripping most of the globe, healthcare and economic recovery strategies are being explored currently as a matter of urgency. Methods: We adopted the epidemiological model which informs United Kingdom government's national policy on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and used it in a local context and show how projections in terms of presentations of symptomatic patients in a variety of settings differ depending on local demographics. Setting: England, United Kingdom, population level modelled 3.2m Results: We clearly demonstrate that there is significant difference in the way the modelling behaves in terms of potential subsequent waves for levels of demand on the health and care systems. This provides evidence of differing timeline of peak demands and clearly shows varying levels of demand throughout the four modelled sub-geographies. Conclusions: The study results clearly outline the expediency of national modelling being adopted to reflect local health and care systems. We urge readers to ensure that any national policy is appropriately adopted to suit local health and care systems. In addition, we share our methodology to ensure other professionals could replicate this study elsewhere. Background National governments are forced to take urgent action with national policy restricting social interactions and businesses to temporarily close. In order to fully understand how the limited health and care resources could be targeted in response to this pandemic, we need to create a thorough understanding of the impact of national policy on local health and care systems. The guiding principle and understanding here is that health and care services are provided locally not nationally, not in aggregate but to individuals. Therefore, we conducted a study using existing models which are used to inform national policy and adapted these to consider local nuances to see whether such projective model would behave differently; showing how projections in terms of presentations of symptomatic patients in a variety of settings differ depending on local demographics. This v2 includes some minor revisions and clarifications as well as some additions in terms of relevant references.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bernard M Groen","author_inst":"Durham University"},{"author_name":"Paul Turner","author_inst":"University of Lincoln"},{"author_name":"Peter Lacey","author_inst":"Whole System Partnership"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Harvey","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Yuqi Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Eliza Wallace","author_inst":"PolicyMap Corp"},{"author_name":"Nilanjan Chatterjee","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.28.20115477","rel_title":"Study of the Sudanese perceptions of COVID-19: Applying the Health Belief Model.","rel_date":"2020-05-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.28.20115477","rel_abs":"Abstract Background COVID-19 a pandemic declared by WHO is the first in recent history pose challenges on public health.

We used a snowball sampling technique starting from known professional and social media groups and individuals and then was distributed on various internet platforms. The survey instrument was based on HBM constructs. Results Some 877 individuals participated in the survey with a mean age of 37.8 more males mostly having a university education employed and residing in Khartoum. More than half of the participants scored high in almost all Health Belief Model constructs except for benefits of hand hygiene. The findings show that the HBM constructs are correlated to each other as well as to other socio-demographic factors. Self-efficacy correlated negatively with susceptibility while positively with severity benefits of and barriers to hand hygiene, benefits and barriers to social distancing respectively. Conclusion The findings show that the HBM constructs are correlated to each other as well as to other socio-demographic factors. Self-efficacy must be taken into account as a strong changing factor to susceptibility and severity perceptions. Correlations found in this study might help drive behaviour-changing efforts.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elwalid Fadul Nasir","author_inst":"King Faisal University"},{"author_name":"Hatim Almahdi Almahdi","author_inst":"King Faisal University"},{"author_name":"Ahmed Khalid alhag","author_inst":"King Faisal University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Harvey","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Yuqi Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Eliza Wallace","author_inst":"PolicyMap Corp"},{"author_name":"Nilanjan Chatterjee","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.27.20115113","rel_title":"COVID-19 Lockdown in a Kenyan Informal Settlement: Impacts on Household Energy and Food Security","rel_date":"2020-05-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.27.20115113","rel_abs":"A COVID-19 lockdown may impact household fuel use and food security for ~700 million sub-Saharan Africans who rely on polluting fuels (e.g. wood, kerosene) for household energy and typically work in the informal economy.

During lockdown, 95% of participants indicated income decline or cessation and 88% reported being food insecure. Three quarters of participants cooked less frequently and half altered their diet. One quarter (27%) of households primarily using liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking before lockdown switched to kerosene (14%) or wood (13%).

In addition to the many factors that can influence these discrepancies, we suggest a biological aspect, the genetic variation at the viral S protein receptor in human cells, ACE2 (angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2), which may contribute to the worse clinical outcome in males and in some regions worldwide. We performed exomics analysis in native and admixed South American populations, and we also conducted in silico genomics databank investigations in populations from other continents. Interestingly, at least ten polymorphisms in coding, noncoding and regulatory sites were found that can shed light on this issue and offer a plausible biological explanation for these epidemiological differences.

The genetic variation of ACE2 function and expression across populations is still poorly understood. This study aims at better understanding the genetic basis of COVID-19 outcomes by studying association between genetic variation in ACE2 and disease severity in the Iranian population. Methods: We analyzed two large Iranian cohorts and several publicly available human population variant databases to identify novel and previously known ACE2 exonic variants present in the Iranian population and considered those as candidate variants for association between genetic variation and disease severity. We genotyped these variants across three groups of COVID-19 patients with different clinical outcomes (mild disease, severe disease, and death) and evaluated this genetic variation with regard to clinical outcomes. Results: We identified 32 exonic variants present in Iranian cohorts or other public variant databases. Among those, 11 variants are novel and have thus not been described in other populations previously. Following genotyping of these 32 candidate variants, only the synonymous polymorphism (c.2247G>A) was detected across the three groups of COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: Genetic variability of known and novel exonic variants was low among our COVID-19 patients. Our results do not provide support for the hypothesis that exonic variation in ACE2 has a sizeable impact on COVID-19 severity across the Iranian population.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amin Ardeshirdavani","author_inst":"Department of Electrical Engineering (ESAT), STADIUS Center for Dynamical Systems, Signal Processing and Data Analytics, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium."},{"author_name":"Pooya Zakeri","author_inst":"Centre for Brain and Disease Research, Flanders Institute for Biotechnology (VIB), Leuven, Belgium.

of novel coronavirus has raised concerns about nosocomial transmission; that is, transmission within healthcare settings. Research from previous outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases suggests a major cause of nosocomial transmission is healthcare professionals' poor compliance with recommended personal protective behaviours. This rapid evidence review explored existing literature on emerging infectious disease outbreaks to identify factors associated with compliance with social and behavioural infection control measures among healthcare staff. 56 papers were reviewed and several positive associations were found: Staff working in emergency or intensive care settings appeared more likely to comply with recommendations than those in other settings, and there was some evidence that contact with confirmed cases could improve compliance. There was some evidence that staff with higher levels of anxiety and higher concern about the risk of infection were more likely to comply with recommended behaviour, and that monitoring from superiors could improve compliance. Several negative associations were also found. Observed non-compliance of colleagues could hinder compliance. Staff identified many barriers to compliance related to personal protective equipment, including availability; perceived difficulty and effectiveness; inconvenience; discomfort; and a negative impact on patient care. There appeared to be many issues regarding the communication and ease of understanding of infection control guidance. Based on the results of this review we recommend provision of training and education tailored for different occupational roles within the healthcare setting; managerial staff 'leading by example'; ensuring adequate resources for infection control; and timely provision of practical evidence-based infection control guidelines.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samantha K Brooks","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Neil Greenberg","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Simon Wessely","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"G James Rubin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Richard Wang","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Neeta Thakur","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Kristin Slown","author_inst":"3.\tDepartment of Pharmaceutical Services, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Priya B Shete","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Martin Rofael","author_inst":"1.\tDivision of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco CA, USA"},{"author_name":"John Z Metcalfe","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Cindy Merrifield","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Carina Marquez","author_inst":"4.\tDivision of HIV, Infectious Diseases, and Global Medicine, Department of Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Fr"},{"author_name":"Katherine Malcolm","author_inst":"1.\tDivision of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Michael Lipnick","author_inst":"5.\tDepartment of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Vivek Jain","author_inst":"4.\tDivision of HIV, Infectious Diseases, and Global Medicine, Department of Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Fr"},{"author_name":"Antonio Gomez","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Gregory Burns","author_inst":"5.\tDepartment of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Lillian B Brown","author_inst":"4.\tDivision of HIV, Infectious Diseases, and Global Medicine, Department of Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Fr"},{"author_name":"Christopher Berger","author_inst":"1.\tDivision of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Vincent Auyeung","author_inst":"1.\tDivision of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Adithya Cattamanchi","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Carolyn M Hendrickson","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.27.20114272","rel_title":"How did governmental interventions affect the spread of COVID-19 in European countries?","rel_date":"2020-05-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.27.20114272","rel_abs":"Background To reduce transmission of Coronavirus Disease 2019, European governments have implemented successive measures to encourage social distancing. However, it remained unclear how effectively measures reduced the spread of the virus, due to data complications. We examined how the effective-contact rate (ECR) among European citizens evolved over the period with implemented measures using a new data-oriented approach that is based on an extended Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model. Methods Using the available data on the confirmed numbers of infections and hospitalizations, we first estimated the daily number of infectious-, exposed- and susceptible individuals and subsequently estimated the ECR with an iterative Poisson regression model, disregarding information on governmental measures. We then studied change points in the daily ECRs to the moments of the governmental measures. Results The change points in the daily ECRs were found to align with the implementation of governmental interventions. At the end of the considered time-window, we found similar ECRs for Italy (0{middle dot}29), Spain (0{middle dot}24), and Germany (0{middle dot}27), while the ECR in the Netherlands (0{middle dot}34), Belgium (0{middle dot}35) and the UK (0{middle dot}37) were somewhat higher. The highest ECR was found for Sweden (0{middle dot}45). Interpretation There seemed to be an immediate effect of banning events and closing schools, typically among the first measures taken by the governments. The effect of additionally closing bars and restaurants seemed limited. For most countries a somewhat delayed effect of the full lockdown was observed, and the ECR after a full lockdown was not necessarily lower than an ECR after (only) a gathering ban.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Richard Andries Jacobus Post","author_inst":"Eindhoven University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Marta Regis","author_inst":"Eindhoven University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhuozhao Zhan","author_inst":"Eindhoven University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Edwin R van den Heuvel","author_inst":"Eindhoven Unversity of Technology"},{"author_name":"Richard Wang","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Neeta Thakur","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Kristin Slown","author_inst":"3.\tDepartment of Pharmaceutical Services, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Priya B Shete","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Martin Rofael","author_inst":"1.\tDivision of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco CA, USA"},{"author_name":"John Z Metcalfe","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Cindy Merrifield","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Carina Marquez","author_inst":"4.\tDivision of HIV, Infectious Diseases, and Global Medicine, Department of Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Fr"},{"author_name":"Katherine Malcolm","author_inst":"1.\tDivision of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Michael Lipnick","author_inst":"5.\tDepartment of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Vivek Jain","author_inst":"4.\tDivision of HIV, Infectious Diseases, and Global Medicine, Department of Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Fr"},{"author_name":"Antonio Gomez","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Gregory Burns","author_inst":"5.\tDepartment of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Lillian B Brown","author_inst":"4.\tDivision of HIV, Infectious Diseases, and Global Medicine, Department of Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Fr"},{"author_name":"Christopher Berger","author_inst":"1.\tDivision of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Vincent Auyeung","author_inst":"1.\tDivision of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Adithya Cattamanchi","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Carolyn M Hendrickson","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.26.20113019","rel_title":"Modelling Capacity on London Underground Carriages in Light of UK Government Mandated Social Distancing Rules in Response to the Covid-19 Pandemic.","rel_date":"2020-05-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.26.20113019","rel_abs":"The UK has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and London in particular has experienced a large number of cases.

Drug repurposing has played a key part in this response. The rapid increase in trial activity has raised questions about efficiency and lack of coordination. Our objective was to develop a user-friendly, open access database to monitor and rapidly identify trials of medicinal products. Methods: Using the US clinicaltrials.gov (NCT) registry, the EU Clinical Trials Register (EUCTR) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), we identified all COVID-19 trials of medicinal products. Trials that were out of scope and duplicates were excluded. A manual encoding was performed to ascertain key information (e.g. trial aim, type of intervention etc). The database, Covid19db, is published online at: http:\/\/www.redo-project.org\/covid19db\/. Results: Descriptive statistics of the database from April 4th 2020 through to August 18th show an increase from 186 to 1618 trials, or an average of 10.5 new trials registered per day. Over this period, the proportion of trials including a repurposing arm decreased slightly (from a maximum of 75% to 64% at the end of the covered period) as did the proportion of trials aiming to prevent infection (from a maximum of 16% to 13%). The most popular trial intervention is hydroxychloroquine (212 trials), followed by azithromycin (64 trials), tocilizumab, favipiravir and chloroquine (145 trials). Total planned enrolment is 1064556 participants as of 18th August 2020. Conclusions: we have developed an open access and regularly updated tool to monitor clinical trials of medicinal products to prevent or treat infection by SARS-CoV-2 globally. Our analysis shows a high number of 'me-too' trials, in particular for some repurposed drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and tocilizumab, substantiating calls for better coordination and better use of trial resources.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pan Pantziarka","author_inst":"Anticancer Fund"},{"author_name":"Liese Vandeborne","author_inst":"Anticancer Fund"},{"author_name":"Lydie Meheus","author_inst":"Anticancer Fund"},{"author_name":"Gauthier Bouche","author_inst":"Anticancer Fund"},{"author_name":"Richard Wang","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Neeta Thakur","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Kristin Slown","author_inst":"3.\tDepartment of Pharmaceutical Services, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Priya B Shete","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Martin Rofael","author_inst":"1.\tDivision of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco CA, USA"},{"author_name":"John Z Metcalfe","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Cindy Merrifield","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Carina Marquez","author_inst":"4.\tDivision of HIV, Infectious Diseases, and Global Medicine, Department of Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Fr"},{"author_name":"Katherine Malcolm","author_inst":"1.\tDivision of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Michael Lipnick","author_inst":"5.\tDepartment of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Vivek Jain","author_inst":"4.\tDivision of HIV, Infectious Diseases, and Global Medicine, Department of Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Fr"},{"author_name":"Antonio Gomez","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Gregory Burns","author_inst":"5.\tDepartment of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Lillian B Brown","author_inst":"4.\tDivision of HIV, Infectious Diseases, and Global Medicine, Department of Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Fr"},{"author_name":"Christopher Berger","author_inst":"1.\tDivision of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Vincent Auyeung","author_inst":"1.\tDivision of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Adithya Cattamanchi","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Carolyn M Hendrickson","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.27.20114983","rel_title":"A call for governments to pause Twitter censorship: a cross-sectional study using Twitter data as social-spatial sensors of COVID-19\/SARS-CoV-2 research diffusion","rel_date":"2020-05-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.27.20114983","rel_abs":"Objectives: To determine whether Twitter data can be used as social-spatial sensors to show how research on COVID-19\/SARS-CoV-2 diffuses through the population to reach the people that are especially affected by the disease. Design: Cross-sectional bibliometric analysis conducted between 23rd March and 14th April 2020. Setting: Three sources of data were used in the analysis: (1) deaths per number of population for COVID-19\/SARS-CoV-2 retrieved from Coronavirus Resource Center at John Hopkins University and Worldometer, (2) publications related to COVID-19\/SARS-CoV-2 retrieved from WHO COVID-19 database of global publications, and (3) tweets of these publications retrieved from Altmetric.com and Twitter. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): To map Twitter activity against number of publications and deaths per number of population worldwide and in the USA states. To determine the relationship between number of tweets as dependent variable and deaths per number of population and number of publications as independent variables. Results: Deaths per one hundred thousand population for countries ranged from 0 to 104, and deaths per one million population for USA states ranged from 2 to 513. Total number of publications used in the analysis was 1761, and total number of tweets used in the analysis was 751,068. Mapping of worldwide data illustrated that high Twitter activity was related to high numbers of COVID-19\/SARS-CoV-2 deaths, with tweets inversely weighted with number of publications. Poisson regression models of worldwide data showed a positive correlation between the national deaths per number of population and tweets when holding the country's number of publications constant (coefficient 0.0285, S.E. 0.0003, p<0.001). Conversely, this relationship was negatively correlated in USA states (coefficient -0.0013, S.E. 0.0001, p<0.001). Conclusions: This study shows that Twitter can play a crucial role in the rapid research response during the COVID-19\/SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic, especially to spread research with prompt public scrutiny. Governments are urged to pause censorship of social media platforms during these unprecedented times to support the scientific community's fight against COVID-19\/SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vanash Patel","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Robin Haunschild","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research"},{"author_name":"Lutz Bornmann","author_inst":"Max Planck Society"},{"author_name":"George Garas","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Richard Wang","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Neeta Thakur","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Kristin Slown","author_inst":"3.\tDepartment of Pharmaceutical Services, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Priya B Shete","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Martin Rofael","author_inst":"1.\tDivision of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco CA, USA"},{"author_name":"John Z Metcalfe","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Cindy Merrifield","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Carina Marquez","author_inst":"4.\tDivision of HIV, Infectious Diseases, and Global Medicine, Department of Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Fr"},{"author_name":"Katherine Malcolm","author_inst":"1.\tDivision of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Michael Lipnick","author_inst":"5.\tDepartment of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Vivek Jain","author_inst":"4.\tDivision of HIV, Infectious Diseases, and Global Medicine, Department of Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Fr"},{"author_name":"Antonio Gomez","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Gregory Burns","author_inst":"5.\tDepartment of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Lillian B Brown","author_inst":"4.\tDivision of HIV, Infectious Diseases, and Global Medicine, Department of Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Fr"},{"author_name":"Christopher Berger","author_inst":"1.\tDivision of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Vincent Auyeung","author_inst":"1.\tDivision of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Adithya Cattamanchi","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Carolyn M Hendrickson","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.27.20114694","rel_title":"The association between treatment with heparin and survival in patients with Covid-19","rel_date":"2020-05-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.27.20114694","rel_abs":"Objectives: This study investigates the association between the treatment with heparin and mortality in patients admitted with Covid-19. Methods: Routinely recorded, clinical data, up to the 24th of April 2020, from the 2075 patients with Covid-19, admitted in 17 hospitals in Spain between the 1st of March and the 20th of April 2020 were used. The following variables were extracted for this study: age, gender, temperature, and saturation of oxygen on admission, treatment with heparin, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, steroids, tocilizumab, a combination of lopinavir with ritonavir, and oseltamivir, together with data on mortality. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to investigate the associations. Results: At the time of collecting the data, 301 patients had died, 1447 had been discharged home from the hospitals, 201 were still admitted, and 126 had been transferred to hospitals not included in the study. Median follow up time was 8 (IQR:5-12) days. Heparin had been used in 1734 patients. Heparin was associated with lower mortality when the model was adjusted for age and gender, with OR (95%CI): 0.55 (0.37-0.82) p=0.003.

Identifying biologic markers associated with prognosis can help clinicians recognize disease severity. Objective: To describe the association between D-dimer, CRP, IL-6, ferritin, LDH, and clinical outcomes in a cohort of COVID-19 patients treated on the inpatient medical service at a university hospital in Washington, DC. Design: In this retrospective study, we included all adults admitted to the inpatient medicine service at George Washington University Hospital between March 12, 2020 and May 9, 2020 with laboratory confirmed COVID-19. Clinical and laboratory data were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors not requiring ICU transfer, survivors requiring ICU transfer, survivors requiring intubation, and non-survivors. Key Results: 299 patients were included in our study, of whom 69 required transfer to the ICU, 39 required intubation, and 71 died. Threshold values for IL-6 (>50 pg\/mL), D-dimer (>3 mcg\/mL), ferritin (>450 ng\/mL), CRP (>100 mg\/L), and LDH (1,200 u\/L) were found to be statistically significant and independently associated with higher odd of clinical deterioration and death. Hypertension, CVA and heart disease independently had an increased risk of all three outcomes, while CKD had only an increased risk of death. Patient co-morbidities had no effect on the different biomarkers' significant association with poor patient clinical outcomes, except cancer.

Very high infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 virus and substantial disease severity caused medical care capacity shortage in many countries. Therefore, real-time epidemic forecasting of the COVID-19 is useful to plan public health strategies like country lockdown and healthcare reorganization. We used extended susceptible-infected-removed (eSIR) model to predict the epidemic trend of COVID-19 in Poland under different scenarios of the lockdown and lockdown removal. We used time-series data of SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 4 to May 22 2020. Our forecast includes the impact of a timeline of preventive measures introduced in Poland. Using eSIR algorithm we estimated the basic reproductive number and a total number of infections under different epidemic trend scenarios. Using eSIR modeling we estimated that the basic reproductive number in Poland concerning different scenarios of the lockdown removal is in a range of 3.91-4.79. The lowest predicted number of infected cases would be 263 900 (0 - 1 734 200, 95%CI) if the strict protective measures were maintained until the end of September. However, under different scenarios of precautions removal, a total number of infected cases may exceed one million within the next year. Relatively early introduction of strong precautions in Poland significantly slowed down epidemic spread in Poland in comparison with other European countries like Italy or Spain. However, early removal of protective measures may result in a significant increase in infection. Data shows that the number of new COVID-19 cases in Poland beyond May 18 is linear what could be a prognosis of a duration of the epidemic exceeding 300 days.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Magdalena Orzechowska","author_inst":"Medical University of Lodz, Poland"},{"author_name":"Andrzej K.

Methods: New models constructed showing the relationship of the I(prime) (the number of infected individuals divided by the total population of a city) with the independent variables -time, temperature, relative humidity, and wind velocity. The regression models fitting in the data were statistically validated by : 1) plot of observed and predicted response; 2) standardized residual plots showing the characteristics of errors; 3) adjusted R^2 value; 4) the p value for the parameters associated with the various independent variables; and 5) the predictive power of the model beyond data points. Results: Models indicate that 1) the transmission of COVID-19 could be relatively high either for elevated temperatures with lower relative humidity or for lower temperatures with higher relative humidity conditions; 2) disease transmission is expected to be reduced more with higher wind velocity; 3) the rate of increase in the number of COVID-19 cases increases in one model with a constant rate and in the other two with varying rates in time. These transmission features seem to have connections with the structural components of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Reliable estimates of cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population are critical to tracking the extent of transmission and informing policies, but US data are lacking, in part because societal closure complicates study conduct. Objective: To estimate the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and percent of infections diagnosed in New York State, overall and by region, age, sex, and race and ethnicity. Design: Statewide cross-sectional seroprevalence study, conducted April 19-28, 2020. Setting: Grocery stores (n=99) located in 26 counties throughout NYS, which were essential businesses that remained open during a period of societal closure and attract a heterogenous clientele. Participants: Convenience sample of patrons >=18 years and residing in New York State, recruited consecutively upon entering stores and via an in-store flyer. Exposures: Region (New York City, Westchester\/Rockland, Long Island, Rest of New York State), age, sex, race and ethnicity. Main Outcomes: Primary outcome: cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, based on dry-blood spot (DBS) SARS-CoV-2 antibody reactivity; secondary outcome: percent of infections diagnosed. Results: Among 15,101 adults with suitable DBS specimens, 1,887 (12.5%) were reactive using a validated SARS-CoV-2 IgG microsphere immunoassay (sensitivity 87.9%, specificity 99.75%). Following post-stratification weighting on region, sex, age, and race and ethnicity and adjustment for assay characteristics, estimated cumulative incidence through March 29 was 14.0% (95% CI: 13.3-14.7%), corresponding to 2,139,300 (95% CI: 2,035,800-2,242,800) infection-experienced adults. Cumulative incidence was higher among Hispanic\/Latino (29.2%, 95% CI: 27.2-31.2%), non-Hispanic black\/African American (20.2% 95% CI, 18.1-22.3%), and non-Hispanic Asian (12.4%, 95% CI: 9.4-15.4%) adults than non-Hispanic white adults (8.1%, 95% CI: 7.4-8.7%, p<.0001). Cumulative incidence was highest in New York City (NYC) 22.7% (95% CI: 21.5%-24.0).

Our context is an effort to inform policy regarding social behavior, to mitigate strain on hospital capacity. The model unknowns are taken to be: the time-varying transmission rate, the fraction of exposed cases that require hospitalization, and the time-varying detection probabilities of new asymptomatic and symptomatic cases. In simulations, we obtain accurate estimates of undetected (that is, unmeasured) infectious populations, by measuring the detected cases together with the recovered and dead - and without assumed knowledge of the detection rates. These state estimates require a measurement of the recovered population, and are tolerant to low errors in that measurement. Further, excellent estimates of all quantities are obtained using a temporal baseline of 112 days, with the exception of the time-varying transmission rate at times prior to the implementation of social distancing. The estimation of this transmission rate is sensitive to contamination in the data, highlighting the need for accurate and uniform methods of reporting. Finally, we employ the procedure using real data from Italy reported by Johns Hopkins. The aim of this paper is not to assign extreme significance to the results of these specific experiments \\textit{per se}.

We hypothesized that males and females in different age groups might have different epidemic trajectories. Methods: Using publicly available data from South Korea, daily new COVID-19 cases were fitted with generalized additive models, assuming Poisson and negative binomial distributions. Epidemic dynamics by age and gender groups were explored with interactions between smoothed time terms and age and gender. Results: A negative binomial distribution fitted the daily case counts best. Interaction between the dynamic patterns of daily new cases and age groups was statistically significant (p<0.001), but not with gender group. People aged 20-39 years led the epidemic processes in the society with two peaks: one major peak around March 1 and a smaller peak around April 7, 2020. The epidemic process among people aged 60 or above was trailing behind that of younger people with smaller magnitude. After March 15, there was a consistent decline of daily new cases among elderly people, despite large fluctuations of case counts among young adults. Conclusions: Although young people drove the COVID-19 epidemic in the whole society with multiple rebounds, elderly people could still be protected from virus infection after the peak of epidemic.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xinhua Yu","author_inst":"University of Memphis"},{"author_name":"Jiasong Duan","author_inst":"University of Memphis"},{"author_name":"Yu Jiang","author_inst":"University of Memphis"},{"author_name":"Hongmei Zhang","author_inst":"University of Memphis"},{"author_name":"Meredith A Barranco","author_inst":"University at Albany School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Linda M Styer","author_inst":"Wadsworth Center, New York State Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Monica M Parker","author_inst":"Wadsworth Center, New York State Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Shu-Yin John Leung","author_inst":"New York State Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Johanne Morne","author_inst":"New York State Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Danielle Greene","author_inst":"New York State Department of Health"},{"author_name":"David R Holtgrave","author_inst":"University at Albany School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Dina Hoefer","author_inst":"New York State Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Jessica Kumar","author_inst":"New York State Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Tomoko Udo","author_inst":"University at Albany School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Brad Hutton","author_inst":"New York State Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Howard A Zucker","author_inst":"New York State Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Gregory Burns","author_inst":"5.\tDepartment of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Lillian B Brown","author_inst":"4.\tDivision of HIV, Infectious Diseases, and Global Medicine, Department of Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Fr"},{"author_name":"Christopher Berger","author_inst":"1.\tDivision of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Vincent Auyeung","author_inst":"1.\tDivision of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Adithya Cattamanchi","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Carolyn M Hendrickson","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.27.20114728","rel_title":"Lessons from movement ecology for the return to work: modeling contacts and the spread of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.27.20114728","rel_abs":"Human behavior (movement, social contacts) plays a central role in the spread of pathogens like SARS-CoV-2. The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 was driven by global human movement, and recent lockdown measures aim to localize movement and contact in order to slow spread. Thus, movement and contact patterns need to be explicitly considered when making reopening decisions, especially regarding return to work. Here, as a case study, we consider the initial stages of resuming research at a large research university, using approaches from movement ecology and contact network epidemiology. First, we develop a dynamical pathogen model describing movement between home and work; we show that limiting social contact, via reduced people or reduced time in the workplace are fairly equivalent strategies to slow pathogen spread. Second, we develop a model based on spatial contact patterns within a specific office and lab building on campus; we show that restricting on-campus activities to labs (rather than labs and offices) could dramatically alter (modularize) contact network structure and thus, potentially reduce relative risk of pathogen spread. Here we argue that explicitly accounting for human movement and contact behavior in the workplace can provide additional insights to be used in conjunction with ongoing public health efforts.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Allison K Shaw","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Lauren A White","author_inst":"University of Maryland College Park"},{"author_name":"Matthew Michalska-Smith","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth T Borer","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Meggan E Craft","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Eric W Seabloom","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Emilie Snell-Rood","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Michael Travisano","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Johanne Morne","author_inst":"New York State Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Danielle Greene","author_inst":"New York State Department of Health"},{"author_name":"David R Holtgrave","author_inst":"University at Albany School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Dina Hoefer","author_inst":"New York State Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Jessica Kumar","author_inst":"New York State Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Tomoko Udo","author_inst":"University at Albany School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Brad Hutton","author_inst":"New York State Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Howard A Zucker","author_inst":"New York State Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Gregory Burns","author_inst":"5.\tDepartment of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Lillian B Brown","author_inst":"4.\tDivision of HIV, Infectious Diseases, and Global Medicine, Department of Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Fr"},{"author_name":"Christopher Berger","author_inst":"1.\tDivision of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Vincent Auyeung","author_inst":"1.\tDivision of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Adithya Cattamanchi","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Carolyn M Hendrickson","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.26.20113258","rel_title":"Belief in Conspiracy Theory about COVID-19 Predicts Mental Health and Well-being -- A Study of Healthcare Staff in Ecuador","rel_date":"2020-05-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.26.20113258","rel_abs":"Abstract Objective: We aim to provide the first evidence of belief in conspiracy theory regarding the COVID-19 virus as a predictor of the mental health and well-being of healthcare workers. Methods: We conducted a survey of 252 healthcare workers in Ecuador from April 10 to May 2, 2020. Results: In Ecuador, 32.54% of the sampled healthcare workers experienced distress disorder, and 28.17% had anxiety disorder. Compared to healthcare workers who were not sure where the virus originated, those who believed the virus was developed intentionally in a lab reported higher levels of distress and anxiety, and lower levels of job satisfaction and life satisfaction. Older healthcare workers and those who exercise more reported higher job satisfaction. Married healthcare workers, those who exercise more, and those not infected reported higher life satisfaction. Conclusion: This paper identifies belief in a COVID-19 conspiracy theory as an important predictor of distress, anxiety, and job and life satisfaction of healthcare workers. It enables mental health services to better target and help mentally vulnerable healthcare workers during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xi Chen","author_inst":"University of Nottingham Ningbo"},{"author_name":"Stephen X.

The benefit-risk balance for use of lopinavir-ritonavir in COVID-19 needs to be monitored on an ongoing basis, therefore a systematic benefit-risk assessment was designed and conducted. A key objective of this study was to provide a platform for a dynamic systematic benefit-risk evaluation; although initially this evaluation is likely to contain limited information, it is required due to the urgent unmet public need. Importantly it allows additional data to be incorporated as it becomes available, and re-evaluation of the benefit-risk profile. Methods: A systematic benefit-risk assessment was conducted using the Benefit-Risk Action team (BRAT) framework. The exposure of interest was lopinavir-ritonavir treatment in COVID-19 compared to standard of care, placebo or other treatments. A literature search was conducted in PubMed and EmBase to identify peer-reviewed papers reporting clinical outcomes. Two clinicians constructed a value tree and ranked key benefits and risks in order of considered clinical importance. Results: In comparison to standard of care, data for several key benefits and risks were identified for lopinavir-ritonavir. Time to clinical improvement was not significantly different for lopinavir-ritonavir in comparison to standard of care (HR=1.31, 95% CI:0.95, 1.80). There appeared to be fewer serious adverse events with lopinavir-ritonavir (20%) vs standard of care (32%). In particular, there were fewer cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome with lopinavir-ritonavir compared to standard of care (13% vs 27%). Limited data were available for comparison of lopinavir-ritonavir to other treatments. Conclusions: Based on currently available data, there was no clear benefit for use of lopinavir-ritonavir compared to standard of care in severe COVID-19. Risk data suggested a possible decrease in serious adverse events, including acute respiratory distress syndrome. Overall, the benefit-risk profile for lopinavir-ritonavir in severe COVID-19 cannot be considered positive until further efficacy and effectiveness data become available.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vicki Osborne","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit"},{"author_name":"Miranda Davies","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit"},{"author_name":"Samantha Lane","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit"},{"author_name":"Alison Evans","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline Denyer","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit"},{"author_name":"Sandeep Dhanda","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit"},{"author_name":"Debabrata Roy","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit"},{"author_name":"Saad AW Shakir","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit"},{"author_name":"Johanne Morne","author_inst":"New York State Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Danielle Greene","author_inst":"New York State Department of Health"},{"author_name":"David R Holtgrave","author_inst":"University at Albany School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Dina Hoefer","author_inst":"New York State Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Jessica Kumar","author_inst":"New York State Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Tomoko Udo","author_inst":"University at Albany School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Brad Hutton","author_inst":"New York State Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Howard A Zucker","author_inst":"New York State Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Gregory Burns","author_inst":"5.\tDepartment of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Lillian B Brown","author_inst":"4.\tDivision of HIV, Infectious Diseases, and Global Medicine, Department of Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Fr"},{"author_name":"Christopher Berger","author_inst":"1.\tDivision of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Vincent Auyeung","author_inst":"1.\tDivision of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Adithya Cattamanchi","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Carolyn M Hendrickson","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.27.20113951","rel_title":"Knowledge, attitude, and perceptions towards the 2019 Coronavirus Pandemic: A bi-national survey in Africa","rel_date":"2020-05-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.27.20113951","rel_abs":"The current Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has changed and impacted lives on a global scale since its emergence and spread from China in late 2019.

However, the control of this pandemic still remains unachievable in many African countries including Egypt and Nigeria, despite the application of some strict preventive and control measures. Therefore, this study assessed the knowledge, attitude and perceptions of Egyptians and Nigerians towards COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 1437 respondents were included in this preliminary cross-sectional survey. The mean knowledge score was 14.7 plusmn 2.3. The majority of the respondents (61.6%) had a satisfactory knowledge of the disease. Age (18-39 years), education (College\/bachelors) and background of respondents were factors influencing knowledge levels. The attitude of most respondents (68.9%) towards the preventive measures was satisfactory with an average attitude score of 6.9 plusmn 1.2. The majority of the respondents (96%) practiced self-isolation and social-distancing but only 36% follow all health recommendations. The perception of most respondents (62.1%) on the global efforts at controlling the virus and preventing further spread was satisfactory with an average score of 10.9 plusmn 2.7. A satisfactory knowledge of COVID-19 was significantly associated with good attitude and perceptions (p < 0.001) of respondents. Only 22% of the respondents were satisfied with their country prime s handling of the pandemic. It is imperative that to avoid Africa being the next epicenter of the pandemic.

Since, there is an unprecedented global effort to develop a vaccine against the COVID-19 disease much less is known about its acceptance in the community. Understanding key determinants that influence the preferences and demands of a future vaccine by the community may help to develop strategies for improving the global vaccination program. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of the acceptancy of COVID-19 vaccine and their determinants among people in Saudi Arabia. Methods A web-based cross-sectional study was designed using snowball sampling strategies under a highly restricted environment. A bilingual self-administered anonymous questionnaire was designed and send to 1000 study participants through social media platforms and email. Study participants were recruited across the country, including the four major cities (Riyadh, Dammam, Jeddah, and Abha) in Saudi Arabia. Associations between COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and sociodemographic profile of the respondents were explored using the chi-squared test. Key determinants in predicting vaccine acceptancy among respondents were modelled using logistic regression analysis. Results Of the 1000 survey invitees 992 responded to the survey. The majority of the study participants (29.53%) were in the age group (36 to 45 years) and 65.8% were female and 17.9% were Non-Saudi participants. Of the 992 respondents 642 said they are interested in taking the COVID-19 vaccine once it is available. Willingness to accept a future COVID-19 vaccine is relatively high among older age groups (79.2% among 45+ year old), married participants (69.3%), participants with education levels of a postgraduate degree or higher (68.8%), non-Saudi (69.1%), workings with government sector (68.9%). In multivariate model, respondents who were above 45 years (aOR: 2.15; 95% CI: 1.08-3.21), and married (aOR: 1.79; 95% CI: 1.28-2.50) were significantly associated with vaccine acceptance (p < .05). Besides, people having trust in the health system were most likely to accept vaccination (aOR: 3.05; 95% CI: 1.13-4.92).Participants having a higher perceived risk of acquiring infection were 2.13 times higher odds of reporting their intention to uptake the COVID-19 vaccine (aOR: 2.13; 95% CI: 1.35-3.85). Conclusion Addressing sociodemographic determinants relating to the COVID-19 vaccination may help to increase uptake of the global vaccination program to tackle future pandemics. Targeted health education measures are needed among the general population to increase the uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bijaya Kumar Padhi","author_inst":"Department of Community Medicine & School of Public Health, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, India"},{"author_name":"Mohammed A.

Shortages in staff, operating theatre space and intensive care beds has led to a significant reduction in the provision of surgical care. Even vascular surgery, often insulated from resource scarcity due to its status as an urgent specialty, has limited capacity due to the pandemic. Furthermore, many vascular surgical patients are elderly with multiple comorbidities putting them at increased risk of COVID-19 and its complications. There is an urgent need to investigate the impact on patients presenting to vascular surgeons during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods and Analysis: The COvid-19 Vascular sERvice (COVER) study has been designed to investigate the worldwide impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on vascular surgery, at both service provision and individual patient level. COVER is running as a collaborative study through the Vascular and Endovascular Research Network (VERN) with the support of numerous national (Vascular Society of Great Britain and Ireland, British Society of Endovascular Therapy, British Society of Interventional Radiology, Rouleaux Club) and an evolving number of international organisations (Vascupedia, SingVasc, Audible Bleeding (USA), Australian and New Zealand Vascular Trials Network (ANZVTN)). The study has 3 Tiers: Tier 1 is a survey of vascular surgeons to capture longitudinal changes to the provision of vascular services within their hospital; Tier 2 captures data on vascular and endovascular procedures performed during the pandemic; and Tier 3 will capture any deviations to patient management strategies from pre-pandemic best practice. Data submission and collection will be electronic using online survey tools (Tier 1: SurveyMonkey for service provision data) and encrypted data capture forms (Tiers 2 and 3: REDCap for patient level data). Tier 1 data will undergo real-time serial analysis to determine longitudinal changes in practice, with country-specific analyses also performed. The analysis of Tier 2 and Tier 3 data will occur on completion of the study as per the pre-specified statistical analysis plan. Ethical Approval: Ethical approval from the UK Health Research Authority has been obtained for Tiers 2 and 3 (20\/NW\/0196 Liverpool Central). Participating centres in the UK will be required to seek local research and development approval.

Objective: To evaluate the clinical characteristics of multiple sclerosis, including staging, degree of disability, and disease-modifying therapy use that are associated with worse outcomes from COVID-19. Design: Prospective cohort study looking at the outcomes of multiple sclerosis patients with COVID-19 between March 1st and May 18th, 2020. Setting: This is a multicenter study of three distinct hospital systems within the U.S. Participants: The study included 40 consecutive patients with nasopharyngeal\/oropharyngeal PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection. Exposures: Multiple sclerosis staging, severe disability (based on baseline-extended disability status scale equal to or greater than 6.0) and disease-modifying therapy. Main Outcomes and Measure: Severity of COVID-19 infection was based on hospital course, where a mild course was defined as the patient not requiring hospital admission, moderate severity was defined as the patient requiring hospital admission to the general floor only, and most severe was defined as requiring intensive care unit admission and\/or death. Results: For the 40 patients, the median age was 52(45.5-61) years, 16\/40(40%) were male, and 21\/40(52.5%) were African American. 19\/40(47.5%) had mild courses, 15\/40(37.5%) had moderate courses, and 6\/40(15%) had severe courses. Patients with moderate and severe courses were significantly older than those with a mild course (57[50-63] years old and 66[58.8-69.5] years old vs 48[40-51.5] years old, P=0.0121, P=0.0373). There was differing prevalence of progressive multiple sclerosis staging in those with more severe courses (severe:2\/6[33.3%]primary-progressing and 0\/6[0%]secondary-progressing, moderate:1\/14[7.14%] and 5\/14[35.7%] vs mild:0\/19[0%] and 1\/19[5.26%], P=0.0075, 1 unknown). Significant disability was found in 1\/19(5.26%) mild course-patients, but was in 9\/15(60%, P=0.00435) of moderate course-patients and 2\/6(33.3%, P=0.200) of severe course-patients. Disease-modifying therapy prevalence did not differ among courses (mild:17\/19[89.5%], moderate:12\/15[80%] and severe:3\/6[50%], P=0.123). Conclusions and Relevance: Multiple sclerosis patients with more severe COVID-19 courses tended to be older, were more likely to suffer from progressive staging, and had a higher degree of disability. However, disease-modifying therapy use was not different among courses.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Farhan Chaudhry","author_inst":"Wayne State University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Helena Bulka","author_inst":"Henry Ford Health Systems"},{"author_name":"Anirudha S Rathnam","author_inst":"Henry Ford Health Systems"},{"author_name":"Omar M Said","author_inst":"Wayne State University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jia Lin","author_inst":"Detroit Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Holly Lorigan","author_inst":"Henry Ford Health Systems"},{"author_name":"Evanthia Bernitsas","author_inst":"Wayne State University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jacob Rube","author_inst":"Wayne State University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Steven J Korzeniewski","author_inst":"Wayne State University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Anza B Memon","author_inst":"Henry Ford Health Systems"},{"author_name":"Phillip D Levy","author_inst":"Wayne State University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adil Javed","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Robert Lisak","author_inst":"Detroit Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Mirela Cerghet","author_inst":"MCERGHE1@hfhs.org"},{"author_name":"Brad Hutton","author_inst":"New York State Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Howard A Zucker","author_inst":"New York State Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Gregory Burns","author_inst":"5.\tDepartment of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Lillian B Brown","author_inst":"4.\tDivision of HIV, Infectious Diseases, and Global Medicine, Department of Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Fr"},{"author_name":"Christopher Berger","author_inst":"1.\tDivision of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Vincent Auyeung","author_inst":"1.\tDivision of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Adithya Cattamanchi","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Carolyn M Hendrickson","author_inst":"2.\tDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"neurology"}]}
