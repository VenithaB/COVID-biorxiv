Staff testing is critical in identifying and isolating infected individuals while also reducing unnecessary workforce depletion. Tygerberg Hospital implemented an online pre-registration system to expedite staff and cluster testing. Objectives: We aimed to identify (1) specific presentations associated with a positive or negative result for SARS-CoV-2 and (2) staff sectors where enhanced strategies for testing might be required. Methods: Retrospective descriptive study involving all clients making use of the hospital's pre-registration system during May 2020. Results: Of 799 clients, most were young and female with few comorbidities. The most common occupation was nurses followed by administrative staff, doctors and general assistants. Doctors tested earlier compared to other staff (median: 1.5 vs 4 days). The most frequent presenting symptoms were headache, sore throat, cough and myalgia. Amongst those testing positive (n=105), fever, altered smell, altered taste sensation, chills and history of fever were the most common symptoms. Three or more symptoms was more predictive of a positive test, but 12\/145 asymptomatic clients also tested positive. Conclusion: Staff coronavirus testing using an online pre-registration form is a viable and acceptable strategy. While some presentations are less likely to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, no symptom can completely exclude it. Staff testing should form part of a bundle of strategies to protect staff including wearing masks, regular hand washing, buddy screening, physical distancing, availability of PPE and special dispensation for COVID-19-related leave.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Muhammad Saadiq Moolla","author_inst":"Stellenbosch University and Tygerberg Hospital"},{"author_name":"Arifa Parker","author_inst":"Stellenbosch University and Tygerberg Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Aslam Parker","author_inst":"Stellenbosch University and Tygerberg Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sthembiso Sithole","author_inst":"Stellenbosch University and Tygerberg Hospital"},{"author_name":"Leila Amien","author_inst":"Tygerberg Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rubeena Chiecktey","author_inst":"Stellenbosch University"},{"author_name":"Tasneem Bawa","author_inst":"Stellenbosch University"},{"author_name":"Abdurasiet Mowlana","author_inst":"Stellenbosch University and Tygerberg Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.10.20151258","rel_title":"Impact of meteorological parameters on the Covid-19 incidence.

We analysed published data of five influenza pandemics (such as the Spanish Flu and the Swine Flu) and the SARS-CoV-1 pandemic to describe whether there were subsequent waves and how they differed. Methods We reanalysed literature and WHO reports on SARS-CoV-1 and literature on five influenza pandemics. We report frequencies of second and third waves, wave heights, wavelengths and time between subsequent waves. From this, we estimated peak-to-peak ratios to compare the wave heights, and wave-length-to-wave-length ratios to compare the wavelengths differences in days. Furthermore, we analysed the seasonality of the wave peaks and the time between the peak values of two waves. Results Second waves, the Spanish Flu excluded, were usually about the same height and length as first waves and were observed in 93% of the 57 described epidemic events of influenza pandemics and in 42% of the 19 epidemic events of the SARS-CoV-1 pandemic. Third waves occurred in 54% of the 28 influenza and in 11% of the 19 SARS-CoV-1 epidemic events. Third waves, the Spanish Flu excluded, usually peaked higher than second waves with a peak-to-peak ratio of 0.5. Conclusion While influenza epidemics are usually accompanied by 2nd waves, this is only the case in the minority of SARS-Cov1 epidemics.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fabian Standl","author_inst":"University of Duisburg-Essen, medical faculty"},{"author_name":"Karl-Heinz Joeckel","author_inst":"University of Duisburg-Essen, medical faculty"},{"author_name":"Bernd Kowall","author_inst":"University of Duisburg-Essen, medical faculty"},{"author_name":"Boerge Schmidt","author_inst":"University of Duisburg-Essen, medical faculty"},{"author_name":"Andreas Stang","author_inst":"University Hospital of Essen, medical faculty"},{"author_name":"Rubeena Chiecktey","author_inst":"Stellenbosch University"},{"author_name":"Tasneem Bawa","author_inst":"Stellenbosch University"},{"author_name":"Abdurasiet Mowlana","author_inst":"Stellenbosch University and Tygerberg Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.13.20152686","rel_title":"Two New Models for Epidemics with Application to the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States, Italy, and the United Kingdom","rel_date":"2020-07-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.13.20152686","rel_abs":"The Distributed Logistic Model and the Adaptive Logistic Model of epidemics are formulated and used to study the course of cases and deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic. The distributed model is designed to account for a spread of initiation times of hot spots across a country; it does especially well at capturing the initial and linear phases of epidemics. The adaptive model accounts for the development of social mitigation factors, and does especially well at capturing the declining phases of epidemics. The historical data for the U.S., Italy, and the U.K. are analyzed in detail. The parameters of the fits to the two models provide complementary information about the pandemic. The initial infection rate constant was r0 {approx} 0.29 per day for each country, and the effective infection rate constants evolved with time in essentially the same way for each. This suggests that mitigation effects were equally effective in all three countries. Analysis with the distributed model suggests that it took somewhat different times T for the epidemic to spread across each country, with T(US) {approx} 50 days significantly greater than the T's of Italy or the U.K. The mortality ratio in the U.S. was about 0.061 while in Italy and U.K. it was much larger at about 0.15.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David H.

Methods Daily statistics of deaths due to the Covid-19 pandemic were subjected to a discrete Fourier transform spectral analysis for France and the world, over the periods from March 29 to May 16, 2020 and from January 22 to May 18, 2020 respectively. Results In both cases, a frequency peak of one harmonic corresponding to a period of 7.11 days was observed for France and the world. In France, this weekly frequency corresponds to a decrease in deaths every Sunday, whereas for the world the systematic decrease is shifted on average by 1.5 days and corresponds to Saturday or Friday.

While it is known that pregnant women have reduced immunity and they are at risk for COVID-19 infection during the current pandemic, it is not clear if the disease manifestation would be different in pregnant women from non-pregnant women. Objectives: To describe the maternal and neonatal clinical features as well as outcome of pregnancies complicated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: In this retrospective national-based study, we analyzed the medical records of all SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant patients and their neonates who were admitted to New-Jahra Hospital, Kuwait, between March 15th 2020 and May 31st 2020. The outcomes of pregnancies were assessed until the end date of follow-up (June 15th 2020). Results: A total of 185 pregnant women were enrolled with a median age of 31 years (interquartile range, IQR: 27.5-34), and median gestational age at diagnosis was 29 weeks (IQR: 18-34). The majority (88%) of the patients had mild symptoms, with fever (58%) being the most common presenting symptom followed by cough (50.6%). During the study period, 141 (76.2%) patients continued their pregnancy, 3 (1.6%) had a miscarriage, 1 (0.5%) had intrauterine fetal death and only 2 (1.1%) patients developed severe pneumonia and required intensive care. Most of the neonates were asymptomatic, and only 2 (5%) of them tested positive on day 5 by nasopharyngeal swab testing. Conclusion: Pregnant women do not appear to be at higher risk to the COVID-19 than the general population. The clinical features of pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection were similar to those of the general population having SARS-CoV-2 infection. Favorable maternal and neonatal outcomes reinforce the existing evidence and may guide healthcare professionals in the management of pregnancies complicated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amal Ayed","author_inst":"Obstetric and Gynaecology Department, Farwaniya Hospital, Kuwait"},{"author_name":"Alia Embaireeg","author_inst":"Paediatric Department, Farwaniya Hospital, Kuwait"},{"author_name":"Asmaa Benawadth","author_inst":"Obstetrics and Gynecology Department, Maternity Hospital, Kuwait"},{"author_name":"Wadha Al-Fouzan","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Kuwait University"},{"author_name":"Majeda Hammoud","author_inst":"Paediatrics Department  , Faculty of Medicine, Kuwait University"},{"author_name":"Monif Alhathal","author_inst":"Neonatal Department, Maternity Hospital, Kuwait"},{"author_name":"Abeer Alzaydai","author_inst":"Obstetrics and Gynaecology Department, Al-Adan Hospital, Kuwait"},{"author_name":"Mariam Ayed","author_inst":"Neonatal Department, Farwaniya Hospital, Kuwait"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"obstetrics and gynecology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.11.20151688","rel_title":"COVID-19 among people living with HIV: A systematic review","rel_date":"2020-07-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.11.20151688","rel_abs":"This systematic review summarizes the evidence on the earliest patients with COVID-19-HIV co-infection.

Methods We examined the disease progression of COVID-19 in 6,911 patients admitted to hospitals in Europe and China. In addition, we evaluated progress of disease symptoms in 37,187 individuals reporting symptoms into the COVID Symptom Study application. Findings Meta-analysis of the mortality risk in eight European hospitals estimated odds ratios per one day increase in the admission date to be 0.981 (0.973-0.988, p<0.001) and per increase in ambient temperature of one degree Celsius to be 0.854 (0.773-0.944, p=0.007). Statistically significant decreases of comparable magnitude in median hospital stay, probability of transfer to Intensive Care Unit and need for mechanical ventilation were also observed in most, but not all hospitals. The analysis of individually reported symptoms of 37,187 individuals in the UK also showed the decrease in symptom duration and disease severity with time. Interpretation Severity of COVID-19 in Europe decreased significantly between March and May and the seasonality of COVID-19 is the most likely explanation. Mucosal barrier and mucociliary clearance can significantly decrease viral load and disease progression, and their inactivation by low relative humidity of indoor air might significantly contribute to severity of the disease.","rel_num_authors":51,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Domagoj Kifer","author_inst":"University of Zagreb"},{"author_name":"Dario Bugada","author_inst":"Emergency and Intensive Care Department - ASST Papa Giovanni XXII Hospital - Bergamo - Italy"},{"author_name":"Judit Villar-Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital del Mar-IMIM, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ivan Gudelj","author_inst":"Genos"},{"author_name":"Cristina Menni","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Carole Helene Sudre","author_inst":"KCL"},{"author_name":"Frano Vuckovic","author_inst":"Genos"},{"author_name":"Ivo Ugrina","author_inst":"Genos"},{"author_name":"Luca F Lorini","author_inst":"Emergency and Intensive Care Department - ASST Papa Giovanni XXII Hospital - Bergamo - Italy"},{"author_name":"Silvia Bettinelli","author_inst":"Emergency and Intensive Care Department - ASST Papa Giovanni XXII Hospital - Bergamo - Italy"},{"author_name":"Nicola Ughi","author_inst":"ASST GOM Niguarda"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Maloberti","author_inst":"ASST GOM Niguarda"},{"author_name":"Oscar Epis","author_inst":"ASST GOM Niguarda"},{"author_name":"Cristina Giannattasio","author_inst":"ASST GOM Niguarda"},{"author_name":"Claudio Rossetti","author_inst":"ASST GOM Niguarda"},{"author_name":"Livije Kalogjera","author_inst":"School of Medicine, University Hospital \"Sestre milosrdnice\" Zagreb, Croatia"},{"author_name":"Jasminka Persec","author_inst":"University Hospital Dubrava Zagreb, Croatia, University of Zagreb School of Dental Medicine"},{"author_name":"Luke Ollivere","author_inst":"Nottingham University Trust"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Ollivere","author_inst":"University of Nottingham, School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Huadong Yan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Key Laboratory of Diagnosis and Treatment of Digestive System Tumors of Zhejiang Province, Hwamei Hospital, University of Chi"},{"author_name":"Ting Cai","author_inst":"Hwa Mei Hospital, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Guruprasad Aithal","author_inst":"School of Medicine, University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Claire Steves","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Anu Kantele","author_inst":"Inflammation Centre, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Mikael Kajova","author_inst":"Inflammation Centre, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Olli Vapalahti","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Antti Sajantila","author_inst":"Department of Forensic Medicine, University of Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Rafal Wojtowicz","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Waldemar Wierzba","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Zbigniew Krol","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Artur Zaczynski","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Katarzyna Zycinska","author_inst":"Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Marek Postula","author_inst":"Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Ivica Luksic","author_inst":"Clinical Hospital Dubrava, Zagreb"},{"author_name":"Rok Civljak","author_inst":"Hospital for Infectious Diseases, Zagreb, Croatia"},{"author_name":"Alemka Markotic","author_inst":"Hospital for Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Christian Mahnkopf","author_inst":"REGIOMED-KLINIKEN GmbH, Gustav-Hirschfeld-Ring 3, 96450 Coburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Markl","author_inst":"REGIOMED-KLINIKEN GmbH, Gustav-Hirschfeld-Ring 3, 96450 Coburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Johannes Brachmann","author_inst":"REGIOMED Kliniken"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Murray","author_inst":"School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Ourselin","author_inst":"School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"},{"author_name":"Julio Pascual","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ana M Valdes","author_inst":"University of Nottingham, School of Medicine, Nottingham NIHR BRC"},{"author_name":"Margarita Posso","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Evaluation, Hospital del Mar-IMIM, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Juan Horcajada","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital del Mar.

Social, demographic, and political characteristics at the US county level might be associated with the trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 case incidence. Objective: To understand how underlying social, demographic, and political characteristics at the US county level might be associated with the trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 case incidence. Design: Retrospective analysis of the trajectory of reported SARS-CoV-2 case counts at the US county level during June 1, 2020 - June 30,2020 and social, demographic, and political characteristics of the county. Setting: United States. Participants: Reported SARS-CoV-2 cases. Exposures: Metropolitan designation, Social Deprivation Index (SDI), 2016 Republican Presidential Candidate Victory. Main Outcomes and Measures: SARS-CoV-2 case incidence. Results: 1023\/3142 US counties were included in the analysis. 678 (66.3%) had increasing SARS-CoV-2 case counts between June 1 - June 30, 2020. In univariate analysis, counties with increasing case counts had a significantly higher SDI (median 48, IQR 24 - 72) than counties with non-increasing case counts (median 40, IQR 19 - 66; p=0.009). In the multivariable model, metropolitan areas of 250,000 - 1 million population, higher percentage of Black residents and a 10-point or greater Republican victory were independently associated with increasing case counts. Limitations: The data examines county-level voting patterns and does not account for individual voting behavior, subjecting this work to the potential for ecologic fallacy. Conclusion: Increasing case counts of SARS-CoV-2 in the US are likely driven by a combination of social disadvantage, social networks, and behavioral factors. Addressing social disadvantage and differential belief systems that may correspond with political alignment will be essential for pandemic control.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ahmad Mourad","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Nicholas A Turner","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Arthur W Baker","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Nwora Lance Okeke","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Shanti Narayanasamy","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Robert Rolfe Jr.","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"John J Engemann","author_inst":"Raleigh Infectious Diseases Associates"},{"author_name":"Gary M Cox","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Jason E Stout","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Silvia Bettinelli","author_inst":"Emergency and Intensive Care Department - ASST Papa Giovanni XXII Hospital - Bergamo - Italy"},{"author_name":"Nicola Ughi","author_inst":"ASST GOM Niguarda"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Maloberti","author_inst":"ASST GOM Niguarda"},{"author_name":"Oscar Epis","author_inst":"ASST GOM Niguarda"},{"author_name":"Cristina Giannattasio","author_inst":"ASST GOM Niguarda"},{"author_name":"Claudio Rossetti","author_inst":"ASST GOM Niguarda"},{"author_name":"Livije Kalogjera","author_inst":"School of Medicine, University Hospital \"Sestre milosrdnice\" Zagreb, Croatia"},{"author_name":"Jasminka Persec","author_inst":"University Hospital Dubrava Zagreb, Croatia, University of Zagreb School of Dental Medicine"},{"author_name":"Luke Ollivere","author_inst":"Nottingham University Trust"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Ollivere","author_inst":"University of Nottingham, School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Huadong Yan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Key Laboratory of Diagnosis and Treatment of Digestive System Tumors of Zhejiang Province, Hwamei Hospital, University of Chi"},{"author_name":"Ting Cai","author_inst":"Hwa Mei Hospital, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Guruprasad Aithal","author_inst":"School of Medicine, University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Claire Steves","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Anu Kantele","author_inst":"Inflammation Centre, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Mikael Kajova","author_inst":"Inflammation Centre, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Olli Vapalahti","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Antti Sajantila","author_inst":"Department of Forensic Medicine, University of Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Rafal Wojtowicz","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Waldemar Wierzba","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Zbigniew Krol","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Artur Zaczynski","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Katarzyna Zycinska","author_inst":"Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Marek Postula","author_inst":"Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Ivica Luksic","author_inst":"Clinical Hospital Dubrava, Zagreb"},{"author_name":"Rok Civljak","author_inst":"Hospital for Infectious Diseases, Zagreb, Croatia"},{"author_name":"Alemka Markotic","author_inst":"Hospital for Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Christian Mahnkopf","author_inst":"REGIOMED-KLINIKEN GmbH, Gustav-Hirschfeld-Ring 3, 96450 Coburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Markl","author_inst":"REGIOMED-KLINIKEN GmbH, Gustav-Hirschfeld-Ring 3, 96450 Coburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Johannes Brachmann","author_inst":"REGIOMED Kliniken"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Murray","author_inst":"School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Ourselin","author_inst":"School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"},{"author_name":"Julio Pascual","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ana M Valdes","author_inst":"University of Nottingham, School of Medicine, Nottingham NIHR BRC"},{"author_name":"Margarita Posso","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Evaluation, Hospital del Mar-IMIM, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Juan Horcajada","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital del Mar.

'Trained immunity' of the populace as a result of BCG immunization policy implementation and coverage had been suggested to be one of the factors responsible for the differential impact of COVID-19 on different countries. Several trials are underway to evaluate the potential protective role of BCG vaccination in COVID-19. However, the lack of clarity on the use of appropriate controls concerning 'trained immunity' or the heterologous cell-mediated immunity conferred by BCG vaccination has been a cause of concern leading to more confusion as exemplified by a recently concluded trial in Israel that failed to find any protective correlation with regard to BCG vaccination. Whereas, when we analyze the COVID-19 data of European countries without any regard for BCG vaccination policy but with similar age distribution, comparable confounding variables, and the stage of the pandemic, the prevalence of tuberculin immunoreactivity - a measure of cell-mediated immunity persistence as a result of Mycobacterium spp.(including BCG vaccine) exposure of the populations, is found consistently negatively correlated with COVID-19 infections and mortality per million population, at all the time points evaluated. We propose that on-going and future studies evaluating the effect of BCG vaccination on COVID-19 outcomes may actively consider, if not already, the inclusion of 'controls' for underlying 'trained immunity'and heterologous cell-mediated immunity prevalence that may be pre-existing or resulting from the intervention (e.g., BCG vaccine) in such trials to arrive at more dependable conclusions concerning their potential benefit.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samer Singh","author_inst":"Banaras Hindu University Institute of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Rajendra P.

We investigate, through extensive simulations, the bias in estimating the hazard ratio (HR) and the absolute risk reduction (ARR) of death when competing risks are ignored, and suggest an alternative method. Methods We simulated a fictive clinical trial on COVID-19 mimicking studies investigating interventions such as Hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir, or convalescent plasma. The outcome is time from randomization until death. Six scenarios for the effect of treatment on death and recovery were considered. The HR and the 28-day ARR of death were estimated using the Cox PH and the Fine and Gray (FG) models. Estimates were then compared with the true values, and the magnitude of misestimation was quantified. Results The Cox PH model misestimated the true HR and the 28-day ARR of death in the majority of scenarios. The magnitude of misestimation increased when recovery was faster and\/or chance of recovery was higher. In some scenarios, this model has shown a harmful treatment effect when it was beneficial. Estimates obtained from the FG model were all consistent and showed no misestimation or changes in direction. Conclusion There is a substantial risk of misleading results in COVID-19 research if recovery and death due to COVID-19 are not considered as competing risk events. We strongly recommend the use of a competing risk approach to re-analyze relevant published data that have used the Cox PH model.

Objectives: The aim of this scoping review was to map and compile the available evidence about the effectiveness of decontaminating N95 masks against coronavirus. Methods: We selected studies written in English assessing or discussing decontamination strategies of N95 masks against coronavirus. The search and study screening were performed in PubMed and SCOPUS by two independent researchers. A descriptive analysis was performed considering the study design of included studies. Results: We included nineteen studies. Eight articles were letter to the editors, five were in vitro studies, three were literature reviews, and three were classified as other study designs. The use of vaporized hydrogen peroxide and ultraviolet irradiation were the strategies most cited. However, there is a lack of evidence and consensus related to the best method of N95 masks decontamination. Conclusion: The evidence towards decontamination strategies of N95 masks against coronavirus remains scarce. Vaporized hydrogen peroxide and ultraviolet irradiation seem the current standard for N95 masks decontamination.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rafael Onofre","author_inst":"Graduate Program in Dentistry, IMED, Passo Fundo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Rafaela Borges","author_inst":"Graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas, Pelotas, RS, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Giulia Demarco","author_inst":"Post-Graduate Program in Dentistry, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Lara Dotto","author_inst":"Graduate Program in Dentistry, IMED, Passo Fundo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Falk Schwendicke","author_inst":"Department for Operative and Preventive Dentistry, Charite, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Flavio Demarco","author_inst":"Graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas, Pelotas, RS, Brazil and Graduate Program in Dentistry, Federal University of Pelotas, Pelotas, "},{"author_name":"Harald Sourij","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Endocrinology and Diabetology, Medical University of Graz, Austria"},{"author_name":"Ingrid Van Keilegom","author_inst":"ORSTAT, KU Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Jason E Stout","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Silvia Bettinelli","author_inst":"Emergency and Intensive Care Department -

Design: Multicenter observational retrospective cohort study. Setting: Greater Paris University hospitals, France. Participants: 7,345 adults hospitalized with COVID-19 between 24 January and 1 April 2020, including 460 patients (6.3%) who received an antidepressant during the visit. Data source: Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris Health Data Warehouse. Main outcome measures: The primary endpoint was a composite of intubation or death. We compared this endpoint between patients who received antidepressants and those who did not in time-to-event analyses adjusting for patient characteristics (such as age, sex, and comorbidities), disease severity and other psychotropic medications. The primary analyses were multivariable Cox models with inverse probability weighting. Results: Over a mean follow-up of 18.5 days (SD=27.1), 1,331 patients (18.1%) had a primary end-point event. Unadjusted hazard ratio estimates of the association between antidepressant use and the primary outcome stratified by age (i.e., 18-50, 51-70, 71-80, and 81+) were non-significant (all p>0.072), except in the group of patients aged 71-80 years (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.98; p=0.041). Following adjustments, the primary analyses showed a significant association between use of any antidepressant (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.80; p<0.001), SSRI (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.75; p<0.001), and SNRI (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.96; p=0.034), and reduced risk of intubation or death. Specifically, exposures to escitalopram, fluoxetine, and venlafaxine were significantly associated with lower risk of intubation or death (all p<0.05). These associations remain significant in multiple sensitivity analyses, except for the association between SNRI use and the outcome. Conclusions: SSRI use could be associated with lower risk of death or intubation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Double-blind controlled randomized clinical trials of these medications for COVID-19 are needed.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicolas Hoertel","author_inst":"AP-HP ; Paris University ; INSERM ; Institut de Psychiatrie et Neurosciences de Paris."},{"author_name":"Marina SANCHEZ RICO","author_inst":"Universidad Complutense de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Raphael VERNET","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Nathanael BEEKER","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Anne-Sophie JANNOT","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Antoine NEURAZ","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Elisa SALAMANCA","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Nicolas PARIS","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Christel DANIEL","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Alexandre GRAMFORT","author_inst":"INRIA"},{"author_name":"Guillaume LEMAITRE","author_inst":"INRIA"},{"author_name":"Melodie BERNAUX","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Ali BELLAMINE","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Cedric LEMOGNE","author_inst":"Paris University"},{"author_name":"Guillaume AIRAGNES","author_inst":"Paris University"},{"author_name":"Anita BURGUN","author_inst":"AP-HP"},{"author_name":"Frederic LIMOSIN","author_inst":"AP-HP ; Paris University ; INSERM ; Institut de Psychiatrie et Neurosciences de Paris."},{"author_name":"Luke Ollivere","author_inst":"Nottingham University Trust"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Ollivere","author_inst":"University of Nottingham, School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Huadong Yan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Key Laboratory of Diagnosis and Treatment of Digestive System Tumors of Zhejiang Province, Hwamei Hospital, University of Chi"},{"author_name":"Ting Cai","author_inst":"Hwa Mei Hospital, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Guruprasad Aithal","author_inst":"School of Medicine, University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Claire Steves","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Anu Kantele","author_inst":"Inflammation Centre, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Mikael Kajova","author_inst":"Inflammation Centre, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Olli Vapalahti","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Antti Sajantila","author_inst":"Department of Forensic Medicine, University of Helsinki, Finland"},{"author_name":"Rafal Wojtowicz","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Waldemar Wierzba","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Zbigniew Krol","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Artur Zaczynski","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Katarzyna Zycinska","author_inst":"Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Marek Postula","author_inst":"Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Ivica Luksic","author_inst":"Clinical Hospital Dubrava, Zagreb"},{"author_name":"Rok Civljak","author_inst":"Hospital for Infectious Diseases, Zagreb, Croatia"},{"author_name":"Alemka Markotic","author_inst":"Hospital for Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Christian Mahnkopf","author_inst":"REGIOMED-KLINIKEN GmbH, Gustav-Hirschfeld-Ring 3, 96450 Coburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Markl","author_inst":"REGIOMED-KLINIKEN GmbH, Gustav-Hirschfeld-Ring 3, 96450 Coburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Johannes Brachmann","author_inst":"REGIOMED Kliniken"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Murray","author_inst":"School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Ourselin","author_inst":"School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"},{"author_name":"Julio Pascual","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ana M Valdes","author_inst":"University of Nottingham, School of Medicine, Nottingham NIHR BRC"},{"author_name":"Margarita Posso","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Evaluation, Hospital del Mar-IMIM, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Juan Horcajada","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital del Mar.

To increase the evidence base supporting specific methods to measure social interaction, we compared data from self-reported contact surveys and wearable proximity sensors from a cohort of schoolchildren in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. Although the number and type of contacts recorded by each participant differed between the two methods, we found good correspondence between the two methods in aggregate measures of age-specific interactions. Fewer, but longer, contacts were reported in surveys, relative to the generally short proximal interactions captured by wearable sensors. When adjusted for expectations of proportionate mixing, though, the two methods produced highly similar, assortative age-mixing matrices. These aggregate mixing matrices, when used in simulation, resulted in similar estimates of risk of infection by age. While proximity sensors and survey methods may not be interchangeable for capturing individual contacts, they can generate highly correlated data on age-specific mixing patterns relevant to the dynamics of respiratory virus transmission.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kyra H.

The programme was first rolled out on the Isle of Wight and included Version 1 of the NHS contact tracing app. We used COVID-19 daily case data to infer incidence of new infections and estimate the reproduction number R for each of 150 Upper Tier Local Authorities in England, and at the National level, before and after the launch of the programme on the Isle of Wight. We used Bayesian and Maximum-Likelihood methods to estimate R, and compared the Isle of Wight to other areas using a synthetic control method. We observed significant decreases in incidence and R on the Isle of Wight immediately after the launch. These results are robust across each of our approaches. Our results show that the sub-epidemic on the Isle of Wight was controlled significantly more effectively than the sub-epidemics of most other Upper Tier Local Authorities, changing from having the third highest reproduction number R (of 150) before the intervention to the tenth lowest afterwards. The data is not yet available to establish a causal link. However, the findings highlight the need for further research to determine the causes of this reduction, as these might translate into local and national non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies in the period before a treatment or vaccination becomes available.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michelle Kendall","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Luke Milsom","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Lucie Abeler-Dorner","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Chris Wymant","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Luca Ferretti","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Mark Briers","author_inst":"Alan Turing Institute"},{"author_name":"Chris Holmes","author_inst":"University of Oxford; Alan Turing Institute"},{"author_name":"David Bonsall","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Johannes Abeler","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Christophe Fraser","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kan Li","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Patti A Calderone","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Eva Noble","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Hongjiang Gao","author_inst":"US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jeanette Rainey","author_inst":"US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Amra Uzicanin","author_inst":"US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jonathan M.

Object: We assessed effectiveness of COCOA. Method: After developing a simple susceptible-infected-recovery model with COCOA and voluntary restrictions against going out (VRG), we assumed that COCOA can reduce infectiousness by 10-50% points through self-quarantine at home after receiving notification from COCOA. Results: COCOA alone is insufficient to halt an outbreak. Even if the entire population were to use COCOA, the reproduction number would be 1.31. However, if VRG were 15%, about half of the maximum VRG effectiveness under the emergency state declaration, then 10% COCOA use by a population can reduce the reproduction number to less than one. Conclusion: Significant effects of COCOA for reducing the reproduction number were found. However, without VRG, COCOA alone is insufficient to control an outbreak.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Junko Kurita","author_inst":"Tokiwa University, Ibaraki, Japan"},{"author_name":"Tamie Sugawara","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Yasushi Ohkusa","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Chris Wymant","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Luca Ferretti","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Mark Briers","author_inst":"Alan Turing Institute"},{"author_name":"Chris Holmes","author_inst":"University of Oxford; Alan Turing Institute"},{"author_name":"David Bonsall","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Johannes Abeler","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Christophe Fraser","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kan Li","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Patti A Calderone","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Eva Noble","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Hongjiang Gao","author_inst":"US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jeanette Rainey","author_inst":"US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Amra Uzicanin","author_inst":"US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jonathan M.

In the present study, we characterized vulnerable populations located in areas at higher risk of COVID-19 related mortality and low critical healthcare capacity in the U.S. Methods Using Bayesian multilevel analysis and small area disease risk mapping, we assessed the spatial variation of COVID-19 related mortality risk for the U.S. in relation with healthcare disparities including race, ethnicity, poverty, air quality, and critical healthcare capacity. Results Overall, highly populated, regional air hub areas, and minorities had an increased risk of COVID-19 related mortality. We found that with an increase of only 1 ug\/m3 in long term PM2.5 exposure, the COVID-19 mortality rate increased by 13%. Counties with major air hubs had 18% increase in COVID-19 related death compared to counties with no airport connectivity. Sixty-eight percent of the counties with high COVID-19 related mortality risk were also counties with lower critical care capacity than national average. These counties were primary located at the North- and South-Eastern regions of the country. Conclusion The existing disparity in health and environmental risk factors that exacerbate the COVID-19 related mortality, along with the regional healthcare capacity, determine the vulnerability of populations to COVID-19 related mortality. The results from this study can be used to guide the development of strategies for the identification and targeting preventive strategies in vulnerable populations with a higher proportion of minority groups living in areas with poor air quality and low healthcare capacity.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Esteban Correa-Agudelo","author_inst":"University of Cincinnati"},{"author_name":"Tesfaye Mersha","author_inst":"University of Cincinnati"},{"author_name":"Andres Hernandez","author_inst":"University of Cincinnati"},{"author_name":"Adam J Branscum","author_inst":"Oregon State University"},{"author_name":"Neil J MacKinnon","author_inst":"University of Cincinnati"},{"author_name":"Diego F Cuadros","author_inst":"University of Cincinnati"},{"author_name":"Chris Holmes","author_inst":"University of Oxford; Alan Turing Institute"},{"author_name":"David Bonsall","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Johannes Abeler","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Christophe Fraser","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kan Li","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Patti A Calderone","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Eva Noble","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Hongjiang Gao","author_inst":"US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jeanette Rainey","author_inst":"US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Amra Uzicanin","author_inst":"US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jonathan M.

Different approaches are followed to mitigate its impact and reduce its spreading in different countries, but limiting mobility and exposure have been de-facto precaution to reduce transmission. However, a full lockdown cannot be sustained for a prolonged period. Evidence-based, multidisciplinary approach on risk zoning, personal and transmission risk assessment on a near real-time, and risk communication would support the optimized decisions to minimize the impact of coronavirus on our lives. This paper presents a framework to assess the individual and regional risk of COVID-19 along with risk communication tools and mechanisms. Relative risk scores on a scale of 100 represent the integrated risk of influential factors. The personal risk model incorporates: age, exposure history, symptoms, local risk and existing health condition, whereas regional risk is computed through the actual cases of COVID-19, public health risk factors, socioeconomic condition of the region, and immigration statistics. A web application tool (www.covira.info) has been developed, where anyone can assess their risk and find the guided information links primarily for Nepal. This study provides regional risk for Nepal, but the framework is scalable across the world. However, personal risk can be assessed immediately from anywhere.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rishi Ram Parajuli","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Bhogendra Mishra","author_inst":"Science Hub, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Amrit Banstola","author_inst":"Centre for Academic Child Health, University of the West of England, UK"},{"author_name":"Bhoj Raj Ghimire","author_inst":"Nepal Open University, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Shobha Poudel","author_inst":"Science Hub, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Kusum Sharma","author_inst":"Science Hub, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Sameer Mani Dixit","author_inst":"Center for Molecular Dynamics Nepal, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Sunil Kumar Shah","author_inst":"Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust, Leeds Teaching Hospital, UK"},{"author_name":"Padam Simkhada","author_inst":"School of Human and Health Sciences, University of Huddersfield, UK"},{"author_name":"Edwin van Teijlingen","author_inst":"Faculty of Health and Social Sciences, Bournemouth University, UK"},{"author_name":"Kan Li","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Patti A Calderone","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Eva Noble","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Hongjiang Gao","author_inst":"US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jeanette Rainey","author_inst":"US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Amra Uzicanin","author_inst":"US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jonathan M.

We included undergraduate students of the University of Aleppo (Syria). The questionnaire consisted of three sections: Demographics ,knowledge and behaviours . Every participant's knowledge was scored from 0-13 depending on the number of correct answers in the knowledge section. The correctness was judged depending on WHO recommendations at the time of questionnaire administration. P-value of 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Among this well-educated and predominantly medical and health-related students, 682 (45.4%) students had a good knowledge level, which is somehow disappointing. The current study shows that 1st year students and non-medical specialties students and smokers had significantly lower knowledge levels than others. On contrary, residing with less people -which may indicate a higher socioeconomic status-, was associated with a higher knowledge level. We also found that commitment to preventive measures was in general satisfying and correlated significantly with knowledge level and gender in most cases. Conclusion: Junior students, non-medical specialties, smokers and those who live with high number of people are vulnerable to less knowledge level and awareness campaigns should concentrate on them. Increasing awareness is useful to increase commitment to preventive measures, and groups that have less adherence to preventive measures, as described in detail, should be taken into consideration while designing public health responses. Finally, we should be aware of the negative impact of quarantine on public health to take it into consideration for current campaigns and future policies.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"aos mohammed alhamid","author_inst":"university of aleppo"},{"author_name":"Ahmad Mohammed Alhamid","author_inst":"university of aleppo"},{"author_name":"ziad aljarad","author_inst":"Aleppo University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bhoj Raj Ghimire","author_inst":"Nepal Open University, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Shobha Poudel","author_inst":"Science Hub, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Kusum Sharma","author_inst":"Science Hub, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Sameer Mani Dixit","author_inst":"Center for Molecular Dynamics Nepal, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Sunil Kumar Shah","author_inst":"Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust, Leeds Teaching Hospital, UK"},{"author_name":"Padam Simkhada","author_inst":"School of Human and Health Sciences, University of Huddersfield, UK"},{"author_name":"Edwin van Teijlingen","author_inst":"Faculty of Health and Social Sciences, Bournemouth University, UK"},{"author_name":"Kan Li","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Patti A Calderone","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Eva Noble","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Hongjiang Gao","author_inst":"US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jeanette Rainey","author_inst":"US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Amra Uzicanin","author_inst":"US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jonathan M.

Our study aims to assess the early impact of COVID-19 lockdown on violent and accidental deaths in Peru. Methods: Based on data from the Peruvian National Death Information System, an interrupted time series analysis was performed to assess the immediate impact and change in the trend of COVID-19 lockdown on external causes of death including homicide, suicide, and traffic accidents. The analysis was stratified by sex and the time unit was every 15 days. Results: All forms of deaths examined presented a sudden drop after the lockdown. The biggest drop was in deaths related to traffic accidents, with a reduction of 12.66 deaths per million men per month (95% CI: -15.56, -9.76) and 3.64 deaths per million women per month (95% CI:-5.25, -2.03). Homicide and suicide presented similar level drop in women, while the homicide reduction was twice the size of the suicide reduction in men. The slope in suicide in men during the lock-down period increased by 3.62 deaths per million men per year (95% CI:0.06, 7.18). No other change in slope was detected. Conclusions: Violent and accidental deaths presented a sudden drop after the lockdown was implemented and an increase in suicide in men was observed. Falls in mobility have a natural impact on traffic accidents, however, the patterns for suicide and homicide are less intuitive and reveal important characteristics of these events, although we expect all of these changes to be transient.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Renzo JC Calderon-Anyosa","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Jay S Kaufman","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"ziad aljarad","author_inst":"Aleppo University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bhoj Raj Ghimire","author_inst":"Nepal Open University, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Shobha Poudel","author_inst":"Science Hub, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Kusum Sharma","author_inst":"Science Hub, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Sameer Mani Dixit","author_inst":"Center for Molecular Dynamics Nepal, Nepal"},{"author_name":"Sunil Kumar Shah","author_inst":"Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust, Leeds Teaching Hospital, UK"},{"author_name":"Padam Simkhada","author_inst":"School of Human and Health Sciences, University of Huddersfield, UK"},{"author_name":"Edwin van Teijlingen","author_inst":"Faculty of Health and Social Sciences, Bournemouth University, UK"},{"author_name":"Kan Li","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Patti A Calderone","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Eva Noble","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Hongjiang Gao","author_inst":"US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jeanette Rainey","author_inst":"US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Amra Uzicanin","author_inst":"US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jonathan M.

While children are largely spared from severe respiratory disease, they can present with a SARS-CoV-2-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) similar to Kawasaki's disease. Here, we show distinct antibody (Ab) responses in children with MIS-C compared to adults with severe COVID-19 causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and those who recovered from mild disease. There was a reduced breadth and specificity of anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in MIS-C patients compared to the COVID patient groups; MIS-C predominantly generated IgG Abs specific for the Spike (S) protein but not for the nucleocapsid (N) protein, while both COVID-19 cohorts had anti-S IgG, IgM and IgA Abs, as well as anti-N IgG Abs. Moreover, MIS-C patients had reduced neutralizing activity compared to COVID-19 cohorts, indicating a reduced protective serological response. These results suggest a distinct infection course and immune response in children and adults who develop severe disease, with implications for optimizing treatments based on symptom and age.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stuart P Weisberg","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Thomas Connors","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Yun Zhu","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Matthew Baldwin","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Wen-Hsuan Lin","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Sandeep Wontakal","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Peter A Szabo","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Steven B Wells","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Pranay Dogra","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Joshua I Gray","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Emma Idzikowski","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Francesca Bovier","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Julia Davis-Porada","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Rei Matsumoto","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Maya Meimei Li Poon","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Michael P Chait","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Cyrille Mathieu","author_inst":"CIRI, International Center for Infectiology Research, Inserm"},{"author_name":"Branka Horvat","author_inst":"CIRI, International Center for Infectiology Research, Inserm"},{"author_name":"Didier Decimo","author_inst":"CIRI, International Center for Infectiology Research, Inserm"},{"author_name":"Zachary C Bitan","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Francesca La Carpia","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Stephen A Ferrara","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Emily Mace","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Joshua Milner","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Anne Moscona","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Eldad A Hod","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Matteo Porotto","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Donna L Farber","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Waldemar Wierzba","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Zbigniew Krol","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Artur Zaczynski","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Katarzyna Zycinska","author_inst":"Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Marek Postula","author_inst":"Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Ivica Luksic","author_inst":"Clinical Hospital Dubrava, Zagreb"},{"author_name":"Rok Civljak","author_inst":"Hospital for Infectious Diseases, Zagreb, Croatia"},{"author_name":"Alemka Markotic","author_inst":"Hospital for Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Christian Mahnkopf","author_inst":"REGIOMED-KLINIKEN GmbH, Gustav-Hirschfeld-Ring 3, 96450 Coburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Markl","author_inst":"REGIOMED-KLINIKEN GmbH, Gustav-Hirschfeld-Ring 3, 96450 Coburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Johannes Brachmann","author_inst":"REGIOMED Kliniken"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Murray","author_inst":"School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Ourselin","author_inst":"School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"},{"author_name":"Julio Pascual","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ana M Valdes","author_inst":"University of Nottingham, School of Medicine, Nottingham NIHR BRC"},{"author_name":"Margarita Posso","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Evaluation, Hospital del Mar-IMIM, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Juan Horcajada","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital del Mar.

We conducted a cross-sectional study in health-care workers to report evidence of pericarditis and myocarditis after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods We studied 139 health-care workers with confirmed past SARS-CoV-2 infection (103 diagnosed by RT-PCR and 36 by serology). Participants underwent clinical assessment, electrocardiography, laboratory tests including immune cell profiling and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. Pericarditis was diagnosed when classical criteria were present, and the diagnosis of myocarditis was based on the updated CMR Lake-Louise-Criteria. Results: Median age was 52 years (IQR 41-57), 100 (72%) were women, and 23 (16%) were previously hospitalized for Covid-19 pneumonia. At examination (10.4 [9.3-11.0] weeks after infection-like symptoms), all participants presented hemodynamic stability. Chest pain, dyspnoea or palpitations were observed in 58 (42%) participants; electrocardiographic abnormalities in 69 (50%); NT-pro-BNP was elevated in 11 (8%); troponin in 1 (1%); and CMR abnormalities in 104 (75%). Isolated pericarditis was diagnosed in 4 (3%) participants, myopericarditis in 15 (11%) and isolated myocarditis in 36 (26%). Participants diagnosed by RT-PCR were more likely to still present symptoms than participants diagnosed by serology (73 [71%] vs 18 [50%]; p=0.027); nonetheless, the prevalence of pericarditis or myocarditis was high in both groups (44 [43%] vs 11 [31%]; p=0.238). Most participants (101 [73%]) showed altered immune cell counts in blood, particularly decreased eosinophil (37 [27%]; p<0.001) and increased CD4-CD8-\/loT alpha beta-cell numbers (24 [17%]; p<0.001). Pericarditis was associated with elevated CD4-CD8-\/loT alpha beta-cell numbers (p=0.011), while participants diagnosed with myopericarditis or myocarditis had lower (p<0.05) plasmacytoid dendritic cell, NK-cell and plasma cell counts and lower anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibody levels (p=0.027). Conclusions: Pericarditis and myocarditis with clinical stability are frequent long after SARS-CoV-2 infection, even in presently asymptomatic subjects. These observations will probably apply to the general population infected and may indicate that cardiac sequelae might occur late in association with an altered (delayed) innate and adaptative immune response.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rocio Eiros","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Manuel Barreiro-Perez","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Ana Martin-Garcia","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Julia Almeida","author_inst":"University of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Villacorta","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Alba Perez-Pons","author_inst":"University of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Soraya Merchan","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Alba Torres-Valle","author_inst":"University of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Clara Sanchez-Pablo","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"David Gonzalez-Calle","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Oihane Perez-Escurza","author_inst":"University of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Ines Toranzo","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Elena Diaz-Pelaez","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Blanca Fuentes-Herrero","author_inst":"University of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Laura Macias-Alvarez","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Guillermo Oliva-Ariza","author_inst":"University of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Quentin Lecrevisse","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Rafael Fluxa","author_inst":"University of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Jose L Bravo-Grandez","author_inst":"University Hospital of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Alberto Orfao","author_inst":"University of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Pedro L Sanchez","author_inst":"University of Salamanca"},{"author_name":"Stephen A Ferrara","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Emily Mace","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Joshua Milner","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Anne Moscona","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Eldad A Hod","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Matteo Porotto","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Donna L Farber","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Waldemar Wierzba","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Zbigniew Krol","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Artur Zaczynski","author_inst":"Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Katarzyna Zycinska","author_inst":"Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Marek Postula","author_inst":"Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland"},{"author_name":"Ivica Luksic","author_inst":"Clinical Hospital Dubrava, Zagreb"},{"author_name":"Rok Civljak","author_inst":"Hospital for Infectious Diseases, Zagreb, Croatia"},{"author_name":"Alemka Markotic","author_inst":"Hospital for Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Christian Mahnkopf","author_inst":"REGIOMED-KLINIKEN GmbH, Gustav-Hirschfeld-Ring 3, 96450 Coburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andreas Markl","author_inst":"REGIOMED-KLINIKEN GmbH, Gustav-Hirschfeld-Ring 3, 96450 Coburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Johannes Brachmann","author_inst":"REGIOMED Kliniken"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Murray","author_inst":"School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Ourselin","author_inst":"School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"},{"author_name":"Julio Pascual","author_inst":"Department of Nephrology, Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Ana M Valdes","author_inst":"University of Nottingham, School of Medicine, Nottingham NIHR BRC"},{"author_name":"Margarita Posso","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Evaluation, Hospital del Mar-IMIM, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Juan Horcajada","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital del Mar.

Prognostic tool is essential in the contingency response for the next wave of outbreak. This study aims to develop prognostic models to predict COVID-19 patients' clinical outcome on day 1 and day 5 of hospital admission. Methods: We did a retrospective analysis of a complete cohort of 1,037 COVID-19 laboratory-confirmed patients in Hong Kong as of 30 April 2020, who were admitted to 16 public hospitals with their data sourced from an integrated electronic health records system. It covered demographic information, chronic disease(s) history, presenting symptoms as well as the worst clinical condition status, biomarkers' readings and Ct value of PCR tests on Day-1 and Day-5 of admission. The study subjects were randomly split into training and testing datasets in a 8:2 ratio. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model was used to classify the training data into three disease severity groups on Day-1 and Day-5. Results: The 1,037 patients had a mean age of 37.8 (SD {+\/-} 17.8), 53.8% of them were male. They were grouped under three disease outcome: 4.8% critical\/serious, 46.8% stable and 48.4% satisfactory. Under the full models, 30 indicators on Day-1 and Day-5 were used to predict the patients' disease outcome and achieved an accuracy rate of 92.3% and 99.5%. With a trade-off between practical application and predictive accuracy, the full models were reduced into simpler models with seven common specific predictors, including the worst clinical condition status (4-level), age group, and five biomarkers, namely, CRP, LDH, platelet, neutrophil\/lymphocyte ratio and albumin\/globulin ratio. Day-1 model's accuracy rate, macro- and micro-averaged sensitivity and specificity were 91.3%, 84.9%-91.3% and 96.0%-95.7% respectively, as compared to 94.2%, 95.9%-94.2% and 97.8%-97.1% under Day-5 model. Conclusions: Both Day-1 and Day-5 models can accurately predict the disease severity. Relevant clinical management could be planned according to the predicted patients' outcome. The model is transformed into a simple online calculator to provide convenient clinical reference tools at the point of care, with an aim to inform clinical decision on triage and step-down care.

Inequalities and burden of comorbidities of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vary importantly inside the countries. We aimed to analyze the Municipality-level factors associated with a high COVID-19 mortality rate of in Mexico. Methods. We retrieved information from 142,643 cumulative confirmed symptomatic cases and 18,886 deaths of COVID-19 as of June 20th, 2020 from the publicly available database of the Ministry of Health of Mexico. Public official data of the most recent census and surveys of the country were used to adjust a negative binomial regression model with the quintiles (Q) of the distribution of sociodemographic and health outcomes among 2,457 Municipality-level. Expected Mortality Rates (EMR), Incidence Rate Ratios (IRR) and 95% Confidence Intervals are reported. Results. Factors associated with high MR of COVID-19, relative to Quintile 1 (Q1), were; diabetes prevalence (Q4, IRR=2.60), obesity prevalence (Q5, IRR=1.93), diabetes mortality rate (Q5, IRR=1.58), proportion of indigenous population (Q2, IRR=1.68), proportion of economically active population (Q5, IRR=1.50), density of economic units that operate essential activities (Q4, IRR=1.54) and population density (Q5, IRR=2.12). We identified 1,351 Municipality-level without confirmed COVID-19 deaths, of which, 202 had nevertheless high (Q4, Mean EMR= 8.0 deaths per 100,000) and 82 very high expected COVID-19 mortality (Q5, Mean EMR= 13.8 deaths per 100,000). Conclusion. This study identified 1,351 Municipality-level of Mexico that, in spite of not having confirmed COVID-19 deaths yet, share characteristics that could eventually lead to a high mortality scenario later in the epidemic and warn against premature easing of mobility restrictions. Local information should be used to reinforce strategies of prevention and control of outbreaks in communities vulnerable to COVID-19.

This was more than twice the number of deaths reported in the next most severely impacted country. We jointly modelled the US epidemic at the state-level, using publicly available death data within a Bayesian hierarchical semi-mechanistic framework. For each state, we estimate the number of individuals that have been infected, the number of individuals that are currently infectious and the time-varying reproduction number (the average number of secondary infections caused by an infected person). We used changes in mobility to capture the impact that non-pharmaceutical interventions and other behaviour changes have on the rate of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Nationally, we estimated 3.7% [3.4%-4.0%] of the population had been infected by 1st June 2020, with wide variation between states, and approximately 0.01% of the population was infectious. We also demonstrated that good model forecasts of deaths for the next 3 weeks with low error and good coverage of our credible intervals.","rel_num_authors":53,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"H Juliette T Unwin","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Swapnil Mishra","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Valerie C Bradley","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Axel Gandy","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Thomas A Mellan","author_inst":"Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Helen Coupland","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Ish-Horowicz","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Michaela Andrea Christine Vollmer","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Charles Whittaker","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sarah L Filippi","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyue Xi","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"M\u00e9lodie Monod","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Oliver Ratmann","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Michael Hutchinson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Fabian Valka","author_inst":"None"},{"author_name":"Harrison Zhu","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Iwona Hawryluk","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Philip Milton","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Kylie E C Ainslie","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Marc Baguelin","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Adhiratha Boonyasiri","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Nick F Brazeau","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Cattarino","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Zulma M Cucunub\u00e1","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Gina Cuomo-Dannenburg","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Ilaria Dorigatti","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Oliver D Eales","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey W Eaton","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Sabinee L van Elsland","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Richard G FitzJohn","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Katy A M Gaythorpe","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"William Green","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Wes Hinsley","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Jeffrey","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Edward Knock","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Daniel J Laydon","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"John Lees","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Gemma Nedjati-Gilani","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Pierre Nouvellet","author_inst":"University of Sussex"},{"author_name":"Lucy C Okell","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Kris V Parag","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Igor Siveroni","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Hayley A Thompson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Patrick Walker","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Caroline E Walters","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Oliver J Watson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Lilith K Whittles","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Azra Ghani","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Neil M Ferguson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Steven Riley","author_inst":"Dept Inf Dis Epi, Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Christl A.
