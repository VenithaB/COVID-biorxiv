New tools are urgently needed to manage elective access. The study assesses the SWALIS-2020 model ability to prioritize and optimize access to surgery during the pandemic. Methods A 2020 March - May feasibility-pilot study, tested a software-aided, inter-hospital, multidisciplinary pathway. All specialties patients in the Genoa Departments referred for urgent elective surgery were included in a multidisciplinary pathway adopting a modified Surgical Waiting List InfoSystem (SWALIS) cumulative prioritization method (PAT-2020) based on waiting time and clinical urgency, in three subcategories: A1-15 days (certain rapid disease progression), A2-21 days (probable progression), and A3-30 days (potential progression). Results Following the feasibility study (N=55 patients), 240 referrals were evaluated in 4 weeks without major criticalities (M\/F=73\/167, Age=68.7 +\/- 14.0). Waiting lists were prioritized and monitored, and theatres allocated based on demand. The SWALIS-2020 score (% of waited-against-maximum time) at operation was 88.7 +\/- 45.2 at week 1 and then persistently over 100% (efficiency), over a controlled variation (equity), with a difference between A3 (153.29 +\/- 103.52) vs. A1 (97.24 +\/- 107.93) (p <0.001), and A3 vs. A2 (88.05 +\/- 77.51) (p <0.001). 222 patients underwent surgery, without related complications or delayed\/failed discharges. Conclusions The pathway has selected the very few patients with the greatest need, optimizing access even with +30% capacity weekly modifications. We will use the pathway to manage active, backlog, and hidden waiting lists throughout the further pandemic phases, and are looking for collaboration for multi-center research. https:\/\/www.isrctn.com\/ISRCTN11384058.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Roberto Valente","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Policlinico S.

However, the reusability of N95 masks is often limited by degradation or breakage of elastic head bands and issues with mask fit after repeated use. The purpose of this study was to develop a frame for N95 masks, using readily available materials and 3D printing, which could replace defective or broken bands and improve fit. Results: An iterative design process yielded a mask frame consisting of two 3D-printed side pieces, malleable wire links that users press against their face, and cut lengths of elastic material that go around the head to hold the frame and mask in place. Volunteers (n= 41; average BMI= 25.5), of whom 31 were women, underwent qualitative fit with and without mask frames and one or more of four different brands of FFRs conforming to US N95 or Chinese KN95 standards. Masks passed qualitative fit testing in the absence of a frame at rates varying from 48-92% (depending on mask model and tester). For individuals for whom a mask passed testing, 75-100% (average = 86%) also passed testing with a frame holding the mask in place. Among users for whom a mask failed in initial fit testing, 41% passed using a frame. Success varied with mask model and across individuals. Conclusions: The use of mask frames can prolong the lifespan of N95 and KN95 masks by serving as a substitute for broken or defective bands without adversely affecting fit. Frames also have the potential to improve fit for some individuals who cannot fit existing masks. Frames therefore represent a simple and inexpensive way of extending the life and utility of PPE in short supply. For clinicians and institutions interested in mask frames, designs and specifications are provided without restriction for use or modification. To ensure adequate performance in clinical settings, qualitative fit testing with user-specific masks and frames is required.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Malia McAvoy","author_inst":"Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology"},{"author_name":"Ai-Tram N.

Method and Material Online and telephonic interviews are conducted among 274 HCPs working in 24 PHCs (17 rural and 7 urban), across 13 districts of Rajasthan. Five dimensions of vulnerability covering awareness, exposure to infection (daily contact; contact with high risk individuals), physical and mental health conditions, while three aspects of preparedness at individual (personal care) and facility (provider safety; management and supervision) level are measured by employing factor analysis. Generalized ordered logit regression model is used to measure the effect of preparedness on COVID19 related vulnerability. Result: Among the 274 HCPs, majority of the staff are from rural PHCs (76 %), less than 35 years (87%), female (57%) and married (57 %). Almost half have high level exposure to COVID19, with mean contact rate is 90. Overall, 26% have comprehensive knowledge on COVID19, and 32% have any mental health issues. Although more than 70% of HCPs have reported more than one individual level preparedness, mental health measures adopted by the HCPs are comparably low. The facility level preparedness for enhancing safety are high such as social distance (79%) and maintaining record of each visitor (75%). However, management related measures adopted by the PHCs are perceived to be lower than the safety measures. The regression analyses suggest that safety related preparedness is significantly associated with reduction of vulnerability by 50%. The management-level preparedness has statistically no significant effect in explaining the variations in level of vulnerability. Conclusion: The facility-level safety measures, which lowers chances of acquiring infection has a positive effect on reducing vulnerability of COVID19. However, the HCPs do not have adequate preparedness at individual, facility management (PHC) and system level to reduce COVID19 vulnerability. Findings suggest that there is a need for a non-conventional approach of monitoring and supervision, in the absence of such measures there is a chance of moral injury that will make the HCPs at the primary level vulnerable to both physiologically and psychologically.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arup Kumar Das","author_inst":"Lords Education and Health Society| Wadhwani Initiative for Sustainable Healthcare (WISH)"},{"author_name":"Ambey Kumar Srivastava","author_inst":"Lords Education and Health Society| Wadhwani Initiative for Sustainable Healthcare (WISH)"},{"author_name":"Saswata Ghosh","author_inst":"Institute of Development Studies Kolkata (IDSK)"},{"author_name":"Ruchi Bhargava","author_inst":"Lords Education and Health Society (LEHS)| Wadhwani Initiative for Sustainable Healthcare (WISH)"},{"author_name":"Rajan Kumar Gupt","author_inst":"Lords Education and Health Society| Wadhwani Initiative for Sustainable Healthcare (WISH)"},{"author_name":"Rajesh Ranjan Singh","author_inst":"Lords Education and Health Society| Wadhwani Initiative for Sustainable Healthcare (WISH)"},{"author_name":"Helen Yang","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Jacob Freake","author_inst":"Fikst Product Development"},{"author_name":"Christopher Van","author_inst":"Borobot"},{"author_name":"David Krikorian","author_inst":"Dana Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Avilash Cramer","author_inst":"Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology"},{"author_name":"Leanne Smith","author_inst":"Borobot"},{"author_name":"Liwei Jiang","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Karen J.

However, the definition of wellbeing and the evidence-base behind such guidelines remains unclear. Objectives Assessing the applicability of wellbeing guidelines in practice; identify unaddressed HCWs' needs; and provide recommendations for supporting frontline staff during the current and future pandemics. Methods and Design This paper discusses the findings of a qualitative study based on interviews with frontline healthcare staff in the UK and examines them in relation to a rapid review of wellbeing guidelines developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Results 14 guidelines were included in the rapid review and 33 interviews with HCWs were conducted in the qualitative study. As a whole, the guidelines placed greater emphasis on wellbeing at an individual level, while HCWs placed greater emphasis on structural conditions at work, such as understaffing and the invaluable support of the community. This in turn had implications for the focus of wellbeing intervention strategies; staff reported an increased availability of formal mental health support, however, understaffing or clashing schedules prevented them from participating in these activities. Conclusion HCWs expressed wellbeing needs which align with social-ecological conceptualisations of wellbeing related to quality of life. This approach to wellbeing has been highlighted in literature about HCWs support in previous health emergencies, yet it has not been monitored during this pandemic. Wellbeing guidelines should explore staff's needs and contextual characteristics affecting the implementation of recommendations.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Norha Vera San Juan","author_inst":"Insitute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience.

Tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor blocking monoclonal antibody, has been repurposed for Covid-19, but prospective trials and dose-finding studies in Covid-19 are lacking. Methods We conducted a phase 2 trial of low-dose tocilizumab in hospitalized adult patients with Covid-19, radiographic pulmonary infiltrate, fever, and C-reactive protein (CRP) >= 40 mg\/L who did not require mechanical ventilation. Dose cohorts were determined by a trial Operations Committee, stratified by CRP and epidemiologic risk factors. A range of doses from 40 to 200 mg (low-dose tocilizumab) was evaluated, with allowance for one repeat dose at 24-48 hours. The primary objective was to assess the relationship of dose to fever resolution and CRP response. Outcomes were compared with retrospective controls with Covid-19. Correlative studies evaluating host antibody response were performed in parallel. Findings A total of 32 patients received low-dose tocilizumab. This cohort had improved fever resolution (75.0% vs. 34.2%, p = 0.001) and CRP decline (86.2% vs. 14.3%, p < 0.001) in the 24-48 hours following drug administration, as compared to the retrospective controls (N=41). The probabilities of fever resolution or CRP decline did not appear to be dose-related in this small study (p=0.80 and p=0.10, respectively). Within the 28-day follow-up, 5 (15.6%) patients died. For patients who recovered, median time to clinical recovery was 3 days (IQR, 2-5). Clinically presumed and\/or cultured bacterial superinfections were reported in 5 (15.6%) patients. Correlative biological studies demonstrated that tocilizumab-treated patients produced anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies comparable to controls. Interpretation Low-dose tocilizumab was associated with rapid improvement in clinical and laboratory measures of hyperinflammation in hospitalized patients with Covid-19. Results of this trial and its correlative biological studies provide rationale for a randomized, controlled trial of low-dose tocilizumab in Covid-19.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Garth W Strohbehn","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Brian L Heiss","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Sherin J Rouhani","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jonathan A Trujillo","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jovian Yu","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Alec J Kacew","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Emily F Higgs","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey C Bloodworth","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Cabanov","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Rachel C Wright","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Adriana Koziol","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Weiss","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Keith Danahey","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Theodore G Karrison","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Cuoghi C Edens","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Iazsmin Bauer Ventura","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Natasha N Pettit","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Bhakti Patel","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Pisano","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mary E Strek","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Thomas F Gajewski","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mark J Ratain","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Pankti D Reid","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Abdulla Al-Khan","author_inst":"HUMC"},{"author_name":"Steven Sperber","author_inst":"HUMC"},{"author_name":"Samit Desai","author_inst":"HUMC"},{"author_name":"Stacey Fanning","author_inst":"HMH CDI"},{"author_name":"Danit Arad","author_inst":"HUMC"},{"author_name":"Ronaldo Go","author_inst":"HUMC"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Tam","author_inst":"HUMC"},{"author_name":"Keith Rose","author_inst":"HUMC"},{"author_name":"Sean Sadikot","author_inst":"HUMC"},{"author_name":"David S Siegel","author_inst":"John Theurer Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Martin Gutierrez","author_inst":"John Theurer Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Andrew Ip","author_inst":"John Theurer Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Stuart Goldberg","author_inst":"John Theurer Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Tatyana Feldman","author_inst":"John Theurer Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Andre Goy","author_inst":"John Theurer Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Andrew Pecora","author_inst":"John Theurer Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Noa Biran","author_inst":"John Theurer Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Lori Leslie","author_inst":"John Theurer Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Alfred Gillio","author_inst":"HUMC"},{"author_name":"Sarah Timmapuri","author_inst":"HUMC"},{"author_name":"Michele Boonstra","author_inst":"John Theurer Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Samuel Singer","author_inst":"John Theurer Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Sukhdeep Kaur","author_inst":"John Theurer Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Ernest Richards","author_inst":"John Theurer Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"David Perlin","author_inst":"HMH CDI"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.22.20157263","rel_title":"Recent smell loss is the best predictor of COVID-19: a preregistered, cross-sectional study","rel_date":"2020-07-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.22.20157263","rel_abs":"Background: COVID-19 has heterogeneous manifestations, though one of the most common symptoms is a sudden loss of smell (anosmia or hyposmia). We investigated whether olfactory loss is a reliable predictor of COVID-19. Methods: This preregistered, cross-sectional study used a crowdsourced questionnaire in 23 languages to assess symptoms in individuals self-reporting recent respiratory illness. We quantified changes in chemosensory abilities during the course of the respiratory illness using 0-100 visual analog scales (VAS) for participants reporting a positive (C19+; n=4148) or negative (C19-; n=546) COVID-19 laboratory test outcome. Logistic regression models identified singular and cumulative predictors of COVID-19 status and post-COVID-19 olfactory recovery. Results: Both C19+ and C19- groups exhibited smell loss, but it was significantly larger in C19+ participants (mean{+\/-}SD, C19+: -82.5{+\/-}27.2 points; C19-: -59.8{+\/-}37.7). Smell loss during illness was the best predictor of COVID-19 in both single and cumulative feature models (ROC AUC=0.72), with additional features providing no significant model improvement. VAS ratings of smell loss were more predictive than binary chemosensory yes\/no-questions or other cardinal symptoms, such as fever or cough. Olfactory recovery within 40 days was reported for ~50% of participants and was best predicted by time since illness onset. Conclusions: As smell loss is the best predictor of COVID-19, we developed the ODoR-19 tool, a 0-10 scale to screen for recent olfactory loss. Numeric ratings [&le;]2 indicate high odds of symptomatic COVID-19 (10<OR<4), especially when viral lab tests are impractical or unavailable.","rel_num_authors":129,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Richard C.

One is a fitting function that can be calibrated to reproduce an epidemic curve with two timescales (e.g., fast growth and slow decay). The other is a compartmental model that accounts for quarantine, self-isolation, social distancing, a non-exponentially distributed incubation period, asymptomatic individuals, and mild and severe forms of symptomatic disease. Using Bayesian inference, we have been calibrating our models daily for consistency with new reports of confirmed cases from the 15 most populous metropolitan statistical areas in the United States and quantifying uncertainty in parameter estimates and predictions of future case reports. This online learning approach allows for early identification of new trends despite considerable variability in case reporting. We infer new significant upward trends for five of the metropolitan areas starting between 19-April-2020 and 12-June-2020.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yen Ting Lin","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Jacob Neumann","author_inst":"Northern Arizona University"},{"author_name":"Ely F Miller","author_inst":"Northern Arizona University"},{"author_name":"Richard G Posner","author_inst":"Northern Arizona University"},{"author_name":"Abhishek Mallela","author_inst":"University of California Davis"},{"author_name":"Cosmin Stafa","author_inst":"Sandia National Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Jaideep Ray","author_inst":"Sandia National Laboratories"},{"author_name":"Gautam Thakur","author_inst":"Oak Ridge National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Supriya Chinthavali","author_inst":"Oak Ridge National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"William S Hlavacek","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"C\u00e9dric Bouysset","author_inst":"Institut de Chimie de Nice, UMR CNRS 7272, Universit\u00e9 C\u00f4te D'Azur"},{"author_name":"Graciela M.

PCR tests are currently the gold standard for diagnosis of the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and serology tests are used to detect seroconversion in infected patients. However, there is a lack of quantitative and ultra-sensitive viral antigen tests for COVID-19. Here we show that Single Molecule Array (Simoa) assays can quantitatively detect SARS-CoV-2 spike, S1 subunit, and nucleocapsid antigens in the plasma of COVID-19 patients. Combined with Simoa anti-SARS-CoV-2 serological assays, we show correlation between production of antibodies and clearance of viral antigens from serial plasma samples from COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, we demonstrate the presence of viral antigens in blood correlates with disease severity in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens in the blood could be a marker for severe COVID-19 cases.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alana F Ogata","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Adam M Maley","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Connie Wu","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tal Gilboa","author_inst":"Harvard medical school"},{"author_name":"Maia Norman","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Roey Lazarovits","author_inst":"Wyss Institute"},{"author_name":"Chih-Ping Mao","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gail Newton","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Matthew Chang","author_inst":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Katrina Nguyen","author_inst":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Maliwan Kamkaew","author_inst":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Quan Zhu","author_inst":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Travis E Gibson","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Edward Ryan","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Richelle Charles","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wayne A Marasco","author_inst":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"David R Walt","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"M.

Studies reported that more than half of the SARS-CoV-2 infections are asymptomatic, confirming the importance for conducting seroepidemiological studies. Although the seroepidemiological studies in Japan observed a reported prevalence of 0.10% in Tokyo, 0.17% in Osaka, and 0.03% in Miyagi, sampling bias was not considered. The study objective was to assess the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in a random sample of households in Utsunomiya City in Tochigi Prefecture, Greater Tokyo, Japan. Methods: We launched the Utsunomiya COVID-19 seROprevalence Neighborhood Association (U-CORONA) Study to assess the seroprevalence of COVID-19 in Utsunomiya City. The survey was conducted between 14 June 2020 and 5 July 2020, in between the first and second wave of the pandemic. Invitations enclosed with a questionnaire were sent to 2,290 people in 1,000 households randomly selected from Utsunomiya basic resident registry. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The level of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was assessed by chemiluminescence immunoassay analysis. Results: Among 2,290 candidates, 753 returned the questionnaire and 742 received IgG tests (32.4 % participation rate). Of the 742 participants, 86.8% were 18 years or older, 52.6% were women, 71.1% were residing within 10 km from the test clinic, and 89.2% were living with another person. The age and sex distribution, distance to clinic and police district were similar with those of non-participants, while the proportion of single-person households was higher among non-participants than participants (16.2% vs. 10.8%). We confirmed three positive cases through quantitative antibody testing. No positive cases were found among the people who live in the same household as someone with positive. All cases were afebrile. The estimated unweighted and weighted prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection were 0.40% (95% confidence interval: 0.08-1.18%) and 1.23% (95% confidence interval: 0.17-2.28%), respectively. Conclusion: This study suggests the importance of detecting all cases using PCR or antigen testing, not only at a hospital, but also in areas where people assemble. Further prospective studies using this cohort are needed to monitor SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nobutoshi Nawa","author_inst":"Tokyo Medical and Dental University"},{"author_name":"Jin Kuramochi","author_inst":"Kuramochi Clinic Interpark"},{"author_name":"Shiro Sonoda","author_inst":"Kuramochi Clinic Interpark"},{"author_name":"Yui Yamaoka","author_inst":"Tokyo Medical and Dental University"},{"author_name":"Yoko Nukui","author_inst":"Tokyo Medical and Dental University"},{"author_name":"Yasunari Miyazaki","author_inst":"Tokyo Medical and Dental University"},{"author_name":"Takeo Fujiwara","author_inst":"Tokyo Medical and Dental University"},{"author_name":"Gail Newton","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Matthew Chang","author_inst":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Katrina Nguyen","author_inst":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Maliwan Kamkaew","author_inst":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Quan Zhu","author_inst":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Travis E Gibson","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Edward Ryan","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Richelle Charles","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wayne A Marasco","author_inst":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"David R Walt","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"M.

Early SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers a conserved transcriptomic response in peripheral blood that is heavily interferon-driven but also marked by indicators of early B-cell activation and antibody production. Interferon responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection demonstrate unique patterns of dysregulated expression compared to other infectious and healthy states. Heterogeneous activation of coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways are present in early COVID-19, as are IL1 and JAK\/STAT signaling pathways, that persist into late disease. Classifiers based on differentially expressed genes accurately distinguished SARS-CoV-2 infection from other acute illnesses (auROC 0.95). The transcriptome in peripheral blood reveals unique aspects of the immune response in COVID-19 and provides for novel biomarker-based approaches to diagnosis.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Micah T McClain","author_inst":"Duke University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Florica J Constantine","author_inst":"Duke University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Henao","author_inst":"Duke University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yiling Liu","author_inst":"Duke University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Ephraim L Tsalik","author_inst":"Duke University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Thomas W Burke","author_inst":"Duke University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Julie M Steinbrink","author_inst":"Duke University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Petzold","author_inst":"Duke University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Bradly P Nicholson","author_inst":"Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Robert Rolfe","author_inst":"Duke University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Bryan D Kraft","author_inst":"Duke University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Matthew S Kelly","author_inst":"Duke University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Gregory D Sempowski","author_inst":"Duke Human Vaccine Institute"},{"author_name":"Thomas N Denny","author_inst":"Duke Human Vaccine Institute"},{"author_name":"Geoffrey S Ginsburg","author_inst":"Duke Center for Applied Genomics and Precision Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher W Woods","author_inst":"Duke University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"David R Walt","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital"},{"author_name":"M.

We aimed to comprehensively characterize the viral RNA level and serum antibody responses in RP-DC patients and evaluate their viral transmission risk. Methods A population-based observational cohort study was performed on 479 DC patients discharged from February 1 to May 5, 2020 in Shenzhen, China. We conducted RT-qPCR, antibody assays, neutralisation assays, virus isolation, whole genome sequencing (WGS), and epidemiological investigation of close contacts. Findings Of 479 DC patients, the 93 (19%) RP individuals, including 36 with multiple RP results, were characterised by young age (median age: 34 years, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 29-38 years). The median discharge-to-RP length was 8 days (95% CI: 7-14 days; maximum: 90 days). After readmission, RP-DC patients exhibited mild (28%) or absent (72%) symptoms, with no disease progression. The viral RNA level in RP-DC patients ranged from 1.9-5.7 log10 copies\/mL (median: 3.2, 95% CI: 3.1-3.5). At RP detection, the IgM, IgG, IgA, total antibody, and neutralising antibody (NAb) seropositivity rates in RP-DC patients were 38% (18\/48), 98% (47\/48), 63% (30\/48), 100% (48\/48), and 91% (39\/43), respectively. Regarding antibody levels, there was no significant difference between RP-DC and non-RP-DC patients. The antibody level remained constant in RP-DC patients pre- and post-RP detection. Virus isolation of nine representative specimens returned negative results. WGS of six specimens yielded only genomic fragments. No clinical symptoms were exhibited by 96 close contacts of 23 RP-DC patients; their viral RNA (96\/96) and antibody (20\/20) test results were negative. After full recovery, 60% of patients (n=162, 78 no longer RP RP-DC and 84 non-RP-DC) had NAb titres of [&ge;]1:32. Interpretation RP may occur in DC patients following intermittent and non-stable excretion of low viral RNA levels. RP-DC patients pose a low risk of transmitting SARS-CoV-2. An NAb titre of [&ge;]1:32 may provide a reference indicator for evaluating humoral responses in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":35,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chao Yang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Min Jiang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaohui Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xiujuan Tang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Shisong Fang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Hao Li","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Le Zuo","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Yixiang Jiang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Yifan Zhong","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Qiongcheng Chen","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Chenli Zheng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Lei Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Shuang Wu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Weihua Wu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Hui Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Jing Yuan","author_inst":"State Key Discipline of Infectious Disease, National Clinical Research Center for infectious disease, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Hospital Affiliat"},{"author_name":"Xuejiao Liao","author_inst":"State Key Discipline of Infectious Disease, National Clinical Research Center for infectious disease, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Hospital Affiliat"},{"author_name":"Zhen Zhang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Yiman Lin","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Yijie Geng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Huan Zhang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Huanying Zheng","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Min Wan","author_inst":"Shenzhen LongHua District Maternity and Child Healthcare Hospital, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Linying Lu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaohu Ren","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Yujun Cui","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Xuan Zou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Tiejian Feng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Junjie Xia","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Ruifu Yang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Yingxia Liu","author_inst":"State Key Discipline of Infectious Disease, National Clinical Research Center for infectious disease, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Hospital Affiliat"},{"author_name":"Shujiang Mei","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Baisheng Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Zhengrong Yang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Qinghua Hu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Katherine L.

Here, we use a stochastic individual-based model to show that heterogeneities in individual exposure histories to endemic coronaviruses are able to explain observed age patterns of hospitalisation due to COVID-19 in EU\/EEA countries and the UK, provided there is (i) a decrease in cross-protection to SARS-CoV-2 with the number of eHCoV exposures and (ii) an increase in potential disease severity with number of eHCoV exposures or as a result of immune senescence. We also show that variation in health care capacity and testing efforts is compatible with country-specific differences in hospitalisation rates. Our findings call for further research on the role of cross-reactivity to endemic coronaviruses and highlight potential challenges arising from heterogeneous health care capacity and testing.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Francesco Pinotti","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Paul S Wikramaratna","author_inst":"No Affiliation"},{"author_name":"Uri Obolski","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University"},{"author_name":"Robert Paton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Daniel Santa Cruz Damineli","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Luiz Carlos Junior Alcantara","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Foundation"},{"author_name":"Marta Giovanetti","author_inst":"Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz"},{"author_name":"Sunetra Gupta","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jos\u00e9 Louren\u00e7o","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Qiongcheng Chen","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Chenli Zheng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Lei Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Shuang Wu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Weihua Wu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Hui Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Jing Yuan","author_inst":"State Key Discipline of Infectious Disease, National Clinical Research Center for infectious disease, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Hospital Affiliat"},{"author_name":"Xuejiao Liao","author_inst":"State Key Discipline of Infectious Disease, National Clinical Research Center for infectious disease, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Hospital Affiliat"},{"author_name":"Zhen Zhang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Yiman Lin","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Yijie Geng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Huan Zhang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Huanying Zheng","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Min Wan","author_inst":"Shenzhen LongHua District Maternity and Child Healthcare Hospital, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Linying Lu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaohu Ren","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Yujun Cui","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Xuan Zou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Tiejian Feng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Junjie Xia","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Ruifu Yang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Yingxia Liu","author_inst":"State Key Discipline of Infectious Disease, National Clinical Research Center for infectious disease, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Hospital Affiliat"},{"author_name":"Shujiang Mei","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Baisheng Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Zhengrong Yang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Qinghua Hu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Katherine L.

Methods: We created a 4:1 propensity score matched sample of COVID-19 patients without and with tuberculosis, using COVID-19 surveillance data in the Philippines. We conducted a longitudinal cohort analysis of matched COVID-19 patients as of May 17, 2020, following them until June 15, 2020. The primary analysis estimated the risk ratios of death and recovery in patients with and without tuberculosis. Kaplan-Meier curves described time-to-death and time-to-recovery stratified by tuberculosis status, and differences in survival were assessed using the Wilcoxon test. Results: The risk of death in COVID-19 patients with tuberculosis was 2.17 times higher than in those without (95% CI: 1.40-3.37). The risk of recovery in COVID-19 patients with tuberculosis was 25% lower than in those without (RR=0.75, 95% CI 0.63-0.91). Similarly, time-to-death was significantly shorter (p=0.0031) and time-to-recovery significantly longer in patients with tuberculosis (p=0.0046). Conclusions: Our findings show that coinfection with tuberculosis increased morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Our findings highlight the need to prioritize routine and testing services for tuberculosis, although health systems are disrupted by the heavy burden of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Karla Therese L.

Thus, to be informed on Nephrology personnel's sero-status might be crucial for patient protection. However, limited information exists about the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in asymptomatic individuals. Methods: We examined the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies among health care workers of a tertiary care kidney center during the peak phase of the Covid-19 crisis in Austria using an orthogonal test strategy and a total of 12 commercial nucleocapsid protein or spike glycoprotein based assays as well as Western blotting and a neutralization assay. Results: At baseline 60 of 235 study participants (25.5%, 95% CI: 20.4-31.5) were judged to be borderline positive or positive for IgM or IgG using a high sensitivity\/low specificity threshold in one test system. Follow-up analysis after about two weeks revealed IgG positivity in 12 (5.1%, 95% CI: 2.9-8.8) and IgM positivity in six (2.6%, 95% CI: 1.1-5.6) in at least one assay. 2.1% (95% CI: 0.8-5.0) of health care workers showed IgG nucleocapsid antibodies in at least two assays. By contrast, positive controls with proven Covid-19 showed antibody positivity among almost all test systems. Moreover, serum samples obtained from health care workers did not show SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing capacity, in contrast to positive controls. Conclusions: Using a broad spectrum of antibody tests the present study revealed inconsistent results for SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among asymptomatic individuals, while this was not the case among Covid-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas Reiter","author_inst":"Medical University of Vienna, Department of Medicine III, Division of Nephrology and

Although high rates of venous thromboembolism and evidence of COVID-19-induced endothelial dysfunction have been reported, the precise aetiology of the increased thrombotic risk associated with COVID-19 infection remains to be fully elucidated. Objectives Here, we assessed clinical platelet parameters and circulating platelet activity in patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19. Methods An assessment of clinical blood parameters in patients with severe COVID-19 disease (requiring intensive care), patients with non-severe disease (not requiring intensive care), general medical in-patients without COVID-19 and healthy donors was undertaken. Platelet function and activity were also assessed by secretion and specific marker analysis. Results We show that routine clinical blood parameters including increased MPV and decreased platelet:neutrophil ratio are associated with disease severity in COVID-19 upon hospitalisation and intensive care unit admission. Strikingly, agonist-induced ADP release was dramatically higher in COVID-19 patients compared with non-COVID-19 hospitalized patients and circulating levels of PF4, sP-selectin and TPO were also significantly elevated in COVID-19. Conclusion Distinct differences exist in routine full blood count and other clinical laboratory parameters between patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19. Moreover, we have determined that COVID-19 patients possess hyperactive circulating platelets. These data suggest that abnormal platelet reactivity may contribute to hypercoagulability in COVID-19. Further investigation of platelet function in COVID-19 may provide additional insights into the aetiology of thrombotic risk in this disease and may contribute to the optimisation of thrombosis prevention and treatment strategies.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shane P Comer","author_inst":"University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Sarah Cullivan","author_inst":"Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin Ireland"},{"author_name":"Paulina B Szklanna","author_inst":"University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Luisa Weiss","author_inst":"University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Steven Cullen","author_inst":"Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Sarah Kelliher","author_inst":"Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Albert Smolenski","author_inst":"University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Niamh Moran","author_inst":"Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Claire Murphy","author_inst":"Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Haidar Altaie","author_inst":"SAS UK Headquarters, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"John Curran","author_inst":"SAS Institute , Dublin, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Katherine O'Reilly","author_inst":"Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Aoife G Cotter","author_inst":"Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Brian Marsh","author_inst":"Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Sean Gaine","author_inst":"Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Patrick Mallon","author_inst":"St Vincent's University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Brian McCullagh","author_inst":"Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Fionnuala N\u00ed \u00c1inle","author_inst":"Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Barry Kevane","author_inst":"Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Patricia B Maguire","author_inst":"University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Huan Zhang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Huanying Zheng","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Min Wan","author_inst":"Shenzhen LongHua District Maternity and Child Healthcare Hospital, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Linying Lu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaohu Ren","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Yujun Cui","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Xuan Zou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Tiejian Feng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Junjie Xia","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Ruifu Yang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Yingxia Liu","author_inst":"State Key Discipline of Infectious Disease, National Clinical Research Center for infectious disease, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Hospital Affiliat"},{"author_name":"Shujiang Mei","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Baisheng Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Zhengrong Yang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Qinghua Hu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Katherine L.

It is not known whether any are suitable for widespread clinical implementation. We addressed this question by independent and systematic evaluation of their performance among hospitalised COVID-19 cases. Methods We conducted an observational cohort study to assess candidate prognostic models, identified through a living systematic review. We included consecutive adults admitted to a secondary care hospital with PCR-confirmed or clinically diagnosed community-acquired COVID-19 (1st February to 30th April 2020). We reconstructed candidate models as per their original descriptions and evaluated performance for their original intended outcomes (clinical deterioration or mortality) and time horizons. We assessed discrimination using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and calibration using calibration plots, slopes and calibration-in-the-large. We calculated net benefit compared to the default strategies of treating all and no patients, and against the most discriminating predictor in univariable analyses, based on a limited subset of a priori candidates. Results We tested 22 candidate prognostic models among a cohort of 411 participants, of whom 180 (43.8%) and 115 (28.0%) met the endpoints of clinical deterioration and mortality, respectively. The highest AUROCs were achieved by the NEWS2 score for prediction of deterioration over 24 hours (0.78; 95% CI 0.73-0.83), and a novel model for prediction of deterioration <14 days from admission (0.78; 0.74-0.82). Calibration appeared generally poor for models that used probability outcomes. In univariable analyses, admission oxygen saturation on room air was the strongest predictor of in-hospital deterioration (AUROC 0.76; 0.71-0.81), while age was the strongest predictor of in-hospital mortality (AUROC 0.76; 0.71-0.81). No prognostic model demonstrated consistently higher net benefit than using the most discriminating univariable predictors to stratify treatment, across a range of threshold probabilities. Conclusions Oxygen saturation on room air and patient age are strong predictors of deterioration and mortality among hospitalised adults with COVID-19, respectively. None of the prognostic models evaluated offer incremental value for patient stratification to these univariable predictors.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rishi K Gupta","author_inst":"Institute for Global Health, University College London, London, UK"},{"author_name":"Michael Marks","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Thomas H.

An alternate entry receptor for the virus was recently proposed to be basigin\/CD147. These early studies have already prompted a clinical trial and multiple published hypotheses of the role of this host receptor in viral infection and pathogenesis. We sought to independently characterize the basigin-spike protein interaction. After conducting several lines of experiments, we report that we are unable to find evidence supporting the role of basigin as a putative spike-binding receptor. Recombinant forms of both the entire ectodomain and S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that directly bind ACE2 do not interact with basigin expressed on the surface of human cells. Using specialized assays tailored to detect receptor interactions as weak or weaker than the proposed basigin-spike binding, we report no evidence for direct binding of the viral spike to either of the two common isoforms of basigin. Given the pressing need for clarity on which targets of SARS-CoV-2 may lead to promising therapeutics, we present these findings to allow more informed decisions about the translational relevance of this putative mechanism in the race to understand and treat COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jarrod Shilts","author_inst":"Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"Gavin James Wright","author_inst":"Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute"},{"author_name":"Thomas H.

The G-form is both more infectious in vitro and associated with increased viral loads in infected people. To gain insight into the mechanism underlying these distinctive characteristics, we employed multiple replicas of microsecond all-atom simulations to probe the molecular-level impact of this substitution on Spikes closed and open states. The open state enables Spike interactions with its human cellular receptor, ACE2. Here we show that changes in the inter-protomer energetics due to the D614G substitution favor a higher population of infection-capable (open) states. The inter-protomer interactions between S1 and S2 subunits in the open state of the D-form are asymmetric. This asymmetry is resolved in the G-form due to the release of tensile hydrogen bonds resulting in an increased population of open conformations. Thus, the increased infectivity of the G-form is likely due to a higher rate of profitable binding encounters with the host receptor. It is also predicted to be more neutralization sensitive due to enhanced exposure of the receptor binding domain, a key target region for neutralizing antibodies.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rachael A Mansbach","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Srirupa Chakraborty","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratoy"},{"author_name":"Kien Nguyen","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"David Montefiori","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Bette Korber","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"S.

COVID-19 is a viral disease that is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which has no approved vaccine. The available control measures are non-pharmacological interventions like wearing face masks, social distancing, and lockdown which are being advocated for by the WHO. This work assesses the impact of non-pharmaceutical control measures (social distancing and use of face-masks) and mass testing on the spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria. A community-based transmission model for COVID-19 in Nigeria is formulated with observing social distancing, wearing face masks in public and mass testing. The model is parameterized using Nigeria data on COVID-19 in Nigeria. The basic reproduction number is found to be less than unity( R_0<1) when the compliance with intervention measures is moderate (50%[&le;]<70%) and the testing rate per day is moderate (0.5[&le;]{sigma}_2<0.7) or when the compliance with intervention measures is strict ([&ge;]70%) and the testing rate per day is poor ({sigma}_2=0.3). This implies that Nigeria will be able to halt the spread of COVID-19 under these two conditions. However, it will be easier to enforce strict compliance with intervention measures in the presence of poor testing rate due to the limited availability of testing facilities and manpower in Nigeria. Hence, this study advocates that Nigerian governments (Federal and States) should aim at achieving a testing rate of at least 0.3 per day while ensuring that all the citizens strictly comply with wearing face masks and observing social distancing in public.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chinwendu Emilian Madubueze","author_inst":"University of Agriculture, Makurdi"},{"author_name":"Nkiru M.

The number of cases changes quickly and varies depending upon which source you use to track, so in the current epidemiological context, the early recognition is critical for the rapid identification of suspected cases (with SARS-CoV-2 infection-like symptoms and signs) to be immediately subjected to quarantine measures. Although surveys are widely used for identifying COVID-19 cases, outcomes and associated risks, no validated epidemiological tool exists for surveying SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population so far. Methods Our study is the phase II of the EPICOVID19 national survey, launched in April 2020 including a national convenience sample of 201121 adults, who voluntarily filled the EPICOVID19 questionnaire. The phase II questionnaire was mailed to all subjects who underwent tests for COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and who accepted to be involved in the second phase of the study, focused on the results reported for NPS and\/or serological IgG\/IgM tests. We evaluated the capability of the self-reported symptoms collected through the EPICOVID19 questionnaire to discriminate the COVID-19 among symptomatic subjects, in order to identify possible cases to undergo instrumental measurements and clinical examinations. We defined a method for the identification of a total score and validated it with reference to the serological and molecular clinical diagnosis, using four standard steps: identification of critical factors, confirmation of presence of latent variable, development of optimal scoring algorithm and validation of the scoring algorithm. Findings 2703 subjects [66% response rate] completed the Phase II questionnaire. Of 2703 individuals, 694 (25.7%) were NPS(+) and of these 84 (12.1% of the 694 NPS(+)) were asymptomatic. In the individuals who performed serological testing, of the 472 who did IgG(+) and 421 who did IgM(+), 22.9% and 11.6% tested positive, respectively. Among IgG(+) 1 of 108 subjects was asymptomatic (0.9%) while 5\/49 subjects among IgM(+) were asymptomatic (10.2%). Compared with NPS(-), among NPS(+) subjects there was a higher rate for Fever (421 [60.7%] vs 391[19.5% ]; p<0.0001), Loss of Taste and\/or Smell (365 [52.6%] vs 239 [11.9% ]; p<0.0001) and Cough (352 [50.7%] vs 580 [28.9% ]; p<0.0001). Also for other symptoms the frequencies were significantly higher in NPS(+) subjects than in NPS(-) ones (p<0.001). Among groups with serological tests, the symptoms with higher percentages in the subjects IgG(+) were Fever (65 [60.2%] vs 43[11.8% ]; p<0.0001) and Pain in muscles, bones, joints (73 [67.6%] vs 71 [19.5% ]; p<0.0001). For the COVID-19 self-reported symptoms items, exploratory (proportion variance explained [89.9%]) and confirmatory factor analysis results (SMSR 0.072; RMSEA 0.052) highlights the presence of one latent variable (factor) underlying the symptoms. We define the one-factor solution as EPICOVID19 diagnostic scale and optimal score for each items was identified: Respiratory problems (1.03), Chest pain (1.07), Loss of Taste and\/or Smell (0.97) and Tachycardia (palpitations) (1.05) were the most important symptoms. The cut-off score was 2.56 (Sensitivity 76.56%; Specificity 68.24%) in NPS(+) and 2.59 (Se 80.37; Sp 80.17) in IgG(+) subjects.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luca Bastiani","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Clinical Physiology"},{"author_name":"Loredana Fortunato","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Clinical Physiology"},{"author_name":"Stefania Pieroni","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Clinical Physiology"},{"author_name":"Fabrizio Bianchi","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Clinical Physiology"},{"author_name":"Fulvio Adorni","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Biomedical Technologies"},{"author_name":"Federica Prinelli","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Biomedical Technologies"},{"author_name":"Andrea Giacomelli","author_inst":"ASST-FBF-Sacco, University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Gabriele Pagani","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Unit, Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences L.Sacco"},{"author_name":"Stefania Maggi","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Neuroscience"},{"author_name":"Caterina Trevisan","author_inst":"University of Padova, Department of Medicine (DIMED)"},{"author_name":"Marianna Noale","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Neuroscience"},{"author_name":"Nithiya Jesuthasan","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Biomedical Technologies"},{"author_name":"Aleksandra Sojic","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Biomedical Technologies"},{"author_name":"Carla Pettenati","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Biomedical Technologies"},{"author_name":"Massimo Andreoni","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Clinic, Department of System Medicine"},{"author_name":"Raffaele Antonelli Incalzi","author_inst":"Unit of Geriatrics, Department of Medicine, Biomedical Campus of Rome"},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Unit, Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences L.Sacco"},{"author_name":"Sabrina Molinaro","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Clinical Physiology"},{"author_name":"Barry Kevane","author_inst":"Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Patricia B Maguire","author_inst":"University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Huan Zhang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Huanying Zheng","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Min Wan","author_inst":"Shenzhen LongHua District Maternity and Child Healthcare Hospital, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Linying Lu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaohu Ren","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Yujun Cui","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Xuan Zou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Tiejian Feng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Junjie Xia","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Ruifu Yang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Yingxia Liu","author_inst":"State Key Discipline of Infectious Disease, National Clinical Research Center for infectious disease, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Hospital Affiliat"},{"author_name":"Shujiang Mei","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Baisheng Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Zhengrong Yang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Qinghua Hu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Katherine L.

The key advantage of these data is that they allow us to examine infection rates for people with particular characteristics. We study how reported symptoms vary in the population and relate reported symptoms to a positive Covid-19 test in the small sample in the survey who were tested. Combining these probabilities we find that the chances of infection increase with a persons education level, are lower and declining with age among those aged over 55, and were higher in the West Midlands and London and lower in the North East than in the rest of the country, and tended to increase with regional population density. There is also evidence that the infection rate was lower among those of a Caribbean origin. A suitably cautious estimate of the mean infection rate is that, during the period up to the end of April 2020, it was between 2% and 8%, with a central rate of about 5%.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Richard Breen","author_inst":"Nuffield College, University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"John Ermisch","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Stefania Pieroni","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Clinical Physiology"},{"author_name":"Fabrizio Bianchi","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Clinical Physiology"},{"author_name":"Fulvio Adorni","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Biomedical Technologies"},{"author_name":"Federica Prinelli","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Biomedical Technologies"},{"author_name":"Andrea Giacomelli","author_inst":"ASST-FBF-Sacco, University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Gabriele Pagani","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Unit, Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences L.Sacco"},{"author_name":"Stefania Maggi","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Neuroscience"},{"author_name":"Caterina Trevisan","author_inst":"University of Padova, Department of Medicine (DIMED)"},{"author_name":"Marianna Noale","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Neuroscience"},{"author_name":"Nithiya Jesuthasan","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Biomedical Technologies"},{"author_name":"Aleksandra Sojic","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Biomedical Technologies"},{"author_name":"Carla Pettenati","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Biomedical Technologies"},{"author_name":"Massimo Andreoni","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Clinic, Department of System Medicine"},{"author_name":"Raffaele Antonelli Incalzi","author_inst":"Unit of Geriatrics, Department of Medicine, Biomedical Campus of Rome"},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Unit, Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences L.Sacco"},{"author_name":"Sabrina Molinaro","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Clinical Physiology"},{"author_name":"Barry Kevane","author_inst":"Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Patricia B Maguire","author_inst":"University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Huan Zhang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Huanying Zheng","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Min Wan","author_inst":"Shenzhen LongHua District Maternity and Child Healthcare Hospital, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Linying Lu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaohu Ren","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Yujun Cui","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Xuan Zou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Tiejian Feng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Junjie Xia","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Ruifu Yang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Yingxia Liu","author_inst":"State Key Discipline of Infectious Disease, National Clinical Research Center for infectious disease, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Hospital Affiliat"},{"author_name":"Shujiang Mei","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Baisheng Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Zhengrong Yang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Qinghua Hu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Katherine L.

As the risk of contracting directly-transmitted infections depends on who interacts with whom, mathematical models often use contact matrices to characterise the spread of infectious pathogens. These contact matrices are usually generated from diary-based contact surveys. However, the majority of places in the world do not have representative empirical contact studies, so synthetic contact matrices have been constructed using more widely available setting-specific survey data on household, school, classroom, and workplace composition combined with empirical data on contact patterns in Europe. In 2017, the largest set of synthetic contact matrices to date were published for 152 geographical locations. In this study, we update these matrices with the most recent data and extend our analysis to 177 geographical locations. Due to the observed geographic differences within countries, we also quantify contact patterns in rural and urban settings where data is available. Further, we compare both the 2017 and 2020 synthetic matrices to out-of-sample empirically-constructed contact matrices, and explore the effects of using both the empirical and synthetic contact matrices when modelling physical distancing interventions for the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that the synthetic contact matrices reproduce the main traits of the contact patterns in the empirically-constructed contact matrices. Models parameterised with the empirical and synthetic matrices generated similar findings with few differences observed in age groups where the empirical matrices have missing or aggregated age groups. This finding means that synthetic contact matrices may be used in modelling outbreaks in settings for which empirical studies have yet to be conducted.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kiesha Prem","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kevin van Zandvoort","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Petra Klepac","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nicholas G Davies","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"- Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Alex R Cook","author_inst":"Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Mark Jit","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stefania Maggi","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Neuroscience"},{"author_name":"Caterina Trevisan","author_inst":"University of Padova, Department of Medicine (DIMED)"},{"author_name":"Marianna Noale","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Neuroscience"},{"author_name":"Nithiya Jesuthasan","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Biomedical Technologies"},{"author_name":"Aleksandra Sojic","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Biomedical Technologies"},{"author_name":"Carla Pettenati","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Biomedical Technologies"},{"author_name":"Massimo Andreoni","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Clinic, Department of System Medicine"},{"author_name":"Raffaele Antonelli Incalzi","author_inst":"Unit of Geriatrics, Department of Medicine, Biomedical Campus of Rome"},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Unit, Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences L.Sacco"},{"author_name":"Sabrina Molinaro","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Clinical Physiology"},{"author_name":"Barry Kevane","author_inst":"Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Patricia B Maguire","author_inst":"University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Huan Zhang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Huanying Zheng","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Min Wan","author_inst":"Shenzhen LongHua District Maternity and Child Healthcare Hospital, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Linying Lu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaohu Ren","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Yujun Cui","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Xuan Zou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Tiejian Feng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Junjie Xia","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Ruifu Yang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Yingxia Liu","author_inst":"State Key Discipline of Infectious Disease, National Clinical Research Center for infectious disease, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Hospital Affiliat"},{"author_name":"Shujiang Mei","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Baisheng Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Zhengrong Yang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Qinghua Hu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Katherine L.

While the properties of the virus are similar from place to place, the impact has been dramatically different from place to place, due to such factors as population density, mobility, age distribution, etc. Thus, optimum testing and social distancing strategies may also be different from place to place. The Epidemiology Workbench provides access to an agent-based model in which demographic, geographic, and public health information a community together with a social distancing and testing strategy may be input, and a range of possible outcomes computed, to inform local authorities on coping strategies. The model is adaptable to other infectious diseases, and to other strains of coronavirus. The tool is illustrated by scenarios for the cities of Urbana and Champaign, Illinois, the home of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Our calculations suggest that massive testing along with some form of shelter-at-home during the weeks of mass ingress is the most effective strategy to combat the likely increase in local cases due to mass ingress of a student population carrying a higher viral load than that currently present in the community.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Santiago N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Corrales","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Eric Jakobsson","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Petra Klepac","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nicholas G Davies","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"- Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Alex R Cook","author_inst":"Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Mark Jit","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stefania Maggi","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Neuroscience"},{"author_name":"Caterina Trevisan","author_inst":"University of Padova, Department of Medicine (DIMED)"},{"author_name":"Marianna Noale","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Neuroscience"},{"author_name":"Nithiya Jesuthasan","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Biomedical Technologies"},{"author_name":"Aleksandra Sojic","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Biomedical Technologies"},{"author_name":"Carla Pettenati","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Biomedical Technologies"},{"author_name":"Massimo Andreoni","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Clinic, Department of System Medicine"},{"author_name":"Raffaele Antonelli Incalzi","author_inst":"Unit of Geriatrics, Department of Medicine, Biomedical Campus of Rome"},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Unit, Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences L.Sacco"},{"author_name":"Sabrina Molinaro","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Clinical Physiology"},{"author_name":"Barry Kevane","author_inst":"Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Patricia B Maguire","author_inst":"University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Huan Zhang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Huanying Zheng","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Min Wan","author_inst":"Shenzhen LongHua District Maternity and Child Healthcare Hospital, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Linying Lu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaohu Ren","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Yujun Cui","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Xuan Zou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Tiejian Feng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Junjie Xia","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Ruifu Yang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Yingxia Liu","author_inst":"State Key Discipline of Infectious Disease, National Clinical Research Center for infectious disease, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Hospital Affiliat"},{"author_name":"Shujiang Mei","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Baisheng Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Zhengrong Yang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Qinghua Hu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Katherine L.

Contact tracing, by identifying and quarantining people who have been in prolonged contact with an infectious individual, has the potential to stop the spread where and when it occurs, with thus limited impact. The limitations of manual contact tracing (MCT), due to delays and imperfect recall of contacts, might be compensated by digital contact tracing (DCT) based on smartphone apps, whose impact however depends on the app adoption. To assess the efficiency of such interventions in realistic settings, we use here datasets describing contacts between individuals in several contexts, with high spatial and temporal resolution, to feed numerical simulations of a compartmental model for COVID-19. We find that the obtained reduction of epidemic size has a robust behavior: this benefit is linear in the fraction of contacts recalled during MCT, and quadratic in the app adoption, with no threshold effect. The combination of tracing strategies can yield important benefits, and the cost (number of quarantines) vs. benefit curve has a typical parabolic shape, independent on the type of tracing, with a high benefit and low cost if app adoption and MCT efficiency are high enough. Our numerical results are qualitatively confirmed by analytical results on simplified models. These results may inform the inclusion of MCT and DCT within COVID-19 response plans.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alain Barrat","author_inst":"Aix Marseille Univ, Universite de Toulon, CNRS, CPT"},{"author_name":"Ciro Cattuto","author_inst":"University of Turin, Turin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Mikko Kivel\u00e4","author_inst":"Aalto University, Finland"},{"author_name":"Sune Lehmann","author_inst":"Technical University of Denmark, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Jari Saram\u00e4ki","author_inst":"Aalto University, Finland"},{"author_name":"- Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Alex R Cook","author_inst":"Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Mark Jit","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stefania Maggi","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Neuroscience"},{"author_name":"Caterina Trevisan","author_inst":"University of Padova, Department of Medicine (DIMED)"},{"author_name":"Marianna Noale","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Neuroscience"},{"author_name":"Nithiya Jesuthasan","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Biomedical Technologies"},{"author_name":"Aleksandra Sojic","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Biomedical Technologies"},{"author_name":"Carla Pettenati","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Biomedical Technologies"},{"author_name":"Massimo Andreoni","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Clinic, Department of System Medicine"},{"author_name":"Raffaele Antonelli Incalzi","author_inst":"Unit of Geriatrics, Department of Medicine, Biomedical Campus of Rome"},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Unit, Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences L.Sacco"},{"author_name":"Sabrina Molinaro","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Clinical Physiology"},{"author_name":"Barry Kevane","author_inst":"Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Patricia B Maguire","author_inst":"University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Huan Zhang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Huanying Zheng","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Min Wan","author_inst":"Shenzhen LongHua District Maternity and Child Healthcare Hospital, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Linying Lu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaohu Ren","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Yujun Cui","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Xuan Zou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Tiejian Feng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Junjie Xia","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Ruifu Yang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Yingxia Liu","author_inst":"State Key Discipline of Infectious Disease, National Clinical Research Center for infectious disease, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Hospital Affiliat"},{"author_name":"Shujiang Mei","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Baisheng Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Zhengrong Yang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Qinghua Hu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Katherine L.

Many involve myriad assumptions and parameters which cannot be reliably calculated under current conditions. We describe machine-learning and curve-fitting based models using fewer assumptions and readily available data. Methods: Instead of relying on highly parameterized models, we design and train multiple neural networks with data on a national and state level, from 9 COVID-19 affected countries, including Indian and US states and territories. Further, we use an array of curve-fitting techniques on government-reported numbers of COVID-19 infections and deaths, separately projecting and collating curves from multiple regions across the globe, at multiple levels of granularity, combining heavily-localized extrapolations to create accurate national predictions. Findings: We achieve an R2 of 0.999 on average through the use of curve-fits and fine-tuned statistical learning methods on historical, global data. Using neural network implementations, we consistently predict the number of reported cases in 9 geographically- and demographically-varied countries and states with an accuracy of 99.53% for 14 days of forecast and 99.1% for 24 days of forecast. Interpretation: We have shown that curve-fitting and machine-learning methods applied on reported COVID-19 data almost perfectly reproduce the results of far more complex and data-intensive epidemiological models. Using our methods, several other parameters may be established, such as the average detection rate of COVID-19. As an example, we find that the detection rate of cases in India (even with our most lenient estimates) is 2.38% - almost a fourth of the world average of 9%.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dewang K Agarwal","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Soham De","author_inst":"Ashoka University"},{"author_name":"Ojas Shukla","author_inst":"DPS International Gurgaon"},{"author_name":"Archit Checker","author_inst":"Ashoka University"},{"author_name":"Apoorvi Mittal","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Ankita Borah","author_inst":"Ashoka University"},{"author_name":"Debayan Gupta","author_inst":"Ashoka University"},{"author_name":"Mark Jit","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stefania Maggi","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Neuroscience"},{"author_name":"Caterina Trevisan","author_inst":"University of Padova, Department of Medicine (DIMED)"},{"author_name":"Marianna Noale","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Neuroscience"},{"author_name":"Nithiya Jesuthasan","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Biomedical Technologies"},{"author_name":"Aleksandra Sojic","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Biomedical Technologies"},{"author_name":"Carla Pettenati","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Biomedical Technologies"},{"author_name":"Massimo Andreoni","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Clinic, Department of System Medicine"},{"author_name":"Raffaele Antonelli Incalzi","author_inst":"Unit of Geriatrics, Department of Medicine, Biomedical Campus of Rome"},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Unit, Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences L.Sacco"},{"author_name":"Sabrina Molinaro","author_inst":"National Research Council, Institute of Clinical Physiology"},{"author_name":"Barry Kevane","author_inst":"Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Patricia B Maguire","author_inst":"University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland"},{"author_name":"Huan Zhang","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Huanying Zheng","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Min Wan","author_inst":"Shenzhen LongHua District Maternity and Child Healthcare Hospital, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Linying Lu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaohu Ren","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Yujun Cui","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Xuan Zou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Tiejian Feng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Junjie Xia","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Ruifu Yang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Yingxia Liu","author_inst":"State Key Discipline of Infectious Disease, National Clinical Research Center for infectious disease, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Hospital Affiliat"},{"author_name":"Shujiang Mei","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Baisheng Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong, China"},{"author_name":"Zhengrong Yang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Qinghua Hu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Katherine L.
