Neither vaccines nor therapeutic drugs are currently available for this novel coronavirus. All measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 are thus based on reducing contact between infected and susceptible individuals. Most of these measures such as quarantine and self-isolation require voluntary compliance by the population. However, humans may act in their (perceived) self-interest only. We construct a mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission with quarantine and hospitalization coupled with a dynamic game model of adaptive human behavior. Susceptible and infected individuals adopt various behavioral strategies based on perceived prevalence and burden of the disease and sensitivity to isolation measures, and they evolve their strategies using a social learning algorithm (imitation dynamics). This results in complex interplay between the epidemiological model, which affects success of different strategies, and the game-theoretic behavioral model, which in turn affects the spread of the disease. We found that the second wave of the pandemic, which has been observed in the US, can be attributed to rational behavior of susceptible individuals, and that multiple waves of the pandemic are possible if the rate of social learning of infected individuals is sufficiently high. To reduce the burden of the disease on the society, it is necessary to incentivize such altruistic behavior by infected individuals as voluntary self-isolation.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Folashade B.

The objective of this study was to report the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, consistent with previous infection, and to report the symptomatology of infection in children. Design This multicentre observational cohort study, conducted between 16th April - 3rd July 2020 at 5 UK sites, aimed to recruit 900 children aged 2 to 15 years of age. Participants provided blood samples for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing and data were gathered regarding unwell contacts and symptoms. Results 1007 participants were enrolled, and 992 were included in the final analysis. The median age of participants was 10.1 years. There were 68 (6.9%) participants with positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests indicative of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of these, 34\/68 (50%) reported no symptoms. The presence of antibodies and the mean antibody titre was not influenced by age. Following multivariate analysis 4 independent variables were identified as significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. These were: known infected household contact; fatigue; gastrointestinal symptoms; and changes in sense of smell or taste. Discussion In this study children demonstrated similar antibody titres in response to SARS-CoV-2 irrespective of age. The symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children were subtle but of those reported, fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms and changes in sense of smell or taste were most strongly associated with antibody positivity.

We, the people, have already started to live in a new-normal way, such as wearing masks, keeping a safe distance from others and maintaining higher level of health & hygiene standards. However, because of this pandemic, the global economy has taken a major blow. Many people have lost their livelihood, and now facing challenges in getting better healthcare facilities and food for survival. Given the serious challenges to the problem, this paper analyzes demographic data to predict vulnerable areas in Kolkata metropolitan city that houses nearly one-third of its population in slums and one-fifth below poverty level, under compromised living conditions. The analysis revealed that the highest risk areas are located in the east and west of the city, the area to a great extent overlapped with wards containing larger share of population below poverty level and are also living in slums. The analysis of publicly accessible Covid-19 case records and containment zones data indicate the hardest hit areas lies in the central Kolkata and several wards along the eastern and northeastern border of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation. The data further revealed that the virus infections have extended to the south Kolkata with increasing number of broad-based containment zones with heightened cases. The analysis of demographic characteristics of the hardest hit wards revealed that not a single variables are directly associated with the increase in the number of containment for a particular ward. The ranking of wards based on four intervention criterion have suggested that the lack of social awareness along with lack of social distancing have dominantly contributed to the increasing number of containment of Covid-19 cases in Kolkata. Determination of optimized ranking and Spearmans rank correlation coefficient of the wards based on four intervention criterion provided a basis for the policy makers to assess ward-based interventions criterion to control further spread of the disease and\/or prevent second wave of infections. Given that the effective antiviral drugs is far away from common publics reach, the application of our study approach would benefit saving lives of many vulnerable populations.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bibhash Nath","author_inst":"Hunter College of the City University of New York"},{"author_name":"Santanu Majumder","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Mahmudur Rahman","author_inst":"The University of Newcastle"},{"author_name":"Jayanta Sen","author_inst":"West Bengal State University"},{"author_name":"Claire Tonry","author_inst":"Queen's University Belfast"},{"author_name":"Alison P Watt","author_inst":"Belfast Health and Social Care Trust"},{"author_name":"Claire McGinn","author_inst":"Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children"},{"author_name":"Steven Foster","author_inst":"Royal Hospital for Children Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Evans","author_inst":"Cardiff and Vale University Health Board"},{"author_name":"Mark D Lyttle","author_inst":"University of the West of England"},{"author_name":"Shazaad Ahmad","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Shamez Ladhani","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Michael Corr","author_inst":"Belfast Health and Social Care Trust"},{"author_name":"Lisa McFetridge","author_inst":"Queen's University Belfast"},{"author_name":"Hannah Mitchell","author_inst":"Queen's University Belfast"},{"author_name":"Kevin Brown","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Gayatric Amirthalingam","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Julie-Ann Maney","author_inst":"Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children"},{"author_name":"Sharon Christie","author_inst":"Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.30.20184168","rel_title":"Suicide during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan","rel_date":"2020-09-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.30.20184168","rel_abs":"The prolonged uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic, fear and anxiety regarding infections, precautionary social isolation, and the resulting economic disruption could deteriorate psychological health and exacerbate the suicidal risk.

We employed difference-in-difference estimation and found that overall suicide rate declined by 14.8% (95% CI: -18.9% to -10.8%) after the outbreak and the subsequent measures (school closure and the state of emergency). The decline is larger among males than females and among adults than children and older adults.

These symptoms have been considered the best predictor of coronavirus infection, for this reason, it was decided to evaluate the predictive value of the smell and taste test and its association with the results of SARS-CoV-2 PCR-RT and rapid diagnostic tests. in the diagnosis of pathology. Methodology: 248 patients divided into 3 groups: asymptomatic, symptomatic without chemosensory disorders, and chemosensory disorders alone. All of them underwent SARS-CoV-2 PCR-RT, a rapid diagnostic test and a test of Venezuelan smell and basic taste at the beginning. Weekly follow-up with smell and taste test and SARS-CoV-2 PCR-RT until recovery. Results: 20.56% of patients had smell and taste disorders to a variable degree and were positive by SARS-CoV-PCR-RT. 2.15.3% of patients with chemosensory disorders were negative for COVID-19. The positive predictive value of the smell and taste test was 57.3; Sensitivity 41.13% and specificity 69.35%. There were no statistically significant differences by age, sex and chemosensory disorders. The predominant chemosensory disorder was the combination of mild hyposmia and hypogeusia and appeared in the company of other symptoms. Recovery occurred in an average of 8.5 days, asynchronously with the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negativization, which occurred up to more than 15 days after the senses recovered. Maximum time of negativization of the RT-PCR of 34 days. Conclusion: chemosensory disorders are a symptom and \/ or sign of coronavirus disease but cannot be considered as predictors of said disease in this population studied. The gold standard remains the SARS-CoV-2 PCR-RT test. Rapid diagnostic tests should be used for follow-up. Recommendations: it is necessary to expand the sample, include routine psychophysical smell and taste tests to screen cases and take race and virus mutations into consideration to explain behavior in certain populations. Key words: Smell, taste, coronavirus, test, diagnosis.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rosalinda Pieruzzini","author_inst":"Departament of Otolaryngology of the Hospital Military University Dr. Carlos Arvelo.

Acquired immunity still remains a dilemma. The aim of our study included a comprehensive analysis of patient characteristics, evaluation of antibody response, and its trend over a period of three months in recovered patients. Methods: Monocentric investigator-initiated pilot longitudinal observational study conducted by the Association Naso Sano, on a cohort of 30 COVID recovered patients based in the Umbria region, followed up from April to June 2020 for baseline blood counts, IgM and IgG trends using two different serological assays-ELISA and CLIA. The demographics, blood group, co-morbidities and treatment modalities were recorded from each patient along with an analysis of clinical profile, dates concerning symptom onset, first positive and two consecutive negative swabs using an online questionnaire followed by serological testing. Descriptive and Bivariate (Pearson correlation coefficient) statistics were conducted to detect statistically significant correlations. Findings: The study involved 30 patients with a M:F ratio of 0.57 and a distribution of mild (67%), moderate (30%) and critical (3%). Majority of the patients were healthcare workers (40%) and the mean viral shedding duration was 20.13 +\/- 6.17 days. The IgG levels offered long-standing protection as long as 3 months in some cases. A statistically significant, directly proportional correlation (Pearson) exists between ELISA and CLIA values for IgM. Some patients also expressed titers lower than the detection threshold and therefore a positive RT-PCR test does not necessarily guarantee a high IgG response in the recovery period. Interpretation: The data presented in our study provides a relative long-term analysis and possible explanation regarding the protection developed by patients recovered from COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Puya Dehgani-Mobaraki","author_inst":"Associazione Naso Sano, Umbria region, Italy."},{"author_name":"Asiya Kamber Zaidi","author_inst":"Associazione Naso Sano, Umbria region, Italy."},{"author_name":"Alessandro Floridi","author_inst":"Laboratory of Nuclear Lipid BioPathology, Centro Ricerche Analisi Biochimico Specialistiche, Perugia, Italy."},{"author_name":"Alessandro Lepri","author_inst":"Associazione Naso Sano"},{"author_name":"Emanuela Floridi","author_inst":"Laboratory of Nuclear Lipid BioPathology, Centro Ricerche Analisi Biochimico Specialistiche, Perugia, Italy."},{"author_name":"Alessia Gherardi","author_inst":"Centro Ricerche Analisi Biochimico Specialistiche, Perugia, Italy."},{"author_name":"Enrico Bernini-Carri","author_inst":"President of European Centre for Disaster and Emergency Medicine of Council of Europe, Strasbourg, Saint Marino"},{"author_name":"Eleonora Durzo","author_inst":"Independant"},{"author_name":"Massoud Dehgani-Mobaraki","author_inst":"Associazione Naso Sano, Umbria region, Italy."},{"author_name":"Angeline Grullon","author_inst":"Otorhinolaryngology Department of the Hospital Military University Dr. Carlos Arvelo.

We carried out proteomic profiling of plasma from cross-sectional and longitudinal cohorts of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and analyzed clinical data from our health system database of over 3,300 patients. Using a machine learning algorithm, we identified a prominent signature of neutrophil activation, including resistin, lipocalin-2, HGF, IL-8, and G-CSF, as the strongest predictors of critical illness. Neutrophil activation was present on the first day of hospitalization in patients who would only later require transfer to the intensive care unit, thus preceding the onset of critical illness and predicting increased mortality. In the health system database, early elevations in developing and mature neutrophil counts also predicted higher mortality rates. Altogether, we define an essential role for neutrophil activation in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and identify molecular neutrophil markers that distinguish patients at risk of future clinical decompensation.","rel_num_authors":30,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matthew L.

Study eligibility criteria: Population-based studies describing prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum antibodies in general people. Participants: general people who were tested for prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum antibodies. Interventions: There were no interventions. Methods: We used random-effects model to estimate pooled seroprevalence, and then extrapolated these findings to the global population (for 2020). Sub-group and meta-regression analyses explored potential sources of heterogeneity in the data and relationships between seroprevalence and socio-demographic, geographical and climatic factors. Results: In total, 47 serological studies involving 399,265 people from 23 countries met the inclusion criteria. The pooled seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in general people was estimated at 3.38% (95% CI, 3.05%-3.72%; 15,879\/399,265). On a regional basis, we determined seroprevalence estimates of 5.27% (3.97-6.57%) in Northern Europe; 4.41% (2.20-6.61%) in Southern Europe; 4.41% (3.03-5.79%) in North America; 3.17% (1.96-4.38%) in Western Europe; 2.02% (1.56-2.49%) in the Eastern Asia; and 1.45% (0.95-1.94%) in South America. Extrapolating to the 2020 world population, we estimated that 263,565,606 individuals had been exposed or infected with SARS-CoV-2 at the first wave of the pandemic. A significantly higher seroprevalence was related to higher income levels and human development indices, higher geographical latitudes and lower mean environmental temperatures. Interpretation This study reinforces that SARS-CoV-2 infection is a very rapidly-spreading communicable disease and calls for routine surveys to constantly monitor temporal changes in seroprevalence around the globe.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ali Rostami","author_inst":"Babol University of Medical Science"},{"author_name":"Mahdi Sepidarkish","author_inst":"Babol University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mariska Leeflang","author_inst":"University of Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Seyed Mohammad Riahi","author_inst":"Birjand University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Malihe Nourollahpour Shiadeh","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sahar Esfandyari","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Chicago"},{"author_name":"Ali H Mokdad","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Peter J.

We hypothesise that the most stringent social distancing (SD) measures (100% of level in Australia in April 2020) deliver better public health and economy outcomes. Design: Fit-for-purpose (individual-based and compartment) models were used to simulate the effects of different SD and detection strategies on Australian COVID-19 infections and the economy from March to July 2020. Public reported COVID-19 data were used to estimate model parameters. Main outcome measures: Public health and economy outcomes for multiple social distancing levels were evaluated, assessing hard versus soft lockdowns, and for early versus later relaxation of social distancing. Outcomes included costs and the timing and magnitude of observed COVID-19 cases and cumulative deaths in Australia from March to June 2020. Results: Higher levels of social distancing achieve zero community transmission with 100% probability and lower economy cost while low levels of social distancing result in uncontrolled outbreaks and higher economy costs. High social distancing total economy costs were $17.4B versus $41.2B for 0.7 social distancing. Early relaxation of suppression results in worse public health outcomes and higher economy costs. Conclusion(s): Better public health outcomes (reduced COVID-19 fatalities) are positively associated with lower economy costs and higher levels of social distancing; achieving zero community transmission lowers both public health and economy costs compared to allowing community transmission to continue; and early relaxation of social distancing increases both public health and economy costs.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Quentin Grafton","author_inst":"Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Tom Kompas","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"John Parslow","author_inst":"CSIRO"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Glass","author_inst":"Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Emily Banks","author_inst":"Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Kamalini Lokuge","author_inst":"Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Ali H Mokdad","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Peter J.

We aimed to assess the contribution of a- and presymptomatic residents and healthcare workers in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in three nursing homes. Methods Two serial point-prevalence surveys, 1 week apart, among residents and healthcare workers of three Dutch nursing homes with recent SARS-CoV-2 introduction. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal testing for SARS-CoV-2, including reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was conducted with reporting of cycle threshold (Ct). Participants were categorized as symptomatic, presymptomatic or asymptomatic with standardized symptom assessment. Results In total, 297 residents and 542 healthcare workers participated in the study. At the first point-prevalence survey, 15 residents tested positive of which one was presymptomatic (Ct value>35) and three remained asymptomatic (Ct value of 23, 30 and 32). At the second point-prevalence survey one resident and one healthcare worker tested SARS-CoV-2 positive (Ct value >35 and 24, respectively) and both remained asymptomatic. Conclusion This study confirms a- and presymptomatic occurrence of Covid-19 among residents and health care workers. Ct values below 25 suggested that these cases have the potential to contribute to viral spread. However, very limited transmission impeded the ability to answer the research question. We describe factors that may contribute to the prevention of transmission and argue that the necessity of large-scale preemptive testing in nursing homes may be dependent of the local situation regarding prevalence of cases in the surrounding community and infection control opportunities.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Laura W van Buul","author_inst":"Amsterdam University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Judith Henriette van den Besselaar","author_inst":"Amsterdam Universitair Medische Centra"},{"author_name":"Fleur M.H.P.H.

The diagnostic accuracy of five commercially available EIAs (Abbott, Euroimmun, EDI, ImmunoDiagnostics, and Roche) to detect IgG or total antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated from cross-sectional samples of potential CCP donors that had prior molecular confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection for sensitivity (n=214) and pre-pandemic emergency department patients for specificity (n=1,102). Of the 214 potential CCP donors, all were sampled >14 days since symptom onset and only a minority had been hospitalized due to COVID-19 (n=16 [7.5%]); 140 potential CCP donors were tested by all five EIAs and a microneutralization assay. When performed according to the manufacturers protocol to detect IgG or total antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the sensitivity of each EIA ranged from 76.4% to 93.9%, and the specificity of each EIA ranged from 87.0% to 99.6%. Using a nAb titer cutoff of [&ge;]160 as the reference positive test (n=140 CCP donors), the empirical area under receiver operating curve of each EIA ranged from 0.66 (Roche) to 0.90 (Euroimmun). Commercial EIAs with high diagnostic accuracy to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies did not necessarily have high diagnostic accuracy to detect high nAbs. Some but not all commercial EIAs may be useful in the identification of individuals with high nAbs in convalescent individuals.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eshan Patel","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Evan M Bloch","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Medicine"},{"author_name":"William Clarke","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yu-Hsiang Hsieh","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Denali Boon","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Yolanda J Eby","author_inst":"JHU"},{"author_name":"Reinaldo E Fernandez","author_inst":"JHU"},{"author_name":"Owen R Baker","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Morgan Keruly","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Charles S Kirby","author_inst":"JHU"},{"author_name":"Ethan Klock","author_inst":"JHU"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Littlefield","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,"},{"author_name":"Jernelle Miller","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Haley A Schmidt","author_inst":"JHU"},{"author_name":"Philip Sullivan","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Estelle Piwowar-Manning","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ruchee Shrestha","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Redd","author_inst":"NIAID\/NIH"},{"author_name":"Richard Eric Rothman","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Hospital"},{"author_name":"David J Sullivan","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Shmuel Shoham","author_inst":"The Johns Hopkins Hospital, , MD"},{"author_name":"Arturo Casadevall","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Thomas C.

Testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 199 individuals (39 children, 61 accompanying persons, 99 hospital employees) did not reveal active infection in any of the study participants. However, 22 (11%) of study participants had SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, indicating prior infection. Ten of these participants did not report symptoms compatible with Covid-19 in the 6 months prior to the study.

High capacity serologic assays detecting binding antibodies (bAb) have been developed, nAb assays are not adaptable to high-throughput testing. We sought to determine the effectiveness of using surrogate bAb signal-to-cutoff ratios (S\/CO) in predicting nAb titers using a pseudovirus reporter viral particle neutralization (RVPN) assay. METHODS: CCP donor serum collected by 3 US blood collectors was tested with a bAb assay (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics VITROS Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total, CoV2T) and a nAb RVPN assay. CoV2T prediction effectiveness at S\/CO thresholds was evaluated for RVPN nAb NT50 titers using receiver operating characteristic analysis. RESULTS: 753 CCPs were tested with median CoV2T S\/CO of 71.2 and median NT50 of 527.5. Proportions of CCP donors with NT50 over various target nAb titers were 86% [&ge;]1:80, 76% [&ge;]1:160, and 62%[&ge;]1:320. Increasing CoV2Ts reduced the sensitivity to predict NT50 titers, while specificity to identify those below thresholds increased. As the targeted NT50 increased, the positive predictive value fell with reciprocal increase in negative predictive value. S\/CO thresholds were thus less able to predict target NT50 titers. CONCLUSION: Selection of a clinically effective nAb titer will impact availability of CCP. Product release with CoV2T assay S\/CO thresholds must balance the risk of releasing products below target nAb titers with the cost of false negatives. A two-step testing scheme may be optimal, with nAb testing on CoV2T samples with S\/COs below thresholds.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Erin Goodhue Meyer","author_inst":"American Red Cross"},{"author_name":"Graham Simmons","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Eduard Grebe","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Michael Gannett","author_inst":"OneBlood"},{"author_name":"Sergej Franz","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Orsolya Darst","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Clara Di Germanio","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Mars Stone","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Paul Contestable","author_inst":"Ortho Clinical Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Alicia Prichard","author_inst":"OneBlood"},{"author_name":"Rita Reik","author_inst":"OneBlood"},{"author_name":"Ralph Vassallo","author_inst":"Vitalant"},{"author_name":"Pampee Young","author_inst":"American Red Cross"},{"author_name":"Michael Busch","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Phillip Williamson","author_inst":"Creative Testing Solutions"},{"author_name":"Larry Dumont","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Ruchee Shrestha","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Redd","author_inst":"NIAID\/NIH"},{"author_name":"Richard Eric Rothman","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Hospital"},{"author_name":"David J Sullivan","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Shmuel Shoham","author_inst":"The Johns Hopkins Hospital, , MD"},{"author_name":"Arturo Casadevall","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Thomas C.

A profound decrease of MAIT cell counts in blood of critically ill patients was observed. These cells showed a strongly activated and cytotoxic phenotype that positively correlated with circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines, notably IL-18. MAIT cell alterations markedly correlated with disease severity and patient mortality. SARS-CoV-2-infected macrophages activated MAIT cells in a cytokine-dependent manner involving an IFN-dependent early phase and an IL-18-induced later phase. Therefore, altered MAIT cell phenotypes represent valuable biomarkers of disease severity and their therapeutic manipulation might prevent the inflammatory phase involved in COVID-19 aggravation.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"H\u00e9lo\u00efse Flament","author_inst":"Immunological Dysfunction Unit, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France ;

Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study including 432 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to three medical centers in Hubei province from January 1st to April 10th 2020. Primary outcomes included ICU admission, mechanical ventilation and death occurring while hospitalized or within 30 days. Results: Of the 432 confirmed patients, 9.5% were admitted to the ICU, 27.3% required mechanical ventilation, and 33.1% died. Total leukocyte count was higher in survivors compared with those who died (8.9 vs 4.8 x 109\/l), but lymphocyte counts were lower (0.6 vs 1.0 x 109\/l). D-dimer was significantly higher in patients who died compared to survivors (6.0ug\/l vs 1.0ug\/l, p<0.0001. This was also seen when comparing mechanically versus non-mechanically-ventilated patients. Other significant differences were seen in AST, ALT, LDH, total bilirubin and creating kinase. The following were associated with increased odds of death: age > 65 years (adjusted hazard ratio (HR 2.09, 95% CI 1.02-4.05), severe disease at baseline (5.02, 2.05-12.29), current smoker (1.67, 1.37-2.02), temperature >39o C at baseline (2.68, 1.88-4.23), more than one comorbidity (2.12, 1.62-3.09), bilateral patchy shadowing on chest CT or X-ray (3.74, 1.78-9.62) and organ failure (6.47, 1.97-26.23). The following interventions were associated with higher CFR: glucocorticoids (1.60, 1.04-2.30), ICU admission (4.92, 1.37-17.64) and mechanical ventilation (2.35, 1.14-4.82). Conclusion: Demographics, including age over 65 years, current smoker, diabetes, hypertension, and cerebrovascular disease, were associated with increased risk of mortality. Mortality was also associated with glucocorticoid use, mechanical ventilation and ICU admission. Take-Home Message: COVID-19 patients with risk factors were more likely to be admitted into ICU and more likely to require mechanical ventilation.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hong Gang Ren","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xingyi Guo","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kevin Blighe","author_inst":"Clinical Bioinformatics Research Ltd."},{"author_name":"Fang Zhu","author_inst":"Western University"},{"author_name":"Janet Martin","author_inst":"Western University"},{"author_name":"Luqman Bin Safdar","author_inst":"The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs"},{"author_name":"Pengcheng Yang","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Dao Wen Wang","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Qinyong Hu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Nan Huo","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Justin Stebbing","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Davy Cheng","author_inst":"Western University"},{"author_name":"Muriel Andrieu","author_inst":"University of Paris, Institut Cochin, INSERM U1016, CNRS UMR 8104, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Christian Boitard","author_inst":"Department of Diabetology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Cochin University Hospital, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Ana\u00efs Vallet-Pichard","author_inst":"Department of Hepatology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Cochin University Hospital, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Jean-Francois Gautier","author_inst":"Department of Diabetes and Endocrinology, Lariboisiere Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Nadine Ajzenberg","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; University of Paris, LVTS, INSERM 114"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Terrier","author_inst":"Medical Intensive Care Unit, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris Cochin University Hospital, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Pene","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Cochin University Hospital, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Jade Ghosn","author_inst":"Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections Anti"},{"author_name":"Yazdan Yazdanpanah","author_inst":"Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections Anti"},{"author_name":"Benoit Visseaux","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections Antimicrobials Modelling Evo"},{"author_name":"Diane Descamps","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections Antimicrobials Modelling Evo"},{"author_name":"Jean-Francois Timsit","author_inst":"Medical and Infectious Diseases Intensive Care Unit, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections"},{"author_name":"Renato Costa Monteiro","author_inst":"Immunological Dysfunction Unit, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France ; University of Paris, Center fo"},{"author_name":"Agnes Lehuen","author_inst":"University of Paris, Institut Cochin, INSERM U1016, CNRS UMR 8104, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"William Damsky","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David van Dijk","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alfred Ian Lee","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hyung Chun","author_inst":"Yale University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.31.20185249","rel_title":"Take-Home Dosing Experiences among Persons Receiving Methadone Maintenance Treatment During COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-09-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.31.20185249","rel_abs":"Purpose: Methadone maintenance treatment is a life-saving treatment for people with opioid use disorders (OUD). The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) introduces many concerns surrounding access to opioid treatment. In March 2020, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) issued guidance allowing the expansion of take-home methadone doses. We sought to describe changes to treatment experiences from the perspective of persons receiving methadone at outpatient treatment facilities for OUD. Methods: We conducted an in-person survey among 104 persons receiving methadone from three clinics in central North Carolina. Surveys collected information on demographic characteristics, methadone treatment history, and experiences with take-home methadone doses in the context of COVID-19 (i.e., before and since March 2020). Results: Before COVID-19, the clinic-level percent of participants receiving any amount of days supply of take-home doses at each clinic varied ranged from 56% to 82%, while it ranged from 78% to 100% since COVID-19. The clinic-level percent of participants receiving a take-homes days supply of a week or longer (i.e., [&ge;]6 days) since COVID-19 ranged from 11% to 56%. Of the 87 participants who received take-homes since COVID-19 began, only four reported selling their take-home doses. Conclusions: Our study found variation in experiences of take-home dosing by clinic and little diversion of take-home doses. While SAMSHA guidance should allow expanded access to take-home doses, adoption of these guidelines may vary at the clinic level. The adoption of these policies should be explored further, particularly in the context of benefits to patients seeking treatment for OUD.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mary C Figgatt","author_inst":"UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health Department of Epidemiology"},{"author_name":"Zach Salazar","author_inst":"North Carolina Survivors Union"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Day","author_inst":"North Carolina Survivors Union"},{"author_name":"Louise Vincent","author_inst":"North Carolina Survivors Union"},{"author_name":"Nabarun Dasgupta","author_inst":"University of North Carolina"},{"author_name":"Luqman Bin Safdar","author_inst":"The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs"},{"author_name":"Pengcheng Yang","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Dao Wen Wang","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Qinyong Hu","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Nan Huo","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Justin Stebbing","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Davy Cheng","author_inst":"Western University"},{"author_name":"Muriel Andrieu","author_inst":"University of Paris, Institut Cochin, INSERM U1016, CNRS UMR 8104, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Christian Boitard","author_inst":"Department of Diabetology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Cochin University Hospital, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Ana\u00efs Vallet-Pichard","author_inst":"Department of Hepatology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Cochin University Hospital, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Jean-Francois Gautier","author_inst":"Department of Diabetes and Endocrinology, Lariboisiere Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Nadine Ajzenberg","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; University of Paris, LVTS, INSERM 114"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Terrier","author_inst":"Medical Intensive Care Unit, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris Cochin University Hospital, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Pene","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Cochin University Hospital, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Jade Ghosn","author_inst":"Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections Anti"},{"author_name":"Yazdan Yazdanpanah","author_inst":"Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections Anti"},{"author_name":"Benoit Visseaux","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections Antimicrobials Modelling Evo"},{"author_name":"Diane Descamps","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections Antimicrobials Modelling Evo"},{"author_name":"Jean-Francois Timsit","author_inst":"Medical and Infectious Diseases Intensive Care Unit, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections"},{"author_name":"Renato Costa Monteiro","author_inst":"Immunological Dysfunction Unit, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France ; University of Paris, Center fo"},{"author_name":"Agnes Lehuen","author_inst":"University of Paris, Institut Cochin, INSERM U1016, CNRS UMR 8104, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"William Damsky","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David van Dijk","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alfred Ian Lee","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hyung Chun","author_inst":"Yale University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"addiction medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.31.20185140","rel_title":"COVID-19 Myocardial Pathology Evaluated Through scrEening Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (COMPETE CMR)","rel_date":"2020-09-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.31.20185140","rel_abs":"Background Myocarditis is a leading cause of sudden cardiac death among competitive athletes and may occur without antecedent symptoms. COVID-19-associated myocarditis has been well-described, but the prevalence of myocardial inflammation and fibrosis in young athletes after COVID-19 infection is unknown. Objectives This study sought to evaluate the prevalence and extent of cardiovascular involvement in collegiate athletes that had recently recovered from COVID-19. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of collegiate varsity athletes with prior COVID-19 infection, all of whom underwent cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) prior to resumption of competitive sports in August 2020. Results Twenty-two collegiate athletes with prior COVID-19 infection underwent CMR. The median time from SARS-CoV-2 infection to CMR was 52 days. The mean age was 20.2 years. Athletes represented 8 different varsity sports. This cohort was compared to 22 healthy controls and 22 tactical athlete controls. Most athletes experienced mild illness (N=17, 77%), while the remainder (23%) were asymptomatic. No athletes had abnormal troponin I, electrocardiograms, or LVEF < 50% on echocardiography. Late gadolinium enhancement was found in 9% of collegiate athletes and one athlete (5%) met formal criteria for myocarditis. Conclusions Our study suggests that the prevalence of myocardial inflammation or fibrosis after an asymptomatic or mild course of ambulatory COVID-19 among competitive athletes is modest (9%), but would be missed by ECG, Ti, and strain echocardiography. Future investigation is necessary to further phenotype cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19 in order to better counsel athletes on return to sports participation.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel Eugene Clark","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Amar Parikh","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey M Dendy","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Alex B Diamond","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kristen George-Durrett","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Frank A Fish","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Warne Fitch","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Sean G Hughes","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jonathan H Soslow","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Nan Huo","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"Justin Stebbing","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Davy Cheng","author_inst":"Western University"},{"author_name":"Muriel Andrieu","author_inst":"University of Paris, Institut Cochin, INSERM U1016, CNRS UMR 8104, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Christian Boitard","author_inst":"Department of Diabetology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Cochin University Hospital, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Ana\u00efs Vallet-Pichard","author_inst":"Department of Hepatology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Cochin University Hospital, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Jean-Francois Gautier","author_inst":"Department of Diabetes and Endocrinology, Lariboisiere Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Nadine Ajzenberg","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; University of Paris, LVTS, INSERM 114"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Terrier","author_inst":"Medical Intensive Care Unit, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris Cochin University Hospital, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Pene","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Cochin University Hospital, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Jade Ghosn","author_inst":"Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections Anti"},{"author_name":"Yazdan Yazdanpanah","author_inst":"Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections Anti"},{"author_name":"Benoit Visseaux","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections Antimicrobials Modelling Evo"},{"author_name":"Diane Descamps","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections Antimicrobials Modelling Evo"},{"author_name":"Jean-Francois Timsit","author_inst":"Medical and Infectious Diseases Intensive Care Unit, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections"},{"author_name":"Renato Costa Monteiro","author_inst":"Immunological Dysfunction Unit, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France ; University of Paris, Center fo"},{"author_name":"Agnes Lehuen","author_inst":"University of Paris, Institut Cochin, INSERM U1016, CNRS UMR 8104, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"William Damsky","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David van Dijk","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alfred Ian Lee","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hyung Chun","author_inst":"Yale University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"cardiovascular medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.31.20185348","rel_title":"Occurrence of Pneumothorax and Pneumomediastinum in Covid-19 patients during non-invasive ventilation with Continuous Positive Airway Pressure","rel_date":"2020-09-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.31.20185348","rel_abs":"Background: Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure (AHRF) is a common complication of Covid-19 related pneumonia, for which non-invasive ventilation (NIV) with Helmet Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is widely used. During past epidemics of SARS and MERS pneumomediastinum (PNM) and pneumothorax (PNX) were common complications (respectively 1.7-12% and 16,4%) either spontaneous or associated to ventilation. Methods: Aim of our retrospective study was to investigate the incidence of PNX\/PNM in COVID-19 pneumonia patients treated with CPAP. Moreover, we examined the correlation between PNX\/PNM and Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) values. We collected data from patients admitted to Luigi Sacco University Hospital of Milan from 21\/02\/2020 to 06\/05\/2020 with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring CPAP. Results: One-hundred-fifty-four patients were enrolled. During hospitalization 3 PNX and 2 PNM occurred (3.2%). Out of these five patients 2 needed invasive ventilation after PNX, two died. In the overall population, 42 patients (27%) were treated with High-PEEP (>10 cmH2O), and 112 with Low-PEEP ([&le;]10 cmH2O). All the PNX\/PNM occurred in the High-PEEP group (5\/37 vs 0\/112, p<0,001). Conclusion: The incidence of PNX appears to be lower in COVID-19 than SARS and MERS, but their occurrence is accompanied by high mortality and worsening of clinical conditions. Considering the association of PNX\/PNM with high PEEP we suggest using the lower PEEP as possible to prevent these complications.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Antonio Gidaro","author_inst":"ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco"},{"author_name":"Federica Samartin","author_inst":"ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco"},{"author_name":"Anna Maria Brambilla","author_inst":"ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco"},{"author_name":"Chiara Cogliati","author_inst":"ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco"},{"author_name":"Stella Ingrassia","author_inst":"ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco"},{"author_name":"Francesco Banfi","author_inst":"ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco"},{"author_name":"Viola Cupiraggi","author_inst":"ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco"},{"author_name":"Cecilia Bonino","author_inst":"ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco"},{"author_name":"Marco Schiuma","author_inst":"ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco"},{"author_name":"Andrea Giacomelli","author_inst":"ASST-FBF-Sacco, University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Stefano Rusconi","author_inst":"ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Salvi","author_inst":"emalele29@gmail.com"},{"author_name":"Muriel Andrieu","author_inst":"University of Paris, Institut Cochin, INSERM U1016, CNRS UMR 8104, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Christian Boitard","author_inst":"Department of Diabetology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Cochin University Hospital, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Ana\u00efs Vallet-Pichard","author_inst":"Department of Hepatology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Cochin University Hospital, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Jean-Francois Gautier","author_inst":"Department of Diabetes and Endocrinology, Lariboisiere Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Nadine Ajzenberg","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; University of Paris, LVTS, INSERM 114"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Terrier","author_inst":"Medical Intensive Care Unit, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris Cochin University Hospital, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Pene","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Cochin University Hospital, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Jade Ghosn","author_inst":"Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections Anti"},{"author_name":"Yazdan Yazdanpanah","author_inst":"Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections Anti"},{"author_name":"Benoit Visseaux","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections Antimicrobials Modelling Evo"},{"author_name":"Diane Descamps","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections Antimicrobials Modelling Evo"},{"author_name":"Jean-Francois Timsit","author_inst":"Medical and Infectious Diseases Intensive Care Unit, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections"},{"author_name":"Renato Costa Monteiro","author_inst":"Immunological Dysfunction Unit, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France ; University of Paris, Center fo"},{"author_name":"Agnes Lehuen","author_inst":"University of Paris, Institut Cochin, INSERM U1016, CNRS UMR 8104, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"William Damsky","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David van Dijk","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alfred Ian Lee","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hyung Chun","author_inst":"Yale University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"emergency medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.31.20185157","rel_title":"ASSOCIATION OF HYPERGLYCEMIA WITH HOSPITAL MORTALITY IN COVID-19 PATIENTS WITHOUT DIABETES: A COHORT STUDY","rel_date":"2020-09-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.31.20185157","rel_abs":"Objective: Diabetes is a known risk factor for mortality in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Our objective was to identify prevalence of hyperglycemia in COVID-19 patients with and without diabetes and quantify its association with COVID-19 disease course. Research Design and Methods: In this observational cohort study, all consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to John H Stroger Jr. Hospital, Chicago, IL from March 15, 2020 to May 15, 2020 were included. The primary outcome was hospital mortality and the main predictor was hyperglycemia (any blood glucose [&ge;]7.78 mmol\/L during hospitalization). Results: Of 403 COVID-19 patients studied, 228 (57%) developed hyperglycemia. Of these, 83 (21%) had hyperglycemia without diabetes. A total of 51 (12.7%) patients died. Compared to the reference group no-diabetes\/no-hyperglycemia patients the no-diabetes\/hyperglycemia patients showed higher mortality (1.8% versus 20.5%, adjusted odds ratio 21.94 (95% confidence interval 4.04-119.0), p < 0.001); improved prediction of death (p=0.0162) and faster progression to death (p=0.0051). Hyperglycemia within the first 24 and 48 hours was also significantly associated with mortality (odds ratio 2.15 and 3.31, respectively). Further, compared to the same reference group, no-diabetes\/hyperglycemia patients had higher risk of ICU admission (p<0.001), mechanical ventilation (p<0.001) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (p<0.001) and a longer hospital stay in survivors (p<0.001). Conclusions: Hyperglycemia in the absence of diabetes was common (21% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients) and was associated with an increased risk of and faster progression to death. Development of hyperglycemia in COVID-19 patients who do not have diabetes is an early indicator of poor prognosis.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Manju Mamtani","author_inst":"M&H Research, LLC"},{"author_name":"Ambarish M Athavale","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Cook County Health, Chicago, Illinois"},{"author_name":"Mohan Abraham","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Cook County Health, Chicago, Illinois"},{"author_name":"Jane Vernik","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Cook County Health, Chicago, Illinois"},{"author_name":"Amatur Amarah","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Cook County Health, Chicago, Illinois"},{"author_name":"Juan Ruiz","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Cook County Health, Chicago, Illinois"},{"author_name":"Amit Joshi","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Cook County Health, Chicago, Illinois"},{"author_name":"Matthew Itteera","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Cook County Health, Chicago, Illinois"},{"author_name":"Sara Zhukovsky","author_inst":"Rush Medical College, Chicago, Illinois"},{"author_name":"Ravi Prakash Madaiah","author_inst":"Cerner Corporation, Kansas City, Missouri"},{"author_name":"Peter Hart","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Cook County Health, Chicago, Illinois"},{"author_name":"Hemant Kulkarni","author_inst":"M&H Research, LLC"},{"author_name":"Muriel Andrieu","author_inst":"University of Paris, Institut Cochin, INSERM U1016, CNRS UMR 8104, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Christian Boitard","author_inst":"Department of Diabetology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Cochin University Hospital, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Ana\u00efs Vallet-Pichard","author_inst":"Department of Hepatology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Cochin University Hospital, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Jean-Francois Gautier","author_inst":"Department of Diabetes and Endocrinology, Lariboisiere Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Nadine Ajzenberg","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; University of Paris, LVTS, INSERM 114"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Terrier","author_inst":"Medical Intensive Care Unit, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris Cochin University Hospital, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Pene","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Cochin University Hospital, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Jade Ghosn","author_inst":"Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections Anti"},{"author_name":"Yazdan Yazdanpanah","author_inst":"Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections Anti"},{"author_name":"Benoit Visseaux","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections Antimicrobials Modelling Evo"},{"author_name":"Diane Descamps","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections Antimicrobials Modelling Evo"},{"author_name":"Jean-Francois Timsit","author_inst":"Medical and Infectious Diseases Intensive Care Unit, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections"},{"author_name":"Renato Costa Monteiro","author_inst":"Immunological Dysfunction Unit, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France ; University of Paris, Center fo"},{"author_name":"Agnes Lehuen","author_inst":"University of Paris, Institut Cochin, INSERM U1016, CNRS UMR 8104, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"William Damsky","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David van Dijk","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alfred Ian Lee","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hyung Chun","author_inst":"Yale University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"endocrinology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.01.20182642","rel_title":"Covid-19 SEIDRD Modelling for Pakistan with implementation of seasonality, healthcare capacity and behavioral risk reduction","rel_date":"2020-09-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.01.20182642","rel_abs":"Introduction: December 2019 saw the origins of a new Pandemic which would soon spread to the farthest places of the planet. Several efforts of modelling of the geo-temporal transmissibility of the virus have been undertaken, but none describes the incorporation of effect of seasonality, contact density, primary care and ICU bed capacity and behavioural risk reduction measures such as lockdowns into the simulation modeling for Pakistan. We use above variables to create a close to real data curve function for the active cases of covid-19 in Pakistan. Objective: The objective of this study was to create a new computational epidemiological model for Pakistan by implementing symptomatology, healthcare capacity and behavioural risk reduction mathematically to predict of Covid-19 case trends and effects of changes in community characteristics and policy measures. Methods: We used a modified version of SEIR model called SEIDRD (Susceptible - Exposed Latent - Diagnosed as Mild or severe - Recovered - Deaths). This was developed using Vensim PLE software version 8.0. This model also incorporated the seasonal and capacity variables for Pakistan and was adjusted for behavioural risk reduction measures such as lockdowns. Results: The SEIDRD model was able to closely replicate the active covid-19 cases curve function for Pakistan until now. It was able to show that given current trends, though the number of active cases are dropping, if the smart lockdown measures were to end, the cases are expected to show a rise from 28th August 2020 onwards reaching a second peak around 28th September 2020. It was also seen that increasing the ICU bed capacity in Pakistan from 4000 to 40000 will not make a significant difference in active case number. Another simulation for a vaccination schedule of 100000 vaccines per day was created which showed a decrease in covid cases in a slow manner over a period of months rather than days. Conclusion: This study attempts to successfully model the active covid-19 cases curve function of Pakistan and mathematically models the effect of seasonality, contact density, ICU bed availability and Lockdown measures. We were able to show the effectiveness of smart lockdowns and were also to predict that in case of no smart lockdowns, Pakistan can see a rise in active case number starting from 28th of August 2020.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shoab Saadat","author_inst":"East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Salman Mansoor","author_inst":"Sligo University Hospital Ireland"},{"author_name":"Ammad Fahim","author_inst":"NUST Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Jane Vernik","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Cook County Health, Chicago, Illinois"},{"author_name":"Amatur Amarah","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Cook County Health, Chicago, Illinois"},{"author_name":"Juan Ruiz","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Cook County Health, Chicago, Illinois"},{"author_name":"Amit Joshi","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Cook County Health, Chicago, Illinois"},{"author_name":"Matthew Itteera","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Cook County Health, Chicago, Illinois"},{"author_name":"Sara Zhukovsky","author_inst":"Rush Medical College, Chicago, Illinois"},{"author_name":"Ravi Prakash Madaiah","author_inst":"Cerner Corporation, Kansas City, Missouri"},{"author_name":"Peter Hart","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Cook County Health, Chicago, Illinois"},{"author_name":"Hemant Kulkarni","author_inst":"M&H Research, LLC"},{"author_name":"Muriel Andrieu","author_inst":"University of Paris, Institut Cochin, INSERM U1016, CNRS UMR 8104, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Christian Boitard","author_inst":"Department of Diabetology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Cochin University Hospital, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Ana\u00efs Vallet-Pichard","author_inst":"Department of Hepatology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Cochin University Hospital, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Jean-Francois Gautier","author_inst":"Department of Diabetes and Endocrinology, Lariboisiere Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Nadine Ajzenberg","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; University of Paris, LVTS, INSERM 114"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Terrier","author_inst":"Medical Intensive Care Unit, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris Cochin University Hospital, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Pene","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Cochin University Hospital, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Jade Ghosn","author_inst":"Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections Anti"},{"author_name":"Yazdan Yazdanpanah","author_inst":"Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections Anti"},{"author_name":"Benoit Visseaux","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections Antimicrobials Modelling Evo"},{"author_name":"Diane Descamps","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections Antimicrobials Modelling Evo"},{"author_name":"Jean-Francois Timsit","author_inst":"Medical and Infectious Diseases Intensive Care Unit, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections"},{"author_name":"Renato Costa Monteiro","author_inst":"Immunological Dysfunction Unit, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France ; University of Paris, Center fo"},{"author_name":"Agnes Lehuen","author_inst":"University of Paris, Institut Cochin, INSERM U1016, CNRS UMR 8104, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"William Damsky","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David van Dijk","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alfred Ian Lee","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hyung Chun","author_inst":"Yale University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.01.20185868","rel_title":"Social multipliers and the Covid-19 epidemic: Analysis through constrained maximum entropy modeling","rel_date":"2020-09-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.01.20185868","rel_abs":"Abstract: Social multipliers occur when individual actions influence other individual actions so as to lead to amplified aggregate effects. Epidemic infections offer a dramatic example of this phenomenon since individual actions such as social distancing and masking that have small effects on individuals' risk can have very large effects in reducing risk when they are widely adopted. This paper uses the info-metric method of constrained maximum entropy modeling to estimate the impact of social multiplier effects in the Covid-19 epidemic with a model that infers the length of infection, the rate of mortality, the base infection factor, and reductions in the infection factor due to changes in social behavior from data on daily infections and deaths. While patterns are not universal over the sample of country data, they strongly support the conclusion that changes in social behavior are the primary factor influencing the dynamics of epidemics.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Duncan K Foley","author_inst":"New School for Social Research"},{"author_name":"Salman Mansoor","author_inst":"Sligo University Hospital Ireland"},{"author_name":"Ammad Fahim","author_inst":"NUST Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Jane Vernik","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Cook County Health, Chicago, Illinois"},{"author_name":"Amatur Amarah","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Cook County Health, Chicago, Illinois"},{"author_name":"Juan Ruiz","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Cook County Health, Chicago, Illinois"},{"author_name":"Amit Joshi","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Cook County Health, Chicago, Illinois"},{"author_name":"Matthew Itteera","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Cook County Health, Chicago, Illinois"},{"author_name":"Sara Zhukovsky","author_inst":"Rush Medical College, Chicago, Illinois"},{"author_name":"Ravi Prakash Madaiah","author_inst":"Cerner Corporation, Kansas City, Missouri"},{"author_name":"Peter Hart","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Cook County Health, Chicago, Illinois"},{"author_name":"Hemant Kulkarni","author_inst":"M&H Research, LLC"},{"author_name":"Muriel Andrieu","author_inst":"University of Paris, Institut Cochin, INSERM U1016, CNRS UMR 8104, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Christian Boitard","author_inst":"Department of Diabetology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Cochin University Hospital, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Ana\u00efs Vallet-Pichard","author_inst":"Department of Hepatology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Cochin University Hospital, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Jean-Francois Gautier","author_inst":"Department of Diabetes and Endocrinology, Lariboisiere Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Nadine Ajzenberg","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; University of Paris, LVTS, INSERM 114"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Terrier","author_inst":"Medical Intensive Care Unit, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris Cochin University Hospital, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Pene","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Cochin University Hospital, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Jade Ghosn","author_inst":"Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections Anti"},{"author_name":"Yazdan Yazdanpanah","author_inst":"Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections Anti"},{"author_name":"Benoit Visseaux","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections Antimicrobials Modelling Evo"},{"author_name":"Diane Descamps","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections Antimicrobials Modelling Evo"},{"author_name":"Jean-Francois Timsit","author_inst":"Medical and Infectious Diseases Intensive Care Unit, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections"},{"author_name":"Renato Costa Monteiro","author_inst":"Immunological Dysfunction Unit, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France ; University of Paris, Center fo"},{"author_name":"Agnes Lehuen","author_inst":"University of Paris, Institut Cochin, INSERM U1016, CNRS UMR 8104, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"William Damsky","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David van Dijk","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alfred Ian Lee","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hyung Chun","author_inst":"Yale University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.31.20184036","rel_title":"Assessing the Impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic on US Mortality: A County-Level Analysis","rel_date":"2020-09-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.31.20184036","rel_abs":"Covid-19 excess deaths refer to increases in mortality over what would normally have been expected in the absence of the Covid-19 pandemic. In this study, we take advantage of spatial variation in Covid-19 mortality across US counties to construct an Ordinary Least Squares regression model estimating its relationship with all-cause mortality. We then examine how the extent of excess mortality not assigned to Covid-19 varies across subsets of counties defined by demographic, structural, and policy characteristics. We estimate that 20.4% [95% CI (13.7%, 27.2%)] of excess deaths between February 1 and August 26, 2020 were ascribed to causes of death other than Covid-19 itself. Excess deaths not assigned to Covid-19 were even higher than predicted by our model in counties with high income inequality, low median income, low homeownership, and high percentages of Black residents, showing a pattern related to socioeconomic disadvantage and structural racism. Our work suggests that inequities in excess deaths attributable to Covid-19 may be even greater than revealed by data reporting deaths assigned to Covid-19 alone.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew C Stokes","author_inst":"Boston University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Dielle J Lundberg","author_inst":"Boston University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Katherine Hempstead","author_inst":"Robert Wood Johnson Foundation"},{"author_name":"Irma T Elo","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Samuel H Preston","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Juan Ruiz","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Cook County Health, Chicago, Illinois"},{"author_name":"Amit Joshi","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Cook County Health, Chicago, Illinois"},{"author_name":"Matthew Itteera","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Cook County Health, Chicago, Illinois"},{"author_name":"Sara Zhukovsky","author_inst":"Rush Medical College, Chicago, Illinois"},{"author_name":"Ravi Prakash Madaiah","author_inst":"Cerner Corporation, Kansas City, Missouri"},{"author_name":"Peter Hart","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Cook County Health, Chicago, Illinois"},{"author_name":"Hemant Kulkarni","author_inst":"M&H Research, LLC"},{"author_name":"Muriel Andrieu","author_inst":"University of Paris, Institut Cochin, INSERM U1016, CNRS UMR 8104, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Christian Boitard","author_inst":"Department of Diabetology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Cochin University Hospital, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Ana\u00efs Vallet-Pichard","author_inst":"Department of Hepatology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Cochin University Hospital, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Jean-Francois Gautier","author_inst":"Department of Diabetes and Endocrinology, Lariboisiere Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Nadine Ajzenberg","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France;

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis are states of chronic inflammation and indicate advanced metabolic disease. We sought to understand the risk of hospitalization for Covid-19 associated with NAFLD\/NASH. Methods: Retrospective analysis of electronic medical record data of 6,700 adults with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR from March 1, 2020 to Aug 25, 2020. Logistic regression and competing risk were used to assess odds of being hospitalized. Additional adjustment was added to assess risk of hospitalization among patients with a prescription for metformin use within the 3 months prior to the SARS-CoV-2 PCR result, history of home glucagon-like-peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) use, and history of metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS). Interactions were assessed by gender and race. Results: A history of NAFLD\/NASH was associated with increased odds of admission for Covid-19: logistic regression OR 2.04 (1.55, 2.96, p<0.01), competing risks OR 1.43 (1.09-1.88, p<0.01); and each additional year of having NAFLD\/NASH was associated with a significant increased risk of being hospitalized for Covid-19, OR 1.86 (1.43-2.42, p<0.01). After controlling for NAFLD\/NASH, persons with obesity had decreased odds of hospitalization for Covid-19, OR 0.41 (0.34-0.49, p<0.01). NAFLD\/NASH increased risk of hospitalization in men and women, and in all racial\/ethnic subgroups. Mediation treatments for metabolic syndrome were associated with non-significant reduced risk of admission: OR 0.42 (0.18-1.01, p=0.05) for home metformin use and OR 0.40 (0.14-1.17, p=0.10) for home GLP-1RA use. MBS was associated with a significant decreased risk of admission: OR 0.22 (0.05-0.98, p<0.05). Conclusions: NAFLD\/NASH is a significant risk factor for hospitalization for Covid-19, and appears to account for risk attributed to obesity.

The COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to exacerbate existing health inequalities as well as expose gaps in service provision for this vulnerable population group. Methods We investigated the responses of 648 staff working in mental healthcare with people with intellectual disabilities and\/or developmental disabilities. Participants contributed to a UK-wide online survey undertaken by the National Institute for Health Research Mental Health Policy Research Unit between 22nd April and 12th May 2020. Recruitment was via professional networks, social media and third sector organisations. Quantitative data describing staff experience over three domains (challenges at work, service user and carer problems, sources of help at work) were summarised and differences between groups explored using Chi square tests. Content analysis was used to organise qualitative data focusing on service changes in response to the pandemic. Results The majority of survey respondents worked in the NHS and in community mental health services. One third had managerial responsibility. Major concerns expressed by mental healthcare staff were: difficulties for service users due to lack of access to usual support networks and health and social care services during the pandemic; and difficulties maintaining adequate levels of support secondary to increased service user need. Staff reported having to quickly adopt new digital ways of working was challenging; nevertheless, free text responses identified remote working as the innovation that staff would most like to retain after the pandemic subsides. Conclusions Understanding the experiences of staff working across different settings in mental healthcare for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic is essential in guiding contingency planning and fostering service developments to ensure the health of this vulnerable group is protected in any future disease outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rory Sheehan","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Christian Dalton-Locke","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Afia Ali","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Vasiliki Totsika","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Norha Vera San Juan","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Angela Hassiotis","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Michael Usher","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Genevieve Metlon-Meaux","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Sayeed Ikramuddin","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Ravi Prakash Madaiah","author_inst":"Cerner Corporation, Kansas City, Missouri"},{"author_name":"Peter Hart","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Cook County Health, Chicago, Illinois"},{"author_name":"Hemant Kulkarni","author_inst":"M&H Research, LLC"},{"author_name":"Muriel Andrieu","author_inst":"University of Paris, Institut Cochin, INSERM U1016, CNRS UMR 8104, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Christian Boitard","author_inst":"Department of Diabetology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Cochin University Hospital, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Ana\u00efs Vallet-Pichard","author_inst":"Department of Hepatology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Cochin University Hospital, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Jean-Francois Gautier","author_inst":"Department of Diabetes and Endocrinology, Lariboisiere Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Nadine Ajzenberg","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; University of Paris, LVTS, INSERM 114"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Terrier","author_inst":"Medical Intensive Care Unit, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris Cochin University Hospital, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Pene","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Cochin University Hospital, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Jade Ghosn","author_inst":"Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections Anti"},{"author_name":"Yazdan Yazdanpanah","author_inst":"Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections Anti"},{"author_name":"Benoit Visseaux","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections Antimicrobials Modelling Evo"},{"author_name":"Diane Descamps","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections Antimicrobials Modelling Evo"},{"author_name":"Jean-Francois Timsit","author_inst":"Medical and Infectious Diseases Intensive Care Unit, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections"},{"author_name":"Renato Costa Monteiro","author_inst":"Immunological Dysfunction Unit, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France ; University of Paris, Center fo"},{"author_name":"Agnes Lehuen","author_inst":"University of Paris, Institut Cochin, INSERM U1016, CNRS UMR 8104, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"William Damsky","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David van Dijk","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alfred Ian Lee","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hyung Chun","author_inst":"Yale University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.01.20185694","rel_title":"Community pharmacists' knowledge and preparedness to participate in the fight against Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Zambia","rel_date":"2020-09-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.01.20185694","rel_abs":"Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has severely strained healthcare systems globally. Community pharmacists remain vital health professionals with unique roles in responding to symptoms, supplying medicines, and providing health promotion in the communities where they serve. The purpose of this study was to assess the level of knowledge and preparedness of community pharmacists in Zambia as frontline workers in curbing COVID-19. Method: This descriptive cross-sectional survey was conducted among 300 registered community pharmacists in Zambia. A self-administered online questionnaire was used to collect the data. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the data using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 23. Results: From a total of 393 community pharmacists, 300 participated in the study indicating a response rate of 76.3%. 97% of the pharmacists knew the common signs and symptoms of COVID-19, 83% knew the national guidelines for screening criteria, and 93% were aware that a suspected case of COVID-19 presenting to the community pharmacy needed to be alerted to the national response team. Only 59% knew they needed to self-isolate and self-report should they experience symptoms of COVID-19. 85% stated that personal protective equipment was inadequate in the pharmacies they operated from. 60% of the pharmacists were prepared to participate in the frontline fight against COVID-19. Conclusion: Community pharmacists in Zambia are knowledgeable about COVID-19 signs and symptoms, including the technical guidelines on the screening and detection of suspected cases. Community pharmacists are prepared to participate in the frontline fight against the COVID-19 pandemic in Zambia.

We investigated public perceptions of the UK government COVID-19 response, focusing on the relationship between trust and transparency, during the first wave (April 2020) of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. Methods: Anonymous survey data were collected (2020-04-06 to 2020-04-22) from 9,322 respondents, aged 20+ using an online questionnaire. We took a mixed methods approach to data analysis, combining statistical analyses, structural topic modelling (STM) and qualitative thematic coding of a sub-set of responses. Missing data were imputed via multiple imputation. Results: Most respondents (95.1%) supported government enforcement of behaviour change. While 52.1% of respondents thought the government was making good decisions, differences were apparent across demographic groups, for example respondents from Scotland had lower odds of responding positively than respondents in London. Higher educational levels saw decreasing odds of having a positive opinion of the government response and decreasing household income associated with decreasing positive opinion. Of respondents who thought the government was not making good decisions 60% believed the economy was being prioritised over people and their health. Positive views on government decision-making were associated with positive views on government transparency about the COVID-19 response. Qualitative analysis about government transparency highlighted five key themes: (1) the justification of opacity due to the condition of crisis, (2) generalised mistrust of politics, (3) concerns about the role of scientific evidence, (4) quality of government communication and (5) questions about political decision-making processes. Conclusion: We recommend targeted community engagement tailored to different groups experiences and a focus on accountability and openness around how decisions are made in the response to the UK COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luisa Enria","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Naomi Waterlow","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nina Trivedy Rogers","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Hannah Brindle","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sham Lal","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shelley Lees","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chrissy h Roberts","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM)"},{"author_name":"Sayeed Ikramuddin","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Ravi Prakash Madaiah","author_inst":"Cerner Corporation, Kansas City, Missouri"},{"author_name":"Peter Hart","author_inst":"Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Cook County Health, Chicago, Illinois"},{"author_name":"Hemant Kulkarni","author_inst":"M&H Research, LLC"},{"author_name":"Muriel Andrieu","author_inst":"University of Paris, Institut Cochin, INSERM U1016, CNRS UMR 8104, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Christian Boitard","author_inst":"Department of Diabetology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Cochin University Hospital, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Ana\u00efs Vallet-Pichard","author_inst":"Department of Hepatology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Cochin University Hospital, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Jean-Francois Gautier","author_inst":"Department of Diabetes and Endocrinology, Lariboisiere Hospital, AP-HP, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Nadine Ajzenberg","author_inst":"Department of Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; University of Paris, LVTS, INSERM 114"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Terrier","author_inst":"Medical Intensive Care Unit, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris Cochin University Hospital, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Pene","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Cochin University Hospital, Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Jade Ghosn","author_inst":"Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections Anti"},{"author_name":"Yazdan Yazdanpanah","author_inst":"Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections Anti"},{"author_name":"Benoit Visseaux","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections Antimicrobials Modelling Evo"},{"author_name":"Diane Descamps","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections Antimicrobials Modelling Evo"},{"author_name":"Jean-Francois Timsit","author_inst":"Medical and Infectious Diseases Intensive Care Unit, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France; Infections"},{"author_name":"Renato Costa Monteiro","author_inst":"Immunological Dysfunction Unit, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France ; University of Paris, Center fo"},{"author_name":"Agnes Lehuen","author_inst":"University of Paris, Institut Cochin, INSERM U1016, CNRS UMR 8104, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"William Damsky","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David van Dijk","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alfred Ian Lee","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hyung Chun","author_inst":"Yale University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.31.20169946","rel_title":"Determinants of SARS-CoV-2 receptor gene expression in upper and lower airways","rel_date":"2020-09-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.31.20169946","rel_abs":"The recent outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has led to a worldwide pandemic.

To design novel interventions aimed at preventing spread of the virus and reducing progression to severe disease, detailed knowledge of the cell types and regulating factors driving cellular entry is urgently needed. Here we assess the expression patterns in genes required for COVID-19 entry into cells and replication, and their regulation by genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors, throughout the respiratory tract using samples collected from the upper (nasal) and lower airways (bronchi). Matched samples from the upper and lower airways show a clear increased expression of these genes in the nose compared to the bronchi and parenchyma. Cellular deconvolution indicates a clear association of these genes with the proportion of secretory epithelial cells. Smoking status was found to increase the majority of COVID-19 related genes including ACE2 and TMPRSS2 but only in the lower airways, which was associated with a significant increase in the predicted proportion of goblet cells in bronchial samples of current smokers. Both acute and second hand smoke were found to increase ACE2 expression in the bronchus. Inhaled corticosteroids decrease ACE2 expression in the lower airways. No significant effect of genetics on ACE2 expression was observed, but a strong association of DNA- methylation with ACE2 and TMPRSS2- mRNA expression was identified in the bronchus.","rel_num_authors":38,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hananeh Aliee","author_inst":"Institute of Computational Biology, Helmholtz Centre, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Florian Massip","author_inst":"Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology, Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine, Robert-Rossle-Str. 10, 13125 Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Cancan Qi","author_inst":"University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen Research Institute for Asthma and COPD, Groningen, the Netherlands."},{"author_name":"Maria Stella de Biase","author_inst":"Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology, Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine, Robert-Rossle-Str. 10, 13125 Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Johannes L van Nijnatten","author_inst":"University of Technology Sydney, Respiratory Bioinformatics and Molecular Biology (RBMB), School of Life Sciences, Sydney, Australia."},{"author_name":"Elin T.G.

Most use simple calculations that can be performed by hand. While several COVID-19 specific risk scores exist, they lack the ease of use of these simpler scores. The objectives of this study were (1) to design, validate, and calibrate a simple, easy-to-use mortality risk score for COVID-19 patients and (2) to recalibrate SOFA, qSOFA, and CURB-65 in a hospitalized COVID-19 population. Design: Retrospective cohort study incorporating demographic, clinical, laboratory, and admissions data from electronic health records. Setting: Multi-hospital health system in New York City. Five hospitals were included: one quaternary care facility, one tertiary care facility, and three community hospitals. Participants: Patients (n=4840) with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV2 infection who were admitted between March 1 and April 28, 2020. Main outcome measures: Gray's K-sample test for the cumulative incidence of a competing risk was used to assess and rank 48 different variables' associations with mortality. Candidate variables were added to the composite score using DeLong's test to evaluate their effect on predictive performance (AUC) of in-hospital mortality. Final AUCs for the new score, SOFA, qSOFA, and CURB-65 were assessed on an independent test set. Results: Of 48 variables investigated, 36 (75%) displayed significant (p<0.05 by Gray's test) associations with mortality. The variables selected for the final score were (1) oxygen support level, (2) troponin, (3) blood urea nitrogen, (4) lymphocyte percentage, (5) Glasgow Coma Score, and (6) age. The new score, COBALT, outperforms SOFA, qSOFA, and CURB-65 at predicting mortality in this COVID-19 population: AUCs for initial, maximum, and mean COBALT scores were 0.81, 0.91, and 0.92, compared to 0.77, 0.87, and 0.87 for SOFA. We provide COVID-19 specific mortality estimates at all score levels for COBALT, SOFA, qSOFA, and CURB-65. Conclusions: The COBALT score provides a simple way to estimate mortality risk in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with superior performance to SOFA and other scores currently in widespread use. Evaluation of SOFA, qSOFA, and CURB-65 in this population highlights the importance of recalibrating mortality risk scores when they are used under novel conditions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This study's approach to score design could also be applied in other contexts to create simple, practical and high-performing mortality risk scores.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Edwin Yoo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Bethany Percha","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Max Tomlinson","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Victor Razuk","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Pan","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Madeleine Basist","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Pranai Tandon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jing Gennie Wang","author_inst":"Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Cynthia Gao","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sonali Bose","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Umesh K Gidwani","author_inst":"Mount Sinai Hospital"},{"author_name":"- Cambridge Lung Cancer Early Detection Programme","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"- INER-Ciencias Mexican Lung Program","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"- NHLBI LungMAP Consortium","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Margaret Neighbors","author_inst":"OMNI Biomarker Development, Genentech Inc.
