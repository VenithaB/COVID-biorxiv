Within this library, ciclesonide, an inhaled corticosteroid, suppressed human coronavirus replication in cultured cells, but did not suppress replication of respiratory syncytial virus or influenza virus. The effective concentration of ciclesonide to block SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of COVID-19) replication (EC90) was 6.3 M. After the eleventh consecutive MERS-CoV passage in the presence of ciclesonide, a resistant mutation was generated, which resulted in an amino acid substitution (A25V) in nonstructural protein (NSP) 15, as identified using reverse genetics. A recombinant virus with the mutation was also resistant to ciclesonide suppression of viral replication. These observations suggest that the effect of ciclesonide was specific to coronavirus, suggesting this is a candidate drug for treatment of patients suffering MERS or COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shutoku Matsuyama","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Miyuki Kawase","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Naganori Nao","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Kazuya Shirato","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Makoto Ujike","author_inst":"Nippon Veterinary and Life Science University"},{"author_name":"Wataru Kamitani","author_inst":"Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Masayuki Shimojima","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Shuetsu Fukushi","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.11.986836","rel_title":"A data-driven drug repositioning framework discovered a potential therapeutic agent targeting COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-03-12","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.11.986836","rel_abs":"The global spread of SARS-CoV-2 requires an urgent need to find effective therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19. We developed a data-driven drug repositioning framework, which applies both machine learning and statistical analysis approaches to systematically integrate and mine large-scale knowledge graph, literature and transcriptome data to discover the potential drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2. The retrospective study using the past SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV data demonstrated that our machine learning based method can successfully predict effective drug candidates against a specific coronavirus. Our in silico screening followed by wet-lab validation indicated that a poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitor, CVL218, currently in Phase I clinical trial, may be repurposed to treat COVID-19. Our in vitro assays revealed that CVL218 can exhibit effective inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 replication without obvious cytopathic effect. In addition, we showed that CVL218 is able to suppress the CpG-induced IL-6 production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggesting that it may also have anti-inflammatory effect that is highly relevant to the prevention immunopathology induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic evaluation in rats and monkeys showed a high concentration of CVL218 in lung and observed no apparent signs of toxicity, indicating the appealing potential of this drug for the treatment of the pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, molecular docking simulation suggested that CVL218 may bind to the N-terminal domain of nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2, providing a possible model to explain its antiviral action. We also proposed several possible mechanisms to explain the antiviral activities of PARP1 inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2, based on the data present in this study and previous evidences reported in the literature. In summary, the PARP1 inhibitor CVL218 discovered by our data-driven drug repositioning framework can serve as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":29,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yiyue Ge","author_inst":"NHC Key laboratory of Enteric Pathogenic Microbiology, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Diseases Control and

epidemics and pandemics worldwide, such as the on-going outbreak of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Existing direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs cannot be applied immediately to new viruses because of virus-specificity, and the development of new DAA drugs from the beginning is not timely for outbreaks. Thus, host-targeting antiviral (HTA) drugs have many advantages to fight against a broad spectrum of viruses, by blocking the viral replication and overcoming the potential viral mutagenesis simultaneously. Herein, we identified two potent inhibitors of DHODH, S312 and S416, with favorable drug-like and pharmacokinetic profiles, which all showed broad-spectrum antiviral effects against various RNA viruses, including influenza A virus (H1N1, H3N2, H9N2), Zika virus, Ebola virus, and particularly against the recent novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Our results are the first to validate that DHODH is an attractive host target through high antiviral efficacy in vivo and low virus replication in DHODH knocking-out cells. We also proposed the drug combination of DAA and HTA was a promising strategy for anti-virus treatment and proved that S312 showed more advantageous than Oseltamivir to treat advanced influenza diseases in severely infected animals. Notably, S416 is reported to be the most potent inhibitor with an EC50 of 17nM and SI value >5882 in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells so far. This work demonstrates that both our self-designed candidates and old drugs (Leflunomide\/Teriflunomide) with dual actions of antiviral and immuno-repression may have clinical potentials not only to influenza but also to COVID-19 circulating worldwide, no matter such viruses mutate or not.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rui Xiong","author_inst":"East China University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Leike Zhang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shiliang Li","author_inst":"East China University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yuan Sun","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Minyi Ding","author_inst":"East China University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yong Wang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yongliang Zhao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yan Wu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Weijuan Shang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiaming Jiang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jiwei Shan","author_inst":"East China University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zihao Shen","author_inst":"East China University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yi Tong","author_inst":"East China University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Liuxin Xu","author_inst":"East China University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yingle Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Gang Zou","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Dimitri Lavillete","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Zhenjiang Zhao","author_inst":"East China University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Rui Wang","author_inst":"East China University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Lili Zhu","author_inst":"East China University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Gengfu Xiao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ke Lan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Honglin Li","author_inst":"East China University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Ke Xu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Dan Zhao","author_inst":"Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China."},{"author_name":"Fengcai Zhu","author_inst":"NHC Key laboratory of Enteric Pathogenic Microbiology, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Diseases Control and Prevention, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, 210009, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaokun Shen","author_inst":"Convalife (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., Shanghai, 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Jianyang Zeng","author_inst":"Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.11.987222","rel_title":"Discovery of a 382-nt deletion during the early evolution of SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-03-12","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.11.987222","rel_abs":"To date, the SARS-CoV-2 genome has been considered genetically more stable than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.

The deletion also removes the ORF8 transcription-regulatory sequence (TRS), which in turn enhances the downstream transcription of the N gene. We also found that viruses with the deletion have been circulating for at least four weeks. During the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003, a number of genetic variants were observed in the human population [1], and similar variation has since been observed across SARS-related CoVs in humans and bats. Overwhelmingly these viruses had mutations or deletions in ORF8, that have been associated with reduced replicative fitness of the virus [2]. This is also consistent with the observation that towards the end of the outbreak sequences obtained from human SARS cases possessed an ORF8 deletion that may be associated with host adaptation [1].

The Chinese government responded to this epidemic with multiple public health policies including locking down the city of Wuhan, establishing multiple temporary hospitals, and prohibiting public gathering events. Here, we constructed a new real-time status dynamic model of SEIO (MH) to reveal the influence of national public health policies and to model the epidemic in Wuhan. Methods A real-time status dynamic model was proposed to model the population of Wuhan in status Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infected with symptoms (I), with Medical care (M), and Out of the system (O) daily. Model parameters were fitted according to the daily report of new infections from Jan. 27th, 2020 to Feb. 2nd, 2020. Using the fitted parameters, the epidemic under different conditions was simulated and compared with the current situation. Finding According to our study, the first patient is most likely appeared on Nov. 29th, 2019. There had already been 4,153 infected people and 6,536 exposed ones with the basic reproduction number R_0 of 2.65 before lockdown, whereas R_0 dropped to 1.98 for the first 30 days after the lockdown. The peak point is Feb. 17th, 2020 with 24,115 infected people and the end point is Jun. 17th, 2020. In total, 77,453 people will be infected. If lockdown imposed 7 days earlier, the total number of infected people would be 21,508, while delaying the lockdown by 1-6 days would expand the infection scale 1.23 to 4.94 times. A delay for 7 days would make the epidemic finally out of control. Doubling the number of beds in hospitals would decrease the total infections by 28%, and further investment in bed numbers would yield a diminishing return. Last, public gathering events that increased the transmission parameter by 5% in one single day would increase 4,243 infected people eventually. Interpretation Our model forecasted that the peak time in Wuhan was Feb. 17th, 2020 and the epidemic in Wuhan is now under control. The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is currently a global public health threat for all nations. Multiple countries including South Korea, Japan, Iran, Italy, and the United States are suffering from SARS-CoV-2. Our study, which simulated the epidemic in Wuhan, the first city in the world fighting against SARS-CoV-2, may provide useful guidance for other countries in dealing with similar situations.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"tianyi qiu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Han Xiao","author_inst":"Aalto University"},{"author_name":"Barnaby Young","author_inst":"National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Feng Zhu","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Martin Linster","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Shirin Kalimuddin","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Jenny Low","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Zhuang Yan","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Jayanthi Jayakumar","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Louisa Sun","author_inst":"Alexandra Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Yan","author_inst":"National University Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Ian Mendenhall","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Yee-Sin Leo","author_inst":"National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Singapore"},{"author_name":"David Lye","author_inst":"National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Lin-Fa Wang","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Gavin Smith","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Gang Zou","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Dimitri Lavillete","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Zhenjiang Zhao","author_inst":"East China University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Rui Wang","author_inst":"East China University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Lili Zhu","author_inst":"East China University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Gengfu Xiao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ke Lan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Honglin Li","author_inst":"East China University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Ke Xu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Dan Zhao","author_inst":"Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China."},{"author_name":"Fengcai Zhu","author_inst":"NHC Key laboratory of Enteric Pathogenic Microbiology, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Diseases Control and Prevention, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, 210009, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaokun Shen","author_inst":"Convalife (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., Shanghai, 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Jianyang Zeng","author_inst":"Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.06.20032342","rel_title":"Early, low-dose and short-term application of corticosteroid treatment in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia: single-center experience from Wuhan, China","rel_date":"2020-03-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.06.20032342","rel_abs":"Background: Severe patients with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia progressed rapidly to acute respiratory failure.

The patients with administration of methylprednisolone had a faster improvement of SpO2, while patients without administration of methylprednisolone had a significantly longer interval of using supplemental oxygen therapy (8.2days[IQR 7.0-10.3] vs. 13.5days(IQR 10.3-16); P<0.001). In terms of chest CT, the absorption degree of the focus was significantly better in patients with administration of methylprednisolone. Conclusion: Our data indicate that in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, early, low-dose and short-term application of corticosteroid was associated with a faster improvement of clinical symptoms and absorption of lung focus.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yin Wang","author_inst":"Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Weiwei Jiang","author_inst":"Department of Gastroenterology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Qi He","author_inst":"Department of Gastroenterology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Cheng Wang","author_inst":"Department of Rheumatology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Baoju Wang","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Pan Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Hand Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Nianguo Dong","author_inst":"Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Qiaoxia Tong","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jayanthi Jayakumar","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Louisa Sun","author_inst":"Alexandra Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Yan","author_inst":"National University Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Ian Mendenhall","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Yee-Sin Leo","author_inst":"National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Singapore"},{"author_name":"David Lye","author_inst":"National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Lin-Fa Wang","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Gavin Smith","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Gang Zou","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Dimitri Lavillete","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Zhenjiang Zhao","author_inst":"East China University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Rui Wang","author_inst":"East China University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Lili Zhu","author_inst":"East China University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Gengfu Xiao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ke Lan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Honglin Li","author_inst":"East China University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Ke Xu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Dan Zhao","author_inst":"Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China."},{"author_name":"Fengcai Zhu","author_inst":"NHC Key laboratory of Enteric Pathogenic Microbiology, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Diseases Control and Prevention, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, 210009, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaokun Shen","author_inst":"Convalife (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., Shanghai, 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Jianyang Zeng","author_inst":"Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.09.20032045","rel_title":"The effectiveness of full and partial travel bans against COVID-19 spread in Australia for travellers from China.","rel_date":"2020-03-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.09.20032045","rel_abs":"Australia implemented a travel ban on China on February 1st 2020. Partial lifting of the ban is being considered, given the decline in incidence of COVID-19 in China. We modelled three scenarios to test the impact of travel bans on epidemic control in Australia. Scenario one was no ban, scenario two was the current ban, scenario three was a partial lifting of the current ban to allow over 100,000 university students to enter Australia, but not tourists. We used disease incidence data from China and air travel passenger movements between China and Australia, derived from incoming passenger arrival cards. We estimated the true incidence of disease in China using data on expected proportion of under-ascertainment of cases. We used an age specific deterministic model divided in 18 age stratified groups to model the epidemic in each scenario. The modelled epidemic with the full ban fitted the observed incidence of cases well. The modelled epidemic of the current ban predicts 57 cases on March 6th in Australia, compared to 66 observed on this date. The modelled impact without a travel ban implemented on February the 1st shows the epidemic would continue for more than a year resulting in more than 2000 cases and about 400 deaths. The impact of a partial lifting of a ban is minimal, and may be safe to consider. Travel restrictions were highly effective for containing the COVID-19 epidemic in Australia and averted a much larger epidemic. The epidemic is still containable if other measures are used in tandem as cases surge in other countries. This research can inform decisions on placing or lifting travel bans as a control measure for the COVID-19 epidemic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Valentina Costantino","author_inst":"The Kirby Institute, UNSW Medicine, University of New South Wales, Australia"},{"author_name":"David James Heslop","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Community Medicine, UNSW Medicine, University of New South Wales, Australia"},{"author_name":"Chandini Raina MacIntyre","author_inst":"The Kirby Institute, UNSW Medicine, University of New South Wales"},{"author_name":"Cheng Wang","author_inst":"Department of Rheumatology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Baoju Wang","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Pan Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Hand Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Nianguo Dong","author_inst":"Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Qiaoxia Tong","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jayanthi Jayakumar","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Louisa Sun","author_inst":"Alexandra Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Yan","author_inst":"National University Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Ian Mendenhall","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Yee-Sin Leo","author_inst":"National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Singapore"},{"author_name":"David Lye","author_inst":"National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Lin-Fa Wang","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Gavin Smith","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Gang Zou","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Dimitri Lavillete","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Zhenjiang Zhao","author_inst":"East China University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Rui Wang","author_inst":"East China University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Lili Zhu","author_inst":"East China University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Gengfu Xiao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ke Lan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Honglin Li","author_inst":"East China University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Ke Xu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Dan Zhao","author_inst":"Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China."},{"author_name":"Fengcai Zhu","author_inst":"NHC Key laboratory of Enteric Pathogenic Microbiology, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Diseases Control and Prevention, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, 210009, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaokun Shen","author_inst":"Convalife (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., Shanghai, 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Jianyang Zeng","author_inst":"Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.08.20032946","rel_title":"Quantifying dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission suggests that epidemic control and avoidance is feasible through instantaneous digital contact tracing","rel_date":"2020-03-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.08.20032946","rel_abs":"The newly emergent human virus SARS-CoV-2 is resulting in high fatality rates and incapacitated health systems.

We analysed key parameters of epidemic spread to estimate the contribution of different transmission routes and determine requirements for case isolation and contact-tracing needed to stop the epidemic. We conclude that viral spread is too fast to be contained by manual contact tracing, but could be controlled if this process was faster, more efficient and happened at scale. A contact-tracing App which builds a memory of proximity contacts and immediately notifies contacts of positive cases can achieve epidemic control if used by enough people. By targeting recommendations to only those at risk, epidemics could be contained without need for mass quarantines ('lock-downs') that are harmful to society.

In a very short time, this virus spread rapidly over China, greatly threatening public health and economic development. The Chinese government acted quickly and implemented a series of strategies to prevent diffusion of this disease. We therefore sought to evaluate the effects of these Chinese strategies for controlling the spread of COVID-19. Methods: From the data of cumulative confirmed cases from provincial Health Commission websites of China, we performed model fitting and calculated the growth speed of cumulative confirmed patients. We further analyzed the time when this growth speed, the rate of the number of new cases, reached its maximum (Speedmax). Comparing different times to Speedmax of different areas in China, we calculated the dates at which the growth speed began to decline in different areas. Also, The number of plateaus were analyzed. Results: The quartic model showed the best fit. For almost all areas in mainland China, the speed of infections reached Speedmax and began to decline within 14 days; exceptions were Hebei, Heilongjiang, Hainan, Guizhou, and Hubei. The number of plateaus was significantly correlated with the emigration index. However, the distance from other areas to Hubei and the number of plateaus had little influence on when a province or area arrived at Speedmax. Once strict intervention strategies were implemented, diffusion and deterioration of COVID-19 were inhibited quickly and effectively over China. Conclusion: Our study suggests that Chinese strategies are highly effective on controlling the diffusion and deterioration of the novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia. These strategies supply experience and guidelines for other countries to control the COVID-19 epidemic.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaoqiang Wang","author_inst":"Renji Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Weitian Tian","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, Renji Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xin Lv","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, Shanghai pulmonary hospital"},{"author_name":"Yumiao Shi","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, Renji Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xiaoxin Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, Renji Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Weifeng Yu","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, Renji Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Diansan Su","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, Renji Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jie Tian","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology, Renji Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christophe Fraser","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Louisa Sun","author_inst":"Alexandra Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Yan","author_inst":"National University Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Ian Mendenhall","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Yee-Sin Leo","author_inst":"National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Singapore"},{"author_name":"David Lye","author_inst":"National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Lin-Fa Wang","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Gavin Smith","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Gang Zou","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Dimitri Lavillete","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Zhenjiang Zhao","author_inst":"East China University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Rui Wang","author_inst":"East China University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Lili Zhu","author_inst":"East China University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Gengfu Xiao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ke Lan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Honglin Li","author_inst":"East China University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Ke Xu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Dan Zhao","author_inst":"Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China."},{"author_name":"Fengcai Zhu","author_inst":"NHC Key laboratory of Enteric Pathogenic Microbiology, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Diseases Control and Prevention, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, 210009, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaokun Shen","author_inst":"Convalife (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., Shanghai, 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Jianyang Zeng","author_inst":"Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.10.20032136","rel_title":"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in adolescents and young adults","rel_date":"2020-03-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.10.20032136","rel_abs":"Background: Adolescents and young adults might play a key role in the worldwide spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), because they are more involved in overseas studying, business, working, and travelling.

The demographics, epidemiological, and clinical data were collected. Several key epidemiological parameters, the asymptomatic cases and transmission to their family members and the clinical characteristics at admission, and during treatment were summarized. RESULTS: Of 46 confirmed patients, 14 patients (47.3%) were aged from 10 to 24 years, and 24 (52.7%) patients were male. The mean incubation period for symptomatic cases was 6.6 days (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.4 - 9.6). The median serial interval was 1.9 days (95% CI 0.4 - 6.2). Three of asymptomatic cases showed the transmission to their family members. Only 1 patient was identified as severe cases at admission. The common symptoms at admission were dry cough (34, 91.0%), and fever (29, 69.0%). Nearly 60% of the patients had showed ground-glass opacity by chest CT findings. Three patients developed acute kidney injury during treatment. Majority of patients (78.3%) were discharged by the end of the follow-up. Conclusions: The adolescent and young adult patients of COVID-19 had a long incubation period, and a short serial interval. The transmission to their family contactors occurred in asymptomatic cases.

Since then, the city of Wuhan has taken unprecedented measures and efforts in response to the outbreak. METHODS: We quantified the effects of control measures on population contact patterns in Wuhan, China, to assess their effects on the progression of the outbreak. We included the latest estimates of epidemic parameters from a transmission model fitted to data on local and internationally exported cases from Wuhan in the age-structured epidemic framework. Further, we looked at the age-distribution of cases. Lastly, we simulated lifting of the control measures by allowing people to return to work in a phased-in way, and looked at the effects of returning to work at different stages of the underlying outbreak. FINDINGS: Changes in mixing patterns may have contributed to reducing the number of infections in mid-2020 by 92% (interquartile range: 66-97%). There are benefits to sustaining these measures until April in terms of reducing the height of the peak, overall epidemic size in mid-2020 and probability that a second peak may occur after return to work. However, the modelled effects of social distancing measures vary by the duration of infectiousness and the role school children play in the epidemic. INTERPRETATION: Restrictions on activities in Wuhan, if maintained until April, would likely contribute to the reduction and delay the epidemic size and peak, respectively. However, there are some limitations to the analysis, including large uncertainties around estimates of R0 and the duration of infectiousness.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kiesha Prem","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yang Liu","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tim Russell","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adam J Kucharski","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Davies","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Mark Jit","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Petra Klepac","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Huaming Mou","author_inst":"Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chenxi Song","author_inst":"Fuwai Hospital, National Center for Cardiovascular Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Feng Li","author_inst":"Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guicheng Wu","author_inst":"Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jingjing Zhang","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Lian Guo","author_inst":"Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huawen Liu","author_inst":"liuhw008@163.com"},{"author_name":"Jinglong Lv","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lixin Xu","author_inst":"Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chunhui Lang","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Nutrition, Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rui Wang","author_inst":"East China University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Lili Zhu","author_inst":"East China University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Gengfu Xiao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ke Lan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Honglin Li","author_inst":"East China University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Ke Xu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Dan Zhao","author_inst":"Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China."},{"author_name":"Fengcai Zhu","author_inst":"NHC Key laboratory of Enteric Pathogenic Microbiology, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Diseases Control and Prevention, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, 210009, China."},{"author_name":"Xiaokun Shen","author_inst":"Convalife (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., Shanghai, 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Jianyang Zeng","author_inst":"Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.09.20032896","rel_title":"First 12 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States","rel_date":"2020-03-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.09.20032896","rel_abs":"Introduction: More than 93,000 cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been reported worldwide. We describe the epidemiology, clinical course, and virologic characteristics of the first 12 U.S. patients with COVID-19. Methods: We collected demographic, exposure, and clinical information from 12 patients confirmed by CDC during January 20-February 5, 2020 to have COVID-19. Respiratory, stool, serum, and urine specimens were submitted for SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR testing, virus culture, and whole genome sequencing. Results: Among the 12 patients, median age was 53 years (range: 21-68); 8 were male, 10 had traveled to China, and two were contacts of patients in this series. Commonly reported signs and symptoms at illness onset were fever (n=7) and cough (n=8). Seven patients were hospitalized with radiographic evidence of pneumonia and demonstrated clinical or laboratory signs of worsening during the second week of illness. Three were treated with the investigational antiviral remdesivir. All patients had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in respiratory specimens, typically for 2-3 weeks after illness onset, with lowest rRT-PCR Ct values often detected in the first week. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected after reported symptom resolution in seven patients. SARS-CoV-2 was cultured from respiratory specimens, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in stool from 7\/10 patients. Conclusions: In 12 patients with mild to moderately severe illness, SARS-CoV-2 RNA and viable virus were detected early, and prolonged RNA detection suggests the window for diagnosis is long. Hospitalized patients showed signs of worsening in the second week after illness onset.","rel_num_authors":178,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stephanie A.

Methods In this single center, observational study, We recruited all Death Cases with COVID-19 from Dec 30, 2019 to Feb 16, 2020 in Intensive care unit of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital.Demographics, basic diseases, X-ray\/CT results, possible therapy strategies and test results when their entrance into admission, ICU and 48 h before death were collected and analyzed. Results This study involved 101 COVID-19 dead cases in Intensive care unit of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital.47 patients went directly to the ICU because of critical condition, and 54 patients were transferred to ICU with aggravated condition.57 (56.44%) were laboratory confirmed by RT-PCR, and 44 (43.6%) were consistent with clinical diagnostic criteria.The cases included 64 males and 37 females with average age of 65.46 years (SD 9.74). The blood type distribution was significantly different, with type A 44.44%, type B 29.29%, type AB 8.08% and type O 18.19%.The clinical manifestations of new coronavirus pneumonia are non-specific,the common symptom was fever (91 [90.10%] of 101 patients),Cough (69[68.32%]) and dyspnea (75[74.26%]). Neutrophils, PCT, CRP,IL-6,D-dimer gradually increased as time went on.Myocardial enzymes were abnormal in most patients at admission,with the progress of the disease, myocardial damage indicators were significantly increased.61(60.40%) used antiviral drugs,59(58.42%) used glucocorticoids, 63.37% used intravenous immunoglobulins, and 44.55% used thymosin preparations. All patients received antibiotic treatment, 63(62.38%) used restricted antibiotics, 23(22.78%) used antifungal drugs.84(83.17%) used non-invasive ventilator or high-flow oxygen therapy equipment, and 76.24% used invasive mechanical ventilation. 7 patients were treated with ECMO and 8 patients were treated with CRRT.The median time from ARDS to invasive mechanical ventilation was 3.00 days(IQR 0.00-6.00). The duration of invasive mechanical ventilation was 5 days (IQR2.00-8.00). Conclusions Critical COVID-19 can cause fatal respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure with high mortality rate. Heart may be the earliest damaged organ except the lungs. Secondary infection in the later period is worthy of attention.","rel_num_authors":0,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stephanie A.

This approach is multi-tiered, beginning with compiling the theoretical protein sequences from genomic derived data. In the case of SARS-CoV-2 we begin with 496 peptides that would be produced by proteolytic digestion of the viral proteins. To eliminate peptides that would cause cross-reactivity and false positives we remove peptides from consideration that have sequence homology or similar chemical characteristics using a progressively larger database of background peptides. Using this pipeline, we can remove 47 peptides from consideration as diagnostic due to the presence of peptides derived from the human proteome. To address the complexity of the human microbiome, we describe a method to create a database of all proteins of relevant abundance in the saliva microbiome. By utilizing a protein-based approach to the microbiome we can more accurately identify peptides that will be problematic in COVID-19 studies which removes 12 peptides from consideration. To identify diagnostic peptides, another 7 peptides are flagged for removal following comparison to the proteome backgrounds of viral and bacterial pathogens of similar clinical presentation. By aligning the protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 field isolates deposited to date we can identify peptides for removal due to their presence in highly variable regions that may lead to false negatives as the pathogen evolves. We provide maps of these regions and highlight 3 peptides that should be avoided as potential diagnostic or vaccine targets. Finally, we leverage publicly deposited proteomics data from human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, as well as a second study with the closely related MERS-CoV to identify the two proteins of highest abundance in human infections. The resulting final list contains the 24 peptides most unique and diagnostic of SARS-CoV-2 infections. These peptides represent the best targets for the development of antibodies are clinical diagnostics. To demonstrate one application of this we model peptide fragmentation using a deep learning tool to rapidly generate targeted LCMS assays and data processing method for detecting CoVID-19 infected patient samples.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=156 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR\/small\/980383v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (37K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d7fd4borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@136563borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@57641dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16de9a4_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ben Orsburn","author_inst":"UVA School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Conor Jenkins","author_inst":"Hood College Biology Department"},{"author_name":"Sierra D Miller","author_inst":"Millersville University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin A Neely","author_inst":"Proteomic und Genomic Sciences"},{"author_name":"Namandje M Bumpus","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Claire M.

Soon after the pandemic was recognized by epidemiologists, a group of biologists comprising the ARTIC Network, has devised a multiplexed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol and primer set for targeted whole-genome amplification of SARS-CoV-2. The ARTIC primer set amplifies 98 amplicons, which are separated only in two PCRs, across a nearly entire viral genome. The original primer set and protocol showed a fairly small amplification bias when clinical samples with relatively high viral loads were used. However, when samples viral load was low, several amplicons, especially amplicons 18 and 76, exhibited low coverage or complete dropout. We have determined that these dropouts were due to a dimer formation between the forward primer for amplicon 18, 18_LEFT, and the reverse primer for amplicon 76, 76_RIGHT. Replacement of 76_RIGHT with an alternatively designed primer was sufficient to produce a drastic improvement in coverage of both amplicons. Based on this result, we replaced 12 primers in total in the ARTIC primer set that were predicted to be involved in 14 primer interactions. The resulting primer set, version N1 (NIID-1), exhibits improved overall coverage compared to the ARTIC Networks original (V1) and modified (V3) primer set.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kentaro Itokawa","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Tsuyoshi Sekizuka","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Masanori Hashino","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Rina Tanaka","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Makoto Kuroda","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Claire M.

While the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through human respiratory droplets and contact with infected persons is clear, the aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been little studied.\n\nMethodsThirty-five aerosol samples of three different types (total suspended particle, size segregated and deposition aerosol) were collected in Patient Areas (PAA) and Medical Staff Areas (MSA) of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Renmin) and Wuchang Fangcang Field Hospital (Fangcang), and Public Areas (PUA) in Wuhan, China during COVID-19 outbreak. A robust droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) method was employed to quantitate the viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome and determine aerosol RNA concentration.\n\nResultsThe ICU, CCU and general patient rooms inside Renmin, patient hall inside Fangcang had undetectable or low airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration but deposition samples inside ICU and air sample in Fangcang patient toilet tested positive. The airborne SARS-CoV-2 in Fangcang MSA had bimodal distribution with higher concentration than those in Renmin during the outbreak but turned negative after patients number reduced and rigorous sanitization implemented. PUA had undetectable airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration but obviously increased with accumulating crowd flow.\n\nConclusionsRoom ventilation, open space, proper use and disinfection of toilet can effectively limit aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Gathering of crowds with asymptomatic carriers is a potential source of airborne SARS-CoV-2. The virus aerosol deposition on protective apparel or floor surface and their subsequent resuspension is a potential transmission pathway and effective sanitization is critical in minimizing aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yuan Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Modern Virology Research Center, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430072, P.

There is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID-19. In this project, a novel multi-epitope vaccine for COVID-19 virus based on surface glycoprotein was designed through application of bioinformatics methods. At the first, seventeen potent linear B-cell and T-cell binding epitopes from surface glycoprotein were predicted in silico, then the epitopes were joined together via different linkers. The ability of the selected epitopes to induce interferon-gamma was evaluate using IFNepitope web server. One final vaccine was constructed which composed of 398 amino acids and attached to 50S ribosomal protein L7\/L12 as adjuvant. Physicochemical properties, as well as antigenicity in the proposed vaccines, were checked for defining the vaccine stability and its ability to induce cell-mediated immune responses. Three-dimensional structure of the mentioned vaccine was subjected to the molecular docking studies with MHC-I and MHC-II molecules. The results proposed that the multi-epitope vaccine with 50S ribosomal protein L7\/L12 was a stable construct with high aliphatic content and high antigenicity.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mandana Behbahani","author_inst":"uni of esfahan"},{"author_name":"Zhi Ning","author_inst":"Division of Environment and Sustainability, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong SAR, P.

Within a few weeks, the disease caused by SARA-CoV-2, which is named COVID-19, has escalated into an unprecedented ongoing outbreak with frightening speed, becoming a global health emergency. This study aimed to exam the prevalence and risk factors of acute posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in Chinese people shortly after the massive outbreak of COVID-19. Method An online anonymous questionnaire survey was conducted in mainland China between 30 January and 3 February, 2020. The survey consisted of two self-administered questionnaires: one was designed to require personal information (gender, age, education background), current location, recent exposure history of Wuhan, the classification of population, and subjective sleep quality; the other was the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), which was to assess PTSS referring to the outbreak. Results A total of 2091 Chinese participated in the current study. The prevalence of PTSS among the public in mainland China 1 month after the COVID-19 outbreak was 4.6%. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that gender (p < 0.001), exposure history of Wuhan (p = 0.047), classification of population (p < 0.001), and subjective sleep quality (p < 0.001) could be regarded as predictor factors for PTSS. Conclusions The results showed that some Chinese showed acute PTSS during the COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, comprehensive psychological intervention needs further implementation. Furthermore, females, people who having recent exposure history of Wuhan, those at high risk of infection or with poor sleep quality deserve special attention.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luna Sun","author_inst":"Naval Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhuoer Sun","author_inst":"Naval Medical University"},{"author_name":"Lili Wu","author_inst":"Naval Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhenwen Zhu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Fan Zhang","author_inst":"Naval Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhilei Shang","author_inst":"Naval Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yanpu Jia","author_inst":"Naval Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jingwen Gu","author_inst":"Naval Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yaoguang Zhou","author_inst":"Naval Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yan Wang","author_inst":"Naval Medical University"},{"author_name":"Nianqi Liu","author_inst":"Naval Medical University"},{"author_name":"Weizhi Liu","author_inst":"Naval Medical University"},{"author_name":"Haidong Kan","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Key Lab of Public Health Safety of the Ministry of Education and Key Lab of Health Technology Assessment of the Ministry of Health, Fud"},{"author_name":"Qingyan Fu","author_inst":"Shanghai Environmental Monitoring Center, Shanghai 200235, P.

Design The study was an observational, descriptive study. Setting This study was carried out in a tertiary hospital in Guangdong, China. Participants 12 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from January 20, 2020 to February 20, 2020. Primary and secondary outcome measures The primary outcome was to evaluate the incidence of early renal injury in COVID-19. In this study, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), endogenous creatinine clearance (Ccr) and urine microalbumin \/ urinary creatinine ratio (UACR) were calculated to assess the incidence of early renal injury. Secondary outcomes were the diagnostic value of urine microalbumin (UMA), 1-microglobulin (A1M), urine immunoglobulin-G (IGU), urine transferring (TRU) alone and in combination in diagnosis of COVID-19 with early renal injury. Results While all patients had no significant abnormalities in serum creatinine (Scr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), the abnormal rates of eGFR, Ccr, and UACR were 66.7%, 41.7%, and 41.7%, respectively. Urinary microprotein detection indicated that the area under curve (AUC) of multi-index combined to diagnose early renal injury in COVID-19 was 0.875, which was higher than UMA (0,813), A1M (0.813), IGU (0.750) and TRU (0.750) alone. Spearman analysis showed that the degree of early renal injury was significantly related to C-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil ratio (NER), suggesting that the more severe the infection, the more obvious the early renal injury. Hypokalemia and hyponatremia were common in patients with COVID-19, and there was a correlation with the degree of renal injury. Conclusions Early renal injury was common in patients with COVID-19. Combined detection of UMA, A1M, IGU, and TRU was helpful for the diagnosis of early renal injury in COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xu-wei Hong","author_inst":"Shantou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ze-pai Chi","author_inst":"Shantou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guo-yuan Liu","author_inst":"Shantou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hong Huang","author_inst":"Shantou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shun-qi Guo","author_inst":"Shantou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jing-ru Fan","author_inst":"Shantou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xian-wei Lin","author_inst":"Shantou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Liao-zhun Qu","author_inst":"Shantou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rui-lie Chen","author_inst":"Shantou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ling-jie Wu","author_inst":"Shantou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Liang-yu Wang","author_inst":"Shantou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qi-chuan Zhang","author_inst":"Shantou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Su-wu Wu","author_inst":"Shantou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ze-qun Pan","author_inst":"Shantou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hao Lin","author_inst":"Shantou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yu-hua Zhou","author_inst":"Shantou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yong-hai Zhang","author_inst":"Shantou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Holly Biggs","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Alison M.

RT-qPCR testing of respiratory secretions is routinely used to detect causative viruses in acute respiratory infection. RT-qPCR in-house protocols to detect the SARS-CoV-2 have been described. Validations of these protocols are considered a key knowledge gap for COVID-19, especially if executed in a high throughput format. Here, we investigate the analytical sensitivity and specificity of two interim RT-qPCR protocols for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 executed in a fully automated platform. Under our conditions, the N1 and RdRP (modified) showed the highest analytical sensitivity for their RNA targets. E assay, in its original concentration, was considered a tertiary confirmatory assay. Taken together, N1, RdRP (optimized) and E presented appropriated analytical sensibility and specificity in our automated RT-qPCR workflow for COVID-19 virus, E being at least 4-fold less sensitive than the others. This study highlights the importance of local validation of in-house assays before its availability to the population. The use of the synthetic RT-qPCR target to investigate novel assays diagnostic parameters in automated workflows is a quick, simple effective way to be prepared for upcoming threats. The proposed assay detected the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in Brazilian Central-West.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gustavo Barcelos Barra","author_inst":"Sabin Medicina Diagnostica"},{"author_name":"Ticiane Henriques Santa Rita","author_inst":"Sabin Medicina Diagnostica"},{"author_name":"Pedro Goes Mesquita","author_inst":"Sabin Medicina Diagnostica"},{"author_name":"Rafael Henriques Jacomo","author_inst":"Sabin Medicina Diagnostica"},{"author_name":"Lidia Freire Abdalla Nery","author_inst":"Sabin Medicina Diagnostica"},{"author_name":"Jing-ru Fan","author_inst":"Shantou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xian-wei Lin","author_inst":"Shantou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Liao-zhun Qu","author_inst":"Shantou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rui-lie Chen","author_inst":"Shantou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ling-jie Wu","author_inst":"Shantou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Liang-yu Wang","author_inst":"Shantou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qi-chuan Zhang","author_inst":"Shantou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Su-wu Wu","author_inst":"Shantou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ze-qun Pan","author_inst":"Shantou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hao Lin","author_inst":"Shantou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yu-hua Zhou","author_inst":"Shantou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yong-hai Zhang","author_inst":"Shantou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Holly Biggs","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Alison M.

Objective: Describe the epidemic characteristics of COVID-19 in Jingmen,Hubei,introduce the local prevention and control experience,and observe the impact of various prevention and control measures on the number of new cases. Methods: All the COVID-19 patients diagnosed in the municipal districts of Jingmen from January 12 to February 29,2020 were enrolled in this study. We described epidemiological data and observed the impact of control measures on the epidemic. Findings: Of the 219 cases (110 men and 109 women), 88 (40%) had exposure to Wuhan. The median age was 48 years ( range,2-88 years;IQR,35-60). Thirty-three severe patients with a median age of 66 years(range,33-82 years,IQR,57-76) were treated in intensive care units; out of these patients, 66.7 %(22) were men and 19 (57.5%) had chronic diseases, including hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, stroke, and renal insufficiency. Under the control measures, the number of new patients gradually decreased and nearly disappeared after 18 days. Wearing masks in all kinds of situations prevents most infections and is one of the most effective prevention and control measures. Interpretation: In conclusion,all people are susceptible to COVID-19, and older males and those with comorbid conditions are more likely to become severe cases. Even though COVID-19 is highly contagious,control measures have proven to be very effective, particularly wearing masks,which could prevent most infections.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qijun Gao","author_inst":"the first hospital of Jingmen"},{"author_name":"yingfu hu","author_inst":"the first hospital of Jingmen"},{"author_name":"zhiguo dai Sr.","author_inst":"the first hospital of Jingmen"},{"author_name":"Jing wu","author_inst":"the first hospital of Jingmen"},{"author_name":"Feng Xiao","author_inst":"the first hostial of Jingmen"},{"author_name":"Jing wang","author_inst":"the fisrt hospital ofJingmen"},{"author_name":"Azaibi Tamin","author_inst":"CDC"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Harcourt","author_inst":"CDC"},{"author_name":"Natalie Thornburg","author_inst":"CDC"},{"author_name":"Susan Gerber","author_inst":"CDC"},{"author_name":"Jamie Lloyd-Smith","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Emmie de Wit","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Ze-qun Pan","author_inst":"Shantou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hao Lin","author_inst":"Shantou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yu-hua Zhou","author_inst":"Shantou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yong-hai Zhang","author_inst":"Shantou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Holly Biggs","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Alison M.

The number of cases has increased rapidly but information on the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia compared to normal controls in Chinese Han population is limited. Our objective is to describe the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia compared to normal controls in the Chinese Han population. In this case series of 752 patients, the full spectrum of cases is described. Fever was present in 86-90% of the patients. The second most common symptom was cough (49.1-51.0%), fatigue (25.2-27.1%), sputum (20.0-23.1%), and headache (9.8-11.1%). the mortality rate is 4.6% in Wuhan, 1.9% in Beijing, and 0.9% in Shanghai. Our findings showed that the levels of lymphocytes were 0.8(IQR, 0.6-1.1)109\/L in Wuhan, 1.0(IQR, 0.7-1.4)109\/L in Beijing, and 1.1 (IQR, 0.8-1.5) 109\/L in Shanghai before admission to hospitals, respectively, indicating that cellular immune function might relate to the mortality. Based on the reference ranges of normal Chinese Han population and the data of the critically ill patients we have observed, it is recommended that reference ranges of people at high risk of COVID-19 infection are CD3+ lymphocytes below 900 cells\/mm3, CD4+ lymphocytes below 500 cells\/mm3, and CD8+ lymphocytes below 300 cells\/mm3.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qiang Zeng Sr.","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yong-zhe Li Sr.","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gang Huang Sr.","author_inst":"Shanghai University of Medicine and Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wei Wu Sr.","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sheng-yong Dong Sr.","author_inst":"Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yang Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai University of Medicine and Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Azaibi Tamin","author_inst":"CDC"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Harcourt","author_inst":"CDC"},{"author_name":"Natalie Thornburg","author_inst":"CDC"},{"author_name":"Susan Gerber","author_inst":"CDC"},{"author_name":"Jamie Lloyd-Smith","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Emmie de Wit","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIAID"},{"author_name":"Ze-qun Pan","author_inst":"Shantou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hao Lin","author_inst":"Shantou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yu-hua Zhou","author_inst":"Shantou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yong-hai Zhang","author_inst":"Shantou Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Holly Biggs","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Alison M.

Studies on novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were less based on pediatric patients. This study aimed to reveal the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in children. Method: This study retrospectively analyzed the clinical symptoms, laboratory results, chest CT, and treatment of children with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19(ie, with samples that were positive for 2019 novel coronavirus[2019-nCoV]) who were admitted to Shenzhen Center of National Infectious Disease Clinical Medical Research from January 16 to February 8, 2020. Result: Nine patients had no obvious clinical symptom. 11 patients developed fever. Other symptoms, including cough(in eleven of seventeen patients), rhinorrhea(in two), diarrhea(in two), vomiting(in two), were also observed. A small minority of patients had lymphocytopenia. Alanine transaminase or transaminase increased in three cases. According to chest CT scan, 11 patients showed unilateral pneumonia, 8 patients had no pulmonary infiltration.

Based on the historical data collected for COVID-19 spreading in 367 cities in China and the set of parameters of the augmented Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model obtained for each city, a set of profile codes representing a variety of transmission mechanisms and contact topologies is formed. By comparing the data of an early outbreak of a given population with the complete set of historical profiles, the best fit profiles are selected and the corresponding sets of profile codes are used for prediction of the future progression of the epidemic in that population. Application of the method to the data collected for South Korea, Italy and Iran shows that peaks of infection cases are expected to occur before the end of March 2020, and that the percentage of population infected in each city will be less than 0.01%, 0.05% and 0.02%, for South Korea, Italy and Iran, respectively.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Choujun Zhan","author_inst":"South China Normal University"},{"author_name":"Chi K.

The number of cases has increased rapidly but information on the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia without comorbidities compared to normal controls in Chinese Han population is limited. Our objective is to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia without comorbidities compared to normal controls in the Chinese Han population. Methods Retrospective, multi-center case series of the 69 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, from February 7 to February 28, 2020; final date of follow-up was February 29, 2020. Results The study population included 69 hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia without comorbidities and 14,117 normal controls. 50.7% patients were male and 49.3% were female; 1.5% patients were asymptomatic cases, 63.8% patients were mild cases, and 36.2% patients were severe or critical cases. Compared with mild patients (n = 44), severe or critical patients (n = 25) were significantly older (median age, 67 years [IQR, 58-79] vs. 49 years [IQR, 36-60]; P < 0.01). Fever was present in 98.6% of the patients. The second most common symptom was cough (62.3%), fatigue (58.0%), sputum (39.1%), and headache (33.3%). The median incubation period was 4 days (IQR, 2 to 7). Leukocyte count was 74.1% of normal controls and lymphocyte count was 45.9% of normal controls. The phenomenon of lymphocyte depletion (PLD) observed in severe or critical cases in 100%. Levels of lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, procalcitonin, and interleukin-6 were showed significant differences between mild and severe or critical cases. Chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral patchy patterns (49.3%), local patchy shadowing (29.0%), and ground glass opacity (21.7%). 7.3% patients were diagnosed ARDS, 7.3% patients were diagnosed acute cardiac injury (troponin I >28 pg\/mL) and 4.4% patients were diagnosed fungal infections or shock. 4.3% patients have been discharged; 1.5% patient had died; 1.5% patient had recovery. Conclusions In this multicenter case series of 69 patients without comorbidities, the full spectrum of asymptomatic, mild, severe, and critical cases is described. 50.7% patients were male and 49.3% were female; 1.5% patients were asymptomatic cases, 63.8% patients were mild cases, and 36.2% patients were severe or critical cases. 4.3% patients have been discharged; 1.5% patient had died; 1.5% patient had recovery. Among the 25 patients with severe or critical disease, 12.0% patients were underwent non-invasive mechanical ventilation, 8.0% patients underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 4.0% patients died.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yang Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai University of Medicine and Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yi-rong Li","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Qiang Zeng","author_inst":"The Second Medical Center & National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Diseases, Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhi-bing Lu","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yong-zhe Li","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wei Wu","author_inst":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sheng-yong Dong","author_inst":"The Second Medical Center & National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Diseases, Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gang Huang","author_inst":"Shanghai University of Medicine and Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xing-huan Wang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Allan Gopez","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Elaine Hsu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Wei Gu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Steven Miller","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Chao-Yang Pan","author_inst":"California Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Hugo Guevara","author_inst":"California Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Debra Wadford","author_inst":"California Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Janice Chen","author_inst":"Mammoth Biosciences, Inc."},{"author_name":"Charles Y Chiu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Alison M.

However, one of the most important clinical characteristics in epidemiology, the distribution of the incubation period, remains unclear. Different estimates of the incubation period of COVID-19 were reported in recent published studies, but all have their own limitations. In this study, we propose a novel low-cost and accurate method to estimate the incubation distribution. Methods: We have conducted a cross-sectional and forward follow-up study by identifying those asymptomatic individuals at their time of departure from Wuhan and then following them until their symptoms developed. The renewal process is hence adopted by considering the incubation period as a renewal and the duration between departure and symptom onset as a forward recurrence time. Under mild assumptions, the observations of selected forward times can be used to consistently estimate the parameters in the distribution of the incubation period. Such a method enhances the accuracy of estimation by reducing recall bias and utilizing the abundant and readily available forward time data. Findings: The estimated distribution of forward time fits the observations in the collected data well. The estimated median of incubation period is 8.13 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.37-8.91), the mean is 8.62 days (95% CI: 8.02-9.28), the 90th percentile is 14.65 days (95% CI: 14.00-15.26), and the 99th percentile is 20.59 days (95% CI: 19.47, 21.62). Compared with results in other studies, the incubation period estimated in this study is longer. Interpretation: Based on the estimated incubation distribution in this study, about 10% of patients with COVID-19 would not develop symptoms until 14 days after infection. Further study of the incubation distribution is warranted to directly estimate the proportion with long incubation periods.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qin Jing","author_inst":"Biostatistics Research Branch, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institute  of Health"},{"author_name":"Chong You","author_inst":"Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Qiushi Lin","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Taojun Hu","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Shicheng Yu","author_inst":"Office for Epidemiology, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Hua Zhou","author_inst":"Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research, Peking University"},{"author_name":"Sheng-yong Dong","author_inst":"The Second Medical Center & National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Diseases, Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gang Huang","author_inst":"Shanghai University of Medicine and Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xing-huan Wang","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Allan Gopez","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Elaine Hsu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Wei Gu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Steven Miller","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Chao-Yang Pan","author_inst":"California Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Hugo Guevara","author_inst":"California Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Debra Wadford","author_inst":"California Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Janice Chen","author_inst":"Mammoth Biosciences, Inc."},{"author_name":"Charles Y Chiu","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Alison M.
