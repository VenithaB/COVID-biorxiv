However, little is unknown whether the pooling strategy detects SARS-CoV-2 with accuracy. Method To validate the feasibility of pooling samples, serial dilution analysis and spike-in experiment were conducted using synthetic DNA and nucleic acids extracted from SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative patients. Furthermore, we studied a total of 1,000 individuals, who were 667 'healthy' (195 healthcare workers and 472 hospitalized patients with other disorders than COVID-19 infection) individuals and 333 infection-suspected patients with cough and fever, were tested. Results Serial dilution analysis showed the limit of detection of around 10-100 copies according to National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Japan. Spike-in experiment demonstrated RT-qPCR detect positive signal in pooling samples of SARS-CoV-2 negative and positive patient at the 5-, 10-, 20-fold dilution. By screening with pooling strategy by the end of April, 2020, there are 12 COVID-19 patients in 333 infection suspected patients (3.6%) and zero in 667 'healthy'. We obtained these results with total running 538 times (instead of 1,000 times) by pooling strategy. Conclusion Pooling samples is feasible for saving test reagents and detecting SARS-CoV-2 in clinical setting to prevent the spread of the virus and nosocomial transmission.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yosuke Hirotsu","author_inst":"Yamanashi Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Makoto Maejima","author_inst":"Yamanashi Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Masahiro Shibusawa","author_inst":"Yamanashi Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuki Nagakubo","author_inst":"Yamanashi Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kazuhiro Hosaka","author_inst":"Yamanashi Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kenji Amemiya","author_inst":"Yamanashi Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hitomi Sueki","author_inst":"Yamanashi Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Miyoko Hayakawa","author_inst":"Yamanashi Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hitoshi Mochizuki","author_inst":"Yamanashi Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Masao Omata","author_inst":"Yamanashi Central Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.01.20088047","rel_title":"The reproduction number of COVID-19 and its correlation with public health interventions","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.01.20088047","rel_abs":"Throughout the past six months, no number has dominated the public media more persistently than the reproduction number of COVID-19. This powerful but simple concept is widely used by the public media, scientists, and political decision makers to explain and justify political strategies to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Here we explore the effectiveness of political interventions using the reproduction number of COVID-19 across Europe. We propose a dynamic SEIR epidemiology model with a time-varying reproduction number, which we identify using machine learning. During the early outbreak, the basic reproduction number was 4.22+\/-1.69, with maximum values of 6.33 and 5.88 in Germany and the Netherlands. By May 10, 2020, it dropped to 0.67+\/-0.18, with minimum values of 0.37 and 0.28 in Hungary and Slovakia. We found a strong correlation between passenger air travel, driving, walking, and transit mobility and the effective reproduction number with a time delay of 17.24+\/-2.00 days. Our new dynamic SEIR model provides the flexibility to simulate various outbreak control and exit strategies to inform political decision making and identify safe solutions in the benefit of global health.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kevin Linka","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Mathias Peirlinck","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Ellen Kuhl","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Yuki Nagakubo","author_inst":"Yamanashi Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kazuhiro Hosaka","author_inst":"Yamanashi Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kenji Amemiya","author_inst":"Yamanashi Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hitomi Sueki","author_inst":"Yamanashi Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Miyoko Hayakawa","author_inst":"Yamanashi Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hitoshi Mochizuki","author_inst":"Yamanashi Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Masao Omata","author_inst":"Yamanashi Central Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.01.20087858","rel_title":"Internet Search Patterns Reveal Clinical Course of Disease Progression for COVID-19 and Predict Pandemic Spread in 32 Countries","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.01.20087858","rel_abs":"Effective public health response to novel pandemics relies on accurate and timely surveillance of pandemic spread, as well as characterization of the clinical course of the disease in affected individuals. We sought to determine whether Internet search patterns can be useful for tracking COVID-19 spread, and whether these data could also be useful in understanding the clinical progression of the disease in 32 countries across six continents. Temporal correlation analyses were conducted to characterize the relationships between a range of COVID-19 symptom-specific search terms and reported COVID-19 cases and deaths for each country during the period of January 1 through April 20, 2020. Increases in COVID-19 symptom-related searches preceded increases in reported COVID-19 cases and deaths by an average of 18.53 days (95% confidence interval 15.98 to 21.08) and 22.16 days (20.33 to 23.99), respectively. Cross-country ensemble averaging was used to derive average temporal profiles for each search term, which were combined to create a search-data-based view of the clinical course of disease progression. Internet search patterns revealed a clear temporal pattern of disease progression for COVID-19: Initial symptoms of fever, dry cough, sore throat and chills were followed by shortness of breath an average of 5.22 days (95% confidence interval 3.30 to 7.14) after initial symptom onset, matching the clinical course reported in the medical literature. This is the first study to show that Internet search data can be useful for characterizing the detailed clinical course of a disease.

The aim of this study was to estimate the epidemiologic parameters of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic for clinical and epidemiological help. Methods: Four electronic databases including Web of Science, Medline (PubMed), Scopus and Google Scholar were searched for literature published from early December 2019 up to 23 March 2020. The \"metan\" command was used to perform a fixed or random effects analysis. Cumulative meta-analysis was performed using the \"metacum\" command. Results: Totally 76 observational studies were included in the analysis. The pooled estimate for R0 was 2.99 (95% CI: 2.71-3.27) for COVID-19. The overall R0 was 3.23, 1.19, 3.6 and 2.35 for China, Singapore, Iran and Japan, respectively. The overall Serial Interval, doubling time, incubation period were 4.45, 4.14 and 4.24 days for COVID-19. In addition, the overall estimation for growth rate and case fatality rate for COVID-19 were 0.38% and 3.29%, respectively. Conclusion: Calculating the pooled estimate of the epidemiological parameters of COVID-19 as an emerging disease, could reveal epidemiological features of the disease that consequently pave the way for health policy makers to think more about control strategies.

Chlorpromazine (CPZ), the prototype of typical antipsychotics from the phenothiazine group, is known to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis and acts as an antiviral, in particular against SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. In this study, we describe the in vitro testing of CPZ against a SARS-CoV-2 isolate in monkey and human cells. We evidenced an antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 with an IC50 of [~]10M. Because of its high biodistribution in lung, saliva and brain, such IC50 measured in vitro may translate to CPZ dosage used in clinical routine. This extrapolation is in line with our observations of a higher prevalence of symptomatic and severe forms of COVID-19 infections among health care professionals compared to patients in psychiatric wards. These preclinical findings support the repurposing of CPZ, a largely used drug with mild side effects, in COVID-19 treatment.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marion Plaze","author_inst":"GHU PARIS Psychiatrie & Neurosciences"},{"author_name":"David Attali","author_inst":"GHU PARIS Psychiatrie & Neurosciences"},{"author_name":"Matthieu Prot","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Anne-Cecile Petit","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Michael Blatzer","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Fabien Vinckier","author_inst":"GHU PARIS Psychiatrie & Neurosciences"},{"author_name":"Laurine Levillayer","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Florent Perin-Dureau","author_inst":"Fondation Rotschild"},{"author_name":"Arnaud Cachia","author_inst":"Universite de Paris"},{"author_name":"Gerard Friedlander","author_inst":"Universite de Paris"},{"author_name":"Fabrice Chretien","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Etienne Simon-Loriere","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Raphael Gaillard","author_inst":"GHU PARIS Psychiatrie & Neurosciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.06.080119","rel_title":"Multiple SARS-CoV-2 introductions shaped the early outbreak in Central Eastern Europe: comparing Hungarian data to a worldwide sequence data-matrix","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.06.080119","rel_abs":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 is the third highly pathogenic human coronavirus in history.

The causal coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) binds host cells via a trimeric Spike whose receptor binding domain (RBD) recognizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), initiating conformational changes that drive membrane fusion. We find that monoclonal antibody CR3022 binds the RBD tightly, neutralising SARS-CoV-2 and report the crystal structure at 2.4 [A] of the Fab\/RBD complex. Some crystals are suitable for screening for entry-blocking inhibitors. The highly conserved, structure-stabilising, CR3022 epitope is inaccessible in the prefusion Spike, suggesting that CR3022 binding would facilitate conversion to the fusion-incompetent post-fusion state. Cryo-EM analysis confirms that incubation of Spike with CR3022 Fab leads to destruction of the prefusion trimer. Presentation of this cryptic epitope in an RBD-based vaccine might advantageously focus immune responses.

Here, we provide preliminary data on stem cell based innate defense against a mouse model of coronavirus, murine hepatitis virus-1 (MHV-1) infection. In a mouse model of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) mediated Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) dormancy, MHV-1 infection in the lung exhibited 20 fold lower viral loads than the healthy control mice, suggesting the potential enhancement of an anti-MHV-1 defense by Mtb. This defense mechanism involves the in vivo expansion and reprogramming of CD271+MSCs in the lung to an enhanced stemness phenotype. The reprogrammed MSCs facilitate the activation of stemness genes, intracellular Mtb replication, and extracellular release of Mtb. The conditioned media of the reprogrammed MSCs exhibit direct anti-viral activity in an in vitro model of MHV-1 induced toxicity to type II alveolar epithelial cells. Thus, our data suggest that reprogrammed MSCs exert a unique innate defense against MHV-1 by activating dormant Mtb. The molecular details of this anti-viral defense mechanism against coronavirus could be further studied to develop a vaccine against COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lekhika Pathak","author_inst":"KaviKrishna Laboratory, Guwahati Biotech Park, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, India"},{"author_name":"Sukanya Gayan","author_inst":"KaviKrishna Laboratory, Guwahati Biotech Park, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, India"},{"author_name":"Bidisha Pal","author_inst":"Thoreau Laboratory for Global Health, M2D2, University of Massachusetts, Lowell"},{"author_name":"Joyeeta Talukdar","author_inst":"KaviKrishna Laboratory, Guwahati Biotech Park, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, India"},{"author_name":"Seema Bhuyan","author_inst":"KaviKrishna Laboratory, Guwahati Biotech Park, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, India"},{"author_name":"Sorra Sandhya","author_inst":"KaviKrishna Laboratory, Guwahati Biotech Park, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, India"},{"author_name":"Herman Yeger","author_inst":"Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto"},{"author_name":"Debabrat Baishya","author_inst":"Gauhati University, Assam, India"},{"author_name":"Bikul Das","author_inst":"KaviKrishna Laboratory, Guwahati Biotech Park, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, India"},{"author_name":"Pranav NM Shah","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tiong Kit Tan","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Pramila Rijal","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Naomi Coombes","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Kevin Bewley","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Julika Radecke","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source Ltd"},{"author_name":"Neil G Paterson","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source Ltd"},{"author_name":"Piyasa Supasa","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Juthathip Mongkolsapaya","author_inst":"University of Oxford and Mahidol University"},{"author_name":"Gavin R Screaton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Miles Carroll","author_inst":"Public Health England and University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alain Townsend","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth E Fry","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Raymond J Owens","author_inst":"University of Oxford and The Rosalind Franklin Institute"},{"author_name":"David I Stuart","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.05.079939","rel_title":"Identification of novel mutations in RNA-dependent RNA polymerases of SARS-CoV-2 and their implications","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.05.079939","rel_abs":"The rapid development of SARS-CoV-2 mediated COVID-19 pandemic has been the cause of significant health concern, highlighting the immediate need for the effective antivirals. SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus that has an inherent high mutation rate. These mutations drive viral evolution and genome variability, thereby, facilitating viruses to have rapid antigenic shifting to evade host immunity and to develop drug resistance. Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) perform viral genome duplication and RNA synthesis. Therefore, we compared the available RdRp sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from Indian isolates and  Wuhan wet sea food market virus sequence to identify, if any, variation between them. We report seven mutations observed in Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates and three unique mutations that showed changes in the secondary structure of the RdRp protein at region of mutation. We also studied molecular dynamics using normal mode analyses and found that these mutations alter the stability of RdRp protein. Therefore, we propose that RdRp mutations in Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates might have functional consequences that can interfere with RdRp targeting pharmacological agents.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gyanendra Bahadur Chand","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, Patna University, Patna-800005, Bihar, India"},{"author_name":"Atanu Banerjee","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, Samastipur College, Samastipur- 848134, Bihar, India"},{"author_name":"Gajendra Kumar Azad","author_inst":"Department of Zoology, Patna University, Patna-800005, Bihar, India"},{"author_name":"Joyeeta Talukdar","author_inst":"KaviKrishna Laboratory, Guwahati Biotech Park, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, India"},{"author_name":"Seema Bhuyan","author_inst":"KaviKrishna Laboratory, Guwahati Biotech Park, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, India"},{"author_name":"Sorra Sandhya","author_inst":"KaviKrishna Laboratory, Guwahati Biotech Park, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, India"},{"author_name":"Herman Yeger","author_inst":"Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto"},{"author_name":"Debabrat Baishya","author_inst":"Gauhati University, Assam, India"},{"author_name":"Bikul Das","author_inst":"KaviKrishna Laboratory, Guwahati Biotech Park, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, India"},{"author_name":"Pranav NM Shah","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tiong Kit Tan","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Pramila Rijal","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Naomi Coombes","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Kevin Bewley","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Julika Radecke","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source Ltd"},{"author_name":"Neil G Paterson","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source Ltd"},{"author_name":"Piyasa Supasa","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Juthathip Mongkolsapaya","author_inst":"University of Oxford and Mahidol University"},{"author_name":"Gavin R Screaton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Miles Carroll","author_inst":"Public Health England and University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alain Townsend","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth E Fry","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Raymond J Owens","author_inst":"University of Oxford and The Rosalind Franklin Institute"},{"author_name":"David I Stuart","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.05.079061","rel_title":"Unsupervised cluster analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes reflects its geographic progression and identifies distinct genetic subgroups of SARS-CoV-2 virus","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.05.079061","rel_abs":"Over 10,000 viral genome sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have been made readily available during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic since the initial genome sequence of the virus was released on the open access Virological website (http:\/\/virological.org\/) early on January 11.

We analyze data on the nucleotide sequencing of the virus and geographic information of a subset of 7, 640 SARS-CoV-2 patients without missing entries that are available in the GISAID database. Instead of modelling the mutation rate, applying phylogenetic tree approaches, etc., we here utilize a model-free clustering approach that compares the viruses at a genome-wide level. We apply principal component analysis to a similarity matrix that compares all pairs of these SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide sequences at all loci simultaneously, using the Jaccard index (Jaccard, 1901; Tan et al., 2005; Prokopenko et al., 2016; Schlauch et al., 2017). Our analysis results of the SARS-CoV-2 genome data illustrates the geographic and chronological progression of the virus, starting from the first cases that were observed in China to the current wave of cases in Europe and North America. We also observe that, based on their sequence data, the SARS-CoV-2 viruses cluster in distinct genetic subgroups.

As low-molecular-weight drugs have high potential to completely match interactions with essential SARS-CoV-2 targets, we propose a strategy to identify such drugs using the fragment-based approach. Herein, using ligand- and protein-observed fragment screening approaches, we identified niacin and hit 1 binding to the catalytic pocket of the main protease of the SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro), thereby modestly inhibiting the enzymatic activity of Mpro. Chemical shift perturbations induced by niacin and hit 1 indicate a partial overlap of their binding sites, i.e., the catalytic pocket of Mpro may accommodate derivatives with large molecular sizes. Therefore, we searched for drugs containing niacin or hit 1 pharmacophores and identified carmofur, bendamustine, triclabendazole, and emedastine; these drugs are highly capable of inhibiting protease activity. Our study demonstrates that the fragment-based approach is a feasible strategy for identifying low-molecular-weight drugs against the SARS-CoV-2 and other potential targets lacking specific drugs.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jia Gao","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Liang Zhang","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Xiaodan Liu","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Fudong Li","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Rongsheng Ma","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Zhongliang Zhu","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Jiahai Zhang","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Jihui Wu","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Yunyu Shi","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Yueyin Pan","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Yushu Ge","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Ke Ruan","author_inst":"University of Science and Technology of China"},{"author_name":"Naomi Coombes","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Kevin Bewley","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Julika Radecke","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source Ltd"},{"author_name":"Neil G Paterson","author_inst":"Diamond Light Source Ltd"},{"author_name":"Piyasa Supasa","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Juthathip Mongkolsapaya","author_inst":"University of Oxford and Mahidol University"},{"author_name":"Gavin R Screaton","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Miles Carroll","author_inst":"Public Health England and University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alain Townsend","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth E Fry","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Raymond J Owens","author_inst":"University of Oxford and The Rosalind Franklin Institute"},{"author_name":"David I Stuart","author_inst":"University of Oxford"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.05.079087","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 codon usage bias downregulates host expressed genes with similar codon usage","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.05.079087","rel_abs":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome is quickly spreading throughout the world and was declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO).

Our analysis reveals that SARS-CoV-2 preferred codons have poor representation of G or C nucleotides in the third position, a characteristic which could conduct to an unbalance in the tRNAs pools of the infected cells with serious implications in host protein synthesis. By integrating this observation with proteomic data from infected cells, we observe a reduced translation rate of host proteins associated with highly expressed genes, and that they share the codon usage bias of the virus. The functional analysis of these genes suggests that this mechanism of epistasis contributes to understand some deleterious collateral effect as result of the viral replication.

Population-based serosurveys provide one avenue for estimating infection rates and monitoring the progression of the epidemic, overcoming many of these limitations. Methods: Taking advantage of a pool of adult participants from population-representative surveys conducted in Geneva, Switzerland, we implemented a study consisting of 8 weekly serosurveys among these participants and their household members older than 5 years. We tested each participant for anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Euroimmun AG, Lubeck, Germany). We estimated seroprevalence using a Bayesian regression model taking into account test performance and adjusting for the age and sex of Geneva's population. Results: In the first three weeks, we enrolled 1335 participants coming from 633 households, with 16% <20 years of age and 53.6% female, a distribution similar to that of Geneva. In the first week, we estimated a seroprevalence of 3.1% (95% CI 0.2-5.99, n=343). This increased to 6.1% (95% CI 2.6-9.33, n=416) in the second, and to 9.7% (95% CI 6.1-13.11, n=576) in the third week. We found that 5-19 year-olds (6.0%, 95% CI 2.3-10.2%) had similar seroprevalence to 20-49 year olds (8.5%, 95%CI 4.99-11.7), while significantly lower seroprevalence was observed among those 50 and older (3.7%, 95% CI 0.99-6.0, p=0.0008). Interpretation: Assuming that the presence of IgG antibodies is at least in the short-term associated with immunity, these results highlight that the epidemic is far from burning out simply due to herd immunity. Further, no differences in seroprevalence between children and middle age adults are observed. These results must be considered as Switzerland and the world look towards easing restrictions aimed at curbing transmission.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Silvia Stringhini","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland; Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland; University Centre fo"},{"author_name":"Ania Wisniak","author_inst":"Institute of Global Health, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Piumatti","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Andrew S Azman","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Stephen A Lauer","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Helene Baysson","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"David De Ridder","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Dusan Petrovic","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Schrempft","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Kailing Marcus","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Arm-Vernez","author_inst":"Geneva Center for Emerging Viral Diseases and Laboratory of Virology, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Sabine Yerly","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Olivia Keiser","author_inst":"Institute of Global Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Samia Hurst","author_inst":"Institut Ethique, Histoire, Humanites, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Klara Posfay-Barbe","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Didier Trono","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Didier Pittet","author_inst":"Centre for Vaccinology, Department of Pathology and Immunology, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Laurent Getaz","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Francois Chappuis","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Isabella Eckerle","author_inst":"Geneva Center for Emerging Viral Diseases and Laboratory of Virology, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Vuilleumier","author_inst":"Division of Laboratory Medicine, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Meyer","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Antoine Flahault","author_inst":"Institute of Global Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Laurent Kaiser","author_inst":"Geneva Center for Emerging Viral Diseases and Laboratory of Virology, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Idris Guessous","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.30.20086397","rel_title":"THE PATHOGENESIS OF THROMBOEMBOLIC DISEASE IN COVID-19 PATIENTS: COULD BE A CATASTROPHIC ANTIPHOSPHOLIPID SYNDROME?","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.30.20086397","rel_abs":"Background The most severely COVID-19 patients need intensive care and show increased risk of thromboembolic events. Although some patients meet the diagnostic criteria for the Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation, the pathogenesis of the diffuse thrombotic status remains unclear. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in sera of deceased patients with autoptic proven thrombotic microangiopathy to evaluate if some patients may have developed Catastrophic Antiphospholipid Syndrome (CAPS). Methods Thirty-five patients were enrolled. The available medical history, comorbidities, therapies, laboratory and autopsy findings were collected post-mortem from clinical records. IgA, IgG and IgM anti cardiolipin (ACA) and anti {beta}2 glycoprotein 1 ({beta}2GP1) antibodies, IgG and IgM anti phosphatidylserine\/prothrombin (PS\/PT) antibodies were tested for all the patients. Results 3\/35 (8.6%) patients were slightly positive for aPL: one for ACA IgG and two for ACA IgM but values were low (< 3X the cut off). No patients tested positive for ACA IgA neither for {beta}2GP1 isotypes. 3\/35 (8.6%) patients were positive for PS\/PT, one for IgG and two for IgM, but values were less than 2X the cut off. No patients showed simultaneous positivity for ACA and PS\/ PT. Conclusions It is difficult to categorize the vascular events into a conventional disease: we did not find significant association with anti-phospholipid antibodies. It is most likely that several factors contribute to trigger the hypercoagulability status and the thromboembolism but, on the basis our results, CAPS is probably not involved into the pathogenesis of these phenomena.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giulia Previtali","author_inst":"ASST Papa Giovanni XXIII, Clinical Chemistry Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Michela Seghezzi","author_inst":"ASST Papa Giovanni XXIII, Clinical Chemistry Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Valentina Moioli","author_inst":"ASST Papa Giovanni XXIII, Clinical Chemistry Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Aurelio Sonzogni","author_inst":"ASST Papa Giovanni XXIII, Pathological Anatomy"},{"author_name":"Roberto Marozzi","author_inst":"ASST Papa Giovanni XXIII, Clinical Chemistry Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Cerutti","author_inst":"ASST Papa Giovanni XXIII, Clinical Chemistry Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Rudi Ravasio","author_inst":"ASST Papa Giovanni XXIII, Clinical Chemistry Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Andrea Gianatti","author_inst":"ASST Papa Giovanni XXIII, Pathological Anatomy"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Guerra","author_inst":"ASST Papa Giovanni XXIII, Clinical Chemistry Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Maria Grazia Alessio","author_inst":"ASST Papa Giovanni XXIII, Clinical Chemistry Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Arm-Vernez","author_inst":"Geneva Center for Emerging Viral Diseases and Laboratory of Virology, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Sabine Yerly","author_inst":"Geneva University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Olivia Keiser","author_inst":"Institute of Global Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Samia Hurst","author_inst":"Institut Ethique, Histoire, Humanites, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Klara Posfay-Barbe","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Didier Trono","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Didier Pittet","author_inst":"Centre for Vaccinology, Department of Pathology and Immunology, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Laurent Getaz","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Francois Chappuis","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Isabella Eckerle","author_inst":"Geneva Center for Emerging Viral Diseases and Laboratory of Virology, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Vuilleumier","author_inst":"Division of Laboratory Medicine, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Meyer","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Antoine Flahault","author_inst":"Institute of Global Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Laurent Kaiser","author_inst":"Geneva Center for Emerging Viral Diseases and Laboratory of Virology, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Idris Guessous","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.02.20088666","rel_title":"Urine Proteome of COVID-19 Patients","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.02.20088666","rel_abs":"The atypical pneumonia (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 is an ongoing pandemic and a serious threat to global public health. The COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms account for a majority of mortality of this disease. However, early detection and effective prediction of patients with mild to severe symptoms remains challenging. In this study, we performed proteomic profiling of urine samples from 32 healthy control individuals and 6 COVID-19 positive patients (3 mild and 3 severe). We found that urine proteome samples from the mild and severe COVID-19 patients with comorbidities can be clearly differentiated from healthy proteome samples based on the clustering analysis. Multiple pathways have been compromised after the COVID-19 infection, including the dysregulation of immune response, complement activation, platelet degranulation, lipoprotein metabolic process and response to hypoxia. We further validated our finding by directly comparing the same patients' urine proteome after recovery. This study demonstrates the COVID-19 pathophysiology related molecular alterations could be detected in the urine and the potential application of urinary proteome in auxiliary diagnosis, severity determination and therapy development of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yanchang Li","author_inst":"Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences (Beijing),  Beijing Institute of Lifeomics"},{"author_name":"Yihao Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences (Beijing),  Beijing Institute of Lifeomics"},{"author_name":"Huiying Liu","author_inst":"The Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wei Sun","author_inst":"Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences (Beijing), Beijing Institute of Lifeomics"},{"author_name":"Baoqing Ding","author_inst":"Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Connecticut"},{"author_name":"Yinghua Zhao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences (Beijing), Beijing Institute of Lifeomics"},{"author_name":"Peiru Chen","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences (Beijing), Beijing Institute of Lifeomics"},{"author_name":"Li Zhu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Zhaodi Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences (Beijing), Beijing Institute of Lifeomics"},{"author_name":"Naikang Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences (Beijing), Beijing Institute of Lifeomics"},{"author_name":"Lei Chang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences (Beijing), Beijing Institute of Lifeomics"},{"author_name":"Hengliang Wang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Changqing Bai","author_inst":"The Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ping Xu","author_inst":"Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences (Beijing),  Beijing Institute of Lifeomics"},{"author_name":"Klara Posfay-Barbe","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Didier Trono","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Didier Pittet","author_inst":"Centre for Vaccinology, Department of Pathology and Immunology, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Laurent Getaz","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Francois Chappuis","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Isabella Eckerle","author_inst":"Geneva Center for Emerging Viral Diseases and Laboratory of Virology, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Vuilleumier","author_inst":"Division of Laboratory Medicine, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Meyer","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Antoine Flahault","author_inst":"Institute of Global Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Laurent Kaiser","author_inst":"Geneva Center for Emerging Viral Diseases and Laboratory of Virology, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Idris Guessous","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.03.20089417","rel_title":"First Data-Set on SARS-CoV-2 Detection for Istanbul Wastewaters in Turkey","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.03.20089417","rel_abs":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and became a global pandemic [1]. By 26 April 2020, more than 2.9 million people were infected by SARS-CoV-2 and over 203 thousand people lost their life globally. By 26 April 2020, 107773 confirmed cases were reported in Turkey with 2706 deaths. Majority of the cases in Turkey has been observed in Istanbul. In the world, the duration of availability of SARS-CoV-2 was found to be significantly longer in stool samples than in respiratory and serum samples [2]. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in wastewaters in Australia [3], Netherlands [4], USA [5], France [6], Spain [7] and USA [8] by using different virus concentration techniques. In this work, Istanbul metropole with 65 % of Covid-19 cases was chosen as the pilot city. On the 21st of April 2020, 24-hr composite samples were collected from the Ambarli, Pasakoy and Kadikoy wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). On the 25th of April 2020, more wastewater samples were taken from Terkos, Buyukcekmece, Baltalimani and Tuzla WWTPs. These wastewater treatment plants were selected among 81 plants in Istanbul in order to take representative samples from 4 different districts of Istanbul according to the severity of Covid-19 cases, like very serious, serious, moderate and mild. Grab samples were also collected from Bagcilar and Kartal manholes located nearby the pandemic hospitals on April 21st, 2020. Polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG 8000) adsorption [5] SARS-Cov-2 concentration method was used for SARS-CoV-2 concentration after optimization. Real time RT-PCR diagnostic panel validated by US was used to quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA in raw sewage taken from the inlets of treatment plants and manholes. Five samples out of seven from wastewater and all samples from manholes were tested positive. SARS-CoV-2 in raw sewage from Ambarli, Pasakoy, Kadikoy, Terkos, Buyukcekmece, Baltalimani and Tuzla WWTPs were found as 8.26x103, 1.80x104, ND, ND, 3.73x103, 4.95x103, 2.89x103, respectively. The Bagcilar and Kartal manholes nearby pandemic hospitals exhibited 4.49x104 and 9.33x104, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 virus titers of manhole were higher than those of inlet of WWTPs. The observed copy numbers were presented against the number of Covid-19 cases coming to the WWTP per treatment plant capacity. Quantitative measurements of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater can be used as a tool in wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) and it can provide information about SARS-CoV-2 distribution in wastewater of various districts of Istanbul which exhibit different scores of Covid-19 cases. The distribution of epidemy was followed not only with blood test but with wastewater monitoring. This may allow us to identify the districts not exhibiting many Covid-19 cases, but under high risk. Continuous monitoring of wastewater for SARS-Cov-2 may provide an early warning signs before an epidemy starts in case of infection resurge.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bilge Alpaslan Kocamemi","author_inst":"Marmara University"},{"author_name":"Halil Kurt","author_inst":"Saglik Bilimleri University"},{"author_name":"Sabri Hacioglu","author_inst":"Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry"},{"author_name":"Cevdet Yarali","author_inst":"Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry"},{"author_name":"Ahmet Mete Saatci","author_inst":"Turkish Water Institute"},{"author_name":"Bekir Pakdemirli","author_inst":"Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry"},{"author_name":"Peiru Chen","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences (Beijing), Beijing Institute of Lifeomics"},{"author_name":"Li Zhu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Zhaodi Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences (Beijing), Beijing Institute of Lifeomics"},{"author_name":"Naikang Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences (Beijing), Beijing Institute of Lifeomics"},{"author_name":"Lei Chang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences (Beijing), Beijing Institute of Lifeomics"},{"author_name":"Hengliang Wang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Changqing Bai","author_inst":"The Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ping Xu","author_inst":"Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences (Beijing),  Beijing Institute of Lifeomics"},{"author_name":"Klara Posfay-Barbe","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Didier Trono","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Didier Pittet","author_inst":"Centre for Vaccinology, Department of Pathology and Immunology, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Laurent Getaz","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Francois Chappuis","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Isabella Eckerle","author_inst":"Geneva Center for Emerging Viral Diseases and Laboratory of Virology, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Vuilleumier","author_inst":"Division of Laboratory Medicine, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Meyer","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Antoine Flahault","author_inst":"Institute of Global Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Laurent Kaiser","author_inst":"Geneva Center for Emerging Viral Diseases and Laboratory of Virology, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Idris Guessous","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.03.20089680","rel_title":"The Impact of Social Distancing on TheCourse of The Covid-19 Pandemic in FourEuropean Countries","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.03.20089680","rel_abs":"In this article the mortality data from four European countries arising from the Covid-19 pandemic is modelled using logistic functions.

Dysregulated host immune response in the lung is a key feature in ARDS pathophysiology. However, cellular actors in Covid-19-driven ARDS are poorly understood. Here, we dynamically analyzed the biology of innate T cells, a heterogeneous class (MAIT, {gamma}{delta}T and iNKT cells) of T lymphocytes, presenting potent anti-infective and regulatory functions. Patients presented a compartmentalized lung inflammation paralleled with a limited systemic inflammation. Circulating innate T cells of critically ill Covid-19 patients presented a profound and persistent phenotypic and functional alteration. Highly activated innate T cells were detected in airways of patients suggesting a recruitment to the inflamed site and a potential contribution in the regulation of the local inflammation. Finally, the expression of the CD69 activation marker on blood iNKT and MAIT cells at inclusion was predictive of disease severity. Thus, patients present an altered innate T cell biology that may account for the dysregulated immune response observed in Covid-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Youenn Jouan","author_inst":"CHRU de Tours"},{"author_name":"Antoine Guillon","author_inst":"CHRU Tours ICU"},{"author_name":"Loic Gonzalez","author_inst":"Inserm U1100"},{"author_name":"Yonatan Perez","author_inst":"CHRU Tours ICU"},{"author_name":"Stephan Ehrmann","author_inst":"CHRU Tours ICU"},{"author_name":"Marion Ferreira","author_inst":"CHRU Tours"},{"author_name":"Thomas Daix","author_inst":"CIC Limoges"},{"author_name":"Robin Jeannet","author_inst":"CIC Limoges"},{"author_name":"Bruno Francois","author_inst":"CIC Limoges"},{"author_name":"Pierre-Francois Dequin","author_inst":"CHRU Tours ICU"},{"author_name":"Mustapha Si-Tahar","author_inst":"Inserm U1100"},{"author_name":"Thomas Baranek","author_inst":"Inserm U1100"},{"author_name":"Christophe Paget","author_inst":"Inserm U1100"},{"author_name":"Ping Xu","author_inst":"Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences (Beijing),  Beijing Institute of Lifeomics"},{"author_name":"Klara Posfay-Barbe","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Didier Trono","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Didier Pittet","author_inst":"Centre for Vaccinology, Department of Pathology and Immunology, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Laurent Getaz","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Francois Chappuis","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Isabella Eckerle","author_inst":"Geneva Center for Emerging Viral Diseases and Laboratory of Virology, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Vuilleumier","author_inst":"Division of Laboratory Medicine, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Meyer","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Antoine Flahault","author_inst":"Institute of Global Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Laurent Kaiser","author_inst":"Geneva Center for Emerging Viral Diseases and Laboratory of Virology, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Idris Guessous","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.02.20089136","rel_title":"A Network-Based Stochastic Epidemic Simulator: Controlling COVID-19 with Region-Specific Policies","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.02.20089136","rel_abs":"In this work, we present an open-source stochastic epidemic simulator, calibrated with extant epidemic experience of COVID-19.

Even so, the current data, albeit showing at least a reduction in infection rates, renders difficult to forecast scenarios in the imminent future. Using South Korea data as scaffold, which is becoming a paradigmatic case of recovery following a high number of infected people, we fitted Portuguese data to biphasic models using non-linear regression and compared the two countries. The results, which suggest good fit, show that recovery in Portugal can be much slower than anticipated, with a very high percentage of active cases (over 50%) remaining still active even months after the projected end of mitigation measures. This, together with the unknown number of asymptomatic carriers, may increase the risk of a much slower recovery if not of new outbreaks.

Therefore, this study proposes a bi-directional correction method to estimate the CFR. COVID-19 data from China were used to evaluate this method. The results show that this method provides more accurate results than both the crude CFR and hospital CFR.

It is critical we understand the efficacy of non-pharmaceutical interventions to choose a safe exit strategy. Many current models are not suitable for assessing exit strategies because they do not account for epidemic resurgence when social distancing ends prematurely (e.g., statistical curve fits) nor permit scenario exploration in specific locations. We developed an SEIR-type mechanistic epidemiological model of COVID-19 dynamics to explore temporally variable non-pharmaceutical interventions. We provide an interactive tool and code to estimate the transmission parameter, {beta}, and the effective reproduction number, Reff. We fit the model to Santa Clara County, California, where an early epidemic start date and early shelter-in-place orders could provide a model for other regions. As of April 22, 2020, we estimate an Reff of 0.982 (95% CI: 0.849 - 1.107) in Santa Clara County. After June 1 (the end-date for Santa Clara County shelter-in-place as of April 27), we estimate a shift to partial social distancing, combined with rigorous testing and isolation of symptomatic individuals, is a viable alternative to indefinitely maintaining shelter-in-place. We also estimate that if Santa Clara County had waited one week longer before issuing shelter-in-place orders, 95 additional people would have died by April 22 (95% CI: 7 - 283). Given early life-saving shelter-in-place orders in Santa Clara County, longer-term moderate social distancing and testing and isolation of symptomatic individuals have the potential to contain the size and toll of the COVID-19 pandemic in Santa Clara County, and may be effective in other locations.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marissa L Childs","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Morgan P Kain","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Devin Kirk","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Mallory Harris","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Lisa Couper","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Nicole Nova","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Isabel Delwel","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jacob Ritchie","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Erin A Mordecai","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Pierre-Francois Dequin","author_inst":"CHRU Tours ICU"},{"author_name":"Mustapha Si-Tahar","author_inst":"Inserm U1100"},{"author_name":"Thomas Baranek","author_inst":"Inserm U1100"},{"author_name":"Christophe Paget","author_inst":"Inserm U1100"},{"author_name":"Ping Xu","author_inst":"Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences (Beijing),  Beijing Institute of Lifeomics"},{"author_name":"Klara Posfay-Barbe","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Didier Trono","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Didier Pittet","author_inst":"Centre for Vaccinology, Department of Pathology and Immunology, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Laurent Getaz","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Francois Chappuis","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Isabella Eckerle","author_inst":"Geneva Center for Emerging Viral Diseases and Laboratory of Virology, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Vuilleumier","author_inst":"Division of Laboratory Medicine, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Meyer","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Antoine Flahault","author_inst":"Institute of Global Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Laurent Kaiser","author_inst":"Geneva Center for Emerging Viral Diseases and Laboratory of Virology, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Idris Guessous","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.02.20089094","rel_title":"Clinical characteristics and fecal-oral transmission potential of patients with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.02.20089094","rel_abs":"Background: A significant proportion of patients with COVID-19 generate negative pharyngeal swab viral nucleic acid test results but test positive using fecal samples. However, fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19 has not been established to date. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the duration of fecal swab positivity in COVID-19 patients after pharyngeal swab nucleic acid test turned negative and to explore its potential for fecal-oral transmission. Methods: A retrospective analysis of clinical records, laboratory results, and chest computed tomography (CT) findings of 17 COVID-19 patients confirmed by laboratory tests from January 22 to February 7, 2020 at a tertiary hospital was performed. The potential of fecal-oral transmission was assessed by detecting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in fecal swab samples. Results: A total of 16 patients (94.1%) had fever; other symptoms included dry cough, dyspnea, nausea, diarrhea, sore throat, fatigue, and muscle pain. Three patients had decreased white blood cell counts, 7 had decreased lymphocyte numbers, and 7 had increased C-reactive protein levels. Fecal samples of 11 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, of whom the time for the fecal samples to become SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid-negative was longer in 10 patients than that for pharyngeal swab samples, and only one case exhibited a shorter time for his fecal sample to become SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid-negative compared to his pharyngeal swab sample. The remaining 6 patients were negative for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in fecal samples. Conclusion: In COVID-19 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in both pharyngeal swab and fecal samples, the time for the fecal samples to become SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid-negative was generally longer than that in pharyngeal swab samples. However, there is currently no evidence demonstrating that the virus can be transmitted through the fecal-oral route.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Saibin Wang","author_inst":"Jinhua Municipal Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Junwei Tu","author_inst":"Jinhua Municipal Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yijun Sheng","author_inst":"Jinhua Municipal Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mallory Harris","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Lisa Couper","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Nicole Nova","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Isabel Delwel","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jacob Ritchie","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Erin A Mordecai","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Pierre-Francois Dequin","author_inst":"CHRU Tours ICU"},{"author_name":"Mustapha Si-Tahar","author_inst":"Inserm U1100"},{"author_name":"Thomas Baranek","author_inst":"Inserm U1100"},{"author_name":"Christophe Paget","author_inst":"Inserm U1100"},{"author_name":"Ping Xu","author_inst":"Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences (Beijing),  Beijing Institute of Lifeomics"},{"author_name":"Klara Posfay-Barbe","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Didier Trono","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Didier Pittet","author_inst":"Centre for Vaccinology, Department of Pathology and Immunology, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Laurent Getaz","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Francois Chappuis","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Isabella Eckerle","author_inst":"Geneva Center for Emerging Viral Diseases and Laboratory of Virology, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Vuilleumier","author_inst":"Division of Laboratory Medicine, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Meyer","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Antoine Flahault","author_inst":"Institute of Global Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Laurent Kaiser","author_inst":"Geneva Center for Emerging Viral Diseases and Laboratory of Virology, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Idris Guessous","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.03.20089201","rel_title":"A note on COVID-19 seroprevalence studies: a meta-analysis using hierarchical modelling","rel_date":"2020-05-06","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.03.20089201","rel_abs":"In recent weeks, several seroprevalence studies have appeared which attempt to determine the prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in the population of certain European and American locations. Many of these studies find an antibody prevalence comparable to the false positive rate of their respective serology tests and the relatively low statistical power associated with each study has invited criticism. To determine the strength of the signal, we perform a meta-analysis on the publicly available seroprevalence data based on Bayesian hierarchical modelling with Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Generalized Linear Mixed Modelling with prediction sampling. We examine studies with results from Santa Clara County (CA), Los Angeles County (CA), San Miguel County (CO), Chelsea (MA), the comte de Geneve (Switzerland), and Gangelt (Germany). Our results are in broad agreement with the conclusions of the studies; we find that there is evidence for non-trivial levels of antibody prevalence across all study locations. However, we also find that a significant probability mass exists for antibody prevalence at levels lower than the reported figures. The results of our meta-analysis on the recent seroprevalence studies point to an important and strongly suggestive signal.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"J\u00e9r\u00f4me Levesque","author_inst":"Government of Canada, Public Services and Procurement Canada"},{"author_name":"David W.

Hong Kong had a massive influx of travellers from mainland China, where the outbreak began, during the early expansion period coinciding with the Lunar New Year festival; however, the spread of the virus has been relatively limited even without imposing severe control measures, such as a full city lockdown. Understanding how quarantine measures in Hong Kong were effective in limiting community spread can provide us with valuable insights into how to suppress an outbreak. However, challenges exist in evaluating the effects of quarantine on COVID-19 transmission dynamics in Hong Kong due to the fact that the effects of border control have to be also taken into account. Methods: We have developed a two-layered susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantined-recovered (SEIQR) meta-population model which can estimate the effects of quarantine on virus transmissibility after stratifying infections into imported and subsequent community infections, in a region closely connected to the outbreak's source. We fitted the model to both imported and local confirmed case data with symptom onset from 18 January to 29 February 2020 in Hong Kong, together with daily transportation data and the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 from Wuhan and mainland China. After model fitting, epidemiological parameters and the timing of the start of quarantine for infected cases were estimated. Results: The model estimated that the reproduction number of COVID-19 in Hong Kong was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66 to 0.86), achieved through quarantining infected cases -0.57 days (95% CI, -4.21 - 3.88) relative to symptom onset, with an estimated incubation time of 5.43 days (95% CI, 1.30 - 9.47). However, if delaying the quarantine start by more than 1.43 days, the reproduction number would be greater than one, making community spread more likely. The model also determined the timing of the start of quarantine necessary in order to suppress an outbreak in the presence of population immunity. Conclusion: The results suggest that the early quarantine for infected cases before symptom onset is a key factor to prevent COVID-19 outbreak.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hsiang-Yu Yuan","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Guiyuan Han","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Hsiangkuo Yuan","author_inst":"Thomas Jefferson University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Susanne Pfeiffer","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Axiu Mao","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Lindsey Wu","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Dirk Pfeiffer","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Jacob Ritchie","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Erin A Mordecai","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Pierre-Francois Dequin","author_inst":"CHRU Tours ICU"},{"author_name":"Mustapha Si-Tahar","author_inst":"Inserm U1100"},{"author_name":"Thomas Baranek","author_inst":"Inserm U1100"},{"author_name":"Christophe Paget","author_inst":"Inserm U1100"},{"author_name":"Ping Xu","author_inst":"Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences (Beijing),  Beijing Institute of Lifeomics"},{"author_name":"Klara Posfay-Barbe","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Didier Trono","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Didier Pittet","author_inst":"Centre for Vaccinology, Department of Pathology and Immunology, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Laurent Getaz","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Francois Chappuis","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Isabella Eckerle","author_inst":"Geneva Center for Emerging Viral Diseases and Laboratory of Virology, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Vuilleumier","author_inst":"Division of Laboratory Medicine, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Meyer","author_inst":"University of Geneva"},{"author_name":"Antoine Flahault","author_inst":"Institute of Global Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Laurent Kaiser","author_inst":"Geneva Center for Emerging Viral Diseases and Laboratory of Virology, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Idris Guessous","author_inst":"Division of Primary Care, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"}]}
