ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and differences in expression may affect susceptibility to COVID-19. Using HCV-infected liver tissue from 195 individuals, we discovered that among genes negatively correlated with ACE2, interferon signalling pathways were highly enriched and observed down-regulation of ACE2 after interferon-alpha treatment. Negative correlation was also found in the gastrointestinal tract and in lung tissue from a murine model of SARS-CoV-1 infection suggesting conserved regulation of ACE2 across tissue and species. Performing a genome-wide eQTL analysis, we discovered that polymorphisms in the interferon lambda (IFNL) region are associated with ACE2 expression. Increased ACE2 expression in the liver was also associated with age and presence of cirrhosis. Polymorphisms in the IFNL region may impact not only antiviral responses but also ACE2 with potential consequences for clinical outcomes in distinct ethnic groups and with implications for therapeutic interventions.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"M.

Since then it has rapidly infected people around the world, with more than 4.5 million confirmed cases by the middle of May 2020. Early genome sequencing of the virus has enabled the development of molecular diagnostics and the commencement of therapy and vaccine development. The analysis of the early sequences showed relatively few evolutionary selection pressures. However, with the rapid worldwide expansion into diverse human populations, significant genetic variations are becoming increasingly likely. The current limitations on social movement between countries also offers the opportunity for these viral variants to become distinct strains with potential implications for diagnostics, therapies and vaccines.\n\nMethodsWe used the current sequencing archives (NCBI and GISAID) to investigate 15,487 whole genomes, looking for evidence of strain diversification and selective pressure.\n\nResultsWe used 6,294 SNPs to build a phylogenetic tree of SARS-CoV-2 diversity and noted strong evidence for the existence of two major clades and six sub-clades, unevenly distributed across the world. We also noted that convergent evolution has potentially occurred across several locations in the genome, showing selection pressures, including on the spike glycoprotein where we noted a potentially critical mutation that could affect its binding to the ACE2 receptor. We also report on mutations that could prevent current molecular diagnostics from detecting some of the sub-clades.\n\nConclusionThe worldwide whole genome sequencing effort is revealing the challenge of developing SARS-CoV-2 containment tools suitable for everyone and the need for data to be continually evaluated to ensure accuracy in outbreak estimations.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jody Phelan","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Wouter Deelder","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Daniel Ward","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Susana Campino","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Martin L Hibberd","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Taane G Clark","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Zhao-Hua Lin","author_inst":"East China Normal University"},{"author_name":"Yin-Qi Zeng","author_inst":"East China Normal University"},{"author_name":"Da-Yu Wu","author_inst":"East China Normal University"},{"author_name":"Ming Tang","author_inst":"East China Normal University"},{"author_name":"Di Xu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zonghua Liu","author_inst":"East China Normal University"},{"author_name":"Ying-Cheng Lai","author_inst":"Arizona State University - Tempe Campus"},{"author_name":"Angela Mo","author_inst":"Center for Integrative Genomics, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA"},{"author_name":"Greg Gibson","author_inst":"Center for Integrative Genomics, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA"},{"author_name":"John McLauchlan","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, Sir Michael Stoker Building, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, G61 1qh,"},{"author_name":"Eleanor Barnes","author_inst":"Peter Medawar Building for Pathogen Research, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 3SY, UK"},{"author_name":"John Kenneth Baillie","author_inst":"Genetics and Genomics, Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH25 9RG, UK."},{"author_name":"Sarah Teichmann","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton Cambridge, CB10 1SA UK"},{"author_name":"Alex Mentzer","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Roosevelt Dr, Headington, Oxford OX3 7BN"},{"author_name":"John Todd","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Roosevelt Dr, Headington, Oxford OX3 7BN"},{"author_name":"Julian Knight","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Roosevelt Dr, Headington, Oxford OX3 7BN"},{"author_name":"Holm Uhlig","author_inst":"Translational Gastroenterology Unit, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 9DU, UK"},{"author_name":"Paul Klenerman","author_inst":"Peter Medawar Building for Pathogen Research, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 3SY, UK"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.29.067983","rel_title":"Evaluation of 19 antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 Infection","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.29.067983","rel_abs":"The global pandemic of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or 2019-nCoV) has prompted multiple clinical trials to jumpstart search for anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies from existing drugs, including those with reported in vitro efficacies as well as those ones that are not known to inhibit SARS-CoV-2, such as ritonavir\/lopinavir and favilavir.

In addition to the canonical sgRNAs generated by SARS-CoV-2, non-canonical sgRNAs (nc-sgRNAs) have been reported. However, the consistency of these nc-sgRNAs across viral isolates and infection conditions is unknown. The comprehensive definition of SARS-CoV-2 RNA products is a key step in understanding SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.\n\nMethodsHere, we report an integrative analysis of eight independent SARS-CoV-2 transcriptomes generated using three sequencing strategies, five host systems, and seven viral isolates. Read-mapping to the SARS-CoV-2 genome was used to determine the 5 and 3 coordinates of all identified junctions in viral RNAs identified in these samples.\n\nResultsUsing junctional abundances, we show nc-sgRNAs make up as much as 33% of total sgRNAs in vitro, are largely consistent in abundance across independent transcriptomes, and increase in abundance over time during in vitro infection. By assessing the homology between sequences flanking the 5 and 3 junction points, we show that nc-sgRNAs are not associated with TRS-like homology. By incorporating read coverage information, we find strong evidence for subgenomic RNAs that contain only 5 regions of ORF1a. Finally, we show that non-canonical junctions change the landscape of viral open reading frames.\n\nConclusionsWe identify canonical and non-canonical junctions in SARS-CoV-2 sgRNAs and show that these RNA products are consistently generated across many independent viral isolates and sequencing approaches. These analyses highlight the diverse transcriptional activity of SARS-CoV-2 and offer important insights into SARS-CoV-2 biology.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jason Nomburg","author_inst":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Matthew Meyerson","author_inst":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"James A.

In this paper we have analysed the spike protein sequences from all these five isolates and also compared for their similarities or differences with other sequences reported in India and with isolates of Wuhan origin. We report one unique mutation at position 723 and the other at 1124 in the S2 domain of spike protein of the isolates from West Bengal only and one mutation downstream of the receptor binding domain at position 614 in S1 domain which was common with the sequence from Gujarat (a state of western part of India). Mutation in the S2 domain showed changes in the secondary structure of the spike protein at region of mutation. We also studied molecular dynamics using normal mode analyses and found that this mutation decreases the flexibility of S2 domain. Since both S1 and S2 are important in receptor binding followed by entry in the host cells, such mutations may define the affinity or avidity of receptor binding.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"FEROZA BEGUM","author_inst":"CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology"},{"author_name":"DEBICA MUKHERJEE","author_inst":"CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology"},{"author_name":"DLUYA THAKRIKI","author_inst":"CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology"},{"author_name":"SANDEEPAN DAS","author_inst":"CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology"},{"author_name":"PREM PRAKASH TRIPATHI","author_inst":"CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology"},{"author_name":"ARUP KUMAR BANERJEE","author_inst":"North Bengal Medical College and Hospital"},{"author_name":"UPASANA RAY","author_inst":"CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology"},{"author_name":"Yin-Qi Zeng","author_inst":"East China Normal University"},{"author_name":"Da-Yu Wu","author_inst":"East China Normal University"},{"author_name":"Ming Tang","author_inst":"East China Normal University"},{"author_name":"Di Xu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Zonghua Liu","author_inst":"East China Normal University"},{"author_name":"Ying-Cheng Lai","author_inst":"Arizona State University - Tempe Campus"},{"author_name":"Angela Mo","author_inst":"Center for Integrative Genomics, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA"},{"author_name":"Greg Gibson","author_inst":"Center for Integrative Genomics, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA"},{"author_name":"John McLauchlan","author_inst":"MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, Sir Michael Stoker Building, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, G61 1qh,"},{"author_name":"Eleanor Barnes","author_inst":"Peter Medawar Building for Pathogen Research, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 3SY, UK"},{"author_name":"John Kenneth Baillie","author_inst":"Genetics and Genomics, Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH25 9RG, UK."},{"author_name":"Sarah Teichmann","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton Cambridge, CB10 1SA UK"},{"author_name":"Alex Mentzer","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Roosevelt Dr, Headington, Oxford OX3 7BN"},{"author_name":"John Todd","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Roosevelt Dr, Headington, Oxford OX3 7BN"},{"author_name":"Julian Knight","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Roosevelt Dr, Headington, Oxford OX3 7BN"},{"author_name":"Holm Uhlig","author_inst":"Translational Gastroenterology Unit, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 9DU, UK"},{"author_name":"Paul Klenerman","author_inst":"Peter Medawar Building for Pathogen Research, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 3SY, UK"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"molecular biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.28.051789","rel_title":"A collection of designed peptides to target SARS-Cov-2 - ACE2 interaction: PepI-Covid19 database.","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.28.051789","rel_abs":"The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is the cellular receptor used by SARS coronavirus SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to enter the cell.

The GAG heparin prevents infection by a range of viruses when added exogenously, including the S-associated coronavirus strain HSR1 and more recently we have demonstrated that heparin can block cellular invasion by SARS-CoV-2. Heparin has found widespread clinical use as anticoagulant drug and this molecule is routinely used as a proxy for the GAG, heparan sulphate (HS), a structural analogue located on the cell surface, which is a known receptor for viral invasion. Previous work has demonstrated that unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparins binds to the Spike (S1) protein receptor binding domain, inducing distinct conformational change and we have further explored the structural features of heparin with regard to these interactions. In this article, previous research is expanded to now include a broader range of GAG family members, including heparan sulphate. This research demonstrates that GAGs, other than those of heparin (or its derivatives), can also interact with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 receptor binding domain and induce distinct conformational changes within this region. These findings pave the way for future research into next-generation, tailor-made, GAG-based antiviral agents, against SARS-CoV-2 and other members of the Coronaviridae.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Courtney Mycroft-West","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Dunhao Su","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Yong Li","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Scott Guimond","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Timothy Rudd","author_inst":"National Institute for Biological Standards and Control"},{"author_name":"Stefano Elli","author_inst":"Istituto di Ricerche Chimiche e Biochimiche G.

Viral Papain-Like cysteine protease (PLpro, NSP3) is essential for SARS-CoV-2 replication and represents a promising target for the development of antiviral drugs. Here, we used a combinatorial substrate library containing natural and a wide variety of nonproteinogenic amino acids and performed comprehensive activity profiling of SARS-CoV-2-PLpro. On the scaffold of best hits from positional scanning we designed optimal fluorogenic substrates and irreversible inhibitors with a high degree of selectivity for SARS PLpro variants versus other proteases. We determined crystal structures of two of these inhibitors (VIR250 and VIR251) in complex with SARS-CoV-2-PLpro which reveals their inhibitory mechanisms and provides a structural basis for the observed substrate specificity profiles. Lastly, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2-PLpro harbors deISGylating activities similar to SARS-CoV-1-PLpro but its ability to hydrolyze K48-linked Ub chains is diminished, which our sequence and structure analysis provides a basis for. Altogether this work has revealed the molecular rules governing PLpro substrate specificity and provides a framework for development of inhibitors with potential therapeutic value or drug repositioning.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wioletta Rut","author_inst":"Wroclaw University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zongyang Lv","author_inst":"Medical University of South Carolina"},{"author_name":"Mikolaj Zmudzinski","author_inst":"Wroclaw University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Patchett","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Digant Nayak","author_inst":"Medical University of South Carolina"},{"author_name":"Scott J Snipas","author_inst":"Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute"},{"author_name":"Farid El Oualid","author_inst":"UbiQ Bio B.V."},{"author_name":"Miklos Bekes","author_inst":"Arvinas, Inc.,"},{"author_name":"Tony T Huang","author_inst":"New York University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Marcin Drag","author_inst":"Wroclaw University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Shaun K Olsen","author_inst":"Medical University of South Carolina"},{"author_name":"Jeremy Turnbull","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Marco Guerrini","author_inst":"Istituto di Ricerche Chimiche e Biochimiche G.

The closely related polysaccharide heparin, the widely used anticoagulant drug, which is structurally similar to HS and is a common experimental proxy, can be expected to mimic the properties of HS. Heparin prevents infection by a range of viruses when added exogenously, including S-associated coronavirus strain HSR1 and inhibits cellular invasion by SARS-CoV-2. We have previously demonstrated that unfractionated heparin binds to the Spike (S1) protein receptor binding domain, induces a conformational change and have reported the structural features of heparin on which this interaction depends. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that enoxaparin, a low molecular weight clinical anticoagulant, also binds the S1 RBD protein and induces conformational change. Here we expand upon these studies, to a wide range of low molecular weight heparins and demonstrate that they induce a variety of conformational changes in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. These findings may have further implications for the rapid development of a first-line therapeutic by repurposing low molecular weight heparins, as well as for next-generation, tailor-made, GAG-based antiviral agents, against SARS-CoV-2 and other members of the Coronaviridae.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Courtney Mycroft-West","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Dunhao Su","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Yong Li","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Scott Guimond","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Timothy Rudd","author_inst":"National Institute for Biological Standards and Control"},{"author_name":"Stefano Elli","author_inst":"Istituto di Ricerche Chimiche e Biochimiche G.

Like other coronaviruses, this novel virus relies on the surface Spike glycoprotein to access the host cells, mainly through the interaction of its Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Therefore, molecular entities able to interfere with binding of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein to ACE2 have a great potential to inhibit viral entry. Starting from the available structural data on the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and the host ACE2 receptor, we here engineered a mini-protein with the aim of creating a soluble and stable Spike interactor. This mini-protein, which was recombinantly produced in high yields, possesses a stable  helical conformation and is able to interact with the RBD of glycosylated Spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 with nanomolar affinity, as measured by microscale thermophoresis. By plugging the Spike protein, our mini-protein constitutes a valid tool for the development of treatments against different types of coronavirus.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria Romano","author_inst":"Institute of Biostructures and Bioimaging, CNR"},{"author_name":"Alessia Ruggiero","author_inst":"Institute of Biostructures and Bioimaging, CNR"},{"author_name":"Flavia Squeglia","author_inst":"Institute of Biostructures and Bioimaging, CNR"},{"author_name":"Rita Berisio","author_inst":"CNR IBB"},{"author_name":"Timothy Rudd","author_inst":"National Institute for Biological Standards and Control"},{"author_name":"Stefano Elli","author_inst":"Istituto di Ricerche Chimiche e Biochimiche G.

In this study, post-translational modification (PTM) of recombinant HCoV-19 S and hACE2 were characterized by LC-MSMS. We revealed that both proteins were highly decorated with specific proportions of N-glycan subtypes. Out of 21 possible glycosites in HCoV-19 S protein, 20 were confirmed completely occupied by N-glycans, with oligomannose glycans being the most abundant type. All 7 possible glycosylation sites in hACE2 were completely occupied mainly by complex type N-glycans. However, we showed that glycosylation did not directly contribute to the binding affinity between SARS-CoV spike protein and hACE2. Additionally, we also identified multiple sites methylated in both proteins, and multiple prolines in hACE2 were converted to hydroxylproline. Refined structural models were built by adding N-glycan and PTMs to recently published cryo-EM structure of the HCoV-19 S and hACE2 generated with glycosylation sites in the vicinity of binding surface. The PTM and glycan maps of both HCoV-19 S and hACE2 provide additional structural details to study mechanisms underlying host attachment, immune response mediated by S protein and hACE2, as well as knowledge to develop remedies and vaccines desperately needed nowadays.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zeyu Sun","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Disease,The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Keyi Ren","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Disease,The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Xing Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Biophysics & Center of Cryo-Electron Microscopy, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Jinghua Chen","author_inst":"Department of Biophysics & Center of Cryo-Electron Microscopy, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Zhengyi Jiang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Disease,The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Jing Jiang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Disease,The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Feiyang Ji","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Disease,The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoxi Ouyang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Disease,The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Lanjuan Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Disease,The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Antonella Bisio","author_inst":"Istituto di Ricerche Chimiche e Biochimiche G.

Comparison of genome sequences from diverse locations allows us to identify the genetic diversity among viruses which would help in ascertaining viral virulence, disease pathogenicity, origin and spread of the SARS-CoV-2 between countries. The aim of this study is to ascertain the genetic diversity among Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Initial examination of the phylogenetic data of SARS-CoV-2 genomes (n=3123) from different continents deposited at GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) revealed multiple origin for Indian isolates. An in-depth analysis of 449 viral genomes derived from samples representing countries from USA, Europe, China, East Asia, South Asia, Oceania, Middle East regions and India revealed that most Indian samples are divided into two clusters (A and B) with cluster A showing more similarity to samples from Oceania and Kuwait and the cluster B grouping with countries from Europe, Middle East and South Asia. Diversity analysis of viral clades, which are characterized by specific non-synonymous mutations in viral proteins, discovered that the cluster A Indian samples belong to I clade (V378I in ORF1ab), which is an Oceania clade with samples having Iran connections and the cluster B Indian samples belong to G clade (D614G in Spike protein), which is an European clade. Thus our study identifies that the Indian SARS-CoV-2 viruses belong to I and G clades with potential origin to be countries mainly from Oceania, Europe, Middle East and South Asia regions, which strongly implying the spread of virus through most travelled countries. The study also emphasizes the importance of pathogen genomics through phylogenetic analysis to discover viral genetic diversity and understand the viral transmission dynamics with eventual grasp on viral virulence and disease pathogenesis.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kumaravel Somasundaram","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Mainak Mondal","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Ankita Lawarde","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Nicolas Fakhry","author_inst":"Head and Neck Surgery Universitary Hospital of la Conception"},{"author_name":"Petros D Karkos","author_inst":"AHEPA University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shazia Peer","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Jon A Sistiaga-Suarez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Donostia"},{"author_name":"Jose A Gonzalez-Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Donostia"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Cammaroto","author_inst":"Morgagni Pierantoni Hospital"},{"author_name":"Miguel Mayo","author_inst":"Hospital Complex of A Coruna"},{"author_name":"Pablo Parente-Arias","author_inst":"Hospital Lucus Agusti"},{"author_name":"Sven Saussez","author_inst":"University of Mons"},{"author_name":"Tareck Ayad","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de l universite de Montreal"},{"author_name":"David Fernig","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Edwin Yates","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Marcelo Lima","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Mark Skidmore","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"John Kenneth Baillie","author_inst":"Genetics and Genomics, Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH25 9RG, UK."},{"author_name":"Sarah Teichmann","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton Cambridge, CB10 1SA UK"},{"author_name":"Alex Mentzer","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Roosevelt Dr, Headington, Oxford OX3 7BN"},{"author_name":"John Todd","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Roosevelt Dr, Headington, Oxford OX3 7BN"},{"author_name":"Julian Knight","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Roosevelt Dr, Headington, Oxford OX3 7BN"},{"author_name":"Holm Uhlig","author_inst":"Translational Gastroenterology Unit, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 9DU, UK"},{"author_name":"Paul Klenerman","author_inst":"Peter Medawar Building for Pathogen Research, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 3SY, UK"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"genetic and genomic medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.25.20079509","rel_title":"Pregnancy and breastfeeding during COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review of published pregnancy cases","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.25.20079509","rel_abs":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is an emerging concern regarding the potential adverse effects during pregnancy.

Results: We identified 30 original studies reporting 212 cases of pregnant women with COVID-19 (30 discharged while pregnant), 200 from China and 12 from other countries. The 182 published deliveries resulted in one stillbirth and 185 live births. Four women with severe COVID-19 required admission to an intensive care unit but no cases of maternal death were reported. There was one neonatal death. Preterm births occurred in 28.7% of cases, but it is unclear whether this was iatrogenic. All cases with amniotic fluid, placenta, and\/or cord blood analyzed for the SARS-CoV-2 virus were negative. Four newborns were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and three newborns had high levels of IgM antibodies. Breast milk samples from 13 mothers and described in seven studies showed no evidence of SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion: The evidence related to the effect of COVID-19 on pregnant women is still limited. Pregnant women and newborns should be considered particularly vulnerable populations regarding COVID-19 prevention and management strategies.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carina Rodrigues","author_inst":"Instituto de Saude Publica da Universidade do Porto"},{"author_name":"Ines Baia","author_inst":"Instituto de Saude Publica da Universidade do Porto"},{"author_name":"Rosa Domingues","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas \/ Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz"},{"author_name":"Henrique Barros","author_inst":"Instituto de Saude Publica da Universidade do Porto"},{"author_name":"Petros D Karkos","author_inst":"AHEPA University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shazia Peer","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Jon A Sistiaga-Suarez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Donostia"},{"author_name":"Jose A Gonzalez-Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Donostia"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Cammaroto","author_inst":"Morgagni Pierantoni Hospital"},{"author_name":"Miguel Mayo","author_inst":"Hospital Complex of A Coruna"},{"author_name":"Pablo Parente-Arias","author_inst":"Hospital Lucus Agusti"},{"author_name":"Sven Saussez","author_inst":"University of Mons"},{"author_name":"Tareck Ayad","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de l universite de Montreal"},{"author_name":"David Fernig","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Edwin Yates","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Marcelo Lima","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Mark Skidmore","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"John Kenneth Baillie","author_inst":"Genetics and Genomics, Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH25 9RG, UK."},{"author_name":"Sarah Teichmann","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton Cambridge, CB10 1SA UK"},{"author_name":"Alex Mentzer","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Roosevelt Dr, Headington, Oxford OX3 7BN"},{"author_name":"John Todd","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Roosevelt Dr, Headington, Oxford OX3 7BN"},{"author_name":"Julian Knight","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Roosevelt Dr, Headington, Oxford OX3 7BN"},{"author_name":"Holm Uhlig","author_inst":"Translational Gastroenterology Unit, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 9DU, UK"},{"author_name":"Paul Klenerman","author_inst":"Peter Medawar Building for Pathogen Research, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 3SY, UK"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"obstetrics and gynecology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.25.20079079","rel_title":"Lopinavir-ritonavir alone or combined with arbidol in the treatment of 73 hospitalized patients with COVID-19: a pilot retrospective study","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.25.20079079","rel_abs":"Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the antiviral efficacy of lopinavir\/ritonavir alone or combined with arbidol in the treatment of hospitalized patients with common coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Methods: In this retrospective observational study, COVID-19 hospitalized patients were identified and divided into two groups based on the antiviral agents used during their hospitalization. Group-LR patients were treated with single antiviral drug of lopinavir-ritonavir. Group-LR+Ar patients were treated with lopinavir-ritonavir combined with arbidol for antiviral therapy at least 3 days. Patients were assessed for different clinical outcomes. Results: A total of 34 and 39 patients were identified for Group-LR and Group-LR+Ar, respectively. Treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir alone was not difference from lopinavir-ritonavir combined with arbidol in overall cure rate of COVID-19 hospitalized patients (92.3% and 97.1%, respectively). In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir-ritonavir combined with abidol led to a median time of hospital stay that was shorter by 1.5 days than group-LR (12.5 days vs. 14 days). The percentages of COVID-19 RNA clearance was 92.3 in group-LR and 97.1 in group-LR+Ar. The mean time of virus turning negative was 11.5 plus-or-minus sign 9.0 days in group-LR+Ar that were longer than group-LR. Treatment of lopinavir-ritonavir combined with arbidol did not significantly accelerate main symptoms improvement and promote the image absorption of pulmonary inflammation. Conclusion: No benefit was observed in the anti-virus effect of lopinavir-ritonavir combined with arbidol compared with lopinavir-ritonavir alone in the hospitalized patients with COVID-19. More clinical observations in COVID-19 patients may help to confirm or exclude the effect of antiviral agents.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiu Lan","author_inst":"Lishui Hospital of Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Chuxiao Shao","author_inst":"Lishui Hospital of Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Xu Zeng","author_inst":"Lishui Hospital of Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Zhenbo Wu","author_inst":"Lishui Hospital of Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Yanyan Xu","author_inst":"Lishui Hospital of Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Shazia Peer","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Jon A Sistiaga-Suarez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Donostia"},{"author_name":"Jose A Gonzalez-Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario Donostia"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Cammaroto","author_inst":"Morgagni Pierantoni Hospital"},{"author_name":"Miguel Mayo","author_inst":"Hospital Complex of A Coruna"},{"author_name":"Pablo Parente-Arias","author_inst":"Hospital Lucus Agusti"},{"author_name":"Sven Saussez","author_inst":"University of Mons"},{"author_name":"Tareck Ayad","author_inst":"Centre Hospitalier de l universite de Montreal"},{"author_name":"David Fernig","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Edwin Yates","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Marcelo Lima","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Mark Skidmore","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"John Kenneth Baillie","author_inst":"Genetics and Genomics, Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH25 9RG, UK."},{"author_name":"Sarah Teichmann","author_inst":"Wellcome Sanger Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton Cambridge, CB10 1SA UK"},{"author_name":"Alex Mentzer","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Roosevelt Dr, Headington, Oxford OX3 7BN"},{"author_name":"John Todd","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Roosevelt Dr, Headington, Oxford OX3 7BN"},{"author_name":"Julian Knight","author_inst":"Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Roosevelt Dr, Headington, Oxford OX3 7BN"},{"author_name":"Holm Uhlig","author_inst":"Translational Gastroenterology Unit, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 9DU, UK"},{"author_name":"Paul Klenerman","author_inst":"Peter Medawar Building for Pathogen Research, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 3SY, UK"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.25.20079335","rel_title":"The nexus of travel restriction, air pollution and COVID-19 infection: Investigation from a megacity of the southern China","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.25.20079335","rel_abs":"To control and prevent the spread of COVID-19, generalized social distancing measures, such as traffic control and travel restriction acted in China.

The emergence, detection, spread, treatment and containment of infectious diseases shows the considerable political and economic impacts in a highly interconnected world. We aimed to estimate the effects of socioeconomic levels on the spread and treatment of COVID-19 in China. Methods: We obtained daily COVID-19 cases at a city level in China. We used migration data from the major cities in Hubei Province, and macroeconomic data at city and province levels. We obtained social management measures in response to COVID-19 outbreak. We assessed the association between measures, migration and COVID-19 spread, and the association between socioeconomic levels and COVID-19 treatment capacity. Findings: On January 1, 2020, COVID-19 spread that affected by management measures and migration started across China. After Wuhan lockdown, the case number reached peak in 12 days, and COVID-19 outbreak was basically contained in China in four weeks due to intensive measures. Guangdong, Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces showed the most excellent COVID-19 treatment capacities. Socioeconomic levels in these provinces ranked top in China. Guangdong achieved the largest decline in severe case rate by 22.1%. Jiangsu had the lowest average rate of severe cases (1.7%) and zero death. Among the regions with top case number, Zhejiang showed the highest rate of cured cases on confirmed cases (96.3%), the lowest average rate of severe cases (7.7%), and one death. The COVID-19 treatment capacities were strongly affected by regional economics and measures on control, detection and treatment. Interpretation: Socioeconomic levels had strong effect on the spread and treatment of COVID-19 in China. Further investigations are needed on the effectiveness of Chinese measures and the effects of socioeconomic levels on COVID-19 treatment outside China.

Design: Community survey Setting: The COVID Symptom Tracker mobile application co-developed by physicians and scientists at Kings College London, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston and Zoe Global Limited was launched in the UK and US on 24th and 29th March 2020 respectively. It captured self-reported information related to COVID-19 symptoms and testing. Participants: 2,618,948 users of the COVID Symptom Tracker App. UK (95.7%) and US (4.3%) population. Data cut-off for this analysis was 21st April 2020. Main outcome measures: Visit to hospital and for those who attended hospital, the need for respiratory support in three subgroups (i) self-reported COVID-19 infection with classical symptoms (SR-COVID-19), (ii) self-reported positive COVID-19 test results (T-COVID-19), and (iii) imputed\/predicted COVID-19 infection based on symptomatology (I-COVID-19). Multivariate logistic regressions for each outcome and each subgroup were adjusted for age and gender, with sensitivity analyses adjusted for comorbidities. Classical symptoms were defined as high fever and persistent cough for several days. Results: Older age and all comorbidities tested were found to be associated with increased odds of requiring hospital care for COVID-19. Obesity (BMI >30) predicted hospital care in all models, with odds ratios (OR) varying from 1.20 [1.11; 1.31] to 1.40 [1.23; 1.60] across population groups. Pre-existing lung disease and diabetes were consistently found to be associated with hospital visit with a maximum OR of 1.79 [1.64,1.95] and 1.72 [1.27; 2.31]) respectively. Findings were similar when assessing the need for respiratory support, for which age and male gender played an additional role. Conclusions: Being older, obese, diabetic or suffering from pre-existing lung, heart or renal disease placed participants at increased risk of visiting hospital with COVID-19. It is of utmost importance for governments and the scientific and medical communities to work together to find evidence-based means of protecting those deemed most vulnerable from COVID-19.

Although more than 14,000 research articles on COVID-19 have been published with the disease taking a pandemic proportion, clinicians and researchers are struggling to distill knowledge for furthering clinical management and research. In this study, we address this gap for a targeted user group, i.e. clinicians, researchers, and policymakers by applying natural language processing to develop a CovidNLP dashboard in order to speed up knowledge discovery. The WHO has created a repository of about more than 5000 peer-reviewed and curated research articles on varied aspects including epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, social factors, and economics. We summarised all the articles in the WHO Database through an extractive summarizer followed by an exploration of the feature space using word embeddings which were then used to visualize the summarized associations of COVID-19 as found in the text. Clinicians, researchers, and policymakers will not only discover the direct effects of COVID-19 but also the systematic implications such as the anticipated rise in TB and cancer mortality due to the non-availability of drugs during the export lockdown as highlighted by our models. These demonstrate the utility of mining massive literature with natural language processing for rapid distillation and knowledge updates. This can help the users understand, synthesize, and take pre-emptive action with the available peer-reviewed evidence on COVID-19. Our models will be continuously updated with new literature and we have made our resource CovidNLP publicly available in a user-friendly fashion at http:\/\/covidnlp.tavlab.iiitd.edu.in\/.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Raghav Awasthi","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ridam Pal","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Pradeep Singh","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Aditya Nagori","author_inst":"CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology Delhi"},{"author_name":"Suryatej Reddy","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Amogh Gulati","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Ponnurangam Kumaraguru","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Tavpritesh Sethi","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"David Alden Drew","author_inst":"Clinical and Translational Epidemiology Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Sajaysurya Ganesh","author_inst":"Zoe Global Limited,164 Westminster Bridge Road, London SE1 7RW, UK"},{"author_name":"Julien Lavigne du Cadet","author_inst":"Zoe Global Limited,164 Westminster Bridge Road, London SE1 7RW, UK"},{"author_name":"Alessia Visconti","author_inst":"Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, Kings College London, Westminster Bridge Road, SE17EH London, UK"},{"author_name":"Maxim B Freydin","author_inst":"Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, Kings College London, Westminster Bridge Road, SE17EH London, UK"},{"author_name":"Marc Modat","author_inst":"School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, Kings College London, Westminster Bridge Road, SE17EH London, UK"},{"author_name":"Mark S Graham","author_inst":"School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, Kings College London, Westminster Bridge Road, SE17EH London, UK"},{"author_name":"Joan Capdevila Pujol","author_inst":"Zoe Global Limited,164 Westminster Bridge Road, London SE1 7RW, UK"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Murray","author_inst":"School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, Kings College London, Westminster Bridge Road, SE17EH London, UK"},{"author_name":"Julia S El-Sayed Moustafa","author_inst":"Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, Kings College London, Westminster Bridge Road, SE17EH London, UK"},{"author_name":"Xinyuan Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, Kings College London, Westminster Bridge Road, SE17EH London, UK"},{"author_name":"Richard Davies","author_inst":"Zoe Global Limited,164 Westminster Bridge Road, London SE1 7RW, UK"},{"author_name":"Mario Falchi","author_inst":"Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, Kings College London, Westminster Bridge Road, SE17EH London, UK"},{"author_name":"Timothy D Spector","author_inst":"Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, Kings College London, Westminster Bridge Road, SE17EH London, UK"},{"author_name":"Andrew T Chan","author_inst":"Clinical and Translational Epidemiology Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Ourselin","author_inst":"School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, Kings College London, Westminster Bridge Road, SE17EH London, UK"},{"author_name":"Claire J Steves","author_inst":"Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, Kings College London, Westminster Bridge Road, SE17EH London, UK"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.25.20078311","rel_title":"Demographic and Socio-Economic Factors, and Healthcare Resource Indicators Associated with the Rapid Spread of COVID-19 in Northern Italy: An Ecological Study","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.25.20078311","rel_abs":"Background: COVID-19 rapidly escalated into a pandemic, threatening 213 countries, areas, and territories the world over. We aimed to identify potential province-level socioeconomic determinants of the virus's dissemination, and explain between-province differences in the speed of its spread, based on data from 36 provinces of Northern Italy. Methods: This is an ecological study. We included all confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 reported between February 24th and March 30th, 2020. For each province, we calculated the trend of contagion as the relative increase in the number of individuals infected between two time endpoints, assuming an exponential growth. Pearson's test was used to correlate the trend of contagion with a set of healthcare-associated, economic, and demographic parameters by province. The virus's spread was input as a dependent variable in a stepwise OLS regression model to test the association between rate of spread and province-level indicators. Findings: Multivariate analysis showed that the spread of COVID-19 was correlated negatively with aging index (p-value=0.003), and positively with public transportation per capita (p-value=0.012), the % of private long-term care hospital beds and, to a lesser extent (p-value=0.070), the % of private acute care hospital beds (p-value=0.006). Interpretation: Demographic and socioeconomic factors, and healthcare organization variables were found associated with a significant difference in the rate of COVID-19 spread in 36 provinces of Northern Italy. An aging population seemed to naturally contain social contacts. The availability of healthcare resources and their coordination could play an important part in spreading infection.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alessandra Buja","author_inst":"Department of Cardiologic, Vascular and Thoracic Sciences, and Public Health, University of Padova.

However, the relationship of social capital to the spread of infectious disease like COVID-19 is lacking. The COVID-19 pandemic presents an unprecedented threat to global health and economy, for which control strategies have relied on aggressive social distancing. However, an understanding of how social capital is related to changes in human mobility patterns for adherence to social distancing is lacking. Objective: This study examines the association between state- and county-level social capital indices and community health indices in the United States, and the growth rate of COVID-19 cases. It also examines changes in human mobility. Methods: Using publicly available state- and county-specific time series data for COVID-19 cases from March 13 to March 31, we used exponential fits to determine growth rate. We obtained publicly available mobility change data, originally measured from GPS-enabled mobile devices. The design was then state- and county-level correlation analysis with social capital and community health indices from the Social Capital Project (United States Senate). Results: In bivariate linear correlation analyses, we find social capital and community health indices were negatively associated with COVID-19 growth rates at both the state and county levels. The correlation was strongest at the county level for the community health index: a one-unit increase in the county community health index was associated with a decrease in the COVID-19 growth rate exponent by 0.045. In further bivariate correlation analyses, we find that social capital indices were negatively associated with retail\/recreation movement and positively associated with residential movement. That is, an increase in social capital is correlated with slower COVID-19 infection spread and more adherence to social distancing protocols. Conclusion: Our results indicate the potential benefit of incorporating social capital concepts in planning policies to control the spread of COVID-19, e.g. different social distancing requirements in different communities. The results also indicate a need for further research into this potentially causal relationship, including examining interventions to increase social capital, community health, and institutional health.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lav R.

We report the epidemiological, demographic, and clinical findings for confirmed COVID-19 cases during the first month of the epidemic in Brazil. Methods: Individual-level and aggregated COVID-19 data were analysed to investigate demographic profiles, socioeconomic drivers and age-sex structure of COVID-19 tested cases. Basic reproduction numbers (R0) were investigated for Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify symptoms associated with confirmed cases and risk factors associated with hospitalization. Laboratory diagnosis for eight respiratory viruses were obtained for 2,429 cases. Findings: By March 25, 1,468 confirmed cases were notified in Brazil, of whom 10% (147 of 1,468) were hospitalised. Of the cases acquired locally (77.8%), two thirds (66.9% of 5,746) were confirmed in private laboratories. Overall, positive association between higher per capita income and COVID-19 diagnosis was identified. The median age of detected cases was 39 years (IQR 30-53). The median R0 was 2.9 for Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Cardiovascular disease\/hypertension were associated with hospitalization. Co-circulation of six respiratory viruses, including influenza A and B and human rhinovirus was detected in low levels. Interpretation: Socioeconomic disparity determines access to SARS-CoV-2 testing in Brazil. The lower median age of infection and hospitalization compared to other countries is expected due to a younger population structure. Enhanced surveillance of respiratory pathogens across socioeconomic statuses is essential to better understand and halt SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","rel_num_authors":38,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"William Marciel de Souza","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Lewis Fletcher Buss","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Darlan da Silva Candido","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jean Paul Carrera","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Sabrina Li","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alexander Zarebski","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Maria Vincenti-Gonzalez","author_inst":"Universitair Medisch Centrum Groningen"},{"author_name":"Janey Messina","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Flavia Cristina da Silva Sales","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Pamela dos Santos Andrade","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Carlos A Prete Jr.","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Vitor Heloiz Nascimento","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Fabio Ghilardi","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Rafael Henrique Moraes Pereira","author_inst":"Institute for Applied Economic Research"},{"author_name":"Andreza Aruska de Souza Santos","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Leandro Abade","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Bernardo Gutierrez","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Moritz  U.

There is an urgent need to find economical and scalable ways to test more people. We present Tapestry, a novel quantitative nonadaptive pooling scheme to test many samples using only a few tests. The underlying molecular diagnostic test is any real-time RT-PCR diagnostic panel approved for the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In cases where most samples are negative for the virus, Tapestry accurately identifies the status of each individual sample with a single round of testing in fewer tests than simple two-round pooling. We also present a companion Android application BYOM Smart Testing which guides users through the pipetting steps required to perform the combinatorial pooling. The results of the pooled tests can be fed into the application to recover the status and estimated viral load for each individual sample.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sabyasachi Ghosh","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"},{"author_name":"Ajit Rajwade","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"},{"author_name":"Srikar Krishna","author_inst":"InStem Bangalore and SASTRA University"},{"author_name":"Nikhil Gopalkrishnan","author_inst":"Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University, and Department of Systems Biology, Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Thomas E.
