Objective: To describe the prevalence of burnout among healthcare professionals and the associated factors. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: Eight university affiliated hospitals in the capital city of Tehran, Iran. Participants: All healthcare workers at the study sites who had been taking care of COVID-19 patients. Measurements: Age, gender, marital status, having children, hospital, job category, experience, and work load, as well as the level of burnout in each subscale. Results: 326 persons (53.0%) experienced high levels of burnout. The average score in emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and lack of personal accomplishment was 26.6, 10.2, and 27.3, respectively. The level of burnout in the three subscales varied based on the personal as well as work related factors and gender was the only variable that was associated with high levels of all three domains. Limitations: There was no control group and thus we cannot claim a causal relationship between COVID-19 and the observed level of burnout. Not all confounding factors might have been accounted for. Conclusions: Burnout is prevalent among healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients. Age, gender, job category, and site of practice contribute to the level of burnout that the staff experience.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammad Jalili","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mahtab Niroomand","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Fahimeh Hadavand","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Kataun Zeinali","author_inst":"Shahid Beheshti Universityof Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Akbar Fotouhi","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"occupational and environmental health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.12.20129908","rel_title":"A Logistic Model for Age-Specific COVID-19 Case-Fatality Rates","rel_date":"2020-06-13","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.12.20129908","rel_abs":"Objectives To develop a mathematical model to characterize age-specific case-fatality rates (CFR) of COVID-19.

These institutions have turned to distance learning to provide educational continuity. Schools now face the challenge of how to reopen safely and resume in-class learning. However, there is little empirical evidence to guide decision-makers on how this can be achieved. Here, we show that selectively deploying e-learning for larger classes is highly effective at decreasing campus-wide opportunities for student-to-student contact, while allowing most in-class learning to continue uninterrupted. We conducted a natural experiment at a large university that implemented a series of e-learning interventions during the COVID-19 outbreak. Analyses of >24 million student connections to the university Wi-Fi network revealed that population size can be manipulated by e-learning in a targeted manner according to class size characteristics. Student mixing showed accelerated growth with population size according to a power law distribution. Therefore, a small e-learning dependent decrease in population size resulted in a large reduction in student clustering behaviour. Our results show that e-learning interventions can decrease potential for disease transmission while minimizing disruption to university operations. Universities should consider targeted e-learning a viable strategy for providing educational continuity during early or late stages of a disease outbreak.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sing Chen Yeo","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Clin K.Y.

At the time of writing this paper no medical therapy is officially recommended or has shown results in improving the outcomes in COVID-19 patients. With the aim of diminishing the impact in Hospital admissions and reducing the number of medical complications, we implemented a strategy based on a Hospital Home-Care Unit (HHCU) using an easy-to-use treatment based on an oral administration regimen outside the hospital with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) plus azithromycin (AZM) for a short period of 5 days. Patients and methods: Patients [&ge;] 18 years old visiting the emergency room at the Hospital Universitario San Pedro de Logrono (La Rioja) between March, 31st and April, 12th diagnosed with COVID-19 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by a specific PCR, as follows: Patients with pneumonia (CURB [&le;] 1) who did not present severe comorbidities and had no processes that contraindicated this therapeutic regime. Olygosimptomatic patients without pneumonia aged [&ge;] 55 years. Patients [&ge;] 18 years old without pneumonia with significant comorbidities. We excluded patients with known allergies to some of the antimicrobials used and patients treated with other drugs that increase the QTc or with QTc >450msc. The therapeutic regime was: HCQ 400 mg every twice in a loading dose followed by 200 mg twice for 5 days, plus AZM 500 mg on the first day followed by 250 mg daily for 5 days. A daily telephone follow-up was carried out from the hospital by the same physician. The end-points of our study were: 1.- To measure the need for hospital admission within 15 days after the start of treatment. 2.- To measure the need to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) within 15 days after the start of the treatment. 3.- To describe the severity of the clinical complications developed. 4.- To measure the mortality within 30 days after starting treatment (differentiating if the cause is COVID-19 or something else). 5.-To describe the safety and adverse effects of the therapeutic regime. Results: During the 13 days studied a total of 502 patients were attended in the emergency room due to COVID-19. Forty-two were sent at home; 80 were attended by the HHCU (patients on this study) and 380 were admitted to the Hospital. In our series there were a group of 69 (85.18%) patients diagnosed with pneumonia (37 males and 32 females). Most of them, 57 (82.60%) had a CURB65 score of <1 (average age 49) and 12 (17.40%) a CURB score of 1 (average age 63). Eighteen (22.50%) of the pneumonia patients also had some morbidity as a risk factor. 11 patients (13.75%) without pneumonia were admitted to the HHCU because comorbidities or age [&ge;] 55 years. Six patients with pneumonia had to be hospitalized during the observation period, 3 of them because side effects and 3 because of worsening. One of these patients, with morbid obesity and asthma, had clinical worsening needing mechanical ventilation at ICU and developed acute distress respiratory syndrome. With the exception of the patient admitted to the ICU, the rest of the patients were discharged at home in the following 8 days (3 to 8 days). Twelve patients (15%), 11 of whom had pneumonia, experienced side effects affecting mainly the digestive. In another patient a QTc interval prolongation (452 msc) was observed. In total 3 of these patients had to be admitted in the Hospital, 2 because of vomiting and 1 because a QTc interval lengthening. None of the patients needed to stop the HCQ or AZM and all the 80 patients finished the therapeutic strategy. From the group without pneumonia only a patient developed diarrhea that did not require hospitalization or stop the medication. Conclusions: Our strategy has been associated with a reduction in the burden of hospital pressure, and it seems to be successful in terms of the number of patients who have developed serious complications and \/ or death. None of the patients died in the studied period and only 6 have to be admitted in conventional hospitalization area.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jos\u00e9 A.

Methods: We have conducted a cohort study amongst Health Care Workers (HCW) exposed to COVID-19 patients, at a tertiary care center in India where there was an abrupt cluster outbreak within on duty personnel. HCWs who had voluntarily taken hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) prior to exposure were considered one cohort while those who had not were considered to be another. All participants with a verifiable contact history were tested for COVID-19 by rtPCR. The two cohorts were comparable in terms of age, gender, comorbidities and exposure. The primary outcome was incidence rates of rtPCR positive COVID-19 infection amongst HCQ users and non - users. Results: 106 healthcare workers were examined in this cohort study of whom 54 were HCQ users and rest were not. The comparative analysis of incidence of infection between the two groups demonstrated that voluntary HCQ usage was associated with lesser likelihood of developing SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to those who were not on it, X2=14.59, p<0.001. None of the HCQ users noted any serious adverse effects. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that voluntary HCQ consumption as pre-exposure prophylaxis by HCWs is associated with a statistically significant reduction in risk of SARS-CoV-2. These promising findings therefore highlight the need to examine this association in greater detail among a larger sample using Randomised Controlled Trials (RCT).","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Raja Bhattacharya","author_inst":"Medical College Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Sampurna Chowdhury","author_inst":"Medical College Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Rishav Mukherjee","author_inst":"Medical College Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Anita Nandi","author_inst":"Medical College Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Manish Kulshrestha","author_inst":"Medical College Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Rohini Ghosh","author_inst":"Medical College Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Souvik Saha","author_inst":"Presidency University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.08.20050559","rel_title":"COVID-19: Dying is Bad--Losing Life is Worse","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.08.20050559","rel_abs":"Background: COVID-19 was the leading cause of death in the United States over the three-month period March through May 2020. Another perspective is COVID-19s toll in terms of years of life lost. We calculated years of life lost for COVID-19 and other leading causes of death over those three months in the US. We also predicted years of life lost for COVID-19 and ischemic heart diseases (which includes heart attacks) for March through August 2020. Methods: Years of life lost are the sum of differences between life expectancy at age of death and age at death. Average years of life lost, years of life lost divided by the number of deaths, were also calculated. We used the COVID-19 Projections Using Machine Learning model to predict years of life lost from COVID-19 through the end of August 2020. Results: COVID-19 caused 12,035 more deaths than ischemic heart diseases during March through May 2020 but ischemic heart diseases years of life lost were 1.5% greater than those for COVID-19. Average years of life lost were 10.8 and 12.4 for COVID-19 and ischemic heart diseases, respectively. At the end of August, COVID-19 may overtake ischemic heart diseases as the leading cause of deaths and years of life lost in the US. Conclusion: Each COVID-19 death causes more than a decade of lost life in the US. We are reminded of a Danish Proverb that states Prediction is difficult, especially when dealing with the future. We suggest that while dying is bad, losing life is even worse.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Harry P Wetzler","author_inst":"Ofstead and Associates"},{"author_name":"Erica A.

Design: Open-source age-structured variant of a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) deterministic compartmental mathematical model. Latin hypercube sampling and maximum likelihood estimation were used to calibrate to cumulative cases and cumulative deaths. Setting: SW at a time considered early in the pandemic, where National Health Service (NHS) authorities required evidence to guide localised planning and support decision-making. Participants: Publicly-available data on COVID-19 patients. Primary and secondary outcome measures: The expected numbers of infected cases, deaths due to COVID-19 infection, patient occupancy of acute and IC beds and the reproduction (\"R\") number over time. Results: SW model projections indicate that, as of the 11th May 2020 (when 'lockdown' measures were eased), 5,793 (95% credible interval, CrI, 2,003 - 12,051) individuals were still infectious (0.10% of the total SW England population, 95%CrI 0.04 - 0.22%), and a total of 189,048 (95%CrI 141,580 - 277,955) had been infected with the virus (either asymptomatically or symptomatically), but recovered, which is 3.4% (95%CrI 2.5 - 5.0%) of the SW population. The total number of patients in acute and IC beds in the SW on the 11th May 2020 was predicted to be 701 (95%CrI 169 - 1,543) and 110 (95%CrI 8 - 464) respectively. The R value in SW England was predicted to be 2.6 (95%CrI 2.0 - 3.2) prior to any interventions, with social distancing reducing this to 2.3 (95%CrI 1.8 - 2.9) and lockdown\/ school closures further reducing the R value to 0.6 (95CrI% 0.5 - 0.7). Conclusions: The developed model has proved a valuable asset for local and regional healthcare services.

This paper aims to propose a high-speed and accurate fully-automated method to detect COVID-19 from the patient's CT scan images. We introduce a new dataset that contains 48260 CT scan images from 282 normal persons and 15589 images from 95 patients with COVID-19 infections. At the first stage, this system runs our proposed image processing algorithm to discard those CT images that inside the lung is not properly visible in them. This action helps to reduce the processing time and false detections. At the next stage, we introduce a novel method for increasing the classification accuracy of convolutional networks. We implemented our method using the ResNet50V2 network and a modified feature pyramid network alongside our designed architecture for classifying the selected CT images into COVID-19 or normal with higher accuracy than other models. After running these two phases, the system determines the condition of the patient using a selected threshold. We are the first to evaluate our system in two different ways. In the single image classification stage, our model achieved 98.49% accuracy on more than 7996 test images. At the patient identification phase, the system correctly identified almost 234 of 245 patients with high speed. We also investigate the classified images with the Grad-CAM algorithm to indicate the area of infections in images and evaluate our model classification correctness.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammad Rahimzadeh","author_inst":"Iran University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Abolfazl Attar","author_inst":"Sharif University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Seyed Mohammad Sakhaei","author_inst":"Sari Azad University"},{"author_name":"Katharine J Looker","author_inst":"Population Health Science Institute, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Catherine Hyams","author_inst":"Academic Respiratory Unit, Southmead Hospital, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Philip D Bright","author_inst":"Immunology, Pathology Sciences, North Bristol NHS Trust, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Irasha Harding","author_inst":"Consultant in Microbiology, University Hospitals Bristol, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Rajeka Lazarus","author_inst":"Consultant in Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, University Hospitals Bristol, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Fergus Hamilton","author_inst":"Infection Science, Southmead Hospital, North Bristol NHS Trust, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Daniel Lawson","author_inst":"School of Mathematics, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Leon Danon","author_inst":"College of Engineering, Mathematics and Physical Sciences, University of Exeter, Exeter, UK"},{"author_name":"Adrian Pratt","author_inst":"Principal BI Analyst Modelling and Analytics, NHS Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire CCG"},{"author_name":"Richard Wood","author_inst":"Head of Modelling and Analytics, NHS Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire CCG"},{"author_name":"Ellen Brooks-Pollock","author_inst":"Bristol Veterinary School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Katherine M E Turner","author_inst":"Bristol Veterinary School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"radiology and imaging"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.04.20119206","rel_title":"A Comparative Study of Target Reconstruction of Ultra-High-Resolution CT for Patients with Corona-Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.04.20119206","rel_abs":"Background: The corona-virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a serious public health risk. Compared with conventional high-resolution CT (C-HRCT, matrix 512), ultra-high resolution CT (U-HRCT, matrix 1024) can increase the effective pixel per unit volume by about 4 times. Our study is to evaluate the value of target reconstruction of U-HRCT in the accurate diagnosis of COVID-19. Methods: A total of 13 COVID-19 cases, 44 cases of other pneumonias, and 6 cases of ground-glass nodules were retrospectively analyzed. The data were categorized into groups A (C-HRCT) and B (U-HRCT), following which iDose4-3 and iDose4-5 were used for target reconstruction, respectively. CT value, noise, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in different reconstructed images were measured. Two senior imaging doctors scored the image quality and the structure of the lesions on a 5-point scale. Chi-square test, variance analysis, and binarylogistic regression analysis were used for statistical analysis. Results: U-HRCT image can reduce noise and improve SNR with an increase of the iterative reconstruction level. The SNR of U-HRCT image was lower than that of the C-HRCT image of the same iDose4level, and the noise of U-HRCT was higher than that of C-HRCT image; the difference was statistically significant (P< 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed thatperipleural distribution, thickening of blood vessels and interlobular septum, and crazy-paving pattern were independent indictors of the COVID-19 on U-HRCT. U-HRCT was superior to C-HRCT in showing the blood vessels, bronchial wall, and interlobular septum in the ground-glass opacities; the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Conclusions:Peripleural distribution, thickening of blood vessels and interlobular septum, and crazy-paving pattern on U-HRCT are favorable signs for COVID-19. U-HRCT is superior to C-HRCT in displaying the blood vessels, bronchial walls, and interlobular septum for evaluating COVID-19.

This study aimed to examine the efficacy and safety of HCQ plus standard of care in COVID-19 patients. Methods: PubMed, The Cochrane Library, Embase, and web of sciences were searched up to June 1, 2020. The references list of the key studies was reviewed for additional relevant resources. Clinical studies registry databases were searched for identifying potential clinical trials. The quality of the included studies was evaluated using the Cochrane Collaborations tool. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan software (version 5.3). Results: Three randomized controlled trials with total number of 242 patients were identified eligible for meta-analysis. No significant differences were observed between HCQ and standard care in terms of viral clearance (Risk ratio [RR] = 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.91, 1.16; P= 0.68), disease progression (RR=0.92; 95% CI= 0.10, 0.81; P=0.94), Chest CT (RR=1.40; 95% CI= 1.03, 1.91; P=0.03).

To overcome the challenge of nucleic acid (NA) extraction and testing kit availability efficient method is urgently needed. Objectives: To establish an efficient, time and resource-saving and cost-effective methods, and to propose an ad hoc pooling approach for mass screening of SARS-CoV-2 Methods: Direct clinical sample and NA pooling approach was used for the standard reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test of the SARS CoV-2 targeting the envelop (E) and open reading frame (ORF1ab) genomic region of the virus. In this approach, experimental pools were created using SARS CoV-2 positive clinical samples spiked with up to 9 negative samples prior to NA extraction step to have a final extraction volume of 200L (maximum dilution factor of 10). Viral NA was also subsequently extracted from each pool and tested using the SARS CoV-2 RT-PCR assay. Results: We found that a single positive sample can be amplified and detected in pools of up to 7 samples depending on the ct value of the original sample, corresponding to high, medium, and low SARS CoV-2 viral copies\/reaction. However, to minimize false negativity of the assay with pooling strategies and with unknown false negativity rate of the assay under validation, we recommend poling of 4 in 1 using the standard protocols of the assay, reagents and equipment. The predictive algorithm indicated a pooling ratio of 4 in 1 was expected to retain accuracy of the test irrespective of the ct value (relative RNA copy number) of the sample spiked and result in a 237% increase in testing efficiency. Conclusions: The approaches showed its concept in easily customized and resource-saving manner and would allow expanding of current screening capacities and enable the expansion of detection in the community.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andargachew Mulu","author_inst":"Armauer Hansen Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Dawit Hailu Alemayehu","author_inst":"Armauer Hansen Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Fekadu Alemu","author_inst":"Armauer Hansen Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Dessalegn Abeje Tefera","author_inst":"Armauer Hansen Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Sinknesh Wolde","author_inst":"Armauer Hansen Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Gebeyehu Aseffa","author_inst":"Armauer Hansen Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Tamrayehu Seyoum","author_inst":"Armauer Hansen Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Meseret Habtamu","author_inst":"Armauer Hansen Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Alemseged Abdissa","author_inst":"Armauer Hansen Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Abebe Genetu Bayih","author_inst":"Armauer Hansen Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Getachew Tesfaye Beyene","author_inst":"Armauer Hansen Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Adrian Pratt","author_inst":"Principal BI Analyst Modelling and Analytics, NHS Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire CCG"},{"author_name":"Richard Wood","author_inst":"Head of Modelling and Analytics, NHS Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire CCG"},{"author_name":"Ellen Brooks-Pollock","author_inst":"Bristol Veterinary School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"},{"author_name":"Katherine M E Turner","author_inst":"Bristol Veterinary School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"genetic and genomic medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.05.20123299","rel_title":"Early administration of lopinavir\/ritonavir plus hydroxychloroquine does not alter the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection: a retrospective cohort study.","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.05.20123299","rel_abs":"Background The potential benefit of a combination therapy with lopinavir\/ritonavir (LPV\/r) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on COVID-19 has been speculated. We explored the effect of the timing of LPV\/r + HCQ initiation on the outcome of patients with COVID-19. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted on patients with COVID-19 who started treatment with LPV\/r plus HCQ between February 21 and March 20, 2020, at Luigi Sacco Hospital in Milan, Italy. Over time cumulative incidence of clinical improvement was compared between patients who started treatment less than 5 days from the onset of symptoms [early treatment group (ET)] and those who initiated it later [delayed treatment group (DT)]. The association of LPV\/r plus HCQ initiation timing on 30-day mortality was also assessed by univariate and multivariate logistic models. Results The study included 172 patients, prevalently males (72%) in their sixties, with a moderate (53.4%) or severe (34.9%) disease. Fourty-three (25%) patients were included in the ET group and and 129 (75%) in the DT group. Severity of disease did not significantly differ between the two groups. Conclusion Timing of LPV\/r + HCQ initiation seems to have no impact on COVID-19 clinical course in terms of improvement and 30-day mortality. These findings rise doubts on the clincial efficacy of this regimen.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrea Giacomelli","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco University Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Gabriele Pagani","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco University Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Anna Lisa Ridolfo","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco University Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alice Oreni","author_inst":"Luigi Sacco Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences DIBIC, University of Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Federico Conti","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco University Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Laura Pezzati","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco University Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Lucia Bradanini","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco University Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giacomo Casalini","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco University Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Simone Passerini","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco University Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Torre","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco University Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Massimo Cohen","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco University Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Guido Gubertini","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco University Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giuliano Rizzardini","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco University Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Chiara Cogliati","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Elisa Ceriani","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Riccardo Colombo","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Stefano Rusconi","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco University Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Cristina Gervasoni","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco University Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Dario Cattaneo","author_inst":"Luigi Sacco Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences DIBIC, University of Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Spinello Antinori","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco University Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco University Hospital, Milan, Italy"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.09.20122036","rel_title":"Differences in antibody kinetics and functionality between severe and mild SARS-CoV-2 infections.","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.09.20122036","rel_abs":"We determined and compared the humoral immune response in severe, hospitalized and mild, non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

Emergency department (ED) screening in symptomatic patients with normal vital signs is frequently limited to oro-nasopharyngeal swabs. We tested the null hypothesis that patients being screened for CoVid-19 in the ED with normal vital signs and without hypoxia would have a point-of-care lung ultrasound (LUS) consistent with CoVid-19 less than 2% of the time. Methods Subjects Subjects were identified from ED ultrasound logs. Inclusion criteria Age 14 years or older with symptoms prompting ED screening for CoVid-19. Exclusion criteria Known congestive heart failure or other chronic lung condition likely to cause excessive B lines on LUS. Intervention Structured blinded ultrasound review and chart review Analysis We used an exact hypothesis tests for binomial random variables. We also measured LUS diagnostic performance using computed tomography as the gold standard. Results We reviewed 77 charts; 62 met inclusion criteria. Vital signs were normal in 31 patients; 10 (32%) of these patients had LUS consistent with CoVid-19. We rejected the null hypothesis (p-value for bitest <0.001). The treating physicians' interpretation of their own point of care lung ultrasounds had a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 75%, 100%) and specificity of 80% (95% CI 68%, 89%).

Apart from providing actionable information to public health authorities on the trend of the pandemic, the daily incidence reflects the process of disease in a susceptible population and thus reflects the pathogenesis of COVID-19, the public health response and diagnosis and reporting. Both daily new cases and daily mortality data in the US exhibit periodic oscillatory patterns. By analyzing NYC and LA testing data, we demonstrate that this oscillation in the number of cases can be strongly explained by the daily variation in testing. This seems to rule out alternative hypotheses such as increased infections on certain days of the week as driving this oscillation. Similarly, we show that the apparent oscillation in mortality in the US data is mostly an artifact of reporting, which disappears in datasets that record death by episode date, such as the NYC and LA datasets. Periodic oscillations in COVID-19 incidence and mortality data reflect testing and reporting practices and contingencies. Thus, these contingencies should be considered first prior to suggesting social or biological mechanisms.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aviv Bergman","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yehonatan Sella","author_inst":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Peter Agre","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Arturo Casadevall","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Marcel van den Berge","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Admiral De Ruyter Hospital, 4462 RA Goes, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Jacobien Veenemans","author_inst":"Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, Admiral De Ruyter Hospital, 4462 RA Goes, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Joep Stohr","author_inst":"Microvida, location St. Elisabeth-Tweesteden Hospital, 5022 GC Tilburg, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Chantal Reusken","author_inst":"WHO COVID-19 Reference Laboratory, Center for Infectious Disease Control, National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), 3721 MA Bilthoven, Th"},{"author_name":"Pieter van der Pol","author_inst":"Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, Admiral De Ruyter Hospital, 4462 RA Goes, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Johan Reimerink","author_inst":"WHO COVID-19 Reference Laboratory, Center for Infectious Disease Control, National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), 3721 MA Bilthoven, Th"},{"author_name":"Massimo Cohen","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco University Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Guido Gubertini","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco University Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giuliano Rizzardini","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco University Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Chiara Cogliati","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Elisa Ceriani","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Riccardo Colombo","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Stefano Rusconi","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco University Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Cristina Gervasoni","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco University Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Dario Cattaneo","author_inst":"Luigi Sacco Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences DIBIC, University of Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Spinello Antinori","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco University Hospital, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Massimo Galli","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli-Sacco, Luigi Sacco University Hospital, Milan, Italy"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.09.20124008","rel_title":"An imperfect tool: COVID-19 'test & trace' success relies on minimising the impact of false negatives and continuation of physical distancing.","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.09.20124008","rel_abs":"The increasingly evident role of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission means testing is central to COVID-19 control, but test sensitivity estimates are low (around 65%).

There is a pressing need to adopt effective measures prevention and containment of in such settings. Design: Retrospective cohort study assessing the effect of enhanced surveillance and early preventative strategies and comparing outcomes for people with severe epilepsy and other comorbidities Setting: Three long-term care facilities: Chalfont Centre for Epilepsy (CCE), St. Elisabeth (STE), and The Meath (TM) with different models of primary and specialist care involvement, in the United Kingdom Participants: 286 long-term residents (age range 19-91 years), 740 carers who had been in contact with the residents during the observation period between 16 March and 05 June 2020. Interventions: Early preventative and infection control measures with identification and isolation of symptomatic cases, with additional enhanced surveillance and isolation of asymptomatic residents and carers at one site (CCE) Main outcome measures: Infection rate for SARS-CoV-2 among residents and carers, asymptomatic rate and case fatality rate, if available. Results: During a 12-week observation period, we identified 29 people (13 residents) who were SARS-CoV-2 positive with confirmed outbreaks amongst residents in two long-term care facilities (CCE, STE). At CCE, two out of 98 residents were symptomatic and tested positive, one of whom died. A further seven individuals testing positive on weekly enhanced surveillance had a completely asymptomatic course. One asymptomatic carer tested positive after contact with confirmed COVID-19 patients in another institution. Since 30 April 2020, during on-site weekly enhanced surveillance all 275 caregivers tested repeatedly negative. At STE, three out of 146 residents were symptomatic and tested positive, a fourth tested positive during hospital admission for symptoms not related to COVID-19. Since April 6, 2020, 105\/215 carers presenting with typical symptoms for COVID-19 were tested, of whom 15 tested positive. At TM, testing of symptomatic carers only started from early\/mid-April, whilst on-site testing, even of symptomatic residents, was not available until recently. During the observation period, eight of 80 residents were symptomatic but none was tested. Twenty-six of 250 carers were symptomatic and were tested, of whom two tested positive. Conclusions: Infection outbreaks in long-term care facilities for vulnerable people with epilepsy can be quickly contained, but only if asymptomatic cases are identified through enhanced surveillance at individual and care staff level. We observed a low rate of morbidity and mortality which confirmed that preventative measures with isolation of suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 can reduce resident-to-resident and reverse resident-to-carer transmission.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Simona Balestrini","author_inst":"UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"},{"author_name":"Matthias J Koepp","author_inst":"UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"},{"author_name":"Sonia Gandhi","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Hannah Rickman","author_inst":"UCLH"},{"author_name":"Gee Yen Shin","author_inst":"UCLH"},{"author_name":"Catherine Houlihan","author_inst":"UCLH"},{"author_name":"Jonny Anders-Cannon","author_inst":"Epilepsy Society"},{"author_name":"Katri Silvennoinen","author_inst":"UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"},{"author_name":"Fenglai Xiao","author_inst":"UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"},{"author_name":"Sara Zagaglia","author_inst":"UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"},{"author_name":"Kirsty Hudgell","author_inst":"St. Elizabeths Centre"},{"author_name":"Mariusz Ziomek","author_inst":"St Elizabeths Centre"},{"author_name":"Paul Haimes","author_inst":"St Elizabeths Centre"},{"author_name":"Adam Sampson","author_inst":"St Elizabeths Centre"},{"author_name":"Annie Parker","author_inst":"Meath Epilepsy Charity"},{"author_name":"J Helen Cross","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Rosemarie Pardington","author_inst":"Young Epilepsy"},{"author_name":"Eleni Nastouli","author_inst":"UCLH"},{"author_name":"Charles Swanton","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Josemir W Sander","author_inst":"UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Sisodiya","author_inst":"UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"neurology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.10.20122275","rel_title":"Predictors of household food insecurity in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.10.20122275","rel_abs":"Objective: To examine associations between sociodemographic and mental health characteristics with household food insecurity as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. Design: Cross-sectional online survey analyzed using univariable tests and a multivariable logistic regression model. Setting: The United States during the week of March 30, 2020. Participants: Convenience sample of 1,965 American adults using Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform. Participants reporting household food insecurity prior to the pandemic were excluded from analyses. Results: 1,517 participants reported household food security before the COVID-19 outbreak. Among this subset, 30% reported food insecurity after the COVID-19 outbreak, 53% were women and 72% were white. On multivariable analysis, race, income, relationship status, anxiety, and depression were significantly associated with incident household food insecurity. Black respondents, Hispanic\/Latino respondents, and respondents with annual income less than $100,000 were significantly more likely to experience incident household food insecurity. Individuals experiencing incident household food insecurity were 2.09 (95% CI 1.58-2.83) times more likely to screen positively for anxiety and 1.88 (95% CI 1.37-2.52) times more likely to screen positively for depression. Conclusions: Food insecurity due to the COVID-19 pandemic is common, and certain populations are particularly vulnerable. There are strong associations between food insecurity and anxiety\/depression. Public health interventions to increase the accessibility of healthful foods, especially for Black and Hispanic\/Latino communities, are crucial to relieving the economic stress of this pandemic.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brianna N Lauren","author_inst":"Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth R Silver","author_inst":"Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Adam S Faye","author_inst":"Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jennifer A Woo Baidal","author_inst":"Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Elissa M Ozanne","author_inst":"University of Utah School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chin Hur","author_inst":"Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jonny Anders-Cannon","author_inst":"Epilepsy Society"},{"author_name":"Katri Silvennoinen","author_inst":"UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"},{"author_name":"Fenglai Xiao","author_inst":"UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"},{"author_name":"Sara Zagaglia","author_inst":"UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"},{"author_name":"Kirsty Hudgell","author_inst":"St. Elizabeths Centre"},{"author_name":"Mariusz Ziomek","author_inst":"St Elizabeths Centre"},{"author_name":"Paul Haimes","author_inst":"St Elizabeths Centre"},{"author_name":"Adam Sampson","author_inst":"St Elizabeths Centre"},{"author_name":"Annie Parker","author_inst":"Meath Epilepsy Charity"},{"author_name":"J Helen Cross","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Rosemarie Pardington","author_inst":"Young Epilepsy"},{"author_name":"Eleni Nastouli","author_inst":"UCLH"},{"author_name":"Charles Swanton","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Josemir W Sander","author_inst":"UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Sisodiya","author_inst":"UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"nutrition"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.09.20124719","rel_title":"Kinetics of the humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2: comparative analytical performance of seven commercial serology tests","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.09.20124719","rel_abs":"Background SARS-CoV-2 serology tests are clinically useful to document a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with no or inconclusive PCR results and suspected COVID-19 disease or sequelae. Data are urgently needed to select the assays with optimal sensitivity at acceptable specificity. Methods A comparative analysis of analytical sensitivity was performed of seven commercial SARS-CoV-2 serology assays on 171 sera from 135 subjects with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, composed of 71 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia and 64 healthcare workers with paucisymptomatic infections. The kinetics of IgA\/IgM\/IgG seroconversion to viral N- and S-protein epitopes were studied from 0 to 54 days after symptom onset. Specificity was verified on 57 pre-pandemic samples. Results Wantai SARS-COV-2 Ab ELISA and Orient Gene COVID-19 IgG\/IgM Rapid Test achieved a superior overall sensitivity. Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay and EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 combined IgG\/IgA also showed acceptable sensitivity (>95%) versus the consensus result of all assays from 10 days post symptom onset. Optimal specificity (>98%) was achieved only by Wantai SARS-COV-2 Ab ELISA, Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay and Innovita 2019-nCoV Ab rapid test. LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1\/S2 IgG showed a significantly lower sensitivity as compared to all other assays.

Existing stochastic SIR models incorporate SSEs by fitting distributions with thin tails, or finite variance, and therefore predicting almost deterministic epidemiological outcomes in large populations. This paper documents evidence from recent coronavirus outbreaks, including SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, that SSEs follow a power law distribution with fat tails, or infinite variance. We then extend an otherwise standard SIR model with estimated power law distributions, and show that idiosyncratic uncertainties in SSEs will lead to large aggregate uncertainties in infection dynamics, even with large populations. That is, the timing and magnitude of outbreaks will be unpredictable. While such uncertainties have social costs, we also find that they on average decrease the herd immunity thresholds and the cumulative infections because per-period infection rates have decreasing marginal effects. Our findings have implications for social distancing interventions: targeting SSEs reduce not only the average rate of infection (R0) but also its uncertainty. To understand this effect, and to improve inference of the average reproduction numbers under fat tails, estimating the tail distribution of SSEs is vital.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Masao Fukui","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Chishio Furukawa","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Dieter De Smet","author_inst":"AZ Delta Medical Laboratories, AZ Delta General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Koen Swaerts","author_inst":"AZ Delta Medical Laboratories, AZ Delta General Hospital"},{"author_name":"An-Sofie Decavele","author_inst":"AZ Delta Medical Laboratories, AZ Delta General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chin Hur","author_inst":"Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jonny Anders-Cannon","author_inst":"Epilepsy Society"},{"author_name":"Katri Silvennoinen","author_inst":"UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"},{"author_name":"Fenglai Xiao","author_inst":"UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"},{"author_name":"Sara Zagaglia","author_inst":"UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"},{"author_name":"Kirsty Hudgell","author_inst":"St. Elizabeths Centre"},{"author_name":"Mariusz Ziomek","author_inst":"St Elizabeths Centre"},{"author_name":"Paul Haimes","author_inst":"St Elizabeths Centre"},{"author_name":"Adam Sampson","author_inst":"St Elizabeths Centre"},{"author_name":"Annie Parker","author_inst":"Meath Epilepsy Charity"},{"author_name":"J Helen Cross","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Rosemarie Pardington","author_inst":"Young Epilepsy"},{"author_name":"Eleni Nastouli","author_inst":"UCLH"},{"author_name":"Charles Swanton","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Josemir W Sander","author_inst":"UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Sisodiya","author_inst":"UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.05.20123448","rel_title":"The effectiveness of social bubbles as part of a Covid-19 lockdown exit strategy, a modelling study","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.05.20123448","rel_abs":"Background: During the Covid-19 lockdown, contact clustering in social bubbles may allow extending contacts beyond the household at minimal additional risk and hence has been considered as part of modified lockdown policy or a gradual lockdown exit strategy. We estimated the impact of such strategies on epidemic and mortality risk using the UK as a case study. Methods: We used an individual based model for a synthetic population similar to the UK, that is stratified into transmission risks from the community, within the household and from other households in the same social bubble. The base case considers a situation where non-essential shops and schools are closed, the secondary household attack rate is 20% and the initial reproduction number is 0.8. We simulate a number of strategies including variations of social bubbles, i.e. the forming of exclusive pairs of households, for particular subsets of households (households including children and single occupancy households), as well as for all households. We test the sensitivity of the results to a range of alternative model assumptions and parameters. Results: Clustering contacts outside the household into exclusive social bubbles is an effective strategy of increasing contacts while limiting some of the associated increase in epidemic risk. In the base case scenario social bubbles reduced cases and fatalities by 17% compared to an unclustered increase of contacts. We find that if all households were to form social bubbles the reproduction number would likely increase to 1.1 and therefore beyond the epidemic threshold of one. However, strategies that allow households with young children or single occupancy households to form social bubbles only increased the reproduction number by less than 10%. The corresponding increase in morbidity andmortality is proportional to the increase in the epidemic risk but is largely focussed in older adults independently of whether these are included in the social bubbles. Conclusions: Social bubbles can be an effective way of extending contacts beyond the household limiting the increase in epidemic risk, if managed appropriately.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Trystan Leng","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Connor White","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Joe Hilton","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Adam J Kucharski","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Pellis","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Helena Stage","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Nicholas G Davies","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Matt J Keeling","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Stefan Flasche","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Sara Zagaglia","author_inst":"UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"},{"author_name":"Kirsty Hudgell","author_inst":"St. Elizabeths Centre"},{"author_name":"Mariusz Ziomek","author_inst":"St Elizabeths Centre"},{"author_name":"Paul Haimes","author_inst":"St Elizabeths Centre"},{"author_name":"Adam Sampson","author_inst":"St Elizabeths Centre"},{"author_name":"Annie Parker","author_inst":"Meath Epilepsy Charity"},{"author_name":"J Helen Cross","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Rosemarie Pardington","author_inst":"Young Epilepsy"},{"author_name":"Eleni Nastouli","author_inst":"UCLH"},{"author_name":"Charles Swanton","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Josemir W Sander","author_inst":"UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Sisodiya","author_inst":"UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.08.20124297","rel_title":"Disproportionate COVID-19 Related Mortality Amongst African Americans in Four Southern States in the United States","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.08.20124297","rel_abs":"Background African Americans have been severely affected by COVID-19 noted with the rising mortality rates within the African American community. Health disparities, health inequities and issues with systemic health access are some of the pre-existing issues African Americans were subjected to within the southern states in the United States. Second, social distancing is a critical non-pharmacological intervention to reduce the spread of COVID-19. However, social distancing was not practical and presented a challenge within the African American community, specifically, in the southern states. Objective This article assesses the effect of COVID-19 on African Americans in the southern states. Methodology This short communication queried the publicly available Department of Health statistics on COVID-19 related mortality and underlying health conditions in four southern states (Alabama [AL], Georgia [GA], Louisiana [LA] and Mississippi [MS]) with a high proportion of African American residents. Second, the unacast COVID-19 toolkit was used to derive a social distancing (SD) grade for any given state, based on three different metrics: (i) percent change in average distance travelled (ii) percent change in non-essential visits and (iii) decrease in human encounters (compared to national baseline). Results Across the four states, on average, as many as 54% of COVID-19 related deaths are in the African American community, although this minority group comprises only 32% of the population cumulatively. This article finds that all four southern states received a social distancing grade of F. COVID-19 have demonstrated that adverse outcomes are higher in individuals with underlying health conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, or pre-existing pulmonary compromise. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed racial disparities in our healthcare system that disproportionately impacts African Americans within the four states of the southern United States. In addition, the lack of diversity in the healthcare system likely impacts this disproportionate impact on African American communities because it is not able to address its primary obligations within minority communities. Recognizing that there is a great need for African American representation or diversity in the health workforce would be able to better address the health disparities.

Methods: We calculate the probability of a confirmed infection, hospitalization, and death resulting from a county-level person-contact using available data on current case incidence, secondary attack rates, infectious periods, asymptomatic infections, and ratios of confirmed infections to hospitalizations and fatalities. Results: Among US counties with populations greater than 500,000 people, during the week ending June 13,2020, the median estimate of the county level probability of a confirmed infection is 1 infection in 40,500 person contacts (Range: 10,100 to 586,000). For a 50 to 64 year-old individual, the median estimate of the county level probability of a hospitalization is 1 in 709,000 person contacts (Range: 177,000 to 10,200,000) and the median estimate of the county level probability of a fatality is 1 in 6,670,000 person contacts (Range 1,680,000 to 97,600.000). Conclusions and Relevance: Estimates of the individual probabilities of COVID19 infection, hospitalization and death vary widely but may not align with public risk perceptions. Systematically collected and publicly reported data on infection incidence by, for example, the setting of exposure, type of residence and occupation would allow more precise estimates of probabilities than possible with currently available public data. Calculation of secondary attack rates by setting and better measures of the prevalence of seropositivity would further improve those estimates.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rajiv Bhatia","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Klausner","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Joe Hilton","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Adam J Kucharski","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Pellis","author_inst":"The University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Helena Stage","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Nicholas G Davies","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Matt J Keeling","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Stefan Flasche","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Sara Zagaglia","author_inst":"UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"},{"author_name":"Kirsty Hudgell","author_inst":"St. Elizabeths Centre"},{"author_name":"Mariusz Ziomek","author_inst":"St Elizabeths Centre"},{"author_name":"Paul Haimes","author_inst":"St Elizabeths Centre"},{"author_name":"Adam Sampson","author_inst":"St Elizabeths Centre"},{"author_name":"Annie Parker","author_inst":"Meath Epilepsy Charity"},{"author_name":"J Helen Cross","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Rosemarie Pardington","author_inst":"Young Epilepsy"},{"author_name":"Eleni Nastouli","author_inst":"UCLH"},{"author_name":"Charles Swanton","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Josemir W Sander","author_inst":"UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Sisodiya","author_inst":"UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.08.20124453","rel_title":"Jinhua Qinggan granule, a Chinese herbal medicine against COVID-19, induces rapid changes in the plasma levels of IL-6 and IFN-\u03b3","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.08.20124453","rel_abs":"Background: Currently, effective vaccines or specific therapeutic agents against COVID-19 are not available. However, in China, traditional Chinese herbal medicines have provided therapeutic benefit to patients with COVID-19. Jinhua Qinggan granule (JHQGG) is a Chinese multi-herbal formula previously developed for the treatment of H1N1 influenza and has been encouraged for patients clinically suspected of COVID-19 during medical observation. However, the immunological mechanism for the efficacy of JHQGG has not been confirmed. Objectives: We thus examined whether the administration of JHQGG affects hematological and immunological measures in healthy individuals. Method: We enrolled 18 healthy volunteers, all of whom tested negative for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Peripheral blood samples were collected 1 h after oral administration of JHQGG and subjected to hematological, biochemical, and cytokine tests. Results: JHQGG rapidly induced a significant decrease in the plasma level of IL-6 and an increase in the plasma level of IFN-{gamma}. Conclusions: Our finding suggests that the therapeutic efficacy of JHQGG against COVID-19 is, in part, associated with its rapid immunomodulatory activity.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yasunari Kageyama","author_inst":"Takanawa Clinic"},{"author_name":"Koichi Aida","author_inst":"Takanawa Clinic"},{"author_name":"Kimihiko Kawauchi","author_inst":"Takanawa Clinic"},{"author_name":"Masafumi Morimoto","author_inst":"Takanawa Clinic"},{"author_name":"Tomoka Ebisui","author_inst":"Takanawa Clinic"},{"author_name":"Tetsu Akiyama","author_inst":"Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, The University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Tsutomu Nakamura","author_inst":"Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, The University of Tokyo"},{"author_name":"Matt J Keeling","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Stefan Flasche","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Sara Zagaglia","author_inst":"UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"},{"author_name":"Kirsty Hudgell","author_inst":"St. Elizabeths Centre"},{"author_name":"Mariusz Ziomek","author_inst":"St Elizabeths Centre"},{"author_name":"Paul Haimes","author_inst":"St Elizabeths Centre"},{"author_name":"Adam Sampson","author_inst":"St Elizabeths Centre"},{"author_name":"Annie Parker","author_inst":"Meath Epilepsy Charity"},{"author_name":"J Helen Cross","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Rosemarie Pardington","author_inst":"Young Epilepsy"},{"author_name":"Eleni Nastouli","author_inst":"UCLH"},{"author_name":"Charles Swanton","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Josemir W Sander","author_inst":"UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"},{"author_name":"Sanjay Sisodiya","author_inst":"UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.11.20125799","rel_title":"The arrival and spread of SARS-CoV2 in Colombia","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.11.20125799","rel_abs":"We performed phylogenomic analysis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2) from 88 infected individuals across different regions of Colombia.

This study aims at analyzing clinical presentation on admission and the determinants associated with direct admission or transfer to intensive care units (ICUs) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Patients and Methods: In this prospective hospital-based study, socio-demographic, clinical and biological characteristics, on admission, of adult COVID-19 hospitalized patients were prospectively collected and analyzed. The outcome was admission\/transfer to intensive care units compared with total hospital stay in medical wards according to patient characteristics. Results: Of the 412 patients included, 325 were discharged and 87 died in hospital. Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of admission\/transfer to ICUs with male gender (OR, 1.99 [95%CI, 1.07-3.73]), temperature (OR, 1.37 [95% CI, 1.01-1.88] per degree Celsius increase), abnormal lung auscultation on admission (OR, 2.62 [95% CI, 1.40-4.90]), elevated level of CRP (OR, 6.96 [95% CI, 1.45-33.35 for CRP>100mg\/L vs CRP<10mg\/L). Increased time was observed between symptom onset and hospital admission (OR, 4.82 [95% CI, 1.61-14.43] for time >10 days vs time <3 days) and monocytopenia (OR, 2.49 [95% CI, 1.29-4.82]). Monocytosis was associated with lower risk of admission\/transfer to ICUs (OR, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.05-1.13]). Conclusions: Clinical and biological features on admission and time until admission were associated with admission to ICUs. Signs to predict worsening on admission could be partially associated with the time until admission. This finding reinforces the need for appropriate guidelines to manage COVID-19 patients in this time window.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Philippe Vanhems","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Marie-Paule Gustin","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Christelle ELIAS","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Laetitia HENAFF","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Cedric DANANCHE","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Beatrice GRISI","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Elodie MUNIER-MARION","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Nagham KHANAFER","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Delphine HILLIQUIN","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Sophie GARDES","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Solweig GERBIER-COLOMBAN","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Selilah AMOUR","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta KUCZEWSKI","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Vanessa ESCURET","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Bruno LINA","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Mitra SAADATIAN-ELAHI","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Anibal Teheran","author_inst":"Fundacion Universitaria Juan N Corpas"},{"author_name":"Ana Gonzalez-Reiche","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Matthew Hernandez","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicina at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Emilia Sordillo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Viviana Simon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Harm van Bakel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alberto Paniz-Mondolfi","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.10.20125013","rel_title":"Successful contact tracing systems for COVID-19 rely on effective quarantine and isolation","rel_date":"2020-06-12","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.10.20125013","rel_abs":"Background. Test, trace and isolate are the three crucial components of the response to COVID-19 identified by the World Health Organisation. Mathematical models of contact tracing often over-simplify the ability of traced contacts to quarantine or isolate. Method. We use an age-structured branching process model of individual disease transmission combined with a detailed model of symptom onset, testing, contact quarantine and case isolation to model each aspect of the test, trace, isolate strategy. We estimated the effective reproduction number under a range of scenarios to understand the importance of each aspect of the system. Findings. People's ability to quarantine and isolate effectively is a crucial component of a successful contact tracing system. 80% of cases need to be quarantined or isolated within 4 days of quarantine or isolation of index case to be confident the contact tracing system is effective. Interpretation. Provision of universal support systems to enable people to quarantine and isolate effectively, coupled with investment in trained public health professionals to undertake contact tracing, are crucial to success. We predict that a high-quality, rapid contact tracing system with strong support structures in place, combined with moderate social distancing measures, is required to contain the spread of COVID-19.
