Studies of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein receptor binding domain suggest that infection requires binding to HS and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in a codependent manner. Here, we show that commensal host bacterial communities can modify HS and thereby modulate SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding and that these communities change with host age and sex. Common human-associated commensal bacteria whose genomes encode HS-modifying enzymes were identified. The prevalence of these bacteria and the expression of key microbial glycosidases in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was lower in adult COVID-19 patients than in healthy controls. The presence of HS-modifying bacteria decreased with age in two large survey datasets, FINRISK 2002 and American Gut, revealing one possible mechanism for the observed increase in COVID-19 susceptibility with age. In vitro, bacterial glycosidases from unpurified culture media supernatants fully blocked SARS-CoV-2 spike binding to human H1299 protein lung adenocarcinoma cells. HS-modifying bacteria in human microbial communities may regulate viral adhesion, and loss of these commensals could predispose individuals to infection. Understanding the impact of shifts in microbial community composition and bacterial lyases on SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to new therapeutics and diagnosis of susceptibility.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=136 SRC=\"FIGDIR\/small\/238444v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14ff1ecorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@193d84corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15d6f9eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14b16c6_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical Abstract.

While rich biological knowledge exists for SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV), integrating this knowledge is difficult and time consuming, since much of it is in siloed databases or in textual format. Furthermore, the data required by the research community varies drastically for different tasks - the optimal data for a machine learning task, for example, is much different from the data used to populate a browsable user interface for clinicians. To address these challenges, we created KG-COVID-19, a flexible framework that ingests and integrates biomedical data to produce knowledge graphs (KGs) for COVID-19 response. This KG framework can also be applied to other problems in which siloed biomedical data must be quickly integrated for different research applications, including future pandemics.\n\nBIGGER PICTUREAn effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic relies on integration of many different types of data available about SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses.

Whether this affected heart disease deaths is unknown. Objective: To determine whether changes in heart disease deaths occurred during the early pandemic period in the US, we analyzed areas without large COVID-19 outbreaks. This isolated the effect of decreased healthcare-seeking behavior during the early outbreak. Design, Setting, and Participants: We performed an observational study of heart disease-specific mortality using National Center for Health Statistics data (NCHS). Weekly provisional counts were disaggregated by jurisdiction of occurrence during 2019 and 2020 for all-cause deaths, COVID-19 deaths, and heart disease deaths. For the primary analysis, jurisdictions were included if; 1) There was no all-cause excess mortality during the early pandemic period (weeks 14-17, 2020); 2) The completeness of that data was estimated by NCHS to be >97% as of July 22, 2020, and; 3) Decreases in emergency department (ED) visits occurred during the study period. We compared heart disease death rates during the early pandemic period with corresponding weeks in 2019 and a pre-pandemic control period of 2020 as a sensitivity analysis. Incident rate and rate ratios were calculated. Exposure: The US COVID-19 outbreak. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incidence of heart disease deaths. Results: Twelve states met the primary inclusion criteria, capturing 747,375,188 person-weeks for the early pandemic period and 740,987,984 person-weeks for the 2019 control period. The mean incidence rate (per 100,000 person-weeks) for heart disease in states without excess deaths during the early pandemic period was 3.95 (95% CI 3.83 to 4.06) versus 4.19 (95% CI 4.14 to 4.23) during the corresponding period in 2019. The incident rate ratio (2020\/2019) was 0.91 (95% CI 0.87 to 0.97). No state recorded an increase from either the corresponding period in 2019 or the 2020 pre-pandemic control period. Two states recorded fewer heart disease deaths. Conclusions and Relevance: This observational study found a decrease in heart disease deaths during the early US outbreak in regions without significant COVID-19 burdens, despite decreases in ED utilization. Long term follow-up data are needed.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jeremy Samuel Faust","author_inst":"Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Zhenqiu Lin","author_inst":"Yale New Haven Hospital, Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation"},{"author_name":"Kalen N.

Here we show significantly enriched CD71+ erythroid precursors\/progenitors in the blood circulation of COVID-19 patients that have distinctive immunosuppressive properties. A subpopulation of abundant erythroid cells, CD45+CD71+cells, co-express ACE2, TMPRSS2, CD147, CD26 and these can be infected with SARS-CoV-2. In turn, pre-treatment of erythroid cells with dexamethasone significantly diminished ACE2\/TMPRSS2 expression and subsequently reduced their infectivity with SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, pathological abundance of erythroid cells might reflect stress erythropoiesis due to the invasion of erythroid progenitors by SARS-CoV-2.

AMP immunogens are efficiently delivered to lymph nodes, where innate and adaptive immune responses are generated. Compared to alum, AMP immunization induced >25-fold higher antigen-specific T cells which produced multiple Th1 cytokines and trafficked into lung parenchyma and respiratory secretions. Antibody responses favored Th1 isotypes (IgG2bc, IgG3) and potently neutralized Spike-2-ACE2 receptor binding, with titers 265-fold higher than the natural immune response from convalescent COVID-19 patients; responses were maintained despite 10-fold dose-reduction in Spike antigen. Both cellular and humoral immune responses were preserved in aged mice.

In the present study, we performed indepth proteome profiling of undepleted plasma from eight COVID-19 patients. Quantitative proteomic analysis using the BoxCar method revealed that 91 out of 1,222 quantified proteins were differentially expressed depending on the severity of COVID-19. Importantly, we found 76 proteins, previously not reported, which could be novel prognostic biomarker candidates. Our plasma proteome signatures captured the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, thereby highlighting the role of neutrophil activation, complement activation, platelet function, and T cell suppression as well as proinflammatory factors upstream and downstream of interleukin-6, interleukin-1B, and tumor necrosis factor.

However, most evidence comes from single-round pseudoparticle infection of cells artificially overexpressing IFITMs. Here, we confirmed that overexpression of IFITMs blocks pseudoparticle infections mediated by the Spike proteins of {beta}-coronaviruses including pandemic SARS-CoV-2. In striking contrast, however, endogenous IFITM expression promoted genuine SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung cells both in the presence and absence of interferon. IFITM2 was most critical for efficient entry of SARS-CoV-2 and enhanced virus production from Calu-3 cells by several orders of magnitude. IFITMs are expressed and further induced by interferons in the lung representing the primary site of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as in other relevant tissues. Our finding that IFITMs enhance SARS-CoV-2 infection under conditions approximating the in vivo situation shows that they may promote viral invasion during COVID-19.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIOverexpression of IFITM1, 2 and 3 restricts SARS-CoV-2 infection\nC_LIO_LIEndogenous IFITM1, 2 and 3 boost SARS-CoV-2 infection of human lung cells\nC_LIO_LIIFITM2 is critical for efficient entry of SARS-CoV-2 in Calu-3 cells\nC_LI","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Caterina Prelli Bozzo","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Virology Ulm, University Medical Centre, 89081 Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Rayhane Nchioua","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Virology Ulm, University Medical Centre, 89081 Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Meta Volcic","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Virology Ulm, University Medical Centre, 89081 Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Lukas Wettstein","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Virology Ulm, University Medical Centre, 89081 Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Tatjana Weil","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Virology Ulm, University Medical Centre, 89081 Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jana Krueger","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine I, Ulm University Medical Centre, 89081 Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Sandra Heller","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine I, Ulm University Medical Centre, 89081 Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Carina Conzelmann","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Virology Ulm, University Medical Centre, 89081 Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Janis A Mueller","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Virology Ulm, University Medical Centre, 89081 Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ruediger Gross","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Virology Ulm, University Medical Centre, 89081 Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Fabian Zech","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Virology Ulm, University Medical Centre, 89081 Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Desiree Schuetz","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Virology Ulm, University Medical Centre, 89081 Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Lennart Koepke","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Virology Ulm, University Medical Centre, 89081 Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Christina Martina Stuerzel","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Virology Ulm, University Medical Centre, 89081 Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Christiane Schueler","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Campus Charite Mitte, Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, 10117 Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Saskia Stenzel","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Campus Charite Mitte, Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, 10117 Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Braun","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Virology Ulm, University Medical Centre, 89081 Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Johanna Weiss","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Virology Ulm, University Medical Centre, 89081 Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Daniel Sauter","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Virology Ulm, University Medical Centre, 89081 Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jan Muench","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Virology Ulm, University Medical Centre, 89081 Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Steffen Stenger","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, Ulm University Medical Centre, 89081 Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Kei Sato","author_inst":"Laboratory of Systems Virology, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan."},{"author_name":"Alexander Kleger","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine I, Ulm University Medical Centre, 89081 Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Christine Goffinet","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Campus Charite Mitte, Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, 10117 Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Konstantin Maria Johannes Sparrer","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Virology Ulm, University Medical Centre, 89081 Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Frank Kirchhoff","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Virology Ulm, University Medical Centre, 89081 Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Austin D.

Moreover, human whey protein inhibited infectious virus production proved by the plaque assay. We found that whey protein from different species such as cow and goat also showed anti-coronavirus properties. And commercial bovine milk also showed similar activity. Interestingly, the main antimicrobial components of breastmilk, such as Lactoferrin and IgA antibody, showed limited anti-coronavirus activity, indicating that other factors of breastmilk may play the important anti-coronavirus role. Taken together, we reported that whey protein inhibits SARS-CoV-2 and its related virus of GX_P2V. These results rule out whey protein as a direct-acting inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 and GX_P2V infection and replication and further investigation of its molecular mechanism of action in the context of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Huahao Fan","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Yuqian Luo","author_inst":"Nanjing University Medical School"},{"author_name":"Bixia Hong","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Liqin Wang","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Xiangshu Jin","author_inst":"Peking University Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Yangzhen Chen","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Yunjia Hu","author_inst":"Beijing University of Chemical Technology"},{"author_name":"Tong Li","author_inst":"Peking University Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Hui Zhuang","author_inst":"Peking University Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Yi-Hua Zhou","author_inst":"Nanjing University Medical School"},{"author_name":"Yi-Gang Tong","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing 100071, P.

Initial indications of selective advantage of specific mutations can be obtained from calculating their frequencies across viral strains. By applying modelling approaches, we provide additional information that is not evident from standard statistics or mutation frequencies alone. We therefore, propose a more precise way of selecting informative mutations. We highlight two interesting mutations found in genes N (P13L) and ORF3a (Q57H). The former appears to be significantly associated with decreased deaths and cases per million according to our models, while the latter shows an opposing association with decreased deaths and increased cases per million.

To decipher any correlation between SARS-CoV-2 evolution and its epidemiology in India, we studied the mutational diversity of spike glycoprotein, the key player for the attachment, fusion and entry of virus to the host cell. For this, we analyzed the sequences of 630 Indian isolates as available in GISAID database till June 07, 2020, and detected the spike protein variants to emerge from two major ancestors - Wuhan-Hu-1\/2019 and its D614G variant. Average stability of the docked spike protein - host receptor (S-R) complexes for these variants correlated strongly (R2=0.96) with the fatality rates across Indian states. However, while more than half of the variants were found unique to India, 67% of all variants showed lower stability of S-R complex than the respective ancestral variants, indicating a possible fitness loss in recently emerged variants, despite a continuous increase in mutation rate. These results conform to the sharply declining fatality rate countrywide (>7-fold during April 11 - June 28, 2020). Altogether, while we propose the potential of S-R complex stability to track disease severity, we urge an immediate need to explore if SARS-CoV-2 is approaching mutational meltdown in India.\n\nSignificanceEpidemiological features are intricately linked to evolutionary diversity of rapidly evolving pathogens, and SARS-CoV-2 is no exception. Our work suggests the potential of average stability of complexes formed by the circulating spike mutational variants and the human host receptor to track the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a given region. In India, the stability of these complexes for recent variants tend to decrease relative to their ancestral ones, following countrywide declining fatality rate, in contrast to an increasing mutation rate. We hypothesize such a scenario as nascent footprints of Mullers ratchet, proposing large-scale population genomics study for its validation, since this understanding could lead to therapeutic approaches for facilitating mutational meltdown of SARS-CoV-2, as experienced earlier for influenza A virus.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rachana Banerjee","author_inst":"JIS Institute of Advanced Studies and Research Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Kausik Basak","author_inst":"JIS Institute of Advanced Studies and Research Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Anamika Ghosh","author_inst":"JIS Institute of Advanced Studies and Research Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Vyshakh Rajachandran","author_inst":"JIS Institute of Advanced Studies and Research Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Kamakshi Sureka","author_inst":"JIS Institute of Advanced Studies and Research Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Debabani Ganguly","author_inst":"JIS Institute of Advanced Studies and Research Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Sujay Chattopadhyay","author_inst":"JIS Institute of Advanced Studies & Research Kolkata"},{"author_name":"George M Spyrou","author_inst":"The Cyprus Institute of Neurology and Genetics"},{"author_name":"Hui Zhuang","author_inst":"Peking University Health Science Center"},{"author_name":"Yi-Hua Zhou","author_inst":"Nanjing University Medical School"},{"author_name":"Yi-Gang Tong","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Beijing 100071, P.

Here, using single cell RNA-seq, we characterized the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from uninfected controls and COVID-19 patients, and cells in paired broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF). We found a close association of decreased dendritic cells (DC) and increased monocytes resembling myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) which correlated with lymphopenia and inflammation in the blood of severe COVID-19 patients. Those MDSC-like monocytes were immune-paralyzed. In contrast, monocyte-macrophages in BALFs of COVID-19 patients produced massive amounts of cytokines and chemokines, but secreted little interferons. The frequencies of peripheral T cells and NK cells were significantly decreased in severe COVID-19 patients, especially for innate-like T and various CD8+ T cell subsets, compared to health controls. In contrast, the proportions of various activated CD4+ T cell subsets, including Th1, Th2 and Th17-like cells were increased and more clonally expanded in severe COVID-19 patients. Patients' peripheral T cells showed no sign of exhaustion or augmented cell death, whereas T cells in BALFs produced higher levels of IFNG, TNF, CCL4 and CCL5 etc. Paired TCR tracking indicated abundant recruitment of peripheral T cells to the patients' lung. Together, this study comprehensively depicts how the immune cell landscape is perturbed in severe COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gang Xu","author_inst":"shenzhen third people's hospital"},{"author_name":"Furong Qi","author_inst":"shenzhen third people's hospital"},{"author_name":"Hanjie Li","author_inst":"Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology"},{"author_name":"Qianting Yang","author_inst":"shenzhen third people's hospital"},{"author_name":"Haiyan Wang","author_inst":"shenzhen third people's hospital"},{"author_name":"Xin Wang","author_inst":"shenzhen third people's hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiaoju Liu","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Juanjuan Zhao","author_inst":"shenzhen third people's hospital"},{"author_name":"Xuejiao Liao","author_inst":"shenzhen third people's hospital"},{"author_name":"Yang Liu","author_inst":"Institute for Hepatology"},{"author_name":"Ido Amit","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"shenzhen third people's hospital"},{"author_name":"Shuye Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Hepatology,Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christiane Schueler","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Campus Charite Mitte, Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, 10117 Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Saskia Stenzel","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Campus Charite Mitte, Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, 10117 Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Braun","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Virology Ulm, University Medical Centre, 89081 Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Johanna Weiss","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Virology Ulm, University Medical Centre, 89081 Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Daniel Sauter","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Virology Ulm, University Medical Centre, 89081 Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jan Muench","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Virology Ulm, University Medical Centre, 89081 Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Steffen Stenger","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, Ulm University Medical Centre, 89081 Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Kei Sato","author_inst":"Laboratory of Systems Virology, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan."},{"author_name":"Alexander Kleger","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine I, Ulm University Medical Centre, 89081 Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Christine Goffinet","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Campus Charite Mitte, Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, 10117 Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Konstantin Maria Johannes Sparrer","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Virology Ulm, University Medical Centre, 89081 Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Frank Kirchhoff","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Virology Ulm, University Medical Centre, 89081 Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Austin D.

Many international guidelines have put forward various measures to control the spread and, using various quality masks seems to be the most important amongst them. This was a cross-sectional pilot study to see any alterations in the bacterial flora of the nasal and the oropharyngeal (OP) microbiota with the use of medical masks over prolonged periods during this COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: Nasal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected using proper international guidelines from 30 healthy healthcare workers matching pre-set inclusion criteria, who gave written informed consent. The swabs were used for gram stain as well as culture and sensitivity analysis using standard methods. Results: In general, we found that the oropharyngeal microflora harboured a more diverse population of bacteria (n=13) than the nasal microflora (n=5). The predominant bacterial flora was found to Staphylococcus epidermidis in the nasal cavity and Streptococcus viridans in the oropharyngeal cavity. There was no growth in 8 (26.68%) samples of oropharynx and 3 (10%) of nasal samples, with one patient having no growth in both the samples. The commonest resistant antibiotic from both the cavity cultures was benzylpenicillin (nasal flora 80% and OP flora 47.37%). Conclusion: This small pilot study has shown a reassuring aspect of no change in the typical bacterial microflora species of the nasal and OP cavity with prolonged use of medical masks. This is the first study to show this convincing evidence during the COVID-19 outbreak and also in healthy healthcare workers who have to wear masks over long durations.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sayak Roy","author_inst":"Medica Superspeciality Hospital"},{"author_name":"Pampi Majumder","author_inst":"Suraksha Diagnostic Pvt.

Hospital admissions mitigate positive sampling bias in PCR tests since these were limited in numbers initially. Additionally, their intent was as a diagnostic rather than a surveying tool. By September 17, the United States' cumulative recovered population is estimated at 45% or 149 million. The remaining susceptible population is 55%, or 50%, excepting the currently infected 5% population. The estimated mortality rate of the cumulative total affected population is 0.13% death. States have followed diverse epidemic time courses. New Jersey and New York show SARS-CoV-2 prevalence of 95% and 82%, respectively. Likewise, each state exhibits relatively low current positive PCR results at 1.2 % and 0.8%. Also, these states show about twice the mortality rate of the nation. By comparison, Florida, California, and Texas showed recovered populations percent around 50%, and higher current PCR positive test results ranging from 5% to 9%. This novel approach provides an improved source of information on the pandemic's full-time course in terms of precision and accuracy in contrast to serological testing, which only views a narrow time slice of its history due to the transient nature of the antibody response and its graduated expression dependency on the severity of the disease. The deficiency of serological testing to estimate the recovered population is made even more acute due to the large proportion of asymptomatic and sub-clinical cases in the COVID-19 pandemic (2,3). T-cell testing, reputedly capable of long-term detection of previously infected individuals, will provide a complete view of the recovered population when it becomes available for large scale use. This New Hospital Admission based method informs a more effective and efficient deployment of a vaccination program since it provides not only a reliable estimate of the susceptible population by state, but it can also provide visibility down to the county level based on COVID-19 hospitalization record independent of PCR testing.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jose E Gonzalez","author_inst":"Aletheia Analytics LLC"},{"author_name":"Pampi Majumder","author_inst":"Suraksha Diagnostic Pvt.

This study aimed to perform a time series analysis on the association between climate factors and daily cases of COVID-19 in Malaysia up to 15 July 2020. The second objective was to predict daily new cases using a forecasting technique. To address within-country variations, the analysis was extended to the state level with Sarawak state as an example. Methodology\/Principal Findings Datasets on the daily confirmed cases and climate variables in Malaysia and Sarawak state were obtained from publicly accessible official websites. A descriptive analysis was performed to characterize all the important variables over the study period. An autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was introduced using daily cases as the dependent variable and climate parameters as the explanatory variables. For Malaysia, the findings suggest that, ceteris paribus, the number of COVID-19 cases decreased with increasing average temperature (p=0.003) or wind speed (p=0.029). However, none of the climate parameters showed a significant relationship with the number of COVID-19 cases in Sarawak state. Forecasts from the ARIMA models showed that new daily COVID-19 cases had already reached the outbreak level and a decreasing trend in both settings. Holding other parameters constant, a small number of new cases (approximately a single digit) is a probable second wave in Sarawak state, Conclusions\/Significance The findings suggest that climate parameters and forecasts are helpful for reducing the uncertainty in the severity of future COVID-19 transmission. A highlight is that forecasts will be a useful tool for making decisions and taking the appropriate interventions to contain the spread of the virus in the community.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cho Naing","author_inst":"International Medical University"},{"author_name":"Han Ni","author_inst":"SEGi University, Sibu Clinical Campus, Sarawak, Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Htar Htar Aung","author_inst":"International Medical University"},{"author_name":"Elaine Chan Wan Ling","author_inst":"International Medical University"},{"author_name":"Joon Wah Mak","author_inst":"International Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xin Wang","author_inst":"shenzhen third people's hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiaoju Liu","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Juanjuan Zhao","author_inst":"shenzhen third people's hospital"},{"author_name":"Xuejiao Liao","author_inst":"shenzhen third people's hospital"},{"author_name":"Yang Liu","author_inst":"Institute for Hepatology"},{"author_name":"Ido Amit","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"shenzhen third people's hospital"},{"author_name":"Shuye Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Hepatology,Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christiane Schueler","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Campus Charite Mitte, Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, 10117 Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Saskia Stenzel","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Campus Charite Mitte, Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, 10117 Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Braun","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Virology Ulm, University Medical Centre, 89081 Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Johanna Weiss","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Virology Ulm, University Medical Centre, 89081 Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Daniel Sauter","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Virology Ulm, University Medical Centre, 89081 Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jan Muench","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Virology Ulm, University Medical Centre, 89081 Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Steffen Stenger","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, Ulm University Medical Centre, 89081 Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Kei Sato","author_inst":"Laboratory of Systems Virology, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan."},{"author_name":"Alexander Kleger","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine I, Ulm University Medical Centre, 89081 Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Christine Goffinet","author_inst":"Institute of Virology, Campus Charite Mitte, Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, 10117 Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Konstantin Maria Johannes Sparrer","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Virology Ulm, University Medical Centre, 89081 Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Frank Kirchhoff","author_inst":"Institute for Molecular Virology Ulm, University Medical Centre, 89081 Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Austin D.

Our objective was to perform case detection of an entire rural community to quantify SARS-CoV-2 transmission using PCR and antibody testing. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of the prevalence and cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the rural town of Bolinas, California (population 1,620), four weeks following shelter-in-place orders. Residents and county essential workers were tested between April 20th-24th, 2020. Prevalence by PCR and seroprevalence combining data from two forms of antibody testing were performed in parallel (Abbott ARCHITECT IgG to nucleocapsid protein and in-house IgG ELISA to the receptor binding domain). Results: Of 1,891 participants, 1,312 were confirmed Bolinas residents (>80% community ascertainment). Zero participants were PCR positive. Assuming 80% sensitivity, it would have been unlikely to observe these results (p<0.05) if there were >3 active infections in the community. Based on antibody results, estimated prevalence of prior infection was 0.16% (95% CrI: 0.02%, 0.46%). Seroprevalence estimates using only one of the two tests would have been higher, with greater uncertainty. The positive predictive value (PPV) of a positive result on both tests was 99.11% (95% CrI: 95.75%, 99.94%), compared to PPV 44.19%-63.32% (95% CrI range 3.25%-98.64%) if only one test was utilized. Conclusions: Four weeks following shelter-in-place, active and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in a rural Northern California community was extremely rare. In this low prevalence setting, use of two antibody tests increased the PPV and precision of seroprevalence estimates.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ayesha Appa","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Saki Takahashi","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Isabel Rodriguez-Barraquer","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Chamie","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Aenor Sawyer","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"- CLIAHUB Consortium","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Elias Duarte","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Jill Hakim","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Keirstinne Turcios","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Joanna Vinden","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Owen Janson","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Aashish Manglik","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Michael J.

Severely ill patients developed significantly higher SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses than outpatients and asymptomatic individuals. The development of plasma antibodies was correlated with decreases in viral RNAemia, consistent with potential humoral immune clearance of virus. Using a novel competition ELISA, we detected antibodies blocking RBD-ACE2 interactions in 68% of inpatients and 40% of outpatients tested. Cross-reactive antibodies recognizing SARS-CoV RBD were found almost exclusively in hospitalized patients.

Nonetheless, exact association and contribution of particular cytokines towards COVID-19 pathology remains poorly understood. This study performed a comprehensive meta-analysis to establish association between induced cytokines and COVID-19 disease severity to help in prognosis and clinical management. Methods: Scientific literature was searched to identify 18 clinical studies. Standardized mean difference (SMD) for cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF- and IFN-{gamma} between severe and non-severe COVID-19 patient groups were summarized using random effects model. A classifier was built using logistic regression model with cytokines having significant SMD as covariates. Results: Out of the 6 cytokines, IL-6 and IL-10 showed statistically significant SMD across the studies synthesized. Classifier with mean values of both IL-6 and IL-10 as covariates performed well with accuracy of ~ 92% that was significantly higher than accuracy reported in literature with IL-6 and IL-10 as individual covariates. Conclusions: Simple panel proposed by us with only two cytokine markers can be used as predictors for fast diagnosis of patients with higher risk of COVID-19 disease deterioration and thus can be managed well for a favourable prognosis.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sujan K Dhar","author_inst":"Beyond Antibody"},{"author_name":"Vishnupriyan K","author_inst":"Mazumdar Shaw Medical Foundation"},{"author_name":"Sharat Damodar","author_inst":"Mazumdar Shaw Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Shashi Gujar","author_inst":"Dalhousie University"},{"author_name":"Manjula Das","author_inst":"Mazumdar Shaw Medical Foundation"},{"author_name":"Javaria Najeeb","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Molly Hunter","author_inst":"ATUM"},{"author_name":"Malaya K Sahoo","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"ChunHong Huang","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fumiko Yamamoto","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Justin Manalac","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ana R Otrelo-Cardoso","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Tho D Pham","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Arjun Rustagi","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Angela J Rogers","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Nigam H Shah","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Catherine A Blish","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jennifer R Cochran","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Kari C Nadeau","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Theodore S Jardetzky","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"James L Zehnder","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Taia T Wang","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Peter S Kim","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Saurabh Gombar","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Robert Tibshirani","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin A Pinsky","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Scott D Boyd","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Karsten Zengler","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Susan Cheng","author_inst":"Brigham and Womens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michael Inouye","author_inst":"Baker Heart & Diabetes Institute, University of Melbourne, University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Teemu Niiranen","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare"},{"author_name":"Mohit Jain","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Veikko Salomaa","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey D.

Fast, accurate and simple blood-based assays for quantification of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are urgently needed to identify infected individuals and keep track of the spread of disease. Methods: The study included 35 plasma samples from 22 individuals with confirmed COVID-19 by real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and 40 non COVID-19 plasma samples. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM\/IgA or IgG antibodies were detected by a microfluidic quantitative immunomagnetic assay (IMA)(ViroTrack Sero COVID IgM+IgA\/IgG Ab, Blusense Diagnostics, Denmark) and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ((ELISA) (EuroImmun Medizinische Labordiagnostika, Germany). Results: Of the 35 plasma samples from the COVID-19 patients, 29 (82.9%) were positive for IgA\/IgM or IgG by IMA and 29 samples (82.9%) were positive by ELISA. Sensitivity for only one sample per patient was 68% for IgA+IgM and 73% IgG by IMA and 73% by ELISA. For samples collected 14 days after symptom onset, the sensitivity of both IMA and ELISA was around 90%. Specificity of the IMA reached 100% compared to 95% for ELISA IgA and 97.5% for ELISA IgG. Conclusion: IMA for COVID-19 is a rapid simple-to-use point of care test with sensitivity and specificity similar to a commercial ELISA.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria Engel Moeller","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Copenhagen University Hospital, Amager and Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Jeppe Fock","author_inst":"BluSense Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Pearlyn Pah","author_inst":"BluSense Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Antia De La Campa Veras","author_inst":"BluSense Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Melanie Bade","author_inst":"BluSense Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Marco Donolato","author_inst":"BluSense Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Simone Bastrup Israelsen","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Copenhagen University Hospital, Amager and Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Jesper Eugen-Olsen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Research, Copenhagen University Hospital, Amager and Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Thomas Benfield","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Copenhagen University Hospital, Amager and Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Frederik Neess Engsig","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Copenhagen University Hospital, Amager and Hvidovre"},{"author_name":"Justin Manalac","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ana R Otrelo-Cardoso","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Tho D Pham","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Arjun Rustagi","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Angela J Rogers","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Nigam H Shah","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Catherine A Blish","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jennifer R Cochran","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Kari C Nadeau","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Theodore S Jardetzky","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"James L Zehnder","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Taia T Wang","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Peter S Kim","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Saurabh Gombar","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Robert Tibshirani","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin A Pinsky","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Scott D Boyd","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Karsten Zengler","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Susan Cheng","author_inst":"Brigham and Womens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michael Inouye","author_inst":"Baker Heart & Diabetes Institute, University of Melbourne, University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Teemu Niiranen","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare"},{"author_name":"Mohit Jain","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Veikko Salomaa","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey D.

Methods: By retrospectively reviewing of patients in four groups (healthy controls, severe influenza A, non-severe COVID-19 and severe COVID-19) who were admitted to Ditan hospital between 2018 to 2020, we performed flow cytometric analysis and compared the absolute counts of leukocytes, lymphocytes, and lymphocyte subsets of the patients at different time points (weeks 1-4). Results: We reviewed the patients' data of 110 healthy blood donors, 80 Non-severe COVID-19, 19 Severe COVID-19 and 43 severe influenza A. We found total lymphocytes (0.93*109\/L, 0.84*109\/L vs 1.78*109\/L, P < 0.0001) and lymphocyte subsets (T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets) of both severe patients to be significantly lower than those of healthy donors at early infection stages. Further, significant dynamic variations were observed at different time points (weeks 1-4).

Even though many kits available commercially but none of them are rapid, sensitive and high throughput. OnCovid total antibody assay is a diagnostic method developed by us uses the principle of bio-layer Interferometry to detect IgM, IgA and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 antigens.

India population is divided into different clusters on the basis of population density and population mobility, even varying resource availability and since the recent cases are coming from throughout the country, it allows us to model an overall average of the country. In this study, we try to prove the efficiency of using the SEIR epidemiological model for different rate study analysis for COVID epidemic in India. Along with it we derived newer components for better forecast of the pandemic in India. We found that there is a decrease in R0 value, but still the epidemic is not under control. The percentage of infected patients being admitted into ICU for critical care is around 9.986%, while the chances of recovery of critical patients being admitted to the ICU seem to be slim at 79.9% of the admitted being dead.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"BRAHMATHEJA REDDY MALI REDDY","author_inst":"INDIAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (BHU), VARANASI"},{"author_name":"ANUJ SINGH","author_inst":"INDIAN INSTITUE OF TECHNOLOGY (BHU), VARANASI"},{"author_name":"PRADEEP SRIVASTAVA","author_inst":"Technology Information, Forecasting and Assessment Council (TIFAC), Department of Science and Technology (DST), New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Venkata Sri Krishna Kona","author_inst":"Oncosimis Biotech Pvt Ltd"},{"author_name":"Laxmaiah Avula","author_inst":"ICMR-National Institute of Nutrition"},{"author_name":"Rakesh Kumar Mishra","author_inst":"CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology"},{"author_name":"Madhusudhana Rao Nalam","author_inst":"AIC-CCMB"},{"author_name":"Yiwei Hao","author_inst":"Capital Medical University Affiliated Beijing Ditan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Meiling Chen","author_inst":"Capital Medical University Affiliated Beijing Ditan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyang Ma","author_inst":"Capital Medical University Affiliated Beijing Ditan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tianwei Zhao","author_inst":"Capital Medical University Affiliated Beijing Ditan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiaodi Guo","author_inst":"Capital Medical University Affiliated Beijing Ditan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhihai Chen","author_inst":"Capital Medical University Affiliated Beijing Ditan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Arjun Rustagi","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Angela J Rogers","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Nigam H Shah","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Catherine A Blish","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jennifer R Cochran","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Kari C Nadeau","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Theodore S Jardetzky","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"James L Zehnder","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Taia T Wang","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Peter S Kim","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Saurabh Gombar","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Robert Tibshirani","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin A Pinsky","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Scott D Boyd","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Karsten Zengler","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Susan Cheng","author_inst":"Brigham and Womens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michael Inouye","author_inst":"Baker Heart & Diabetes Institute, University of Melbourne, University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Teemu Niiranen","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare"},{"author_name":"Mohit Jain","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Veikko Salomaa","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey D.

However, there is a lack of research on geographic modeling of COVID-19 as well as identification of contributory factors affecting the COVID-19 in the context of developing countries. To fulfill the gap, this study aimed to identify the potential factors affecting the COVID-19 incidence rates at the district-level in Bangladesh using spatial regression model (SRM). Therefore, data related to 32 demographic, economic, weather, built environment, health, and facilities related factors were collected and analyzed to explain the spatial variability of this disease incidence. Three global (Ordinary least squares (OLS), spatial lag model (SLM) and spatial error model (SEM)) and one local (geographically weighted regression (GWR)) SRMs were developed in this study. The results of the models showed that four factors significantly affected the COVID-19 incidence rates in Bangladesh. Those four factors are urban population percentage, monthly consumption, number of health workers, and distance from the capital. Among the four developed models, the GWR model performed the best in explaining the variation of COVID-19 incidence rates across Bangladesh with a R square value of 78.6%. Findings from this research offer a better insight into the COVID-19 situation and would help to develop policies aimed to prevent the future epidemic crisis.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Md.

There are growing concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. With government-imposed restrictions as well as a general burden on healthcare systems, the pandemic has the potential to disrupt the access to, and delivery of, mental healthcare. Ultimately, this could potentially lead to unmet needs of individuals requiring mental health support. Methods. Electronic healthcare records from primary care psychological therapy services (Improving Access to Psychological Therapy) in England were used to examine changes in access to mental health services and service delivery during early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional, descriptive timeseries was conducted using data from 1st January 2019 to 24th May 2020 across five NHS trusts to examine patterns in referrals to services (n = 171,823) and appointments taking place (n = 865,902). Results. The number of patients accessing mental health services dropped by an average of 55% in the 9 weeks after lockdown was announced, reaching a maximum reduction of 74% in the initial 3 weeks after lockdown in the UK. As referrals began to increase again, there was a relatively faster increase in referrals from Black, Asian, and ethnic minority groups as well an increase in referrals from more densely populated areas. Despite a reduction in access, service providers adapted to infection control guidance by rapidly shifting to remote delivery of care. Interpretation. Services were able to rapidly adapt to provide continuity of care in mental healthcare. However, patients accessing services reduced dramatically, potentially placing a future burden on service providers to treat a likely backlog of patients in addition to a possible excess of patients as the long-term consequences of the pandemic become more apparent. Despite the observational nature of the data, which should be noted, the present study can inform the planning of service provision and policy.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Clarissa M.

While some studies have found no link between smoking status and severe COVID-19, others demonstrated a significant one. The present study aimed to determine the relationship between smoking and clinical COVID-19 severity via a systematic meta-analysis approach. Methods: We searched the Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase databases to identify clinical studies suitable for inclusion in this meta-analysis. Studies reporting smoking status and comparing non-severe and severe patients were included. Non-severe cases were described as mild, common type, non-intensive care unit (ICU) treatment, survivors, and severe cases as critical, need for ICU, refractory, and non-survivors. Results: A total of 16 articles detailing 11322 COVID-19 patients were included. Our meta-analysis revealed a relationship between a history of smoking and severe COVID-19 cases (OR=2.17; 95% CI: 1.37-3.46; P <.001). Additionally, we found an association between the current smoking status and severe COVID-19 (OR=1.51; 95% CI: 1.12-2.05; P <.008). In 10.7% (978\/9067) of non-smokers, COVID-19 was severe, while in active smokers, severe COVID-19 occurred in 21.2% (65\/305) of cases. Conclusion: Active smoking and a history of smoking are clearly associated with severe COVID-19. The SARS-COV-2 epidemic should serve as an impetus for patients and those at risk to maintain good health practices and discontinue smoking.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Askin Gulsen","author_inst":"Department of Pneumology, University of Lubeck, Lubeck, Germany"},{"author_name":"Burcu Arpinar Yigitbas","author_inst":"Yedikule Chest Disease and Thoracic Surgery Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Berat Uslu","author_inst":"Yedikule Chest Disease and Thoracic Surgery Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Daniel Droemann","author_inst":"Deparment ofPneumology, University of Lubeck, Lubeck, Germany"},{"author_name":"Oguz Kilinc","author_inst":"Department of Pneumology, Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Rania M El-Lababidi","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi"},{"author_name":"Fadi Hamed","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Abuzakouk","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi"},{"author_name":"Mahmoud El-Kaissi","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyang Ma","author_inst":"Capital Medical University Affiliated Beijing Ditan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tianwei Zhao","author_inst":"Capital Medical University Affiliated Beijing Ditan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiaodi Guo","author_inst":"Capital Medical University Affiliated Beijing Ditan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhihai Chen","author_inst":"Capital Medical University Affiliated Beijing Ditan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Arjun Rustagi","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Angela J Rogers","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Nigam H Shah","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Catherine A Blish","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jennifer R Cochran","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Kari C Nadeau","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Theodore S Jardetzky","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"James L Zehnder","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Taia T Wang","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Peter S Kim","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Saurabh Gombar","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Robert Tibshirani","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin A Pinsky","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Scott D Boyd","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Karsten Zengler","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Susan Cheng","author_inst":"Brigham and Womens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michael Inouye","author_inst":"Baker Heart & Diabetes Institute, University of Melbourne, University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Teemu Niiranen","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare"},{"author_name":"Mohit Jain","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Veikko Salomaa","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey D.

Multiple approaches and strategies have been performed to relieve the pressure and support existing healthcare systems. The Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health (MOH) launched an initiative to support the National Healthcare System. Since the 5th of June 2020, 238 outpatient fever clinics were established across Saudi Arabia. Methods: A cross-sectional study included 2,733 eligible patients subjected to MOH treatment protocol (hydroxychloroquine and zinc) and revisited the clinics within 3-7 days after treatment initiation. This study aimed to assess the safety outcome and reported adverse events from hydroxychloroquine use among suspected COVID-19 patients. The data was collected through an electronic link and cross-checked with that of the national database (Health Electronic Surveillance Network, HESN) and reports from the MOH Morbidity and Mortality (M&M) Committee. Results: Majority of the cases were males (70.4%). Upon reassessing the studied participants within 3-7 days, 240 patients (8.8%) discontinued the treatment protocol because of the development of side effects (4.1%) and for non-clinical reasons in the remaining (4.7%). Medication side effects overall were reported among (6.7%) of all studied participants, including mainly cardiovascular adverse events (2.5%), followed by gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (2.4%). No Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission or death were reported among these patients. Conclusion: In our study, results show that the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 patients in mild to moderate cases in an outpatient setting, within the protocol recommendation and inclusion\/exclusion criteria, is safe, highly tolerable, and with minimum side effects.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abdulrhman Mohana","author_inst":"Saudi Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Tarek Suliman","author_inst":"King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Nagla Mahmoud","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Mustafa Hassanein","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Amel Alfaifi","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Eissa Alenazi","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Nashwa Radwan","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Nasser Alkhalifah","author_inst":"King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Ehab Elkady","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Abdullah Almohaizeie","author_inst":"King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Fouad AboGazalah","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Khaled AbdulKareem","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Fahad AlGhofaili","author_inst":"King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Hani Jokhdar","author_inst":"Ministry of Health, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Fahad Alrabiah","author_inst":"King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Nigam H Shah","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Catherine A Blish","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jennifer R Cochran","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Kari C Nadeau","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Theodore S Jardetzky","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"James L Zehnder","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Taia T Wang","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Peter S Kim","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Saurabh Gombar","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Robert Tibshirani","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin A Pinsky","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Scott D Boyd","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Karsten Zengler","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Susan Cheng","author_inst":"Brigham and Womens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michael Inouye","author_inst":"Baker Heart & Diabetes Institute, University of Melbourne, University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Teemu Niiranen","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare"},{"author_name":"Mohit Jain","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Veikko Salomaa","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey D.
