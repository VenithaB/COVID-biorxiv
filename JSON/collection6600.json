Meanwhile, most countries apply social distancing with the objective to keep the number of critical cases below the capabilities of the health care system. Due to the novelty and rapid spread of the virus, an a priori assessment of this strategy was not possible. In this study, we present a model-based systems analysis to assess the effectiveness of social distancing measures in terms of intensity and duration of application. Results show a super-linear scaling between intensity (percent contact reduction) and required duration of application to have an added value (lower fatality rate). This holds true for an effective reproduction of R > 1 and is reverted for R < 1. If R is not reduced below 1, secondary effects of required long-term isolation are likely to unravel the added value of disease mitigation. If an extinction is not feasible, we recommend moderate social-distancing that is well balanced against capability limits of national health-care systems.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christian Neuwirth","author_inst":"Interfaculty Department of Geoinformatics - Z_GIS, University of Salzburg"},{"author_name":"Christoph Gruber","author_inst":"Center for Computational Material Science, Institute of Applied Physics, Vienna University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Thomas Murphy","author_inst":"Interfaculty Department of Geoinformatics - Z_GIS, University of Salzburg"},{"author_name":"Carmen W.E.

The structural research on the receptor recognition by SARS-CoV-2 has identified the key interactions between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its host (epithelial cell) receptor, also known as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). It controls both the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV-2. In view of this, we propose and analyze a mathematical model for investigating the effect of CTL responses over the viral mutation to control the viral infection when a postinfection immunostimulant drug (pidotimod) is administered at regular intervals. Dynamics of the system with and without impulses have been analyzed using the basic reproduction number. This study shows that the proper dosing interval and drug dose both are important to eradicate the viral infection.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amar Nath Chatterjee","author_inst":"K.L.S.

As of April 20, there have been more than 2.4 million confirmed cases with over 160,000 deaths. Extreme case surges coupled with challenges in forecasting the clinical course of affected patients have necessitated thoughtful resource allocation and early identification of high-risk patients. However, effective methods for achieving this are lacking. In this paper, we present a decision tree-based machine learning model trained on electronic health records from patients with confirmed COVID-19 at a single center within the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City. We then externally validate our model by predicting the likelihood of critical event or death within various time intervals for patients after hospitalization at four other hospitals and achieve strong performance, notably predicting mortality at 1 week with an AUC-ROC of 0.84. Finally, we establish model interpretability by calculating SHAP scores to identify decisive features, including age, inflammatory markers (procalcitonin and LDH), and coagulation parameters (PT, PTT, D-Dimer). To our knowledge, this is one of the first models with external validation to both predict outcomes in COVID-19 patients with strong validation performance and identification of key contributors in outcome prediction that may assist clinicians in making effective patient management decisions.","rel_num_authors":49,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Akhil Vaid","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine

detection of SARS-2. Many clinical diagnostic laboratories rely on commercial platforms that provide integrated end-to-end solutions. While this provides established robust pipelines, there is a clear bottleneck in the supply of reagents given the current situation of extraordinary high demand. Some laboratories resort to implementing kit-free handling procedures, but many other small laboratories will not have the capacity to develop those and\/or will perform manual handling of their samples. In order to provide multiple workflows for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection we compared several commercially available RNA extraction methods: QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAgen), the recently developed RNAdvance Blood (Beckman) and Mag-Bind Viral DNA\/RNA 96 Kit (Omega Bio-tek). We also compared different 1-step RT-qPCR Master Mix brands: TaqMan Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix (ThermoFisher Scientific), qPCRBIO Probe 1-Step Go Lo-ROX (PCR Biosystems) and Luna(R) Universal Probe One-Step RT-qPCR Kit (NEB). We used the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) recommended primers that detect two regions of the viral N gene as well as those that detect the RdRP gene region as per Public Health England (PHE) guidelines (Charite\/WHO\/PHE). Our data show that the RNA extraction methods provide similar results. Amongst the qPCR reagents tested, TaqMan Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix and Luna(R) Universal Probe One-Step RT-qPCR Kit proved most sensitive. The N1 and N2 primer-probes provide a more reliable detection than the RdRP-SARSr primer-probe set, particularly in samples with low viral titres. Importantly, we have implemented a protocol using heat inactivation and demonstrate that it has minimal impact on the sensitivity of the qPCR in clinical samples - potentially making SARS-CoV-2 testing portable to settings that do not have CL-3 facilities.","rel_num_authors":33,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria Jose Lista","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Robert Page","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Helin Sertkaya","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Pedro Matos","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Elena Ortiz-Zapater","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Thomas J.A.

Methods: In this retrospective, multicenter cohort study, we consecutively included all adult inpatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and pre-existing cirrhosis that had been discharged or had died by 24 March 2020 from 16 designated hospitals in China. Demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiographic findings on admission, treatment, complications during hospitalization and clinical outcomes were collected and compared between survivors and non-survivors. Findings: Twenty-one patients were included in this study, of whom 16 were cured and 5 died in hospital. Seventeen patients had compensated cirrhosis and hepatitis B virus infection was the most common etiology. Lymphocyte and platelet counts were lower, and direct bilirubin levels were higher in patients who died than those who survived (p= 0.040, 0.032, and 0.006, respectively). Acute respiratory distress syndrome and secondary infection were both the most frequently observed complications. Only one patient developed acute on chronic liver failure. Of the 5 non-survivors, all patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and 2 patients progressed to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

Little is known regarding how physicians have been affected. We aimed to characterize COVID-19 impact on NYC resident physicians. Methods IRB-exempt and expedited cross-sectional analysis through survey to NYC residency program directors (PDs) April 3-12, 2020, encompassing events from March 2-April 12, 2020. Findings From an estimated 340 residency programs around NYC, recruitment yielded 91 responses, representing 24 specialties and 2,306 residents. 45.1% of programs reported at least one resident with confirmed COVID-19: 101 resident physicians were confirmed COVID-19-positive, with additional 163 residents presumed positive for COVID-19 based on symptoms but awaiting or unable to obtain testing. 56.5% of programs had a resident waiting for, or unable to obtain, COVID-19 testing. Two COVID-19-positive residents were hospitalized, with one in intensive care. Among specialties with >100 residents represented, negative binomial regression indicated that infection risk differed by specialty (p=0.039). Although most programs (80%) reported quarantining a resident, with 16.8% of residents experiencing quarantine, 14.9% of COVID-19-positive residents were not quarantined. 90 programs, encompassing 99.2% of the resident physicians, reported reuse or extended mask use, and 43 programs, encompassing 60.4% of residents, felt that personal protective equipment (PPE) was suboptimal. 65 programs (74.7%) have redeployed residents elsewhere to support COVID-19 efforts. Interpretation Many resident physicians around NYC have been affected by COVID-19 through direct infection, quarantine, or redeployment.

Knowledge of the incubation period distribution can be used directly to inform decision-making or as inputs into mathematical models. Objectives: The aim of this study was to conduct a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis of estimates of the incubation periods of COVID-19. Design: Rapid systematic review and meta-analysis of observational research Data sources: Publications on the electronic databases PubMed, Google Scholar, MedRxiv and BioRxiv were searched. The search was not limited to peer-reviewed published data, but also included pre-print articles. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Studies were selected for meta-analysis if they reported either the parameters and confidence intervals of the distributions fit to the data, or sufficient information to facilitate calculation of those values. The majority of studies suitable for inclusion in the final analysis modelled incubation period as a lognormal distribution. We conducted a random effects meta-analysis of the parameters of this distribution. Results: The incubation period distribution may be modelled with a lognormal distribution with pooled mu and sigma parameters of 1.63 (1.51, 1.75) and 0.50 (0.45, 0.55) respectively. The corresponding mean was 5.8 (5.01, 6.69 days). It should be noted that uncertainty increases towards the tail of the distribution: the pooled parameter estimates resulted in a median incubation period of 5.1 (4.5, 5.8) days, whereas the 95th percentile was 11.6 (9.5, 14.2) days. Conclusions and implications: The choice of which parameter values are adopted will depend on how the information is used, the associated risks and the perceived consequences of decisions to be taken. These recommendations will need to be revisited once further relevant information becomes available. Finally, we present an RShiny app that facilitates updating these estimates as new data become available.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Conor G McAloon","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Aine Collins","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Kevin Hunt","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Ann Barber","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Andrew Byrne","author_inst":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine"},{"author_name":"Francis Butler","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Miriam Casey","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"John M Griffin","author_inst":"Straffan, Co.

We analyzed socio-demographic factors associated with higher likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection and explore mediating pathways for race disparities in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods: Cross sectional analysis of COVID-19 Surveillance and Outcomes Registry (CURATOR), which captures data for a large healthcare system comprising of one central tertiary care, seven large community hospitals, and an expansive ambulatory \/ emergency care network in the Greater Houston area. Nasopharyngeal samples for individuals inclusive of all ages, races, ethnicities and sex were tested for SARS-CoV-2. We analyzed, socio-demographic (age, sex, race, ethnicity, household income, residence population density) and comorbidity (hypertension, diabetes, obesity, cardiac disease) factors. Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to provide adjusted Odds Ratios (aOR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) for likelihood of positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) framework was utilized to explore three mediation pathways (low income, high population density, high comorbidity burden) for association between African American race and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: Among 4,513 tested individuals, 754 (16.7%) tested positive. Overall mean (SD) age was 50.6 (18.9) years, 62% females and 26% were African American. African American race was associated with lower socio-economic status, higher comorbidity burden, and population density residence. In the fully adjusted model, African American race (vs. White; aOR, CI: 1.84, 1.49-2.27) and Hispanic ethnicity (vs. non-Hispanic; aOR, CI: 1.70, 1.35-2.14) had a higher likelihood of infection. Older individuals and males were also at a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The SEM framework demonstrated a statistically significant (p = 0.008) indirect effect of African American race on SARS-CoV-2 infection mediated via a pathway that included residence in densely populated zip code. Conclusions: There is strong evidence of race and ethnic disparities in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic potentially mediated through unique social determinants of health.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Farhaan S Vahidy","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Juan Carlos Nicolas","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jennifer R Meeks","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Osman Khan","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Stephen L Jones","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Faisal Masud","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"H Dirk Sostman","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Academic Institute"},{"author_name":"Robert A Phillips","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"Julia D Andrieni","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bita A Kash","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Khurram Nasir","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"Martin J Green","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Simon J More","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Mei Mei","author_inst":"Tianjin Haihe Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huiling Liu","author_inst":"Tianjin Haihe Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhengyan Wang","author_inst":"Suizhou Hospital, Hubei University of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jinlin Li","author_inst":"Suizhou Hospital, Hubei University of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hua Yang","author_inst":"Minda Hospital Affiliated to Hubei University for Nationalities"},{"author_name":"Huihua Xiang","author_inst":"Minda Hospital Affiliated to Hubei University for Nationalities"},{"author_name":"Xiaodan Li","author_inst":"The Central Hospital of Enshi Tujia And Miao Autonomous Prefecture"},{"author_name":"Tao Liu","author_inst":"The Central Hospital of Enshi Tujia And Miao Autonomous Prefecture"},{"author_name":"Ming-Hua Zheng","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chuan Liu","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yifei Huang","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Dan Xu","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoguo Li","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Ning Kang","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Qing He","author_inst":"The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Ye Gu","author_inst":"The Sixth People's Hospital of Shenyang"},{"author_name":"Guo Zhang","author_inst":"The People's Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region"},{"author_name":"Chuxiao Shao","author_inst":"Zhejiang University Lishui Hospital & Lishui Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dengxiang Liu","author_inst":"Xingtai People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lin Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xun Li","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Norifumi Kawada","author_inst":"Osaka City University"},{"author_name":"Zicheng Jiang","author_inst":"Ankang Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fengmei Wang","author_inst":"Tianjin Second People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bin Xiong","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College"},{"author_name":"Tetsuo Takehara","author_inst":"Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Don C.

Use of personal protective equipment (PPE) in health care workplace is recommended as a high priority. In order to investigate the relationship between PPE use and the number of COVID-19 cases among HCWs, we conducted a molecular epidemiological study among 142 HCWs who were dispatched from Hefei to work in Wuhan and 284 HCWs who remained in Hefei, China; both provided care for patients with COVID-19. Nucleic acid testing and SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody (IgM, IgG, IgA) detection were performed to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection among those HCWs. We also extracted publicly released data on daily number of COVID-19 cases among HCWs, daily number of HCWs who were dispatched to Hubei province since January 24, and daily production of PPE in China and daily demand and supply of PPE in Hubei province. Our laboratory testing confirmed that none of the 142 HCWs who were dispatched to work in Wuhan and 284 HCWs who remained in Hefei were infected by SARS-CoV-2. Consistent with these findings, as of April 15, 2020, none of the 42,600 HCWs who were successively dispatched to Hubei province since January 24, 2020 was reported to have COVID-19. These HCWs were provided with adequate supply of PPE as committed by their original institutions or provinces. In contrast, during the early phase of COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei province, a substantial shortage of PPE and an increasing number of COVID-19 infection among HCWs were reported. With the continuing increase in domestic production of PPE in China, the PPE supply started to meet and then exceed the demand. This coincided with a subsequent reduction in the number of reported COVID-19 cases among HCWs. In conclusion, our findings indicate that COVID-19 infection among HCWs could be completely prevented. Appropriate and adequate PPE might play a crucial role in protecting HCWs against COVID-19 infection.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China; Clinical Research Hospital (Hefei)"},{"author_name":"Yuan-Zeng Min","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, 230026, China"},{"author_name":"Chun-Mei Yang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, 230001, China"},{"author_name":"Hai-Ou Hong","author_inst":"Anhui Provincial Hospital Health Center, the First Affiliated Hospital of USTC; Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of "},{"author_name":"Tian Xue","author_inst":"Joint Laboratory of Public Health, USTC and Anhui NHC; Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, 2300"},{"author_name":"Yong Gao","author_inst":"Joint Laboratory of Public Health, USTC and Anhui NHC, Department of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and M"},{"author_name":"Tengchuan Jin","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, 230001, China"},{"author_name":"Zhao-Hui Lu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, 230001, China"},{"author_name":"Liang-Ming Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China,"},{"author_name":"Xueying Zheng","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC,  Clinical Research Hospital (Hefei) of Chinese Academy of Science, Joint Laboratory of Public Health, USTC and Anhui NHC,"},{"author_name":"Sihui Luo","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC,  Clinical Research Hospital (Hefei) of Chinese Academy of Science, Joint Laboratory of Public Health, USTC and Anhui NHC,"},{"author_name":"Wei Bao","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, College of Public Health, University of Iowa, City"},{"author_name":"Jian-Ping Weng","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC,  Clinical Research Hospital (Hefei) of Chinese Academy of Science, Joint Laboratory of Public Health, USTC and Anhui NHC,"},{"author_name":"Mei Mei","author_inst":"Tianjin Haihe Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huiling Liu","author_inst":"Tianjin Haihe Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhengyan Wang","author_inst":"Suizhou Hospital, Hubei University of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jinlin Li","author_inst":"Suizhou Hospital, Hubei University of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hua Yang","author_inst":"Minda Hospital Affiliated to Hubei University for Nationalities"},{"author_name":"Huihua Xiang","author_inst":"Minda Hospital Affiliated to Hubei University for Nationalities"},{"author_name":"Xiaodan Li","author_inst":"The Central Hospital of Enshi Tujia And Miao Autonomous Prefecture"},{"author_name":"Tao Liu","author_inst":"The Central Hospital of Enshi Tujia And Miao Autonomous Prefecture"},{"author_name":"Ming-Hua Zheng","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chuan Liu","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yifei Huang","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Dan Xu","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoguo Li","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Ning Kang","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Qing He","author_inst":"The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Ye Gu","author_inst":"The Sixth People's Hospital of Shenyang"},{"author_name":"Guo Zhang","author_inst":"The People's Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region"},{"author_name":"Chuxiao Shao","author_inst":"Zhejiang University Lishui Hospital & Lishui Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dengxiang Liu","author_inst":"Xingtai People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lin Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xun Li","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Norifumi Kawada","author_inst":"Osaka City University"},{"author_name":"Zicheng Jiang","author_inst":"Ankang Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fengmei Wang","author_inst":"Tianjin Second People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bin Xiong","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College"},{"author_name":"Tetsuo Takehara","author_inst":"Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Don C.

Therefore the majority of the population is at risk of infection if no intervention measures were undertaken. The true size of the COVID-19 epidemic remains unknown, as a significant proportion of infected individuals only exhibit mild symptoms or are even asymptomatic. A timely assessment of the evolving epidemic size is crucial for resource allocation and triage decisions. In this article, we modify the back-calculation algorithm to obtain a lower bound estimate of the number of COVID-19 infected persons in China outside the Hubei province. We estimate the infection density among infected and show that the drastic control measures enforced throughout China following the lockdown of Wuhan City effectively slowed down the spread of the disease in two weeks.

Live voting at polls was allowed despite concern over increasing the spread of COVID-19. In addition to 1.1 million absentee ballots cast, 453,222 persons voted live. The purpose of our study was to determine if an increase in COVID-19 activity was associated with the election. Methods: Using the voting age population for the United States (US), WI, and its 3 largest counties, and daily new COVID-19 case reports from various COVID-19 web-based dashboards, daily new case rates were calculated. With election day April 7, the incubation period included April 12-21. The new case activity in the rest of the US was compared with the Wisconsin activity during the incubation period. Results: WI daily new case rates were lower than those of the rest of the US for the 10-day period before the election and remained lower during the post exposure incubation period. The ratio of Wisconsin new case rates to US new case rates was 0.34 WI: 1 US for the 10 days leading up to the election and declined to 0.28 WI: 1 US for the 10-day post-incubation period after the election. Similar analysis for Milwaukee county showed a pre-election ratio of 1.02 Milwaukee: 1 US and after the election the ratio was 0.63 Milwaukee: 1 US. Dane county had a pre-election ratio of 0.21 Dane: 1 US case, and it fell to 0.13 Dane: 1 US after the election. Waukesha county had a pre-election ratio of 0.27 Waukesha: 1 US case and that fell to 0.19 Waukesha: 1 US after the election. Conclusions: There was no increase in COVID-19 new case daily rates observed for Wisconsin or its 3 largest counties following the election on April 7, 2020, as compared to the US, during the post-incubation interval period.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew C Berry","author_inst":"Division of Gastroenterology, Larkin Community Hospital, South Miami, FL, USA"},{"author_name":"Madhuri S Mulekar","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of South Alabama, Mobile, AL, USA"},{"author_name":"Bruce B Berry","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Froedtert & The Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhou","author_inst":"East China Normal University"},{"author_name":"Dean A.

We explored the role of lung ultrasonography (LU) in quickly assessing lung status in these patients. Methods: eChoVid is a multicentric study based on routinely collected data, conducted in 3 emergency units of Assistance Publique des Hopitaux de Paris (APHP); 107 patients were included between March 19, 2020 and April 01, 2020 and underwent LU, a short clinical assessment by 2 emergency physicians blinded to each other's and a CT. LU consisted of scoring lesions in 8 chest zones from 0 to 3, defining a severity global score (GS) ranging from 0 to 24. CT severity score ranged from 0 to 3 according to the extent of interstitial pneumonia signs. 48 patients underwent LU by both an expert and a newly trained physician. Findings: The GS showed good performance to predict CT severity assessment of COVID-19 as normal versus pathologic: AUC=0.93, maximal Youden index 1 with 95% sensitivity, and 83% specificity. Similar performance was found for CT assessment as normal or minimal versus moderate or severe (n=90): AUC 0.89, maximal Youden index 7 with 86% sensitivity, and 78% specificity. Good agreement was found for zone scoring assessed by new trainee (30mn theory + 30mn practice) and expert (n=14,14*8 checkpoints), weighted kappa 0.85-1; moderate agreement was found for new trainee (n=48, 30mn theory) and expert, kappa 0.62-0.81. Interpretation: GS score is a simple tool to assess lung damage severity in patients with suspected or diagnosed COVID-19. Comparing the performance of new trainees and expert physicians opens a path for adoption beyond the scope of experts. LU is a good candidate for patients triage, especially in case of CT availability issues.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mehdi Benchoufi","author_inst":"Center for Clinical Epidemiology, Hotel-Dieu Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France - METHODS Team, Center for Research in Epide"},{"author_name":"Jerome Bokobza","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, Cochin Hospital, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Anthony Anthony Chauvin","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, Hopital Lariboisiere, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, University Diderot, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Dion","author_inst":"Imaging department Hotel Dieu, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Universite de Paris,Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Marie-Laure Baranne","author_inst":"Center for Clinical Epidemiology, Hotel-Dieu Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Fabien Levan","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, Hopital Cochin, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Maxime Gautier","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, Hopital Lariboisiere, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Delphine Cantin","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, Hotel Dieu Hospital, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Thomas d Humieres","author_inst":"Physiology department, Henri Mondor University Hospital, APHP, Creteil, France"},{"author_name":"Cedric Gil-Jardine","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department SAMU-SMUR, Pellegrin Hospital, University Hospital Center, Bordeaux, France - Bordeaux Population Health,  INSERM U1219, IETO Team, B"},{"author_name":"Sylvain Benenati","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, Hospital Group South Ile-de-France, Melun, France"},{"author_name":"Mathieu Oberlin","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, New Civil Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Mikael Martinez","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, Forez Hospital Center, Montbrison, France - Nord Emergency Network Ligerien Ardeche (REULIAN), Hospital Center Le Corbusier, Firminy"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Kahn","author_inst":"Imaging department Hotel Dieu, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris University, France"},{"author_name":"Abdourahmane Diallo","author_inst":"Clinical Trial Unit Hospital, Lariboisiere St-Louis Fernand-Widal Hospital Group, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris University, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Eric Vicaut","author_inst":"Clinical Trial Unit Hospital, Lariboisiere St-Louis Fernand-Widal Hospital Group, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris University, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Pierre Bourrier","author_inst":"Imaging Department Saint-Louis Hospital, Assistance Publique des Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Hua Yang","author_inst":"Minda Hospital Affiliated to Hubei University for Nationalities"},{"author_name":"Huihua Xiang","author_inst":"Minda Hospital Affiliated to Hubei University for Nationalities"},{"author_name":"Xiaodan Li","author_inst":"The Central Hospital of Enshi Tujia And Miao Autonomous Prefecture"},{"author_name":"Tao Liu","author_inst":"The Central Hospital of Enshi Tujia And Miao Autonomous Prefecture"},{"author_name":"Ming-Hua Zheng","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chuan Liu","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yifei Huang","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Dan Xu","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoguo Li","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Ning Kang","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Qing He","author_inst":"The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Ye Gu","author_inst":"The Sixth People's Hospital of Shenyang"},{"author_name":"Guo Zhang","author_inst":"The People's Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region"},{"author_name":"Chuxiao Shao","author_inst":"Zhejiang University Lishui Hospital & Lishui Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dengxiang Liu","author_inst":"Xingtai People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lin Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xun Li","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Norifumi Kawada","author_inst":"Osaka City University"},{"author_name":"Zicheng Jiang","author_inst":"Ankang Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fengmei Wang","author_inst":"Tianjin Second People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bin Xiong","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College"},{"author_name":"Tetsuo Takehara","author_inst":"Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Don C.

Susceptibility for infectious diseases like Covid-19 is likely to be partly genetic. Mapping the genetic susceptibility for Covid-19 outcomes may reveal biological mechanisms that could potentially aid in drug or vaccine developments. However, as the disease spreads unevenly across the country, regional allele frequency differences could become spuriously associated with disease prevalence. Methods: A regional genome-wide association study (RGWAS) was conducted in 396,042 individuals from England to investigate the association between 1.2 million genetic variants and regional differences in daily reported Covid-19 cases from March 1st to April 18th 2020. Results: The polygenic signal increases during the first weeks of March, peaking at March 13th with the measured genetic variants explaining ~3% of the variance, including two genome-wide significant loci. The explained variance starts to drop at the end of March and reaches almost zero on April 18th. The majority of this temporary polygenic signal is due to genes associated with higher educational attainment and better health. Conclusions: The temporary positive relationship between Covid-19 cases and regional socio-economic status (SES) at the beginning of the Covid-19 outbreak may reflect 1) a higher degree of international travelers, 2) more social contacts, and\/or 3) better testing capacities in higher SES regions. These signals are in the opposite direction of expected disease risk increasing effects, which has the potential to cancel out signals of interest. Genetic association studies should be aware of the timing and location of cases as this can introduce interfering polygenic signals that reflect regional differences in genes associated with behavior.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abdel Abdellaoui","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Jerome Bokobza","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, Cochin Hospital, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Anthony Anthony Chauvin","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, Hopital Lariboisiere, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, University Diderot, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Dion","author_inst":"Imaging department Hotel Dieu, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Universite de Paris,Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Marie-Laure Baranne","author_inst":"Center for Clinical Epidemiology, Hotel-Dieu Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Fabien Levan","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, Hopital Cochin, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Maxime Gautier","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, Hopital Lariboisiere, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Delphine Cantin","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, Hotel Dieu Hospital, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Thomas d Humieres","author_inst":"Physiology department, Henri Mondor University Hospital, APHP, Creteil, France"},{"author_name":"Cedric Gil-Jardine","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department SAMU-SMUR, Pellegrin Hospital, University Hospital Center, Bordeaux, France - Bordeaux Population Health,  INSERM U1219, IETO Team, B"},{"author_name":"Sylvain Benenati","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, Hospital Group South Ile-de-France, Melun, France"},{"author_name":"Mathieu Oberlin","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, New Civil Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Mikael Martinez","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, Forez Hospital Center, Montbrison, France - Nord Emergency Network Ligerien Ardeche (REULIAN), Hospital Center Le Corbusier, Firminy"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Kahn","author_inst":"Imaging department Hotel Dieu, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris University, France"},{"author_name":"Abdourahmane Diallo","author_inst":"Clinical Trial Unit Hospital, Lariboisiere St-Louis Fernand-Widal Hospital Group, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris University, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Eric Vicaut","author_inst":"Clinical Trial Unit Hospital, Lariboisiere St-Louis Fernand-Widal Hospital Group, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris University, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Pierre Bourrier","author_inst":"Imaging Department Saint-Louis Hospital, Assistance Publique des Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Hua Yang","author_inst":"Minda Hospital Affiliated to Hubei University for Nationalities"},{"author_name":"Huihua Xiang","author_inst":"Minda Hospital Affiliated to Hubei University for Nationalities"},{"author_name":"Xiaodan Li","author_inst":"The Central Hospital of Enshi Tujia And Miao Autonomous Prefecture"},{"author_name":"Tao Liu","author_inst":"The Central Hospital of Enshi Tujia And Miao Autonomous Prefecture"},{"author_name":"Ming-Hua Zheng","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chuan Liu","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yifei Huang","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Dan Xu","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoguo Li","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Ning Kang","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Qing He","author_inst":"The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Ye Gu","author_inst":"The Sixth People's Hospital of Shenyang"},{"author_name":"Guo Zhang","author_inst":"The People's Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region"},{"author_name":"Chuxiao Shao","author_inst":"Zhejiang University Lishui Hospital & Lishui Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dengxiang Liu","author_inst":"Xingtai People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lin Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xun Li","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Norifumi Kawada","author_inst":"Osaka City University"},{"author_name":"Zicheng Jiang","author_inst":"Ankang Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fengmei Wang","author_inst":"Tianjin Second People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bin Xiong","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College"},{"author_name":"Tetsuo Takehara","author_inst":"Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Don C.

Patients with airborne diseases such as Covid-19 should ideally be treated in negative pressure isolation rooms. However, due to the overwhelming demand for hospital beds, patients treated in general wards, hospital corridors, and makeshift hospitals. Adequate building ventilationin hospitals and public spaces is a crucial factor to contain the disease [1,2], to exit the current lockdown situation, and reduce the chance of subsequent waves of outbreaks. Lu et al. [3] reported an air-conditioner induced Covid-19 outbreak, by an asymptomatic patient, in a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, which exposes our vulnerability to future outbreaks linked to ventilation in public spaces. We demonstrate that displacement ventilation(either mechanical or naturalventilation), where air intakes are at low level and extracts are at high level, is a viable alternative to negative pressure isolation rooms, which are often not available on site in hospital wards and makeshift hospitals. Displacement ventilation produces negative pressure at the occupant level, which draws fresh air from outdoor, and positive pressure near the ceiling, which expels the hot and contaminated air out. We acknowledge that, in both developed and developing countries, many modern large structures lack the openings required for natural ventilation. This lack of openings can be supplemented by installing extract fans. We provide guidelines for such mechanically assisted-naturally ventilated makeshift hospitals, and public spaces such as supermarkets and essential public buildings","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rajesh Kumar Bhagat","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Paul Linden","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Anthony Anthony Chauvin","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, Hopital Lariboisiere, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, University Diderot, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Dion","author_inst":"Imaging department Hotel Dieu, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Universite de Paris,Paris, France."},{"author_name":"Marie-Laure Baranne","author_inst":"Center for Clinical Epidemiology, Hotel-Dieu Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Fabien Levan","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, Hopital Cochin, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Maxime Gautier","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, Hopital Lariboisiere, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Delphine Cantin","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, Hotel Dieu Hospital, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Thomas d Humieres","author_inst":"Physiology department, Henri Mondor University Hospital, APHP, Creteil, France"},{"author_name":"Cedric Gil-Jardine","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department SAMU-SMUR, Pellegrin Hospital, University Hospital Center, Bordeaux, France - Bordeaux Population Health,  INSERM U1219, IETO Team, B"},{"author_name":"Sylvain Benenati","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, Hospital Group South Ile-de-France, Melun, France"},{"author_name":"Mathieu Oberlin","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, New Civil Hospital, Strasbourg, France"},{"author_name":"Mikael Martinez","author_inst":"Adult Emergency Department, Forez Hospital Center, Montbrison, France - Nord Emergency Network Ligerien Ardeche (REULIAN), Hospital Center Le Corbusier, Firminy"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Kahn","author_inst":"Imaging department Hotel Dieu, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris University, France"},{"author_name":"Abdourahmane Diallo","author_inst":"Clinical Trial Unit Hospital, Lariboisiere St-Louis Fernand-Widal Hospital Group, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, Paris University, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Eric Vicaut","author_inst":"Clinical Trial Unit Hospital, Lariboisiere St-Louis Fernand-Widal Hospital Group, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris University, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Pierre Bourrier","author_inst":"Imaging Department Saint-Louis Hospital, Assistance Publique des Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Hua Yang","author_inst":"Minda Hospital Affiliated to Hubei University for Nationalities"},{"author_name":"Huihua Xiang","author_inst":"Minda Hospital Affiliated to Hubei University for Nationalities"},{"author_name":"Xiaodan Li","author_inst":"The Central Hospital of Enshi Tujia And Miao Autonomous Prefecture"},{"author_name":"Tao Liu","author_inst":"The Central Hospital of Enshi Tujia And Miao Autonomous Prefecture"},{"author_name":"Ming-Hua Zheng","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chuan Liu","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yifei Huang","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Dan Xu","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoguo Li","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Ning Kang","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Qing He","author_inst":"The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Ye Gu","author_inst":"The Sixth People's Hospital of Shenyang"},{"author_name":"Guo Zhang","author_inst":"The People's Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region"},{"author_name":"Chuxiao Shao","author_inst":"Zhejiang University Lishui Hospital & Lishui Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dengxiang Liu","author_inst":"Xingtai People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lin Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xun Li","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Norifumi Kawada","author_inst":"Osaka City University"},{"author_name":"Zicheng Jiang","author_inst":"Ankang Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fengmei Wang","author_inst":"Tianjin Second People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bin Xiong","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College"},{"author_name":"Tetsuo Takehara","author_inst":"Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Don C.

Knowledge of the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is needed to accurately monitor the spread of the epidemic and also to calculate the infection fatality rate (IFR). These measures may help the authorities to make informed decisions and adjust the current societal interventions. Blood donors comprise approximately 4.7% of the similarly aged population of Denmark and blood is donated in all areas of the country. The objective of this study was to perform real-time seroprevalence surveying among blood donors as a tool to estimate previous SARS-CoV-2 infections and the population based IFR. Methods: All Danish blood donors aged 17-69 years giving blood April 6 to 17 were tested for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M and G antibodies using a commercial lateral flow test. Antibody status was compared between areas and an estimate of the IFR was calculated. The seroprevalence was adjusted for assay sensitivity and specificity taking the uncertainties of the test validation into account when reporting the 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: The first 9,496 blood donors were tested and a combined adjusted seroprevalence of 1.7% (CI: 0.9-2.3) was calculated. The seroprevalence differed across areas. Using available data on fatalities and population numbers a combined IFR in patients younger than 70 is estimated at 82 per 100,000 (CI: 59-154) infections. Conclusions: The IFR was estimated to be slightly lower than previously reported from other countries not using seroprevalence data. The IFR, including only individuals with no comorbidity, is likely several fold lower than the current estimate. This may have implications for risk mitigation. We have initiated real-time nationwide anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence surveying of blood donations as a tool in monitoring the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christian Erikstrup","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Christoffer Egeberg Hother","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Ole Birger Vestager Pedersen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Zealand University Hospital, Koege, Denmark"},{"author_name":"K\u00e5re M\u00f8lbak","author_inst":"Infection Control, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Robert Leo Skov","author_inst":"Infection Control, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Dorte Kinggaard Holm","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Susanne S\u00e6kmose","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Zealand University Hospital, Koege, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Anna Christine Nilsson","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Patrick Terrence Brooks","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Jens Kjaergaard Boldsen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, DenmarkD"},{"author_name":"Christina Mikkelsen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Mikkel Gybel-Brask","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Erik S\u00f8rensen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Khoa Manh Dinh","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Susan Mikkelsen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Bjarne Kuno M\u00f8ller","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Thure Haunstrup","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Lene Harritsh\u00f8j","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Bitten Aagaard Jensen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Henrik Hjalgrim","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"S\u00f8ren Thue Lillevang","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Henrik Ullum","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Chuan Liu","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yifei Huang","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Dan Xu","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoguo Li","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Ning Kang","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Qing He","author_inst":"The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Ye Gu","author_inst":"The Sixth People's Hospital of Shenyang"},{"author_name":"Guo Zhang","author_inst":"The People's Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region"},{"author_name":"Chuxiao Shao","author_inst":"Zhejiang University Lishui Hospital & Lishui Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dengxiang Liu","author_inst":"Xingtai People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lin Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xun Li","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Norifumi Kawada","author_inst":"Osaka City University"},{"author_name":"Zicheng Jiang","author_inst":"Ankang Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fengmei Wang","author_inst":"Tianjin Second People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bin Xiong","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College"},{"author_name":"Tetsuo Takehara","author_inst":"Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Don C.

It is significant for prevention and control to model the evolution effectively and efficiently . Methods: We first propose the multi-chain Fudan-CCDC model which is based on the original single-chain model to describe the revival of COVID-19 in some countries. Multi-chains are considered as the superposition of distinctive single chains. Parameter identification is carried out by minimizing the penalty function. Results: From results of numerical simulations, the multi-chain model performs well on data fitting and reasonably interprets the revival phenomena. The band of 25% fluctuation of simulation results could contain most seemly unsteady increments. Conclusion: The multi-chain model has better performance on data fitting in revival situations compared with the single-chain model. It is predicted by the three-chain model with data by Apr 21 that the epidemic curve of Iran would level off on round May 10, and the final cumulative confirmed cases would be around 88820. The upper bound of the 95% confidence interval would be around 96000.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hanshuang Pan","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Nian Shao","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yue Yan","author_inst":"Shanghai University of Finance and Economics"},{"author_name":"Xinyue Luo","author_inst":"Shanghai University of Finance and Economics"},{"author_name":"Ali Ahmadi","author_inst":"Modeling in Health Research Center, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord"},{"author_name":"Yasin Fadaei","author_inst":"Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jin Cheng","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Wenbin Chen","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Patrick Terrence Brooks","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Jens Kjaergaard Boldsen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, DenmarkD"},{"author_name":"Christina Mikkelsen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Mikkel Gybel-Brask","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Erik S\u00f8rensen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Khoa Manh Dinh","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Susan Mikkelsen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Bjarne Kuno M\u00f8ller","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Thure Haunstrup","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Lene Harritsh\u00f8j","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Bitten Aagaard Jensen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Henrik Hjalgrim","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"S\u00f8ren Thue Lillevang","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Henrik Ullum","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Chuan Liu","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yifei Huang","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Dan Xu","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoguo Li","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Ning Kang","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Qing He","author_inst":"The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Ye Gu","author_inst":"The Sixth People's Hospital of Shenyang"},{"author_name":"Guo Zhang","author_inst":"The People's Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region"},{"author_name":"Chuxiao Shao","author_inst":"Zhejiang University Lishui Hospital & Lishui Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dengxiang Liu","author_inst":"Xingtai People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lin Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xun Li","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Norifumi Kawada","author_inst":"Osaka City University"},{"author_name":"Zicheng Jiang","author_inst":"Ankang Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fengmei Wang","author_inst":"Tianjin Second People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bin Xiong","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College"},{"author_name":"Tetsuo Takehara","author_inst":"Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Don C.

Objective: To determine sociodemographic, health-related, risk-related, and instruction-related factors that predict non-adherence to instructions for the COVID-19 pandemic. Design: Cross-sectional survey in Israel collected between March 28 and April 10, 2020. Setting: Population-based study. Participants: A convenience sample completed an online survey. Exposures: Sociodemographic, health-related, risk-related, and instruction-related characteristics of the participants that have been linked to adherence to medical instructions. Main Outcome and Measure: Non-adherence to instructions defined by a mean score of less than 4 on a 1 to 5 adherence scale consisting of 19 instruction items. Results: Among 654 participants (413 [64.8%] female, age 40.14 [15.23] years), 28.7% were defined as non-adherents. Non-adherence was associated with male gender [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.54, CI 1.03-2.31], not having children [aOR = 1.73, 1.13-2.65], smoking [aOR = 2.27, CI 1.42-3.62], high levels of ADHD symptoms [aOR = 1.55, CI 1.07-2.25], high levels of past risk-taking behavior [aOR = 1.41, CI 1.10-1.81], as well as by current high psychological distress [aOR = 1.51, CI 1.14-2.01], low perceived risk of COVID-19 [aOR = 1.52, CI 1.22-1.89], low exposure to the instructions [aOR = 1.45, CI 1.14-1.82], and low perceived efficacy of the instructions [aOR = 1.47, CI 1.16-1.85]. Adjusted OR of age, economic status, physical health status, and exposure to media did not reach the significance level. Conclusions and Relevance People with the above characteristics may have increased risk for non-adherence to public health instructions.

Our comparison is based on a computerized simulation integrating accumulated SARS-CoV-2 epidemiological knowledge. Our results stress the importance of immediate on-symptom isolation of suspected cases and household members, and the beneficial effects of prompt testing capacity. Our findings expose significant epidemic-suppression differences among strategies with seemingly similar economic cost stressing the importance of not just the portion of population and business that is released, but also the pattern. The most effective building blocks are the ones that integrate several base strategies - they allow to release large portions of the population while still achieving diminishing viral spread. However, it may come with a price on somewhat more complex schemes. For example, our simulations indicate that a personal isolation of 4 days once every two weeks, for example a long weekend (Fri-Mon) self-isolation once every two weeks, while protecting the 5% most sensitive population would reduce R well below 1 even if ten percent of the population do not follow it. This kind of integrated strategy can be either voluntary or mandatory and enforced. We further simulate the contrasting approach of a stratified population release in a hope to achieve herd immunity, which for the time being seems inferior to other suggested building blocks. Knowing the tradeoff between building blocks could help optimize exit strategies to be more effective and suitable for a particular area or country, while maximizing human life as well as economic value. Given our results, we believe that pandemic can be controlled within a reasonable amount of time and at a reasonable socio-economic burden.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elad Barkan","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Smadar Shilo","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Yeela Talmor-Barkan","author_inst":"Rabin Medical Center (Beilinson and Hasharon Hospitals)"},{"author_name":"Itai Berger","author_inst":"The Hebrew University of Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Ali Ahmadi","author_inst":"Modeling in Health Research Center, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord"},{"author_name":"Yasin Fadaei","author_inst":"Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jin Cheng","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Wenbin Chen","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Patrick Terrence Brooks","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Jens Kjaergaard Boldsen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, DenmarkD"},{"author_name":"Christina Mikkelsen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Mikkel Gybel-Brask","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Erik S\u00f8rensen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Khoa Manh Dinh","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Susan Mikkelsen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Bjarne Kuno M\u00f8ller","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Thure Haunstrup","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Lene Harritsh\u00f8j","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Bitten Aagaard Jensen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Henrik Hjalgrim","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"S\u00f8ren Thue Lillevang","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Henrik Ullum","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Chuan Liu","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yifei Huang","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Dan Xu","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoguo Li","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Ning Kang","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Qing He","author_inst":"The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Ye Gu","author_inst":"The Sixth People's Hospital of Shenyang"},{"author_name":"Guo Zhang","author_inst":"The People's Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region"},{"author_name":"Chuxiao Shao","author_inst":"Zhejiang University Lishui Hospital & Lishui Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dengxiang Liu","author_inst":"Xingtai People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lin Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xun Li","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Norifumi Kawada","author_inst":"Osaka City University"},{"author_name":"Zicheng Jiang","author_inst":"Ankang Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fengmei Wang","author_inst":"Tianjin Second People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bin Xiong","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College"},{"author_name":"Tetsuo Takehara","author_inst":"Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Don C.

In order to address this need, we have developed a highly sensitive RT-LAMP assay compatible with current reagents, that utilizes a colorimetric readout in as little as 30 minutes. In addition to this, we have developed an inexpensive pipeline to further increase sensitivity without requiring highly specialized equipment. A rapid inactivation protocol capable of inactivating virions, as well as endogenous nucleases, was also developed to increase sensitivity and sample stability. This protocol, combined with our RT-LAMP assay, has a sensitivity of at least 50 viral RNA copies per microliter in a sample. To further increase the sensitivity, a purification protocol compatible with this inactivation method was developed. The inactivation and purification protocol, combined with our RT-LAMP assay, brings the sensitivity to at least 1 viral RNA copy per microliter in a sample. We hope that this inactivation and purification pipeline, which costs approximately $0.07 per sample and which uses readily available reagents, will increase the availability of SARS-CoV-2 testing, as well as expand the settings in which this testing can be performed.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brian A Rabe","author_inst":"Harvard University Medical School"},{"author_name":"Constance Cepko","author_inst":"Harvard University Medical School"},{"author_name":"Yeela Talmor-Barkan","author_inst":"Rabin Medical Center (Beilinson and Hasharon Hospitals)"},{"author_name":"Itai Berger","author_inst":"The Hebrew University of Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Ali Ahmadi","author_inst":"Modeling in Health Research Center, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord"},{"author_name":"Yasin Fadaei","author_inst":"Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jin Cheng","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Wenbin Chen","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Patrick Terrence Brooks","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Jens Kjaergaard Boldsen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, DenmarkD"},{"author_name":"Christina Mikkelsen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Mikkel Gybel-Brask","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Erik S\u00f8rensen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Khoa Manh Dinh","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Susan Mikkelsen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Bjarne Kuno M\u00f8ller","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Thure Haunstrup","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Lene Harritsh\u00f8j","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Bitten Aagaard Jensen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Henrik Hjalgrim","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"S\u00f8ren Thue Lillevang","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Henrik Ullum","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Chuan Liu","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yifei Huang","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Dan Xu","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoguo Li","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Ning Kang","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Qing He","author_inst":"The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Ye Gu","author_inst":"The Sixth People's Hospital of Shenyang"},{"author_name":"Guo Zhang","author_inst":"The People's Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region"},{"author_name":"Chuxiao Shao","author_inst":"Zhejiang University Lishui Hospital & Lishui Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dengxiang Liu","author_inst":"Xingtai People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lin Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xun Li","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Norifumi Kawada","author_inst":"Osaka City University"},{"author_name":"Zicheng Jiang","author_inst":"Ankang Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fengmei Wang","author_inst":"Tianjin Second People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bin Xiong","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College"},{"author_name":"Tetsuo Takehara","author_inst":"Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Don C.

Available evidence is limited to a few retrospective observational studies with small number of patients. We did a meta-analysis to assess the effect of ACEi\/ARB in patients with COVID-19 on severity of disease, risk for hospitalisation, and death compared to those not on ACEi\/ARB. We searched the Cochrane library, PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrial.gov and medRxiv for studies published until 25.04.2020. Inclusion criteria included all studies with patients with confirmed COVID-19 either taking, or not taking, ACEi\/ARB. Depending on degree of heterogeneity, fixed or random effect model was selected to calculate effect size (Odds ratio). Results: Six studies were eligible for this meta-analysis. These included 423 patients on ACEi\/ARB, and 1419 not on ACEi\/ARB. Compared to patients with COVID-19 not on ACEi\/ARB, there was a statistically significant 43% reduction (OR 0.57, CI: 0.37-0.88, I2: 0.000) in the odds of death in those on ACEi\/ARB. There was a statistically non-significant 38% reduction (OR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.31-1.23, I2=70.36) in the odds of developing severe disease and 19% reduction (OR 0.81; 95% CI: 0.42-1.55, I2: 0.000) in the odds of hospitalisation among those on ACEi\/ARB. Discussion: It is safe to use ACEi\/ARB in patients with COVID-19 requiring these medications for associated comorbidities. Although limited by confounding factors typical of a meta-analysis of retrospective observational studies, our data suggests that use of these medications may reduce the odds of death. Conclusion: Our meta-analysis of the updated studies on SARS-CoV-2 reassures the medical fraternity on the use of and continuation of ACEi\/ARB, supporting all recent recommendations .","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"SAMIT GHOSAL","author_inst":"Nightingale Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jagat Jyoti Mukherjee","author_inst":"Apollo Gleneagles Hospital, Kolkata, India"},{"author_name":"Binayak Sinha","author_inst":"AMRI Hospitals, Kolkata, India"},{"author_name":"Kalyan Kumar Gangopadhyay","author_inst":"Fortis & Peerless Hospital, Kolkata, India"},{"author_name":"Ali Ahmadi","author_inst":"Modeling in Health Research Center, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord"},{"author_name":"Yasin Fadaei","author_inst":"Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jin Cheng","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Wenbin Chen","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Patrick Terrence Brooks","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Jens Kjaergaard Boldsen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, DenmarkD"},{"author_name":"Christina Mikkelsen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Mikkel Gybel-Brask","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Erik S\u00f8rensen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Khoa Manh Dinh","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Susan Mikkelsen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Bjarne Kuno M\u00f8ller","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Thure Haunstrup","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Lene Harritsh\u00f8j","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Bitten Aagaard Jensen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Henrik Hjalgrim","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"S\u00f8ren Thue Lillevang","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Henrik Ullum","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Chuan Liu","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yifei Huang","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Dan Xu","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoguo Li","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Ning Kang","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Qing He","author_inst":"The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Ye Gu","author_inst":"The Sixth People's Hospital of Shenyang"},{"author_name":"Guo Zhang","author_inst":"The People's Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region"},{"author_name":"Chuxiao Shao","author_inst":"Zhejiang University Lishui Hospital & Lishui Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dengxiang Liu","author_inst":"Xingtai People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lin Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xun Li","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Norifumi Kawada","author_inst":"Osaka City University"},{"author_name":"Zicheng Jiang","author_inst":"Ankang Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fengmei Wang","author_inst":"Tianjin Second People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bin Xiong","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College"},{"author_name":"Tetsuo Takehara","author_inst":"Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Don C.

Some report possible curative effects, others do not. In order to shed some light on this rather controversial topic, we used mathematical modelling to simulate possible scenarios of response to hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients. Our computer-aided simulations show that hydroxychloroquine may have an impact on the amplitude of the viral load peak but that viral clearance is not significantly accelerated if the drug is not administered early enough (i.e. when viral loads range from 1 to 1,000 copies\/mL). Although some authors had used the trough plasma concentrations or the theoretical drug distribution in the lung to model the effect of chloroquine\/hydroxychloroquine on COVID-19, the theoretical drug response based on the trough whole blood concentrations of the drug agreed well with the results of the clinical trials so far reported. Moreover, the effects of chloroquine\/hydroxychloroquine could be fully explained when taking into account also the capacity of this drug to raise cell-mediated responses against the productively SARS-Cov-2-infected cells. On the whole, the present study suggests that chloroquine\/hydroxychloroquine has a narrow therapeutic window, which overlaps with the highest tolerated doses. These considerations may have implications for development of anti-COVID-19 combination therapies and prevention strategies.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrea Savarino","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Italian Institute of Health, Rome, Italy."},{"author_name":"Mohammad Tarek","author_inst":"Bioinformatics Department, Armed Forces College of Medicine (AFCM), Cairo, Egypt."},{"author_name":"Binayak Sinha","author_inst":"AMRI Hospitals, Kolkata, India"},{"author_name":"Kalyan Kumar Gangopadhyay","author_inst":"Fortis & Peerless Hospital, Kolkata, India"},{"author_name":"Ali Ahmadi","author_inst":"Modeling in Health Research Center, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord"},{"author_name":"Yasin Fadaei","author_inst":"Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jin Cheng","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Wenbin Chen","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Patrick Terrence Brooks","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Jens Kjaergaard Boldsen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, DenmarkD"},{"author_name":"Christina Mikkelsen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Mikkel Gybel-Brask","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Erik S\u00f8rensen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Khoa Manh Dinh","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Susan Mikkelsen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Bjarne Kuno M\u00f8ller","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital and Department of Clinical Medicine Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Thure Haunstrup","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Lene Harritsh\u00f8j","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Bitten Aagaard Jensen","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Henrik Hjalgrim","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"S\u00f8ren Thue Lillevang","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Henrik Ullum","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Chuan Liu","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yifei Huang","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Dan Xu","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoguo Li","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Ning Kang","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Qing He","author_inst":"The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Ye Gu","author_inst":"The Sixth People's Hospital of Shenyang"},{"author_name":"Guo Zhang","author_inst":"The People's Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region"},{"author_name":"Chuxiao Shao","author_inst":"Zhejiang University Lishui Hospital & Lishui Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dengxiang Liu","author_inst":"Xingtai People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lin Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xun Li","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Norifumi Kawada","author_inst":"Osaka City University"},{"author_name":"Zicheng Jiang","author_inst":"Ankang Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fengmei Wang","author_inst":"Tianjin Second People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bin Xiong","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College"},{"author_name":"Tetsuo Takehara","author_inst":"Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Don C.

Design: Prospective observational cohort study with rapid data gathering and near real-time analysis, using a pre-approved questionnaire adopted by the WHO. Setting: 166 UK hospitals between 6th February and 18th April 2020. Participants: 16,749 people with COVID-19. Interventions: No interventions were performed, but with consent samples were taken for research purposes. Many participants were co-enrolled in other interventional studies and clinical trials. Results: The median age was 72 years [IQR 57, 82; range 0, 104], the median duration of symptoms before admission was 4 days [IQR 1,8] and the median duration of hospital stay was 7 days [IQR 4,12]. The commonest comorbidities were chronic cardiac disease (29%), uncomplicated diabetes (19%), non-asthmatic chronic pulmonary disease (19%) and asthma (14%); 47% had no documented reported comorbidity. Increased age and comorbidities including obesity were associated with a higher probability of mortality. Distinct clusters of symptoms were found: 1. respiratory (cough, sputum, sore throat, runny nose, ear pain, wheeze, and chest pain); 2. systemic (myalgia, joint pain and fatigue); 3. enteric (abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea). Overall, 49% of patients were discharged alive, 33% have died and 17% continued to receive care at date of reporting. 17% required admission to High Dependency or Intensive Care Units; of these, 31% were discharged alive, 45% died and 24% continued to receive care at the reporting date. Of those receiving mechanical ventilation, 20% were discharged alive, 53% died and 27% remained in hospital. Conclusions: We present the largest detailed description of COVID-19 in Europe, demonstrating the importance of pandemic preparedness and the need to maintain readiness to launch research studies in response to outbreaks.

The COVID-19 disease course is strikingly divergent. Approximately 80-85% of patients experience mild or no symptoms, while the remainder develop severe disease. The mechanisms underlying these divergent outcomes are unclear. Emerging health disparities data regarding African American and homeless populations suggest that vitamin D insufficiency (VDI) may be an underlying driver of COVID-19 severity. To better define the VDI-COVID-19 link, we determined the prevalence of VDI among our COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Methods: In an Institutional Review Board approved study performed at a single, tertiary care academic medical center, the medical records of COVID-19 patients were retrospectively reviewed. Subjects were included for whom serum 25-hydroxycholecalcifoerol (25OHD) levels were determined. COVID-19-relevant data were compiled and analyzed. We determined the frequency of VDI among COVID-19 patients to evaluate the likelihood of a VDI-COVID-19 relationship. Results: Twenty COVID-19 patients with serum 25OHD levels were identified; 65.0% required ICU admission.The VDI prevalence in ICU patients was 84.6%, vs. 57.1% in floor patients. Strikingly, 100% of ICU patients less than 75 years old had VDI. Coagulopathy was present in 62.5% of ICU COVID-19 patients, and 92.3% were lymphocytopenic. Conclusions: VDI is highly prevalent in severe COVID-19 patients. VDI and severe COVID-19 share numerous associations including hypertension, obesity, male sex, advanced age, concentration in northern climates, coagulopathy, and immune dysfunction. Thus, we suggest that prospective, randomized controlled studies of VDI in COVID-19 patients are warranted.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Frank H.

It is essential to investigate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 and uncover potential risk factors for severe disease to reduce the overall mortality rate of COVID-19. Methods Sixty-one critical COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and 93 severe non-ICU patients at Huoshenshan Hospital (Wuhan, China) were included in this study. Medical records, including demographic, platelet counts, heparin-involved treatments, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia-(HIT) related laboratory tests, and fatal outcomes of COVID-19 patients were analyzed and compared between survivors and nonsurvivors. Findings Sixty-one critical COVID-19 patients treated in ICU included 15 survivors and 46 nonsurvivors. Forty-one percent of them (25\/61) had severe thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count (PLT) less than 50x109\/L, of whom 76% (19\/25) had a platelet decrease of >50% compared to baseline; 96% of these patients (24\/25) had a fatal outcome. Among the 46 nonsurvivors, 52.2% (24\/46) had severe thrombocytopenia, compared to 6.7% (1\/15) among survivors. Moreover, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) could induce a significant decrease in PLT in 81.3% of critical CRRT patients (13\/16), resulting in a fatal outcome. In addition, a high level of anti-heparin-PF4 antibodies, a marker of HIT, was observed in most ICU patients. Surprisingly, HIT occurred not only in patients with heparin exposure, such as CRRT, but also in heparin-naive patients, suggesting that spontaneous HIT may occur in COVID-19. Interpretation Anti-heparin-PF4 antibodies are induced in critical COVID-19 patients, resulting in a progressive platelet decrease. Exposure to a high dose of heparin may trigger further severe thrombocytopenia with a fatal outcome. An alternative anticoagulant other than heparin should be used to treat COVID-19 patients in critical condition.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xuan Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Xiaopeng Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yongjiu Xiao","author_inst":"The 940th Hospital of the People Liberation Army"},{"author_name":"Ting Gao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Guangfei Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Zhongyi Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Zhang Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yong Hu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Qincai Dong","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Songtao Zhao","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Li Yu","author_inst":"the 969th Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army Joint Logistics Support Force"},{"author_name":"Shuwei Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Hongzhen Li","author_inst":"Joinn Laboratories (China) Co.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) listed several criteria that define high-risk individuals, but multivariable prediction models may allow for a more accurate and granular risk evaluation. In the early days of the pandemic, when individual level data required for training prediction models was not available, a large healthcare organization developed a prediction model for supporting its COVID-19 policy using a hybrid strategy. The model was constructed on a baseline predictor to rank patients according to their risk for severe respiratory infection or sepsis (trained using over one-million patient records) and was then post-processed to calibrate the predictions to reported COVID-19 case fatality rates. Since its deployment in mid-March, this predictor was integrated into many decision-processes in the organization that involved allocating limited resources. With the accumulation of enough COVID-19 patients, the predictor was validated for its accuracy in predicting COVID-19 mortality among all COVID-19 cases in the organization (3,176, 3.1% death rate). The predictor was found to have good discrimination, with an area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve of 0.942. Calibration was also good, with a marked improvement compared to the calibration of the baseline model when evaluated for the COVID-19 mortality outcome. While the CDC criteria identify 41% of the population as high-risk with a resulting sensitivity of 97%, a 5% absolute risk cutoff by the model tags only 14% to be at high-risk while still achieving a sensitivity of 90%. To summarize, we found that even in the midst of a pandemic, shrouded in epidemiologic \"fog of war\" and with no individual level data, it was possible to provide a useful predictor with good discrimination and calibration.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Noam Barda","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Innovation Division, Clalit Health Services, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Dan Riesel","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Innovation Division, Clalit Health Services, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Amichay Akriv","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Innovation Division, Clalit Health Services, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Joseph Levi","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Innovation Division, Clalit Health Services, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Uriah Finkel","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Innovation Division, Clalit Health Services, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Gal Yona","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel"},{"author_name":"Daniel Greenfeld","author_inst":"Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Management, Technion University, Haifa, Israel"},{"author_name":"Shimon Sheiba","author_inst":"Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Management, Technion University, Haifa, Israel"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Somer","author_inst":"Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Management, Technion University, Haifa, Israel"},{"author_name":"Eitan Bachmat","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Be'er Sheva, Israel"},{"author_name":"Guy N Rothblum","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel"},{"author_name":"Uri Shalit","author_inst":"Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Management, Technion University, Haifa, Israel"},{"author_name":"Doron Netzer","author_inst":"Community Medical Services Division, Clalit Health Services, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ran Balicer","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Innovation Division, Clalit Health Services, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Noa Dagan","author_inst":"Clalit Research Institute, Innovation Division, Clalit Health Services, Tel Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Xiuwu Bian","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qing Mao","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical University"},{"author_name":"Cheng Cao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Jonathan S Nguyen-Van-Tam","author_inst":"Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Nottingham School of Medicine, Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Jake Dunning","author_inst":"National Infection Service, Public Health England and Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Peter JM Openshaw","author_inst":"National Heart and Lung Division, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"J Kenneth Baillie","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Malcolm Gracie Semple","author_inst":"NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Emerging and Zoonotic Infections, and Institute of Translational Medicine, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Universi"},{"author_name":"Yifei Huang","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Dan Xu","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoguo Li","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Ning Kang","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Qing He","author_inst":"The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Ye Gu","author_inst":"The Sixth People's Hospital of Shenyang"},{"author_name":"Guo Zhang","author_inst":"The People's Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region"},{"author_name":"Chuxiao Shao","author_inst":"Zhejiang University Lishui Hospital & Lishui Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dengxiang Liu","author_inst":"Xingtai People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lin Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xun Li","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Norifumi Kawada","author_inst":"Osaka City University"},{"author_name":"Zicheng Jiang","author_inst":"Ankang Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fengmei Wang","author_inst":"Tianjin Second People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bin Xiong","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College"},{"author_name":"Tetsuo Takehara","author_inst":"Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Don C.
