The goals of this study were to use artificial intelligence (AI) to predict blueprints for designing universal vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, that contain a sufficiently broad repertoire of T-cell epitopes capable of providing coverage and protection across the global population. To help achieve these aims, we profiled the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome across the most frequent 100 HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-DR alleles in the human population, using host-infected cell surface antigen presentation and immunogenicity predictors from the NEC Immune Profiler suite of tools, and generated comprehensive epitope maps. We then used these epitope maps as input for a Monte Carlo simulation designed to identify statistically significant \"epitope hotspot\" regions in the virus that are most likely to be immunogenic across a broad spectrum of HLA types. We then removed epitope hotspots that shared significant homology with proteins in the human proteome to reduce the chance of inducing off-target autoimmune responses. We also analyzed the antigen presentation and immunogenic landscape of all the nonsynonymous mutations across 3400 different sequences of the virus, to identify a trend whereby SARS-COV-2 mutations are predicted to have reduced potential to be presented by host-infected cells, and consequently detected by the host immune system. A sequence conservation analysis then removed epitope hotspots that occurred in less-conserved regions of the viral proteome. Finally, we used a database of the HLA genotypes of approximately 22 000 individuals to develop a \"digital twin\" type simulation to model how effective different combinations of hotspots would work in a diverse human population, and used the approach to identify an optimal constellation of epitopes hotspots that could provide maximum coverage in the global population. By combining the antigen presentation to the infected-host cell surface and immunogenicity predictions of the NEC Immune Profiler with a robust Monte Carlo and digital twin simulation, we have managed to profile the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome and identify a subset of epitope hotspots that could be harnessed in a vaccine formulation to provide a broad coverage across the global population.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brandon Malone","author_inst":"NEC Laboratories Europe GmbH"},{"author_name":"Boris Simovski","author_inst":"NEC OncoImmunity AS"},{"author_name":"Clement Moline","author_inst":"NEC OncoImmunity AS"},{"author_name":"Jun Cheng","author_inst":"NEC Laboratories Europe GmbH"},{"author_name":"Marius Gheorghe","author_inst":"NEC OncoImmunity AS"},{"author_name":"Hugues Fontenelle","author_inst":"NEC OncoImmunity AS"},{"author_name":"Ioannis Vardaxis","author_inst":"NEC OncoImmunity AS"},{"author_name":"Simen Tennoe","author_inst":"NEC OncoImmunity AS"},{"author_name":"Jenny-Ann Malmberg","author_inst":"NEC OncoImmunity AS"},{"author_name":"Richard Stratford","author_inst":"NEC OncoImmunity AS"},{"author_name":"Trevor Clancy","author_inst":"NEC OncoImmunity AS"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.21.053058","rel_title":"Inhibition of PIKfyve kinase prevents infection by EBOV and SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-04-21","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.21.053058","rel_abs":"Virus entry is a multistep process. It initiates when the virus attaches to the host cell and ends when the viral contents reach the cytosol. Genetically unrelated viruses can subvert analogous subcellular mechanisms and use similar trafficking pathways for successful entry. Antiviral strategies targeting early steps of infection are therefore appealing, particularly when the probability for successful interference through a common step is highest. We describe here potent inhibitory effects on content release and infection by chimeric VSV containing the envelope proteins of Zaire ebolavirus (VSV-ZEBOV) or SARS-CoV-2 (VSV-SARS-CoV-2) elicited by Apilimod and Vacuolin-1, small molecule inhibitors of the main endosomal Phosphatidylinositol-3-Phosphate\/Phosphatidylinositol 5-Kinase, PIKfyve. We also describe potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 strain 2019-nCoV\/USA-WA1\/2020 by Apilimod.

However, there is a segment of high amino acid similarity between human SARS-CoV-2 and a pangolin isolated strain, GD410721, in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, a pattern that can be caused by either recombination or by convergent amino acid evolution driven by natural selection. We perform a detailed analysis of the synonymous divergence, which is less likely to be affected by selection than amino acid divergence, between human SARS-CoV-2 and related strains. We show that the synonymous divergence between the bat derived viruses and SARS-CoV-2 is larger than between GD410721 and SARS-CoV-2 in the RBD, providing strong additional support for the recombination hypothesis. However, the synonymous divergence between pangolin strain and SARS-CoV-2 is also relatively high, which is not consistent with a recent recombination between them, instead it suggests a recombination into RaTG13. We also find a 14-fold increase in the dN\/dS ratio from the lineage leading to SARS-CoV-2 to the strains of the current pandemic, suggesting that the vast majority of non-synonymous mutations currently segregating within the human strains have a negative impact on viral fitness. Finally, we estimate that the time to the most recent common ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 or RmYN02 based on synonymous divergence, is 51.71 years (95% C.I., 28.11-75.31) and 37.02 years (95% C.I., 18.19-55.85), respectively.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rasmus Nielsen","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Hongru Wang","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Lenore Pipes","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Zhuoming Liu","author_inst":"Washington University in Saint Louis"},{"author_name":"Timothy K Soh","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"David Cureton","author_inst":"Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health, Inc"},{"author_name":"James Brett Case","author_inst":"Washington University in Saint Louis"},{"author_name":"Rita E Chen","author_inst":"Washington University in Saint Louis"},{"author_name":"Michael S Diamond","author_inst":"Washington University in Saint Louis"},{"author_name":"Sean P.J.

Many biotechnology laboratories are rushing to develop therapeutic antibodies and antiviral drugs for treatment of this viral disease. The viral CoV spike (S) glycoprotein is one of the main targets for pharmacological intervention. Its receptor-binding domain (RBD) interacts with the human ACE2 receptor ensuring the entry of the viral genomes into the host cell. In this work, we report on the differences in the binding of the RBD of the previous coronavirus SARS-CoV and of the newer 2019-nCoV coronavirus to the human ACE2 receptor using atomistic molecular dynamics techniques. Our results show major mutations in the 2019-nCoV RBD with respect to the SARS-CoV RBD occurring at the interface of RBD-ACE2 complex. These mutations make the 2019-nCoV RBD protein backbone much more flexible, hydrophobic interactions are reduced and additional polar\/charged residues appear at the interface. We observe that higher flexibility of the 2019-nCoV RBD with respect to the SARS-CoV RBD leads to a bigger binding interface between the 2019-nCoV RBD and ACE2 and to about 20% more contacts between them in comparison with SARS-CoV. Taken together, the 2019-nCoV RBD shows more stable binding interface and higher binding affinity for the ACE2 receptor. The mutations not only stabilize the binding interface, they also lead to overall more stable 2019-nCoV RBD protein structure, even far from the binding interface. Our results on the molecular differences in the binding between the two viruses can provide important inputs for development of appropriate antiviral treatments of the new viruses, addressing the necessity of ongoing pandemics.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Toan The Nguyen","author_inst":"University of Science, Vietnam National University - Hanoi"},{"author_name":"Hien Thi Thu Lai","author_inst":"University of Science, Vietnam National University - Hanoi"},{"author_name":"Ly Hai Nguyen","author_inst":"University of Science, Vietnam National University - Hanoi"},{"author_name":"Duc Nguyen-Manh","author_inst":"United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority"},{"author_name":"Agata The Kranjc Pietrucci","author_inst":"Institut National de la Transfusion Sanguine"},{"author_name":"David Cureton","author_inst":"Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health, Inc"},{"author_name":"James Brett Case","author_inst":"Washington University in Saint Louis"},{"author_name":"Rita E Chen","author_inst":"Washington University in Saint Louis"},{"author_name":"Michael S Diamond","author_inst":"Washington University in Saint Louis"},{"author_name":"Sean P.J.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that coronavirus COVID19 is an international pandemic. The Real-Time Reverse transcription polymerase Chain Reaction (RTPCR) has a low positive and sensitivity rate in the early stage of COVID19. As a result, the Computed Tomography (CT) imaging is used for diagnosing. COVID19 has different key signs on a CT scan differ from other viral pneumonia. These signs include ground glass opacities, consolidations, and crazy paving. In this paper, an Artificial Intelligence-inspired Model for COVID19 Diagnosis and Prediction for Patient Response to Treatment (AIMDP) is proposed. AIMDP model has two main functions reflected in two proposed modules, namely, the Diagnosis Module (DM) and Prediction Module (PM). The Diagnosis Module (DM) is proposed for early and accurately detecting the patients with COVID 19 and distinguish it from other viral pneumonias using COVID19 signs obtained from CT scans. The DM model, uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as a Deep learning technique for segmentation, can process hundreds of CT images in seconds to speed up diagnosis of COVID19 and contribute in its containment. In addition, some countries have no ability to provide all patients with the treatment and intensive care services, so it will be mandatory to give treatment to only responding patients. In this context, the Prediction Module (PM) is proposed for predicting the ability of the patient to respond to treatment based on different factors e.g. age, infection stage, respiratory failure, multi-organ failure and the treatment regimens. PM implement the Whale Optimization Algorithm for selecting the most relevant patients features. The experimental results show promising performance for the proposed diagnosing and prediction modules, using a dataset with hundreds of real data and CT images.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sally M.

The virus from another cluster of two family members living together without travel history but with a sick contact of a confirmed case from another city outside of Hubei accumulated significantly more mutations (9 SNPs vs average 4 SNPs), suggesting a complex and dynamic nature of this outbreak.

Approaches to efficient management are urgently needed. We aimed to develop and validate a score for early prediction of clinical deterioration of COVID-19 patients. Methods: In this retrospective multicenter cohort study, we included 1138 mild to moderate COVID-19 patients admitted to 33 hospitals in Guangdong Province from December 27, 2019 to March 4, 2020 (N =818; training cohort), as well as two hospitals in Hubei Province from January 21 to February 22, 2020 (N =320; validation cohort) in the analysis. Results: The 14-day cumulative incidences of clinical deterioration were 7.9% and 12.1% in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. An Early WArning Score (EWAS) (ranging from 0 to 4.5), comprising of age, underlying chronic disease, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein, and D-dimer levels, was developed (AUROC: 0.857). By applying the EWAS, patients were categorized into low-, medium-, and high risk groups (cut-off values: two and three). The 14-day cumulative incidence of clinical deterioration in the low-risk group was 1.8%, which was significantly lower than the incidence rates in the medium- (14.4%) and high-risk (40.9%) groups (P <.001). The predictability of EWAS was similar in the validation cohort (AUROC =0.781), patients in the low-, medium-, and high-risk groups had 14-day cumulative incidences of 2.6%, 10.0%, and 25.7%, respectively (P <.001). Conclusion: The EWAS, which is based on five common parameters, can predict COVID-19-related clinical deterioration and may be a useful tool for a rapid triage and establishing a COVID-19 hierarchical management system that will greatly focus clinical management and medical resources to reduce mortality in highly endemic areas.","rel_num_authors":30,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yabing Guo","author_inst":"Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yingxia Liu","author_inst":"National Clinical Research Centre for Infectious Disease, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Tec"},{"author_name":"Jiatao Lu","author_inst":"Wuhan Hankou Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rong Fan","author_inst":"Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fuchun Zhang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xueru Yin","author_inst":"Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhihong Liu","author_inst":"Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Qinglang Zeng","author_inst":"Honghu People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jing Yuan","author_inst":"National Clinical Research Centre for Infectious Disease, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Tec"},{"author_name":"Shufang Hu","author_inst":"Wuhan Hankou Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qiongya Wang","author_inst":"Wuhan Hankou Hospital"},{"author_name":"Baolin Liao","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mingxing Huang","author_inst":"The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Sichun Yin","author_inst":"The Ninth Dongguan People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xilin Zhang","author_inst":"The Fourth Foshan People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rui Xin","author_inst":"Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhanzhou Lin","author_inst":"Huizhou Central People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Changzheng Hu","author_inst":"Jiangmen Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Boliang Zhao","author_inst":"The First Zhaoqing People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ridong He","author_inst":"Zhanjiang Central People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Minfeng Liang","author_inst":"The First Foshan People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"National Clinical Research Centre for Infectious Disease, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Tec"},{"author_name":"Li Liu","author_inst":"Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jian Sun","author_inst":"Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Lu Tang","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Lisi Deng","author_inst":"The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jinyu Xia","author_inst":"The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoping Tang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"National Clinical Research Centre for Infectious Disease, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Tec"},{"author_name":"Jinlin Hou","author_inst":"Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.15.20064931","rel_title":"Sequencing analysis of the spread of SARS-CoV2 in the Greater New York City region","rel_date":"2020-04-21","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.15.20064931","rel_abs":"Effective public response to a pandemic relies upon accurate measurement of the extent and dynamics of an outbreak.

Patients were categorized based on their exposure to hydroxychloroquine alone (HC) or with azithromycin (HC+AZ) as treatments in addition to standard supportive management for Covid-19. The two primary outcomes were death and the need for mechanical ventilation. We determined the association between treatment and the primary outcomes using competing risk hazard regression adjusting for clinical characteristics via propensity scores. Discharge and death were taken into account as competing risks and subdistribution hazard ratios are presented. RESULTS: A total of 368 patients were evaluated (HC, n=97; HC+AZ, n=113; no HC, n=158). Rates of death in the HC, HC+AZ, and no HC groups were 27.8%, 22.1%, 11.4%, respectively. Rates of ventilation in the HC, HC+AZ, and no HC groups were 13.3%, 6.9%, 14.1%, respectively. Compared to the no HC group, the risk of death from any cause was higher in the HC group (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.10 to 6.17; P=0.03) but not in the HC+AZ group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.56 to 2.32; P=0.72). The risk of ventilation was similar in the HC group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.53 to 3.79; P=0.48) and in the HC+AZ group (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.16 to 1.12; P=0.09), compared to the no HC group. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found no evidence that use of hydroxychloroquine, either with or without azithromycin, reduced the risk of mechanical ventilation in patients hospitalized with Covid-19. An association of increased overall mortality was identified in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone. These findings highlight the importance of awaiting the results of ongoing prospective, randomized, controlled studies before widespread adoption of these drugs.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joseph Magagnoli","author_inst":"University of South Carolina"},{"author_name":"Siddharth Narendran","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Felipe Pereira","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Tammy Cummings","author_inst":"Dorn Research Institute, Columbia VA Health Care System"},{"author_name":"James W Hardin","author_inst":"University of South Carolina"},{"author_name":"S Scott Sutton","author_inst":"University of South Carolina"},{"author_name":"Jayakrishna Ambati","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Gael Westby","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Guomiao Shen","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xiaojun Feng","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Megan S Hogan","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Manon Ragonnet-Cronin","author_inst":"MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis and Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Lily Geidelberg","author_inst":"MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis and Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Christian Marier","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Peter Meyn","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yutong Zhang","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Cadley","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Raquel Ordonez","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Raven Luther","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Emily Huang","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Emily Guzman","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Carolina Arguelles-Grande","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kimon V Argyropoulos","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Margaret Black","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Antonio Serrano","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Melissa E Call","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Min Jae Kim","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Brendan Belovarac","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tatyana Gindin","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andrew Lytle","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jared Pinnell","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Theodore Vougiouklakis","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Chen","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lawrence H Lin","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Amy Rapkiewicz","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Raabe","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Marie I Samanovic","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"George Jour","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Iman Osman","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Maria Aguero-Rosenfeld","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark J Mulligan","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Erik M Volz","author_inst":"MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis and Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Paolo Cotzia","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Matija Snuderl","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adriana Heguy","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.16.20062141","rel_title":"Estimating the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on documented infections with COVID-19: A cross-country analysis","rel_date":"2020-04-21","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.16.20062141","rel_abs":"Background: The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly evolved into a global epidemic. To control its spread, countries have implemented non pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as school or border closures, while others have even enforced complete lockdowns. Here we study the impact of NPIs in reducing documented cases of COVID-19. Documented case numbers are selected because they are essential for decision-makers in the area of health-policy when monitoring and evaluating current control mechanisms. Methods: We empirically estimate the relative reduction in the number of new cases attributed to each NPI. A cross-country analysis is performed using documented cases through April 15, 2020 from n=20 countries (i.e., the United States, Canada, Australia, the EU-15 countries, Norway, and Switzerland). Results: As of April 15, venue closures were associated with a reduction in the number of new cases by 36 % (95% credible interval [CrI] 20-48 %), closely followed by gathering bans (34 %; 95% CrI 21-45 %), border closures (31 %; 95% CrI 19-42 %), and work bans on non-essential business activities (31 %; 95% CrI 16-44 %). Event bans lead to a slightly less pronounced reduction (23 %; 95% CrI 8-35 %). School closures (8 %; 95% CrI 0-23 %) and lockdowns (5 %; 95% CrI 0-14 %) appeared to be the least effective among the NPIs considered in this analysis. Conclusions: With this cross-country analysis, we provide early estimates regarding the impact of different NPIs for controlling the COVID-19 epidemic. These findings are relevant for evaluating current health-policies.

We aim to predict COVID-19 disease course and compare effectiveness of mitigation measures across countries to inform policy decision making. We propose a robust and parsimonious survival-convolution model for predicting key statistics of COVID-19 epidemics (daily new cases). We account for transmission during a pre-symptomatic incubation period and use a time-varying effective reproduction number (Rt) to reflect the temporal trend of transmission and change in response to a public health intervention. We estimate the intervention effect on reducing the infection rate and quantify uncertainty by permutation. In China and South Korea, we predicted the entire disease epidemic using only data in the early phase (two to three weeks after the outbreak). A fast rate of decline in Rt was observed and adopting mitigation strategies early in the epidemic was effective in reducing the infection rate in these two countries. The lockdown in Italy did not further accelerate the speed at which the infection rate decreases. The effective reproduction number has staggered around Rt=1.0 for more than 2 weeks before decreasing to below 1.0, and the epidemic in Italy is currently under control. In the US, Rt significantly decreased during a 2-week period after the declaration of national emergency, but afterwards the rate of decrease is substantially slower. If the trend continues after May 1, the first wave of COVID-19 may be controlled by July 26 (CI: July 9 to August 27). However, a loss of temporal effect on infection rate (e.g., due to relaxing mitigation measures after May 1) could lead to a long delay in controlling the epidemic (November 19 with less than 100 daily cases) and a total of more than 2 million cases.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qinxia Wang","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Shanghong Xie","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Yuanjia Wang","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Donglin Zeng","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Daniel Tschernutter","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Pierluigi Bottrighi","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Alberto Cenedese","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Joan Puig Salles","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Werner Vach","author_inst":"Basel Academy, University of Basel"},{"author_name":"Stefan Feuerriegel","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Megan S Hogan","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Manon Ragonnet-Cronin","author_inst":"MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis and Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Lily Geidelberg","author_inst":"MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis and Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Christian Marier","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Peter Meyn","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yutong Zhang","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Cadley","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Raquel Ordonez","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Raven Luther","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Emily Huang","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Emily Guzman","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Carolina Arguelles-Grande","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kimon V Argyropoulos","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Margaret Black","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Antonio Serrano","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Melissa E Call","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Min Jae Kim","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Brendan Belovarac","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tatyana Gindin","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andrew Lytle","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jared Pinnell","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Theodore Vougiouklakis","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Chen","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lawrence H Lin","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Amy Rapkiewicz","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Raabe","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Marie I Samanovic","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"George Jour","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Iman Osman","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Maria Aguero-Rosenfeld","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark J Mulligan","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Erik M Volz","author_inst":"MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis and Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Paolo Cotzia","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Matija Snuderl","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adriana Heguy","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.16.20063727","rel_title":"Social interventions can lower COVID-19 deaths in middle-income countries","rel_date":"2020-04-21","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.16.20063727","rel_abs":"A novel pandemic coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first detected in late 2019 in Wuhan (China)1,2.

The United States and the United Kingdom estimated the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce COVID-19 deaths, but there is less evidence to support choice of control measures in middle-income countries4. We used Colombia, an upper-middle income country, as a case-study to assess the effect of social interventions to suppress or mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Here we show that a combination of social distancing interventions, triggered by critical care admissions, can suppress and mitigate the peak of COVID-19, resulting in less critical care use, hospitalizations, and deaths. We found, through a mathematical simulation model, that a one-time social intervention may delay the number of critical care admissions and deaths related to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a series of social interventions (social and work distance and school closures) over a period of a year can reduce the expected burden of COVID-19, however, these interventions imply long periods of lockdown. Colombia would prevent up to 97% of COVID-19 deaths using these triggered series of interventions during the first year. Our analyses could be used by decision-makers from other middle-income countries with similar demographics and contact patterns to Colombia to reduce COVID-19 critical care admissions and deaths in their jurisdictions.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Angel Jose Paternina-Caicedo","author_inst":"Universidad del Sinu"},{"author_name":"Marc Choisy","author_inst":"Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam"},{"author_name":"Christian Garcia-Calavaro","author_inst":"Centro Programa de Salud Publica, Universidad de Santiago"},{"author_name":"Guido Camargo-Espa\u00f1a","author_inst":"Department of Biological Sciences and Eck Institute of Global Health, University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Jos\u00e9 Rojas-Suarez","author_inst":"Universidad de Cartagena"},{"author_name":"Carmelo Due\u00f1as","author_inst":"Universidad de Cartagena"},{"author_name":"Adrian Smith","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Fernando Pio De la Hoz-Restrepo","author_inst":"Universidad Nacional de Colombia"},{"author_name":"Werner Vach","author_inst":"Basel Academy, University of Basel"},{"author_name":"Stefan Feuerriegel","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Megan S Hogan","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Manon Ragonnet-Cronin","author_inst":"MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis and Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Lily Geidelberg","author_inst":"MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis and Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Christian Marier","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Peter Meyn","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yutong Zhang","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Cadley","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Raquel Ordonez","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Raven Luther","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Emily Huang","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Emily Guzman","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Carolina Arguelles-Grande","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kimon V Argyropoulos","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Margaret Black","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Antonio Serrano","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Melissa E Call","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Min Jae Kim","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Brendan Belovarac","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tatyana Gindin","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andrew Lytle","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jared Pinnell","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Theodore Vougiouklakis","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Chen","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lawrence H Lin","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Amy Rapkiewicz","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Raabe","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Marie I Samanovic","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"George Jour","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Iman Osman","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Maria Aguero-Rosenfeld","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark J Mulligan","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Erik M Volz","author_inst":"MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis and Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Paolo Cotzia","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Matija Snuderl","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adriana Heguy","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.16.20066787","rel_title":"FALSE-NEGATIVE RESULTS OF INITIAL RT-PCR ASSAYS FOR COVID-19: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW","rel_date":"2020-04-21","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.16.20066787","rel_abs":"Background: A false-negative case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is defined as a person with suspected infection and an initial negative result by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, with a positive result on a subsequent test. False-negative cases have important implications for isolation and risk of transmission of infected people and for the management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to review and critically appraise evidence about the rate of RT-PCR false-negatives at initial testing for COVID-19. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, as well as COVID-19 repositories including the EPPI-Centre living systematic map of evidence about COVID-19 and the Coronavirus Open Access Project living evidence database. Two authors independently screened and selected studies according to the eligibility criteria and collected data from the included studies. The risk of bias was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. We calculated the proportion of false-negative test results with the corresponding 95% CI using a multilevel mixed-effect logistic regression model. The certainty of the evidence about false-negative cases was rated using the GRADE approach for tests and strategies. All information in this article is current up to July 17, 2020. Results: We included 34 studies enrolling 12,057 COVID-19 confirmed cases. All studies were affected by several risks of bias and applicability concerns. The pooled estimate of false-negative proportion was highly affected by unexplained heterogeneity (tau-squared= 1.39; 90% prediction interval from 0.02 to 0.54). The certainty of the evidence was judged as very low, due to the risk of bias, indirectness, and inconsistency issues. Conclusions: There is a substantial and largely unexplained heterogeneity in the proportion of false-negative RT-PCR results. The collected evidence has several limitations, including risk of bias issues, high heterogeneity, and concerns about its applicability. Nonetheless, our findings reinforce the need for repeated testing in patients with suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection given that up to 54% of COVID-19 patients may have an initial false-negative RT-PCR (certainty of evidence: very low). An update of this review when additional studies become available is warranted.

The laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection has relied on nucleic acid tests. However, there are many limitations of nucleic acid tests, including low throughput and high rates of false negatives. More sensitive and accurate tests to effectively identify infected patients are needed. METHODS: This study has developed fully automated chemiluminescent immunoassays (CLIA) to determine IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in human serum. The assay performance has been evaluated at 10 hospitals. Clinical specificity was evaluated by measuring 972 hospitalized patients with diseases other than COVID-19, and 586 donors of a normal population. Clinical sensitivity was assessed on 503 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and 52 suspected cases. RESULTS: The assays demonstrated satisfied assay precision with coefficient of variation (CV) of less than 4.45%. Inactivation of specimen does not affect assay measurement. SARS-CoV-2 IgM shows clinical specificity of 97.33% and 99.49% for hospitalized patients and normal population respectively. SARS-CoV-2 IgG shows clinical specificity of 97.43% and 99.15% for the hospitalized patients and the normal population respectively. SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG show clinical sensitivity of 85.88% and 96.62% respectively for confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection with RT-PCR, of 73.08% and 86.54% respectively for suspected cases. CONCLUSIONS: we have developed fully automated immunoassays for detecting SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies in human serum. The assays demonstrated high clinical specificity and sensitivity, and add great value to nucleic acid testing in fighting against the global pandemic of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chungen Qian","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Mi Zhou","author_inst":"Shenzhen YHLO Biotech Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Fangming Cheng","author_inst":"Shenzhen YHLO Biotech Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Xiaotao Lin","author_inst":"Shenzhen YHLO Biotech Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Yijun Gong","author_inst":"Shenzhen YHLO Biotech Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Xiaobing Xie","author_inst":"the First Affiliated Hospital of Hunan University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ping Li","author_inst":"the First Affiliated Hospital of Hunan University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Zhiyong Li","author_inst":"the First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Pingan Zhang","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zejin Liu","author_inst":"Wuhan Asia General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fang Hu","author_inst":"Huangshi Central Hospital (Affiliated Hospital of Hubei Polytechnic University)"},{"author_name":"Yun Wang","author_inst":"TongJi Hospital, TongJi Medical college, HUST"},{"author_name":"Quan Li","author_inst":"Changshou Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yan Zhu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Maternity & Child Healthcare Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guikai Duan","author_inst":"Shenzhen Maternity & Child Healthcare Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yinting Xing","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University"},{"author_name":"Huanyu Song","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wenfang Xu","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Shaoxing University"},{"author_name":"Bi-Feng Liu","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Fuzhen Xia","author_inst":"Reagent R&D Center, Shenzhen YHLO Biotech Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Emily Guzman","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Carolina Arguelles-Grande","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kimon V Argyropoulos","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Margaret Black","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Antonio Serrano","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Melissa E Call","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Min Jae Kim","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Brendan Belovarac","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tatyana Gindin","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andrew Lytle","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jared Pinnell","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Theodore Vougiouklakis","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Chen","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lawrence H Lin","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Amy Rapkiewicz","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Raabe","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Marie I Samanovic","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"George Jour","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Iman Osman","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Maria Aguero-Rosenfeld","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark J Mulligan","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Erik M Volz","author_inst":"MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis and Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Paolo Cotzia","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Matija Snuderl","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adriana Heguy","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.16.20066159","rel_title":"Susceptibility and Sustainability of India against CoVid19: a multivariate approach","rel_date":"2020-04-21","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.16.20066159","rel_abs":"Purpose: We are currently in the middle of a global crisis.

The impact of different environmental, social, economic and health parameters is unknown and under research. It is important to identify the factors which can weaken the virus, and the nations which are more vulnerable to this virus. Materials and Methods: Data of weather, vaccination trends, life expectancy, lung disease, number of infected people in the pre-lockdown and post-lockdown period of highly infected nations are collected. These are extracted from authentic online resources and published reports. Analysis is done to find the possible impact of each parameter on CoVid19. Results: CoVid19 has no linear correlation with any of the selected parameters, though few parameters have depicted non-linear relationship in the graphs. Further investigations have shown better result for some parameters. A combination of the parameters results in a better correlation with infection rate. Conclusions: Though depending on the study outcome, the impact of CoVid19 in India can be predicted, the required lockdown period cannot be calculated due to data limitation.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Soumi Ray","author_inst":"IIT Roorkee"},{"author_name":"Mitu Roy","author_inst":"Haldia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Fangming Cheng","author_inst":"Shenzhen YHLO Biotech Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Xiaotao Lin","author_inst":"Shenzhen YHLO Biotech Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Yijun Gong","author_inst":"Shenzhen YHLO Biotech Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Xiaobing Xie","author_inst":"the First Affiliated Hospital of Hunan University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ping Li","author_inst":"the First Affiliated Hospital of Hunan University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Zhiyong Li","author_inst":"the First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Pingan Zhang","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zejin Liu","author_inst":"Wuhan Asia General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fang Hu","author_inst":"Huangshi Central Hospital (Affiliated Hospital of Hubei Polytechnic University)"},{"author_name":"Yun Wang","author_inst":"TongJi Hospital, TongJi Medical college, HUST"},{"author_name":"Quan Li","author_inst":"Changshou Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yan Zhu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Maternity & Child Healthcare Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guikai Duan","author_inst":"Shenzhen Maternity & Child Healthcare Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yinting Xing","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University"},{"author_name":"Huanyu Song","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wenfang Xu","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Shaoxing University"},{"author_name":"Bi-Feng Liu","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Fuzhen Xia","author_inst":"Reagent R&D Center, Shenzhen YHLO Biotech Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Emily Guzman","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Carolina Arguelles-Grande","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kimon V Argyropoulos","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Margaret Black","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Antonio Serrano","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Melissa E Call","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Min Jae Kim","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Brendan Belovarac","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tatyana Gindin","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andrew Lytle","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jared Pinnell","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Theodore Vougiouklakis","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Chen","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lawrence H Lin","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Amy Rapkiewicz","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Raabe","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Marie I Samanovic","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"George Jour","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Iman Osman","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Maria Aguero-Rosenfeld","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark J Mulligan","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Erik M Volz","author_inst":"MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis and Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Paolo Cotzia","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Matija Snuderl","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adriana Heguy","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.16.20067553","rel_title":"Early forecasts of the evolution of the COVID-19 outbreaks and quantitative assessment of the effectiveness of countering measures.","rel_date":"2020-04-21","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.16.20067553","rel_abs":"We discovered that the time evolution of the inverse fractional daily growth of new infections, N\/dN, in the current outbreak of COVID-19 is accurately described by a universal function, namely the two-parameter Gumbel cumulative function, in all countries that we have investigated. While the two Gumbel parameters, as determined bit fits to the data, vary from country to country (and even within different regions of the same country), reflecting the diversity and efficacy of the adopted containment measures, the functional form of the evolution of N\/dN appears to be universal. The result of the fit in a given region or country appears to be stable against variations of the selected time interval. This makes it possible to robustly estimate the two parameters from the data data even over relatively small time periods. In turn, this allows one to predict with large advance and well-controlled confidence levels, the time of the peak in the daily new infections, its magnitude and duration (hence the total infections), as well as the time when the daily new infections decrease to a pre-set value (e.g. less than about 2 new infections per day per million people), which can be very useful for planning the reopening of economic and social activities. We use this formalism to predict and compare these key features of the evolution of the COVID-19 disease in a number of countries and provide a quantitative assessment of the degree of success in in their efforts to countain the outbreak.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emanuele Daddi","author_inst":"CEA Saclay"},{"author_name":"Mauro Giavalisco","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Amherst"},{"author_name":"Fangming Cheng","author_inst":"Shenzhen YHLO Biotech Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Xiaotao Lin","author_inst":"Shenzhen YHLO Biotech Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Yijun Gong","author_inst":"Shenzhen YHLO Biotech Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Xiaobing Xie","author_inst":"the First Affiliated Hospital of Hunan University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ping Li","author_inst":"the First Affiliated Hospital of Hunan University of Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Zhiyong Li","author_inst":"the First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Pingan Zhang","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Zejin Liu","author_inst":"Wuhan Asia General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fang Hu","author_inst":"Huangshi Central Hospital (Affiliated Hospital of Hubei Polytechnic University)"},{"author_name":"Yun Wang","author_inst":"TongJi Hospital, TongJi Medical college, HUST"},{"author_name":"Quan Li","author_inst":"Changshou Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yan Zhu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Maternity & Child Healthcare Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guikai Duan","author_inst":"Shenzhen Maternity & Child Healthcare Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yinting Xing","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University"},{"author_name":"Huanyu Song","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wenfang Xu","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Shaoxing University"},{"author_name":"Bi-Feng Liu","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Fuzhen Xia","author_inst":"Reagent R&D Center, Shenzhen YHLO Biotech Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Emily Guzman","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Carolina Arguelles-Grande","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kimon V Argyropoulos","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Margaret Black","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Antonio Serrano","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Melissa E Call","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Min Jae Kim","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Brendan Belovarac","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tatyana Gindin","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andrew Lytle","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jared Pinnell","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Theodore Vougiouklakis","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Chen","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lawrence H Lin","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Amy Rapkiewicz","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Raabe","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Marie I Samanovic","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"George Jour","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Iman Osman","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Maria Aguero-Rosenfeld","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark J Mulligan","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Erik M Volz","author_inst":"MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis and Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Paolo Cotzia","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Matija Snuderl","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adriana Heguy","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.16.20067504","rel_title":"The effect of inter-city travel restrictions on geographical spread of COVID-19: Evidence from Wuhan, China","rel_date":"2020-04-21","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.16.20067504","rel_abs":"Background: To contain the spread of COVID-19, a cordon sanitaire was put in place in Wuhan prior to the Lunar New Year, on 23 January 2020, restricting travel to other parts of China. We assess the efficacy of the cordon sanitaire to delay the introduction and onset of local transmission of COVID-19 in other major cities in mainland China. Methods: We estimated the number of infected travellers from Wuhan to other major cities in mainland China from November 2019 to March 2020 using previously estimated COVID-19 prevalence in Wuhan and publicly available mobility data. We focused on Beijing, Chongqing, Hangzhou, and Shenzhen as four representative major cities to identify the potential independent contribution of the cordon sanitaire and holiday travel. To do this, we simulated outbreaks generated by infected arrivals in these destination cities using stochastic branching processes. We also modelled the effect of the cordon sanitaire in combination with reduced transmissibility scenarios representing the effect of local non-pharmaceutical interventions. Findings: In the four cities, given the potentially high prevalence of COVID-19 in Wuhan between Dec 2019 and early Jan 2020, local transmission may have been seeded as early as 2 - 8 January 2020. By the time the cordon sanitaire was imposed, simulated case counts were likely in the hundreds. The cordon sanitaire alone did not substantially affect the epidemic progression in these cities, although it may have had some effect in smaller cities. Interpretation: Our results indicate that the cordon sanitaire may not have prevented COVID-19 spread in major Chinese cities; local non-pharmaceutical interventions were likely more important for this.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Billy J Quilty","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Charlie Diamond","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yang Liu","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hamish Gibbs","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Timothy W Russell","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher I Jarvis","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kiesha Prem","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Carl A B Pearson","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Samuel J Clifford","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stefan Flasche","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"CMMID COVID-19 working group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Petra Klepac","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark Jit","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Guikai Duan","author_inst":"Shenzhen Maternity & Child Healthcare Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yinting Xing","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University"},{"author_name":"Huanyu Song","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wenfang Xu","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Shaoxing University"},{"author_name":"Bi-Feng Liu","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Fuzhen Xia","author_inst":"Reagent R&D Center, Shenzhen YHLO Biotech Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Emily Guzman","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Carolina Arguelles-Grande","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kimon V Argyropoulos","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Margaret Black","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Antonio Serrano","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Melissa E Call","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Min Jae Kim","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Brendan Belovarac","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tatyana Gindin","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andrew Lytle","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jared Pinnell","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Theodore Vougiouklakis","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Chen","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lawrence H Lin","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Amy Rapkiewicz","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Raabe","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Marie I Samanovic","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"George Jour","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Iman Osman","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Maria Aguero-Rosenfeld","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark J Mulligan","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Erik M Volz","author_inst":"MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis and Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Paolo Cotzia","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Matija Snuderl","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adriana Heguy","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.16.20067447","rel_title":"Interim evaluation of emergency declaration in Japan in the first week of the COVID-19 outbreak","rel_date":"2020-04-21","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.16.20067447","rel_abs":"Background: Prime Minister of Japan Abe declared an emergency to control the COVID-19 outbreak on April 7, 2020.

Method: We applied a simple susceptible-infected-recovery model to data of patients with symptoms in Tokyo, Japan for January 14 - April 21 as of April 22. We estimate the reproduction number in four periods: R0 before voluntary event cancellation and school closure (VECSC) which was introduced since February 27 to March 19, Rv during the VECSC, Ra after VECSC, and Re after the emergency declaration. Results: Results suggest that the value of R0 was estimated as 1.267; its range was [1.214, 1.341]. However, Rv was estimated as 2.360 [1.844, 2.623].

To date, documentation of histopathologic features in fatal cases of COVID-19 has been limited due to small sample size and incomplete organ sampling. Methods Post-mortem examinations were performed on 12 fatal COVID-19 cases in Washington State during February-March 2020. Clinical and laboratory data were reviewed. Tissue examination of all major organs was performed by light microscopy and electron microscopy. The presence of viral RNA in sampled tissues was tested by RT-PCR. Results All 12 patients were older with significant preexisting comorbidities. The major pulmonary finding was diffuse alveolar damage in the acute and\/or organizing phases with virus identified in type I and II pneumocytes by electron microscopy. The kidney demonstrated viral particles in the tubular epithelium, endothelium, and podocytes without significant inflammation. Viral particles were also observed in the trachea and large intestines. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the cardiac tissue of a patient with lymphocytic myocarditis. RT-PCR also detected viral RNA in the subcarinal lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and large intestines. Conclusion SARS-CoV-2 represents the third novel coronavirus to cause widespread human disease since 2002. Similar to SARS and MERS, the primary pathology was diffuse alveolar damage with virus located in the pneumocytes. However, other major organs including the heart and kidneys may be susceptible to viral replication and damage leading to increased mortality in those with disseminated disease. Understanding the pathology of SARS-CoV-2 will be essential to design effective therapies.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Benjamin T Bradley","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Heather Maioli","author_inst":"University of Washington, Seattle, WA"},{"author_name":"Robert Johnston","author_inst":"King County Medical Examiner's Office, Seattle, WA"},{"author_name":"Irfan Chaudhry","author_inst":"King County Medical Examiner's Office, Seattle, WA"},{"author_name":"Susan L.

Methods: A randomized, single-blind, group sequential, active-controlled trial was performed at JinYinTan Hospital, Wuhan, China. Between February 2020 and March 2020, 17 patients with critically ill COVID-19 were enrolled in our study. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either ALA (1200 mg\/d, intravenous infusion) once daily plus standard care or standard care plus equal volume saline infusion (placebo) for 7 days. All patients were monitored within the 7 days therapy and followed up to day 30 after therapy. The primary outcome of this study was the Sequential Organ Failure Estimate (SOFA) score, and the secondary outcome was the all-cause mortality within 30 days. Result: Nine patients were randomized to placebo group and 8 patients were randomized to ALA group. SOFA score was similar at baseline, increased from 4.3 to 6.0 in the placebo group and increased from 3.8 to 4.0 in the ALA group (P=0.36) after 7 days. The 30-day all-cause mortality tended to be lower in the ALA group (3\/8, 37.5%) compared to that in the placebo group (7\/9, 77.8%, P=0.09). Conclusion: In our study, ALA use is associated with lower SOFA score increase and lower 30-day all-cause mortality as compared with the placebo group. Although the mortality rate was two-folds higher in placebo group than in ALA group, only borderline statistical difference was evidenced due to the limited patient number. Future studies with larger patient cohort are warranted to validate the role of ALA in critically ill patients with COVID-19.

Ventilator sharing has been suggested as a crisis standard of care strategy to increase availability of mechanical ventilation. The safety and practicality of shared ventilation in patients is unknown. We designed and evaluated a system whereby one mechanical ventilator can be used to simultaneously ventilate two patients who have different lung compliances using a custom manufactured flow control valve to allow for individual adjustment of tidal volume and airway pressure for each patient. Methods: The system was first evaluated in a simulation lab using two human patient simulators under expected clinical conditions. It was then tested in an observational study of four patients with acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19. Two separately ventilated COVID-19 patients were connected to a single ventilator for one hour. This intervention was repeated in a second pair of patients. Ventilatory parameters (tidal volume, peak airway pressures, compliance) were recorded at five minute intervals during both studys. Arterial blood gases were taken at zero, thirty, and sixty minutes. The primary outcome was maintenance of stable acid-base status and oxygenation during shared ventilation. Results: Two male and two female patients, age range 32-56 yrs, participated. Ideal body weight and driving pressure were markedly different among patients. All patients demonstrated stable physiology and ventilation for the duration of shared ventilation. In one patient tidal volume was increased after 30 minutes to correct a respiratory acidosis. Conclusions: Differential ventilation using a single ventilator and a split breathing circuit with flow control valves is possible. A single ventilator could feasibly be used to safely ventilate two COVID-19 patients simultaneously as a bridge to full ventilatory support.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matthew Levin","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Martin D Chen","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Anjan Shah","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Ronak Shah","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"George Zhou","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Erica Kane","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Garrett Burnett","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Shams Ranginwala","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Madek","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Christopher Gidiscin","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Chang Park","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Daniel Katz","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Salter","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Roopa Kohli-Seth","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"James B Eisenkraft","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Suzan Uysal","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Michael McCarry","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Andrew B Leibowitz","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"David L Reich","author_inst":"David.reich@mountsinai.org"},{"author_name":"Fuzhen Xia","author_inst":"Reagent R&D Center, Shenzhen YHLO Biotech Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Emily Guzman","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Carolina Arguelles-Grande","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kimon V Argyropoulos","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Margaret Black","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Antonio Serrano","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Melissa E Call","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Min Jae Kim","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Brendan Belovarac","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tatyana Gindin","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andrew Lytle","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jared Pinnell","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Theodore Vougiouklakis","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Chen","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lawrence H Lin","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Amy Rapkiewicz","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Raabe","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Marie I Samanovic","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"George Jour","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Iman Osman","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Maria Aguero-Rosenfeld","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark J Mulligan","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Erik M Volz","author_inst":"MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis and Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Paolo Cotzia","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Matija Snuderl","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adriana Heguy","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.20.050088","rel_title":"Identification and enrichment of SECReTE cis-acting RNA elements in the Coronaviridae and other (+) single-strand RNA viruses","rel_date":"2020-04-20","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.20.050088","rel_abs":"cis-acting RNA motifs play a major role in regulating many aspects of RNA biology including posttranscriptional processing, nuclear export, RNA localization, translation and degradation. Here we analyzed the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and other single-strand RNA (ssRNA) viruses for the presence of a unique cis RNA element called SECReTE. This motif consists of 10 or more consecutive triplet nucleotide repeats where a pyrimidine nucleotide (C or U) in present every third base, and which we identified in mRNAs encoding secreted proteins in bacteria, yeast, and humans. This motif facilitates mRNA localization to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), along with the enhanced translation and secretion of translated protein. We now examined for SECReTE presence in Group IV and V RNA viruses, the former including the Coronaviridae, like SARS-CoV-2 and other positive (+)ssRNA viruses, and the latter consisting of negative (-) ssRNA viruses. Interestingly, the SARS-CoV-2 genome contains 40 SECReTE motifs at an abundance of ~1.3 SECReTEs\/kilobase (kb). Moreover, all ssRNA viruses we examined contain multiple copies of this motif and appears in (+)ssRNA viruses as non-random in occurrence and independent of genome length. Importantly, (+)ssRNA viruses (e.g. Coronaviruses and Hepaciviruses), which utilize ER membranes to create double membrane vesicles to serve as viral replication centers (VRCs), contain more SECReTE motifs per kb as compared to (-)ssRNA viruses (e.g. Rabies, Mumps, and Influenza), that replicate in the nucleus or the cytoplasm, or other (+)ssRNA viruses (e.g. Enteroviruses and Flaviviruses) which employ different organellar membranes. As predicted by our earlier work, SECReTE sequences are mostly found in membranal or ER-associated\/secreted proteins. Thus, we propose that SECReTE motifs could be important for the efficient translation and secretion of secreted viral proteins, as well as for VRC formation. Future studies of SECReTE function and identification of SECReTE-binding proteins could provide new drug targets to treat COVID-19 and other (+)ssRNA related diseases.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gal Haimovich","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Tsviya Olender","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Camila Baez","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey E Gerst","author_inst":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"author_name":"George Zhou","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Erica Kane","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Garrett Burnett","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Shams Ranginwala","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Madek","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Christopher Gidiscin","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Chang Park","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Daniel Katz","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Salter","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Roopa Kohli-Seth","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"James B Eisenkraft","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Suzan Uysal","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Michael McCarry","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Andrew B Leibowitz","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"David L Reich","author_inst":"David.reich@mountsinai.org"},{"author_name":"Fuzhen Xia","author_inst":"Reagent R&D Center, Shenzhen YHLO Biotech Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Emily Guzman","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Carolina Arguelles-Grande","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kimon V Argyropoulos","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Margaret Black","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Antonio Serrano","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Melissa E Call","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Min Jae Kim","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Brendan Belovarac","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tatyana Gindin","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andrew Lytle","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jared Pinnell","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Theodore Vougiouklakis","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"John Chen","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lawrence H Lin","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Amy Rapkiewicz","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Raabe","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Marie I Samanovic","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"George Jour","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Iman Osman","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Maria Aguero-Rosenfeld","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark J Mulligan","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Erik M Volz","author_inst":"MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis and Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Paolo Cotzia","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Matija Snuderl","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adriana Heguy","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.17.047498","rel_title":"The crystal structure of nsp10-nsp16 heterodimer from SARS CoV-2in complex with S-adenosylmethionine","rel_date":"2020-04-20","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.17.047498","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the coronaviridae family and is the etiological agent of the respiratory Coronavirus Disease 2019.

To address these challenges, we designed a fast (30-minute) colorimetric test (LAMP) for SARS-CoV-2 infection from naso\/oropharyngeal swabs, plus a large-scale shotgun metatranscriptomics platform (total-RNA-seq) for host, bacterial, and viral profiling. We applied both technologies across 857 SARS-CoV-2 clinical specimens and 86 NYC subway samples, providing a broad molecular portrait of the COVID-19 NYC outbreak. Our results define new features of SARS-CoV-2 evolution, nominate a novel, NYC-enriched viral subclade, reveal specific host responses in interferon, ACE, hematological, and olfaction pathways, and examine risks associated with use of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. Together, these findings have immediate applications to SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics, public health, and new therapeutic targets.","rel_num_authors":52,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel J Butler","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher Mozsary","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Cem Meydan","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"David C Danko","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Foox","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Joel Rosiene","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alon Shaiber","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ebrahim Afshinnekoo","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Matthew MacKay","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fritz J Sedlazeck","author_inst":"Baylor College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nikolay A Ivanov","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Maria A Sierra","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Diana Pohle","author_inst":"University Hospital Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Michael Zietz","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Undina Gisladottir","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Vijendra Ramlall","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Craig D Westover","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Krista Ryon","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Young","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chandrima Bhattacharya","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Phyllis Ruggiero","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bradley W Langhorst","author_inst":"New England Biolabs"},{"author_name":"Nathan A Tanner","author_inst":"New England Biolabs"},{"author_name":"Justyna Gawrys","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dmitry Meleshko","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Dong Xu","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Peter A D Steel","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Amos J Shemesh","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jenny Xiang","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jean Thierry-Mieg","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Danielle Thierry-Mieg","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Robert E Schwartz","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Angelika Iftner","author_inst":"University Hospital Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Daniela Bezdan","author_inst":"University Hospital Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"John Sipley","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lin Cong","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Arryn Craney","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Priya Velu","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ari Melnick","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Iman Hajirasouliha","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stacy M Horner","author_inst":"Duke University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Thomas Iftner","author_inst":"University Hospital Tubingen"},{"author_name":"Mirella Salvatore","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Massimo Loda","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lars F Westblade","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shawn Levy","author_inst":"HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Melissa Cushing","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shixiu Wu","author_inst":"Hangzhou Cancer Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nicholas P Tatonetti","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Marcin Imielinski","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hanna Rennert","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher Mason","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"molecular biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.17.042366","rel_title":"Rapid direct nucleic acid amplification test without RNA extraction for SARS-CoV-2 using a portable PCR thermocycler","rel_date":"2020-04-20","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.17.042366","rel_abs":"There is an ongoing worldwide coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

There is an urgent need for rapid, simplified and cost-effective detection methods. We have developed and analytically validated a protocol for direct rapid extraction-free PCR (DIRECT-PCR) detection of SARS-CoV-2 without the need for nucleic acid purification. As few as 6 RNA copies per reaction of viral nucleocapsid (N) gene from respiratory samples such as sputum and nasal exudate can be detected directly using our one-step inhibitor-resistant assay. The performance of this assay was validated on a commercially available portable PCR thermocycler. Viral lysis, reverse transcription, amplification and detection are achieved in a single-tube homogeneous reaction within 36 minutes. This minimized hands-on time, reduces turnaround-time for sample-to-result and obviates the need for RNA purification reagents. It could enable wider use of Covid-19 testing for diagnosis, screening and research in countries and regions where laboratory capabilities are limiting.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Soon Keong Wee","author_inst":"Nanyang Technological University"},{"author_name":"Suppiah Paramalingam Sivalingam","author_inst":"Nanyang Technological University"},{"author_name":"Eric Peng Huat Yap","author_inst":"Nanyang Technological University"},{"author_name":"David C Danko","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Foox","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Joel Rosiene","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alon Shaiber","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ebrahim Afshinnekoo","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Matthew MacKay","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fritz J Sedlazeck","author_inst":"Baylor College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nikolay A Ivanov","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Maria A Sierra","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Diana Pohle","author_inst":"University Hospital Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Michael Zietz","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Undina Gisladottir","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Vijendra Ramlall","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Craig D Westover","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Krista Ryon","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Young","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chandrima Bhattacharya","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Phyllis Ruggiero","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bradley W Langhorst","author_inst":"New England Biolabs"},{"author_name":"Nathan A Tanner","author_inst":"New England Biolabs"},{"author_name":"Justyna Gawrys","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dmitry Meleshko","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Dong Xu","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Peter A D Steel","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Amos J Shemesh","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jenny Xiang","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jean Thierry-Mieg","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Danielle Thierry-Mieg","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Robert E Schwartz","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Angelika Iftner","author_inst":"University Hospital Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"Daniela Bezdan","author_inst":"University Hospital Tuebingen"},{"author_name":"John Sipley","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lin Cong","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian Hospital"},{"author_name":"Arryn Craney","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Priya Velu","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ari Melnick","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Iman Hajirasouliha","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stacy M Horner","author_inst":"Duke University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Thomas Iftner","author_inst":"University Hospital Tubingen"},{"author_name":"Mirella Salvatore","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Massimo Loda","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lars F Westblade","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shawn Levy","author_inst":"HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Melissa Cushing","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shixiu Wu","author_inst":"Hangzhou Cancer Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nicholas P Tatonetti","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Marcin Imielinski","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hanna Rennert","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher Mason","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.20.046144","rel_title":"A scientometric overview of CORD-19","rel_date":"2020-04-20","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.20.046144","rel_abs":"As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds, researchers from all disciplines are coming together and contributing their expertise.

Publications from CORD-19 focus mostly on a few well-defined research areas, in particular: coronaviruses (primarily SARS, MERS, COVID-19); public health and viral epidemics; molecular biology of viruses; influenza and other families of viruses; immunology and antivirals; clinical medicine.
