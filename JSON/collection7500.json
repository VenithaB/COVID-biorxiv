India is also facing this very tough task for controlling the virus outbreak and has managed its growth rate through some strict measures. This study presents the current situation of coronavirus spread in India along with the impact of various measures taken for it. With the help of data sources (till 7th-8th April 2020) from various state units of India and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, this study presents various trends and patterns. This study answers six different research ques-tions in a comprehensive manner. It has been reported that growth rate of infected cases has been controlled with the help of National Lockdown, however some uncontrolled mass level events had negatively impacted the infected cases. With the help of exponential and polyno-mial regression modelling, the predictions of up to 75000 cases have been done by the end of April 2020. It has also been seen that there are some prominent clusters and patient nodes in the network of patients which are the major influencers for COVID-19 spread. Also, death rate case predictions have been done through multi-class classification models with an accuracy of 75%. At the end, strategies for continuation for lockdown has been discussed and presented. It appears that only essential services should be open for the citizens of India and the national lockdown should be carried on for next 2-4 weeks. This study will be useful for the Government of India and various states of India, Administrative Units of India, Frontline health workforce of India, researchers and scientists. This study will also be favorable for the administrative units of other countries to consider various aspects related to the control of COVID-19 outspread in their respective regions.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rajan Gupta","author_inst":"University of Delhi"},{"author_name":"Saibal Kumar Pal","author_inst":"DRDO, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Gaurav Pandey","author_inst":"TheNorthCap University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.08.20058297","rel_title":"Work-related Covid-19 transmission","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.08.20058297","rel_abs":"Importance: Our study helps fill the knowledge gap related to work-related transmission in the emerging coronaviral pandemic. Objective: To demonstrate high-risk occupations for early coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) local transmission. Methods: In this observational study, we extracted confirmed Covid-19 cases from governmental investigation reports in Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. We followed each country\/area for 40 days after its first locally transmitted case, and excluded all imported cases. We defined a possible work-related case as a worker with evidence of close contact with another confirmed case due to work, or an unknown contact history but likely to be infected in the working environment (e.g. an airport taxi driver). We calculated the case number for each occupation, and illustrated the temporal distribution of all possible work-related cases and healthcare worker (HCW) cases. The temporal distribution was further defined as early outbreak (the earliest 10 days of the following period) and late outbreak (11th to 40th days of the following period). Results: We identified 103 possible work-related cases (14.9%) among a total of 690 local transmissions. The five occupation groups with the most cases were healthcare workers (HCWs) (22%), drivers and transport workers (18%), services and sales workers (18%), cleaning and domestic workers (9%) and public safety workers (7%). Possible work-related transmission played a substantial role in early outbreak (47.7% of early cases). Occupations at risk varied from early outbreak (predominantly services and sales workers, drivers, construction laborers, and religious professionals) to late outbreak (predominantly HCWs, drivers, cleaning and domestic workers, police officers, and religious professionals). Conclusions: Work-related transmission is considerable in early Covid-19 outbreaks, and the elevated risk of infection was not limited to HCW. Implementing preventive\/surveillance strategies for high-risk working populations is warranted.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fan-Yun Lan","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Health, Harvard University T.H.

Ultraviolet-C wavelength is a promising way of decontamination, however adequate dosimetry is needed to ensure balance between over and underexposed areas and provide reliable results. Our study demonstrates that UVGI light irradiance varies significantly on different respirator angles and propose a method to decontaminate several masks at once ensuring appropriate dosage in shaded zones. Methods: An UVGI irradiator was built with internal dimensions of 69.5 x55 x 33 cm with three 15W UV lamps. Inside, a grating of 58 x 41 x 15 cm was placed to hold the masks. Two different flat fold respirator models were used to assess irradiance, four of model Aura 9322 3M of dimensions 17 x 9 x 4cm (tri-fold), and two of model SAFE 231FFP3NR (bi-fold) with dimensions 17 x 6 x 5 cm. A spectrometer STN-SilverNova was employed to verify wavelength spectrum and surface irradiance. A simulation was performed to find the irradiance pattern inside the box and the six masks placed inside. These simulations were carried out using the software DIALUX EVO 8.2. Results: The data obtained reveal that the irradiance received inside the manufactured UVGI-irradiator depends not only on the distance between the lamps plane and the base of the respirators but also on the orientation and shape of the masks. This point becomes relevant in order to assure that all the respirators inside the chamber receive the correct dosage. Conclusion: Irradiance over FFR surfaces depend on several factors such as distance and angle of incidence of the light source. Careful irradiance measurement and simulation can ensure reliable dosage in the whole mask surface, balancing overexposure. Closed box systems might provide a more reliable, reproducible UVGI dosage than open settings.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aurora Baluja","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care.

Health systems will need surge capacity to absorb acute increases in caseload due to the pandemic. We assessed the capacity of the Kenyan health system to absorb surges in the number of people that will need hospitalization and critical care because of the COVID-19. Methods We assumed that 2% of the Kenyan population get symptomatic infection by SARS-Cov-2 based on modelled estimates for Kenya and determined the health system surge capacity for COVID-19 under three transmission curve scenarios, 6, 12, and 18 months. We estimated four measures of hospital surge capacity namely: 1) hospital bed surge capacity 2) ICU bed surge capacity 3) Hospital bed tipping point, and 5) ICU bed tipping point. We computed this nationally and for all the 47 county governments. Results The capacity of Kenyan hospitals to absorb increases in caseload due to COVID-19 is constrained by the availability of oxygen, with only 58% of hospital beds in hospitals with oxygen supply. There is substantial variation in hospital bed surge capacity across counties. For example, under the 6 months transmission scenario, the percentage of available general hospital beds that would be taken up by COVID-19 cases varied from 12% Tharaka Nithi county, to 145% in Trans Nzoia county. Kenya faces substantial gaps in ICU beds and ventilator capacity. Only 22 out of the 47 counties have at least 1 ICU unit. Kenya will need an additional 1,511 ICU beds and 1,609 ventilators (6 months transmission curve) to 374 ICU beds and 472 ventilators (18 months transmission curve) to absorb caseloads due to COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Edwine Barasa","author_inst":"Health Economics Research Unit, KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Paul O Ouma","author_inst":"Population Health Unit, KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Emelda A Okiro","author_inst":"Population Health Unit, KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Julio Corti\u00f1as","author_inst":"Department of Anaesthesiology and Critical Care.

In Taiwan, most cases to date were imported or linked to imported cases. Methods In collaboration with Facebook Data for Good, we characterized changes in movement patterns in Taiwan since February 2020, and built metapopulation models that incorporate human movement data to identify the high risk areas of disease spread and assess the potential effects of local travel restrictions in Taiwan. Results We found that mobility changed with the number of local cases in Taiwan in the past few months. For each city, we identified the most highly connected areas that may serve as sources of importation during an outbreak. We showed that the risk of an outbreak in Taiwan is enhanced if initial infections occur around holidays. Intracity travel reductions have a higher impact on the risk of an outbreak than intercity travel reductions, while intercity travel reductions can narrow the scope of the outbreak and help target resources. The timing, duration, and level of travel reduction together determine the impact of travel reductions on the number of infections, and multiple combinations of these can result in similar impact. Conclusions To prepare for the potential spread within Taiwan, we utilized Facebook's aggregated and anonymized movement and colocation data to identify cities with higher risk of infection and regional importation. We developed an interactive application that allows users to vary inputs and assumptions and shows the spatial spread of the disease and the impact of intercity and intracity travel reduction under different initial conditions. Our results can be used readily if local transmission occurs in Taiwan after relaxation of border control, providing important insights into future disease surveillance and policies for travel restrictions.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Meng-Chun Chang","author_inst":"National Tsing Hua University"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Kahn","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

It has been suggested that ACE- inhibitors (ACEi) and Angiotensin-2 Blockers (ARB), which are commonly used in patients with hypertension or diabetes and may raise ACE2 levels, could increase the risk of severe COVID19 infection. Methods and Results: We evaluated this hypothesis in a consecutive cohort of 1200 acute inpatients with COVID19 at two hospitals with a multi-ethnic catchment population in London (UK). The mean age was 68+-17 years (57% male) and 74% of patients had at least 1 comorbidity. 415 patients (34.6%) reached the primary endpoint of death or transfer to a critical care unit for organ support within 21-days of symptom onset. 399 patients (33.3 %) were taking ACEi or ARB. Patients on ACEi\/ARB were significantly older and had more comorbidities. The odds ratio (OR) for the primary endpoint in patients on ACEi and ARB, after adjustment for age, sex and co-morbidities, was 0.63 (CI 0.47-0.84, p<0.01). Conclusions: There was no evidence for increased severity of COVID19 disease in hospitalised patients on chronic treatment with ACEi or ARB. A trend towards a beneficial effect of ACEi\/ARB requires further evaluation in larger meta-analyses and randomised clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel Bean","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Zeljko Kraljevic","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Thomas Searle","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Bendayan","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Andrew Pickles","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Amos Folarin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Lukasz Roguski","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Kawsar Noor","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Anthony Shek","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rosita Zakeri","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Ajay Shah","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"James Teo","author_inst":"King's College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Richard JB Dobson","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"Nancy Francoeur","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Betsaida Salom Melo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Irina Oussenko","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Gintaras Deikus","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Juan Soto","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Shwetha Hara Sridhar","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Ying-Chih Wang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Twyman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Andrew Kasarskis","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Deena Rose Altman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Melissa Smith","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Robert Sebra","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Judith Aberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Garcia-Sarstre","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Marta Luksza","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Gopi Patel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alberto Paniz-Mondolfi","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Melissa Gitman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Emilia Mia Sordillo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Viviana Simon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Harm van Bakel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.07.20056754","rel_title":"Applying the unified models of ecology to forecast epidemics, with application to Covid-19","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.07.20056754","rel_abs":"During a burgeoning outbreak of a novel disease, public attention will ordinarily expand as the severity of the outbreak expands--as infections multiply and news reports accumulate. Such public attention will in turn reinforce tactics to control the outbreak. In classical epidemiological models, effects of such tactics can be incorporated in standard parameters of transmission, recovery, and mortality. Unfortunately, early in an outbreak those individual parameters may be poorly known, hence corresponding models can get lost in uncertainty. This makes it difficult to determine whether the disease is spreading exponentially or logistically, or along another path. Examining cases over time is also problematic, as a logistically growing infection that is leveling off appears exponential in early phases. Here we report on the most basic mechanistic, ecological model we can imagine, which can help distinguish growth that is and is not under control. This approach did a satisfactory job predicting the final outcome of the Ebola outbreak of 2014-15. The model's two parameters were computable in real time, well before the outcome was actually known. The first parameter is an intrinsic rate of increase in cumulative deaths or reported cases. The second parameter is related to the human social system and represents all tactics that combine to control the outbreak. That parameter is coupled to the number of cumulative deaths or cases. We examine the basic mechanisms operating in this model and show the predictions made during the Ebola outbreak. We also consider how this basic model is performing for the Covid-19 pandemic and highlight ecological models that align with popularly discussed concepts such as flatten-the-curve, exponential growth, and inflection points of curves.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shelby W Loberg","author_inst":"University of Minnesota Morris"},{"author_name":"Clarence Lehman","author_inst":"University of Minnesota Twin Cities"},{"author_name":"Thomas Searle","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Bendayan","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Andrew Pickles","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Amos Folarin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Lukasz Roguski","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Kawsar Noor","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Anthony Shek","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rosita Zakeri","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Ajay Shah","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"James Teo","author_inst":"King's College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Richard JB Dobson","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"Nancy Francoeur","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Betsaida Salom Melo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Irina Oussenko","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Gintaras Deikus","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Juan Soto","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Shwetha Hara Sridhar","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Ying-Chih Wang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Twyman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Andrew Kasarskis","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Deena Rose Altman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Melissa Smith","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Robert Sebra","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Judith Aberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Garcia-Sarstre","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Marta Luksza","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Gopi Patel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alberto Paniz-Mondolfi","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Melissa Gitman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Emilia Mia Sordillo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Viviana Simon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Harm van Bakel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.08.20058073","rel_title":"Testing the association between blood type and COVID-19 infection, intubation, and death","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.08.20058073","rel_abs":"The rapid global spread of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has strained healthcare and testing resources, making the identification and prioritization of individuals most at-risk a critical challenge.

We found slightly increased infection prevalence among non-O types.

We estimated Rh-negative blood type to have a protective effect for all three outcomes. Our results add to the growing body of evidence suggesting blood type may play a role in COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael Zietz","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Jason E.

Self-collected swabs offer many advantages provided detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses is not compromised. METHODS In a prospective study, patients attending dedicated COVID-19 collection clinics were offered the option to first self-collect (SC) nasal and throat swabs prior to health worker collection (HC). Two different laboratory services participated, with HC at Site 1 collecting nasal and throat swabs and at Site 2 nasopharyngeal (NP) and throat swabs. Samples were analysed for SARS-CoV-2 as well as common respiratory viruses. Concordance of results between methods was assessed using Cohens kappa ({kappa}). RESULTS Of 236 patients sampled by HC and SC, 25 had COVID-19 (24 by HC and 25 by SC) and 63 had other respiratory viruses (56 by HC and 58 by SC). SC was highly concordant with HC ({kappa} = 0.890) for all viruses including SARS-CoV-2 and more concordant than HC to positive results by any method ({kappa} = 0.959 vs 0.933). CONCLUSIONS Self-collection of throat and nasal swabs offers a reliable alternative to health worker collection for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and other common respiratory viruses. High viral load of SARS-CoV-2 throughout the respiratory tract and sensitive molecular methods may explain these findings. Self-collection also provides patients with easier access to testing, reduces the exposure of the community and health workers to those undergoing testing and reduces the requirement for PPE.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael C Wehrhahn","author_inst":"Douglass Hanly Moir Pathology"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Robson","author_inst":"Sullivan Nicolaides Pathology"},{"author_name":"Suzanne Brown","author_inst":"Department of Endocrinology & Diabetes, Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital"},{"author_name":"Evan Bursle","author_inst":"Sullivan Nicolaides Pathology"},{"author_name":"Shane Byrne","author_inst":"Sullivan Nicolaides Pathology"},{"author_name":"David New","author_inst":"Clinipath Pathology"},{"author_name":"Smathi Chong","author_inst":"Clinipath Pathology"},{"author_name":"James P Newcombe","author_inst":"Douglass Hanly Moir Pathology"},{"author_name":"Terri Sivertsen","author_inst":"Douglass Hanly Moir Pathology"},{"author_name":"Narelle Hadlow","author_inst":"Clinipath Pathology"},{"author_name":"Ajay Shah","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"James Teo","author_inst":"King's College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Richard JB Dobson","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"Nancy Francoeur","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Betsaida Salom Melo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Irina Oussenko","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Gintaras Deikus","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Juan Soto","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Shwetha Hara Sridhar","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Ying-Chih Wang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Twyman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Andrew Kasarskis","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Deena Rose Altman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Melissa Smith","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Robert Sebra","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Judith Aberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Garcia-Sarstre","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Marta Luksza","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Gopi Patel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alberto Paniz-Mondolfi","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Melissa Gitman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Emilia Mia Sordillo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Viviana Simon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Harm van Bakel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.08.20057794","rel_title":"Factors associated with hospitalization and critical illness among 4,103 patients with COVID-19 disease in New York City","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.08.20057794","rel_abs":"Background: Little is known about factors associated with hospitalization and critical illness in Covid-19 positive patients. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of all patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 treated at a single academic health system in New York City between March 1, 2020 and April 2, 2020, with follow up through April 7, 2020. Primary outcomes were hospitalization and critical illness (intensive care, mechanical ventilation, hospice and\/or death). We conducted multivariable logistic regression to identify risk factors for adverse outcomes, and maximum information gain decision tree classifications to identify key splitters. Results: Among 4,103 Covid-19 patients, 1,999 (48.7%) were hospitalized, of whom 981\/1,999 (49.1%) have been discharged home, and 292\/1,999 (14.6%) have died or were discharged to hospice. Of 445 patients requiring mechanical ventilation, 162\/445 (36.4%) have died. Strongest hospitalization risks were age [&ge;]75 years (OR 66.8, 95% CI, 44.7-102.6), age 65-74 (OR 10.9, 95% CI, 8.35-14.34), BMI>40 (OR 6.2, 95% CI, 4.2-9.3), and heart failure (OR 4.3 95% CI, 1.9-11.2). Strongest critical illness risks were admission oxygen saturation <88% (OR 6.99, 95% CI 4.5-11.0), d-dimer>2500 (OR 6.9, 95% CI, 3.2-15.2), ferritin >2500 (OR 6.9, 95% CI, 3.2-15.2), and C-reactive protein (CRP) >200 (OR 5.78, 95% CI, 2.6-13.8). In the decision tree for admission, the most important features were age >65 and obesity; for critical illness, the most important was SpO2<88, followed by procalcitonin >0.5, troponin <0.1 (protective), age >64 and CRP>200. Conclusions: Age and comorbidities are powerful predictors of hospitalization; however, admission oxygen impairment and markers of inflammation are most strongly associated with critical illness.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christopher M.

Government of different countries have developed and adopted various policies to contain this epidemic and the most common were the social distancing and lockdown. We proposed a SEIR epidemic model that accommodates the effects of lockdown and individual based precautionary measures and used it to estimate model parameters from the epidemic data up to 2nd April, 2020, freely available in GitHub repository for COVID-19, for nine developed and developing countries. We used the estimated parameters to predict the disease burden in these countries with special emphasis on India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. Our analysis revealed that the lockdown and recommended individual hygiene can slow down the outbreak but unable to eradicate the disease from the society. With the current human-to-human transmission rate and existing level of personal precautionary, the number of infected individuals in India will be increasing at least for the next 3 months and the peak will come in 5 months. We can, however, reduce the epidemic size and prolong the time to arrive epidemic peak by seriously following the measures suggested by the authorities. We need to wait for another one month to obtain more data and epidemiological parameters for giving a better prediction about the pandemic.

It was followed by a bigger wave mainly from local transmissions resulting in 651 cases. The following wave saw unexpectedly three digit number of daily cases following a mass gathering urged the government to choose a more stringent measure. A limited lock-down approach called Movement Control Order (MCO) was immediately initiated to the whole country as a way to suppress the epidemic trajectory. The lock-down causes a major socio-economic disruption thus the ability to forecast the infection dynamic is urgently required to assist the government on timely decisions. Limited testing capacity and limited epidemiological data complicate the understanding of the future infection dynamic of the COVID-19 epidemic. Three different epidemic forecasting models was used to generate forecasts of COVID-19 cases in Malaysia using daily reported cumulative case data up until 1st April 2020 from the Malaysia Ministry of Health. The forecasts were generated using a Curve Fitting Model with Probability Density Function and Skewness Effect, the SIR Model, and a System Dynamic Model. Method one based on curve fitting with probability density function estimated that the peak will be on 19th April 2020 with an estimation of 5,637 infected persons. Method two based on SIR Model estimated that the peak will be on 20th - 31st May 2020 if Movement Contro (MCO) is in place with an estimation of 630,000 to 800,000 infected persons. Method three based on System Dynamic Model estimated that the peak will be on 17th May 2020 with an estimation of 22,421 infected persons. Forecasts from each of model suggested the epidemic may peak between middle of April to end of May 2020.

Subsequently, research on COVID-19 has focused on number of cases and deaths and predicted projections have focused on these parameters. We propose that the number of tests performed is a very important denominator in understanding the COVID-19 data. We analysed the number of diagnostic tests performed in proportion to the number of cases and subsequently deaths across different countries and projected pandemic outcomes. We obtained real time COVID-19 data from the reference website Worldometer at 0900 BST on Saturday 4th April, 2020 and collated the information obtained on the top 50 countries with the highest number of COVID 19 cases. We analysed this data according to the number of tests performed as the main denominator. Country wise population level pandemic projections were extrapolated utilising three models - 1) inherent case per test and death per test rates at the time of obtaining the data (4\/4\/2020 0900 BST) for each country; 2) rates adjusted according to the countries who conducted at least 100000 tests and 3) rates adjusted according to South Korea. We showed that testing rates impact on the number of cases and deaths and ultimately on future projections for the pandemic across different countries. We found that countries with the highest testing rates per population have the lowest death rates and give us an early indication of an eventual COVID-19 mortality rate. It is only by continued testing on a large scale that will enable us to know if the increasing number of patients who are seriously unwell in hospitals across the world are the tip of the iceberg or not. Accordingly, obtaining this information through a rapid increase in testing globally is the only way which will enable us to exit the COVID-19 pandemic and reduce economic and social instability.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rahul Potluri","author_inst":"ACALM Big Data Research Group"},{"author_name":"Deepthi Lavu","author_inst":"ACALM Big Data Research Group"},{"author_name":"Shuhaimi Mansor","author_inst":"Universiti Teknologi Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Nor Erne Nazira Bazin","author_inst":"Universiti Teknologi Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Safiya Amaran","author_inst":"Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin"},{"author_name":"Ahmad Athif Mohd Faudzi","author_inst":"Universiti Teknologi Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Anazida Zainal","author_inst":"Universiti Teknologi Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Sharin Hazlin Huspi","author_inst":"Universiti Teknologi Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Eric Jiun Hooi Khoo","author_inst":"Universiti Teknologi Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Shaekh Mohammad Shithil","author_inst":"Universiti Teknologi Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Ajay Shah","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"James Teo","author_inst":"King's College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Richard JB Dobson","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"Nancy Francoeur","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Betsaida Salom Melo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Irina Oussenko","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Gintaras Deikus","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Juan Soto","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Shwetha Hara Sridhar","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Ying-Chih Wang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Twyman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Andrew Kasarskis","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Deena Rose Altman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Melissa Smith","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Robert Sebra","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Judith Aberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Garcia-Sarstre","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Marta Luksza","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Gopi Patel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alberto Paniz-Mondolfi","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Melissa Gitman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Emilia Mia Sordillo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Viviana Simon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Harm van Bakel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.09.20056903","rel_title":"BCG protects against COVID-19?

We wished to validate the findings by examining the association between daily rates of COVID-19 case fatality (i.e. Death Per Case \/Days of the endemic [dpc\/d]) and the presence of universal BCG vaccination before 1980, or the year of the establishment of universal vaccination. There was no significant association in either analysis. In this work we emphasize caution amidst the publication surge on COVID-19, and highlight the political\/economical-, arbitrary selection-, and fear\/anxiety related biases, which may obscure scientific rigor. It is underscored that physical (social) distancing (i.e. quarantine) and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) are the only epidemiologic measures (Iceland being a great example, where universal BCG vaccination policy was never in place), which consistently associate with successful counteraction of morbidity and mortality during the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Reka Szigeti","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Domos Kellermayer","author_inst":"University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Richard Kellermayer","author_inst":"Section of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA"},{"author_name":"Nor Erne Nazira Bazin","author_inst":"Universiti Teknologi Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Safiya Amaran","author_inst":"Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin"},{"author_name":"Ahmad Athif Mohd Faudzi","author_inst":"Universiti Teknologi Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Anazida Zainal","author_inst":"Universiti Teknologi Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Sharin Hazlin Huspi","author_inst":"Universiti Teknologi Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Eric Jiun Hooi Khoo","author_inst":"Universiti Teknologi Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Shaekh Mohammad Shithil","author_inst":"Universiti Teknologi Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Ajay Shah","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"James Teo","author_inst":"King's College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Richard JB Dobson","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"Nancy Francoeur","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Betsaida Salom Melo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Irina Oussenko","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Gintaras Deikus","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Juan Soto","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Shwetha Hara Sridhar","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Ying-Chih Wang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Twyman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Andrew Kasarskis","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Deena Rose Altman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Melissa Smith","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Robert Sebra","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Judith Aberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Garcia-Sarstre","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Marta Luksza","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Gopi Patel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alberto Paniz-Mondolfi","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Melissa Gitman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Emilia Mia Sordillo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Viviana Simon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Harm van Bakel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.07.20056739","rel_title":"Potential dissemination of epidemics based on Brazilian mobile geolocation data.

The study is intended to help public administrators in action plans and resources allocation, whilst studying how mobile geolocation data may be employed as a measure of population mobility during an epidemic. The first part of the study focus on the states of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro during the period of March 2020, when the disease first started to spread in these states. Metapopulation models for the disease spread were simulated in order to evaluate the risk of infection of each city within the states, by ranking them according to the time the disease will take to infect each city.

We assessed the US publics early experience with the COVID-19 crisis during the period when shelter-in-place orders were widely implemented to understand non-compliance with those orders, sentiment about the crisis, and to compare across age categories associated with different levels of risk. We posted our survey on Twitter, Facebook, and NextDoor on March 14th to March 23rd that included 21 questions including demographics, impact on daily life, actions taken, and difficulties faced. We analyzed the free-text responses to the impact question using LIWC, a computational natural language processing tool, and performed a thematic content analysis of the reasons people gave for non-compliance with social distancing orders. Stanford Universitys IRB approved the study. In 9 days, we collected a total of 20,734 responses. 6,573 individuals provided a response ([&ge;]30 words) to the question, Tell us how the coronavirus crisis is impacting your life. Our data (Figure 1) show that younger people (18-31) are more emotionally negative, self-centered, and less concerned with family, while middle-aged people are group-oriented (32-44) and focused on family (32-64) (all p values < .05 corrected for multiple comparisons). Unsurprisingly, the oldest and most at-risk group (65+) are more focused on biological terms (e.g., health-related topics), but were surprisingly low in anxiety and high in emotionally positive terms relative to those at lower risk. We also content-analyzed 7,355 responses (kappas > .75) to the question, What are the reasons you are not self-isolating more? Of these participants, 39.8% reported not being compliant, with the youngest group (18-31) having the lowest compliance rate (52.4%) compared to the other age groups (all > 60%; all p values < .01). Table 1 describes the seven primary themes for non-compliance. Non-essential work requirements, concerns about mental and physical health, and the belief that other precautions were sufficient were the most common reasons, although other rationales included wanting to continue everyday activities and beliefs that society is over-reacting. Childcare was an important concern for a subset of respondents. Overall, our findings suggest that public health messages should focus on young people and 1) address their negative affect, 2) refocus their self-orientation by emphasizing the importance of individual behavior to group-level health outcomes, and 3) target the specific rationales that different people have regarding the pandemic to maximize compliance with social distancing.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ryan C Moore","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Angela Lee","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey T Hancock","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Meghan Halley","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Eleni Linos","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Afonso Delgado","author_inst":"In Loco"},{"author_name":"S\u00e9rgio M Oliva","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Sharin Hazlin Huspi","author_inst":"Universiti Teknologi Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Eric Jiun Hooi Khoo","author_inst":"Universiti Teknologi Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Shaekh Mohammad Shithil","author_inst":"Universiti Teknologi Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Ajay Shah","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"James Teo","author_inst":"King's College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Richard JB Dobson","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"Nancy Francoeur","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Betsaida Salom Melo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Irina Oussenko","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Gintaras Deikus","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Juan Soto","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Shwetha Hara Sridhar","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Ying-Chih Wang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Twyman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Andrew Kasarskis","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Deena Rose Altman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Melissa Smith","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Robert Sebra","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Judith Aberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Garcia-Sarstre","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Marta Luksza","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Gopi Patel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alberto Paniz-Mondolfi","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Melissa Gitman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Emilia Mia Sordillo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Viviana Simon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Harm van Bakel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.09.20049288","rel_title":"Know Your Epidemic, Know Your Response: Covid-19 in the United States","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.09.20049288","rel_abs":"We document that during the week of March 10-16, the Covid-19 pandemic fundamentally affected the perceptions of U.S. residents about the health risks and socioeconomic consequences entailed by the pandemic. During this week, it seems, \"everything changed.\" Not only did the pandemic progress rapidly across the United States, but U.S. residents started to realize that the threat was real: increasing Covid-19 caseloads heightened perceptions of infection risks and excess mortality risks, concerns about the economic implications increased substantially, and behavioral responses became widespread as the pandemic expanded rapidly in the U.S. In early to mid-March 2020, average perceptions about the coronavirus infection risks are broadly consistent with projections about the pandemic, while expectations about dying conditional on infection and expectations about Covid-19-related excess mortality during the next months are possibly too pessimistic. However, some aspects of Covid-19 perceptions are disconcerting from the perspective of implementing and sustaining an effective societal response to the pandemic. For instance, the education gradient in expected infection risks entails the possibility of having different perceptions of the reality of the pandemic between people with and without a college education, potentially resulting in two different levels of behavioral and policy-responses across individuals and regions. Unless addressed by effective health communication that reaches individuals across all social strata, some of the misperceptions about Covid-19 epidemic raise concerns about the ability of the United States to implement and sustain the widespread and harsh policies that are required to curtail the pandemic. Our analyses also reveal perceptions of becoming infected with the virus, and dying from Covid-19, were driven upwards by a rapidly increasing national caseload, and perceptions of the economic consequences and the adaptation of social distancing were affected by both national and state-level cases.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alberto Ciancio","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Fabrice K\u00e4mpfen","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Iliana V.

Because the clinically diagnosed cases in Hubei province were reported for the first time on February 13, 2020, a very high peak of new cases in China was observed. The reason why so many clinically diagnosed cases appeared was not clear. Methods: All data of new cases in China were acquired from WHO situation reports. Linear fitting was used to infer the ability to detect COVID-19 infections. Primer-BLAST and nucleotide blast were applied to check the specificity of primers. Expression data of human mRNA in different tissues was obtained from Human Protein Atlas. Finding: Based on the data and analysis of changes of new laboratory-confirmed cases and new clinically diagnosed cases, it was inferred that there were many false-negative results in all clinically diagnosed cases in Hubei province. There were eight non-specific primers in dozens of primers used in clinical or research detection of COVID-19. Among them, a pair of primer for the ORF1ab regions of SARS-CoV-2 genome, which widely applied to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus in China, well matched some human mRNAs such as Cathepsin C transcripts. Compared to other transcripts, Cathepsin C mRNA had a high abundance in tonsil, lung and small intestine.

Methods: We proposed to use a retrospective case-control study to give a comparison between suspected patients and confirmed patients in the clinical characteristics. Results: (56%) patients were confirmed for COVID-19 from suspected 167 patients. We find that elder people were more likely to be infected by COVID-19. Among the confirmed 94 patients, 2 (2%) patients were admitted to an intensive care unit, and 0 (0%) patients died during the study period. We find that images of CT scan of patients with a COVID-19 are significantly different from patients without a COVID-19. Conclusions: To our best knowledge, it is the first time to use the case-control design to study the coronavirus disease, since it is particularly appropriate for investigating infectious disease outbreaks. The clinical treatment experience in this study can supply a guideline for treating COVID-19 as the number of the infected patients is increasing in the world. Compared with other studies, we find that the mortality rate and the intensive care unit rate can be reduced if patients can be treated timely in the right identification and detection with nucleic acid testing and chest CT scan. Therefore, we recommend nucleic acid testing and chest CT scan for the clinical treatment practice from this successful clinical treatment study.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jianghu Dong","author_inst":"College of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Lianpin Wu","author_inst":"Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"QIKE Jin","author_inst":"Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jie Chen","author_inst":"Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jiawei He","author_inst":"Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jill Darling","author_inst":"University of Southern California"},{"author_name":"Arie Kapteyn","author_inst":"University of Southern California"},{"author_name":"J\u00e4rgen Maurer","author_inst":"University of Lausanne"},{"author_name":"Hans-Peter Kohler","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Shaekh Mohammad Shithil","author_inst":"Universiti Teknologi Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Ajay Shah","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"James Teo","author_inst":"King's College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Richard JB Dobson","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"Nancy Francoeur","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Betsaida Salom Melo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Irina Oussenko","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Gintaras Deikus","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Juan Soto","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Shwetha Hara Sridhar","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Ying-Chih Wang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Twyman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Andrew Kasarskis","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Deena Rose Altman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Melissa Smith","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Robert Sebra","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Judith Aberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Garcia-Sarstre","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Marta Luksza","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Gopi Patel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alberto Paniz-Mondolfi","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Melissa Gitman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Emilia Mia Sordillo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Viviana Simon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Harm van Bakel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.07.20053744","rel_title":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Infection During Pregnancy In China: A Retrospective Cohort Study","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.07.20053744","rel_abs":"Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as the cause of the ongoing worldwide epidemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China and worldwide. However, there were few studies about the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on pregnant women. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, we enrolled 31 pregnant women and 35 non-pregnant women from Jan 28 to Feb 28, 2020 to evaluate the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. Inflammatory indices were used to assess the severity of COVID-19. Evidence of vertical transmission was determined by laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, placenta, neonatal throat and anal swab and breastmilk samples. Findings Compared with non-pregnant women, pregnant women had a significantly lower proportion of fever (54.8% vs. 87.5%, p= 0.006), a shorter average interval from onset to hospitalization, and a higher proportion of severe or critical COVID-19 (32.3% vs. 11.4%, p=0.039). Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and systematic immune-inflammation-based prognostic index (SII) were significantly higher on admission in severe\/critical pneumonia group than moderate pneumonia group. We could not detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR in amniotic fluid, placenta, neonatal throat and anal swab and breastmilk samples. Conclusions The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 in pregnant women were insidious and atypical, compared with those in non-pregnant patients. SII and NLR could be a useful marker to evaluate the severity of COVID-19. There was no evidence of vertical transmission during pregnancy with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mingzhu Yin","author_inst":"Xiangya Hospital, Central
