We demonstrate that the S1-Fc fusion protein is extremely immunogenic, as evidenced by strong antibody titers observed by day 7. Strong virus neutralizing activity was observed on day 14 in rabbits immunized with the S1-Fc fusion protein using a pseudovirus neutralization assay. Most importantly, in less than 20 days and three injections of the S1-Fc fusion protein, two monkeys developed higher virus neutralizing titers than a recovered COVID-19 patient in a live SARS-CoV-2 infection assay.

The rapid, sensitive and specific diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 by fast and unambiguous testing is widely recognized to be critical in responding the current outbreak. Since the current testing capacity by conventional PCR based methods is insufficient because of shortages of supplies such as RNA extraction kits and PCR reagents, alternative and\/or complementary testing assays should be developed. Here, we exploit the potential of targeted mass spectrometry based proteomic technologies to solve the current issue of insufficient SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing capacity. We have assessed the limit of detection by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) on an Orbitrap Eclipse mass spectrometer for target tryptic peptides of several SARS-CoV-2 proteins from a sample of virus infected Vero cells. For Nucleocapsid protein the limit of detection was found to be in the mid-attomole range (0.9 x 10-12 g), which would theoretically correspond to approximately 10,000 SARS-CoV-2 particles, under the assumption that all viral proteins are assembled in macromolecular virus particles. Whether or not this sensitivity is sufficient to play a role in SARS-CoV-2 detection in patient material such as swabs or body fluids largely depends on the amount of viral proteins present in such samples and is subject of further research. If yes, mass spectrometry based methods could serve as a complementary protein based diagnostic tool and further steps should be focused on sample preparation protocols and on improvements in sample throughput.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Karel Bezstarosti","author_inst":"Erasmus University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Mart M Lamers","author_inst":"Erasmus University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Bart L Haagmans","author_inst":"Erasmus University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jeroen AA Demmers","author_inst":"Erasmus University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Bounlom Douangngeun","author_inst":"National Animal Health Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Kongsy Khammavong","author_inst":"Wildlife Conservation Society"},{"author_name":"Sinpakone Singhalath","author_inst":"Wildlife Conservation Society"},{"author_name":"Veasna Duong","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur du Cambodge"},{"author_name":"Philippe Buchy","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur du Cambodge"},{"author_name":"Sarah H Olson","author_inst":"Wildlife Conservation Society"},{"author_name":"Lucy Keatts","author_inst":"Wildlife Conservation Society"},{"author_name":"Amanda E Fine","author_inst":"Wildlife Conservation Society"},{"author_name":"Zoe Greatorex","author_inst":"Wildlife Conservation Society"},{"author_name":"Martin Gilbert","author_inst":"Wildlife Conservation Society"},{"author_name":"Matthew LeBreton","author_inst":"Mosaic"},{"author_name":"Karen Saylors","author_inst":"Labyrinth Global Health, Inc."},{"author_name":"Damien O Joly","author_inst":"British Columbia Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy"},{"author_name":"Edward M Rubin","author_inst":"Metabiota Inc."},{"author_name":"Christian E Lange","author_inst":"Metabiota"},{"author_name":"Xin Cheng","author_inst":"Advaccine (Suzhou) Biopharmaceuticals, Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Min Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Chenxi Xia","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Maohua Li","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Le Sun","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.22.046565","rel_title":"Functional and Genetic Analysis of Viral Receptor ACE2 Orthologs Reveals Broad Potential Host Range of SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-04-23","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.22.046565","rel_abs":"The pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a major global health threat. Epidemiological studies suggest that bats are the natural zoonotic reservoir for SARS-CoV-2. However, the host range of SARS-CoV-2 and intermediate hosts that facilitate its transmission to humans remain unknown. The interaction of coronavirus with its host receptor is a key genetic determinant of host range and cross-species transmission. SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor to enter host cells in a species-dependent manner. It has been shown that human, palm civet, pig and bat ACE2 can support virus entry, while the murine ortholog cannot. In this study, we characterized the ability of ACE2 from diverse species to support viral entry. We found that ACE2 is expressed in a wide range of species, with especially high conservation in mammals. By analyzing amino acid residues of ACE2 critical for virus entry, based on structure of SARS-CoV spike protein interaction with human, bat, palm civet, pig and ferret ACE2, we identified approximately eighty ACE2 proteins from mammals that could potentially mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry. Functional assays showed that 44 of these mammalian ACE2 orthologs, including those of domestic animals, pets, livestock, and animals commonly found in zoos and aquaria, could bind SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and support viral entry. In contrast, New World monkey ACE2 orthologs could not bind SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and support viral entry. We further identified the genetic determinant of New World monkey ACE2 that restricts viral entry using genetic and functional analyses. In summary, our study demonstrates that ACE2 from a remarkably broad range of species can facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry. These findings highlight a potentially broad host tropism of SARS-CoV-2 and suggest that SARS-CoV-2 might be distributed much more widely than previously recognized, underscoring the necessity to monitor susceptible hosts to prevent future outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yinghui Liu","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Gaowei Hu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Yuyan Wang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaomin Zhao","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Fansen Ji","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Wenlin Ren","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Mingli Gong","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Xiaohui Ju","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Changhe Li","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Junxian Hong","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Yuanfei Zhu","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xia Cai","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Jianping Wu","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Xun Lan","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Youhua Xie","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Xinquan Wang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Zhenghong Yuan","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Rong Zhang","author_inst":"Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Qiang Ding","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Xin Cheng","author_inst":"Advaccine (Suzhou) Biopharmaceuticals, Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Min Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Chenxi Xia","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Maohua Li","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Le Sun","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.23.057265","rel_title":"Structural and biochemical characterization of nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 core polymerase complex from COVID-19 virus","rel_date":"2020-04-23","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.23.057265","rel_abs":"The ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused huge number of human deaths.

Here, we describe the near-atomic resolution structure of its core polymerase complex, consisting of nsp12 catalytic subunit and nsp7-nsp8 cofactors. This structure highly resembles the counterpart of SARS-CoV with conserved motifs for all viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, and suggests the mechanism for activation by cofactors. Biochemical studies revealed reduced activity of the core polymerase complex and lower thermostability of individual subunits of COVID-19 virus as compared to that of SARS-CoV. These findings provide important insights into RNA synthesis by coronavirus polymerase and indicate a well adaptation of COVID-19 virus towards humans with relatively lower body temperatures than the natural bat hosts.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qi Peng","author_inst":"Institute Of Microbiology Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ruchao Peng","author_inst":"Institute Of Microbiology Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Bin Yuan","author_inst":"Institute Of Microbiology Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jingru Zhao","author_inst":"Institute Of Microbiology Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Min Wang","author_inst":"Institute Of Microbiology Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xixi Wang","author_inst":"Institute Of Microbiology Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Qian Wang","author_inst":"Institute Of Microbiology Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yan Sun","author_inst":"Institute Of Microbiology Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zheng Fan","author_inst":"Institute Of Microbiology Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jianxun Qi","author_inst":"Institute Of Microbiology Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"George F.

Conventional testing for SARS-CoV-2 involves collection of a clinical specimen with a nasopharyngeal swab, storage of the swab during transport in universal transport medium (UTM), extraction of RNA, and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). As testing has scaled across the world, supply chain challenges have emerged across this entire workflow. Here we sought to evaluate how eliminating the UTM storage and RNA extraction steps would impact the results of molecular testing. Using paired mid-turbinate swabs self-collected by 11 individuals with previously established SARS-CoV-2 positivity, we performed a comparison of conventional (swab [-&gt;] UTM [-&gt;] RNA extraction [-&gt;] RT-qPCR) vs. simplified (direct elution from dry swab [-&gt;] RT-qPCR) protocols. Our results suggest that dry swabs eluted directly into a simple buffered solution (TE) can support molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 via endpoint RT-qPCR without substantially compromising sensitivity. Although further confirmation with a larger sample size and variation of other parameters is necessary, these results are encouraging for the possibility of a simplified workflow that could support massively scaled testing for COVID-19 control.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sanjay Srivatsan","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Peter D Han","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Katrina van Raay","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Caitlin R Wolf","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Denise J McCulloch","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Ashley E Kim","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Brandstetter","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Beth Martin","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jase Gehring","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Seattle Flu Study Investigators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Sriram Kosuri","author_inst":"Octant, Inc, University of California, Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Eric Q Konnick","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Christina M Lockwood","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Mark J Reider","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Deborah A Nickerson","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Helen Y Chu","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jay Shendure","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Lea M Starita","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Xin Cheng","author_inst":"Advaccine (Suzhou) Biopharmaceuticals, Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Min Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Chenxi Xia","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Maohua Li","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Le Sun","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"molecular biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.21.054387","rel_title":"Identification of potential treatments for COVID-19 through artificial intelligence-enabled phenomic analysis of human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-04-23","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.21.054387","rel_abs":"To identify potential therapeutic stop-gaps for SARS-CoV-2, we evaluated a library of 1,670 approved and reference compounds in an unbiased, cellular image-based screen for their ability to suppress the broad impacts of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on phenomic profiles of human renal cortical epithelial cells using deep learning.

Its efficient transmission and range of disease severity raise questions regarding the contributions of virus-receptor interactions. ACE2 is a host ectopeptidase and the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Numerous reports describe ACE2 mRNA abundance and tissue distribution; however, mRNA abundance is not always representative of protein levels. Currently, there is limited data evaluating ACE2 protein and its correlation with other SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility factors.\n\nMaterials and methodsWe systematically examined the human upper and lower respiratory tract using single-cell RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry to determine receptor expression and evaluated its association with risk factors for severe COVID-19.\n\nFindingsOur results reveal that ACE2 protein is highest within regions of the sinonasal cavity and pulmonary alveoli, sites of presumptive viral transmission and severe disease development, respectively. In the lung parenchyma, ACE2 protein was found on the apical surface of a small subset of alveolar type II cells and colocalized with TMPRSS2, a cofactor for SARS-CoV2 entry. ACE2 protein was not increased by pulmonary risk factors for severe COVID-19.\n\nAdditionally, ACE2 protein was not reduced in children, a demographic with a lower incidence of severe COVID-19.\n\nInterpretationThese results offer new insights into ACE2 protein localization in the human respiratory tract and its relationship with susceptibility factors to COVID-19.\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSPrevious studies of ACE2 mRNA transcript abundance in the human respiratory tract have suggested a possible association between ACE2 expression and age, sex, and the presence of comorbidities.

Previous ACE2 protein studies have been limited by a paucity of lung tissue samples and reports that have produced contradictory results.\n\nAdded value of this studyUsing a combination of single-cell RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry, we describe ACE2 expression in the human respiratory tract. Staining protocols were optimized and validated to show consistent apical localization and avoid non-specific staining. We show ACE2 protein is found in subsets of airway cells and is highest within regions of the sinonasal cavity and pulmonary alveoli, sites of presumptive viral transmission and severe disease development for COVID-19, respectively. We show age, sex, and comorbidities do not increase ACE2 protein expression in the human respiratory tract.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceACE2 protein abundance does not correlate with risk factors for severe clinical outcomes, but in some cases showed an inversed relationship.

We aimed to develop an efficient, rapid and scalable surveillance strategy for detecting all remaining COVID-19 community transmission through exhaustive identification of every active transmission chain. We also identified measures to enable early detection and effective management of any reintroduction of transmission once containment measures are lifted to ensure strong containment measures do not need to be reinstated. Methods We compared efficiency and sensitivity to detect community transmission chains through testing of: hospital cases; primary care fever and cough patients; or asymptomatic community members, using surveillance evaluation methods and mathematical modelling, varying testing capacities and prevalence of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 fever and cough, and the reproduction number. System requirements for increasing testing to allow exhaustive identification of all transmission chains, and then enable complete follow-up of all cases and contacts within each chain, were assessed per million population. Findings Assuming 20% of cases are asymptomatic and all symptomatic COVID-19 cases present to primary care, with high transmission (R=2.2) there are a median of 13 unrecognised community cases (5 infectious) when a transmission chain is identified through hospital surveillance versus 3 unrecognised cases (1 infectious) through primary care surveillance. 3 unrecognised community upstream community cases themselves are estimated to generate a further 22-33 contacts requiring follow-up. The unrecognised community cases rise to 5 if only 50% of symptomatic cases present to primary care. Screening for asymptomatic disease in the community cannot exhaustively identify all transmission under any of the scenarios assessed. The additional capacity required to screen all fever and cough primary care patients would be approximately 2,000 tests\/million population per week using 1\/16 pooling of samples. Interpretation Screening all syndromic fever and cough primary care presentations, in combination with exhaustive and meticulous case and contact identification and management, enables appropriate early detection and elimination of community transmission of COVID-19. If testing capacity is limited, interventions such as pooling allow increased case detection, even given reduced test sensitivity. Wider identification and testing of all upstream contacts, (i.e. potential sources of infection for identified cases, and their related transmission chains) is critical, and to be done exhaustively requires more resources than downstream contact tracing. The most important factor in determining the performance of such a surveillance system is community participation in screening and follow up, and as such, appropriate community engagement, messaging and support to encourage presentation and compliance is essential. We provide operational guidance on implementing such a system.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kamalini Lokuge","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Emily Banks","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Davis","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Leslee Roberts","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Tatum Street","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Grazia Caleo","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Glass","author_inst":"The Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Christine Wohlford-Lenane","author_inst":"University of Iowa"},{"author_name":"Paul B McCray Jr.","author_inst":"University of Iowa"},{"author_name":"David K Meyerholz","author_inst":"University of Iowa"},{"author_name":"Mason L.

Methods: We conducted a primary survey of 638 adults in Brazil on March 25-28, 2020, about one month (32 days) after the first COVID-19 case in South America was confirmed in Sao Paulo. Results: In Brazil, 52% (332) of the sampled adults experienced mild or moderate distress, and 18.8% (120) suffered severe distress. Adults who were female, younger, more educated, and exercised less report-ed higher levels of distress. The distance from the Brazilian epicenter of Sao Paulo inter-acted with age and workplace attendance to predict the level of distress. The typhoon eye effect was stronger for people who were older or attended their workplace less. The most vulnerable adults were those who were far from the epicenter and did not go to their workplace in the week before the survey. Conclusion: Identifying the predictors of distress enables mental health services to better target finding and helping the more mentally vulnerable adults during the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stephen X.

OBJECTIVE To develop and validate a predication model, presented as nomogram and scale, to distinguish infectious acute abdomen patients suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). DESIGN Diagnostic model based on retrospective case series. SETTING Two hospitals in Wuhan and Beijing, China. PTRTICIPANTS 584 patients admitted to hospital with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 from 2 Jan 2020 to15 Feb 2020 and 238 infectious acute abdomen patients receiving emergency operation from 28 Feb 2019 to 3 Apr 2020. METHODS LASSO regression and multivariable logistic regression analysis were conducted to develop the prediction model in training cohort. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated by calibration curves, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, decision curve analysis (DCA) and clinical impact curves in training and validation cohort. A simplified screening scale and managing algorithm was generated according to the nomogram. RESULTS Six potential COVID-19 prediction variables were selected and the variable abdominal pain was excluded for overmuch weight. The five potential predictors, including fever, chest computed tomography (CT), leukocytes (white blood cells, WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT), were all independent predictors in multivariable logistic regression analysis (p[&le;]0.001) and the nomogram, named COVID-19 Infectious Acute Abdomen Distinguishment (CIAAD) nomogram, was generated. The CIAAD nomogram showed good discrimination and calibration (C-index of 0.981 (95% CI, 0.963 to 0.999) and AUC of 0.970 (95% CI, 0.961 to 0.982)), which was validated in the validation cohort (C-index of 0.966 (95% CI, 0.960 to 0.972) and AUC of 0.966 (95% CI, 0.957 to 0.975)). Decision curve analysis revealed that the CIAAD nomogram was clinically useful. The nomogram was further simplified into the CIAAD scale. CONCLUSIONS We established an easy and effective screening model and scale for surgeons in emergency department to distinguish COVID-19 patients from infectious acute abdomen patients. The algorithm based on CIAAD scale will help surgeons manage infectious acute abdomen patients suspected COVID-19 more efficiently.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bangbo Zhao","author_inst":"Department of General Surgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yingxin Wei","author_inst":"Department of General Surgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wenwu Sun","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, The Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Sciences and Technology"},{"author_name":"Cheng Qin","author_inst":"Department of General Surgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xingtong Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zihao Wang","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Tianhao Li","author_inst":"Department of General Surgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hongtao Cao","author_inst":"Department of General Surgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Weibin Wang","author_inst":"Department of General Surgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yujun Wang","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, The Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Sciences and Technology"},{"author_name":"Mason L.

To analyze the role of temperature, humidity, date of first case diagnosed (DFC) and the behavior of the growth-curve of cumulative frequency (CF) [number of days to rise (DCS) and reach the first 100 cases (D100), and the difference between them ({Delta}DD)] with the doubling time (Td) of Covid-19 cases in 67 countries grouped by climate zone. Design. Retrospective incident case study. Setting. WHO based register of cumulative incidence of Covid-19 cases. Participants. 1,706,914 subjects diagnosed between 12-29-2019 and 4-15-2020. Exposures. SARS-Cov-2 virus, ambient humidity, temperature and climate areas (temperate, tropical\/subtropical). Main outcome measures. Comparison of DCS, D100, {Delta}DD, DFC, humidity, temperature, Td for the first (Td10) and second (Td20) ten days of the CF growth-curve between countries according to climate zone, and identification of factors involved in Td, as well as predictors of CF using lineal regression models. Results. Td10 and Td20 were [&ge;]3 days longer in tropical\/subtropical vs. temperate areas (2.8[plusmn]1.2 vs. 5.7[plusmn]3.4; p=1.41E-05 and 4.6[plusmn]1.8 vs. 8.6[plusmn]4.2; p=9.7E-05, respectively). The factors involved in Td10 (DFC and {Delta}DD) were different than those in Td20 (Td10 and climate areas). After D100, the fastest growth-curves during the first 10 days, were associated with Td10<2 and Td10<3 in temperate and tropical\/subtropical countries, respectively. The fold change Td20\/Td10 >2 was associated with earlier flattening of the growth-curve. In multivariate models, Td10, DFC and ambient temperature were negatively related with CF and explained 44.7% (r2 = 0.447) of CF variability at day 20 of the growth-curve, while Td20 and DFC were negatively related with CF and explained 63.8% (r2 = 0.638) of CF variability towards day 30 of the growth-curve. Conclusions. The larger Td in tropical\/subtropical countries is positively related to DFC and temperature. Td and environmental factors explain 64% of CF variability in the best of cases. Therefore, other factors, such as pandemic containment measures, would explain the remaining variability.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jaime Berumen","author_inst":"Unidad de Medicina Experimental, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Max Schmulson","author_inst":"Unidad de Medicina Experimental, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Guadalupe Guerrero","author_inst":"Hospital General de Mexico, Dr. Eduardo Liceaga, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Barrera","author_inst":"Unidad de Medicina Experimental, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Jorge Larriva-Sahd","author_inst":"Instituto de Neurobiologia, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Campus Juriquilla, Queretaro Mexico"},{"author_name":"Gustavo Olaiz","author_inst":"Centro de Investigacion en politicas, poblacion y salud, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City Mexico"},{"author_name":"Rebeca Garcia-Leyva","author_inst":"Unidad de Medicina Experimental, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Rosa M Wong-Chew","author_inst":"Division de Investigacion, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Miguel Betancourt-Cravioto","author_inst":"Fundacion Carlos Slim, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Hector Gallardo","author_inst":"Fundacion Carlos Slim, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"German Fajardo-Dolci","author_inst":"Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Roberto Tapia-Conyer","author_inst":"Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Aruna Subramanian","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Angela J Rogers","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Catherine A Blish","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Deborah A Nickerson","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Helen Y Chu","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jay Shendure","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Lea M Starita","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Xin Cheng","author_inst":"Advaccine (Suzhou) Biopharmaceuticals, Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Min Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Chenxi Xia","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Maohua Li","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Le Sun","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.18.20070912","rel_title":"An empirical estimate of the infection fatality rate of COVID-19 from the first Italian outbreak","rel_date":"2020-04-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.18.20070912","rel_abs":"Background: The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been spread-ing globally for months, yet the infection fatality ratio of the disease is still uncertain. This is partly because of inconsistencies in testing and death reporting standards across countries. Our purpose is to provide accurate estimates which do not rely on testing and death count data directly but only use population level statistics. Methods: We collected demographic and death records data from the Italian Institute of Statistics. We focus on the area in Italy that experienced the initial outbreak of COVID-19 and estimated a Bayesian model fitting age-stratified mortality data from 2020 and previous years. We also assessed the sensitivity of our estimates to alternative assumptions on the proportion of population infected. Findings: We estimate an overall infection fatality rate of 1.31% (95% credible interval [CrI] 0.94-1.89), as well as large differences by age, with a low infection fatality rate of 0.05% for under 60 year old (CrI 0-0.17) and a substantially higher 4.16% (CrI 3.05-5.80) for people above 60 years of age. In our sensitivity analysis, we found that even under extreme assumptions, our method delivered useful information. For instance, even if only 10% of the population were infected, the infection fatality rate would not rise above 0.2% for people under 60. Finally, using data on demographics we show large expected heterogeneity in overall IFR across countries. Interpretation: Our empirical estimates based on population level data show a sharp difference in fatality rates between young and old people and firmly rule out overall fatality ratios below 0.5% in populations with more than 30% over 60 years old.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gianluca Rinaldi","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Matteo Paradisi","author_inst":"NBER and EIEF"},{"author_name":"Guadalupe Guerrero","author_inst":"Hospital General de Mexico, Dr. Eduardo Liceaga, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Barrera","author_inst":"Unidad de Medicina Experimental, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Jorge Larriva-Sahd","author_inst":"Instituto de Neurobiologia, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Campus Juriquilla, Queretaro Mexico"},{"author_name":"Gustavo Olaiz","author_inst":"Centro de Investigacion en politicas, poblacion y salud, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City Mexico"},{"author_name":"Rebeca Garcia-Leyva","author_inst":"Unidad de Medicina Experimental, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Rosa M Wong-Chew","author_inst":"Division de Investigacion, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Miguel Betancourt-Cravioto","author_inst":"Fundacion Carlos Slim, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Hector Gallardo","author_inst":"Fundacion Carlos Slim, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"German Fajardo-Dolci","author_inst":"Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Roberto Tapia-Conyer","author_inst":"Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Aruna Subramanian","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Angela J Rogers","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Catherine A Blish","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Deborah A Nickerson","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Helen Y Chu","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jay Shendure","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Lea M Starita","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Xin Cheng","author_inst":"Advaccine (Suzhou) Biopharmaceuticals, Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Min Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Chenxi Xia","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Maohua Li","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Le Sun","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.18.20071142","rel_title":"Is there evidence that BCG vaccination has non-specific protective effects for COVID 19 infections or is it an illusion created by lack of testing?","rel_date":"2020-04-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.18.20071142","rel_abs":"The goal of this paper is to showcase that the COVID-19 disease pattern is evolving and to study the relationship between mandatory BCG policy and caseload\/million or death\/per million. We analyze seven recent publications on the impact of BCG vaccinations on the development of COVID19 illness and extend presented findings using the latest data from April 10, 2020. We analyze data from 98 countries and we extend existing models by adding the dimension of COVID-19-related testing conducted by the analyzed countries. Similarly to prior studies, we find that COVID-19 attributable case and death incidences across countries share a relationship with the BCG vaccination inclusion in the national immunization program of a country when testing is not taken into consideration. However, this relationship vanishes when we add the dimension of testing. We observe that case and death incidences conditional on testing do not get affected by the BCG vaccination inclusion in the national immunization program of a country. Therefore, we show that there is no statistical evidence to support the assertion that inclusion of BCG vaccination in national immunization program (NIP) has any impact of COVID 19 infections (cases) or mortality.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shivendu Shivendu","author_inst":"University fo South Florida"},{"author_name":"Saurav Chakraborty","author_inst":"University of Louisville"},{"author_name":"Agnieszka Onuchowska","author_inst":"Southern Illinois University Edwardsville"},{"author_name":"Arpit Srivastava","author_inst":"University of South Florida"},{"author_name":"Ankita Patidar","author_inst":"University of South Florida"},{"author_name":"Gustavo Olaiz","author_inst":"Centro de Investigacion en politicas, poblacion y salud, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City Mexico"},{"author_name":"Rebeca Garcia-Leyva","author_inst":"Unidad de Medicina Experimental, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Rosa M Wong-Chew","author_inst":"Division de Investigacion, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Miguel Betancourt-Cravioto","author_inst":"Fundacion Carlos Slim, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Hector Gallardo","author_inst":"Fundacion Carlos Slim, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"German Fajardo-Dolci","author_inst":"Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Roberto Tapia-Conyer","author_inst":"Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Aruna Subramanian","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Angela J Rogers","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Catherine A Blish","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Deborah A Nickerson","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Helen Y Chu","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jay Shendure","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Lea M Starita","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Xin Cheng","author_inst":"Advaccine (Suzhou) Biopharmaceuticals, Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Min Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Chenxi Xia","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Maohua Li","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"},{"author_name":"Le Sun","author_inst":"AbMax Biotechnology Co., LTD"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.18.20071134","rel_title":"Cluster of COVID-19 in northern France: A retrospective closed cohort study","rel_date":"2020-04-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.18.20071134","rel_abs":"Background: The Oise department in France has been heavily affected by COVID-19 in early 2020. Methods: Between 30 March and 4 April 2020, we conducted a retrospective closed cohort study among pupils, their parents and siblings, as well as teachers and non-teaching staff of a high-school located in Oise. Participants completed a questionnaire that covered history of fever and\/or respiratory symptoms since 13 January 2020 and had blood tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The infection attack rate (IAR) was defined as the proportion of participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection based on antibody detection. Blood samples from two blood donor centres collected between 23 and 27 March 2020 in the Oise department were also tested for presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Findings: Of the 661 participants (median age: 37 years), 171 participants had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The overall IAR was 25.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 22.6-29.4), and the infection fatality rate was 0% (one-sided 97.5% CI = 0-2.1). Nine of the ten participants hospitalised since mid-January were in the infected group, giving a hospitalisation rate of 5.3% (95% CI = 2.4-9.8). Anosmia and ageusia had high positive predictive values for SARS-CoV-2 infection (84.7% and 88.1%, respectively). Smokers had a lower IAR compared to non-smokers (7.2% versus 28.0%, P <0.001). The proportion of infected individuals who had no symptoms during the study period was 17.0% (95% CI = 11.2-23.4). The proportion of donors with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in two nearby blood banks of the Oise department was 3.0% (95% CI = 1.1-6.4). Interpretation: The relatively low IAR observed in an area where SARS-CoV-2 actively circulated weeks before confinement measures indicates that establishing herd immunity will take time, and that lifting these measures in France will be long and complex.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arnaud Fontanet","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Laura Tondeur","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Yoann Madec","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Grant","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Camille Besombes","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Jolly","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Sandrine Fernandes Pellerin","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Marie-Noelle Ungeheuer","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Cailleau","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Lucie Kuhmel","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Sarah Temmam","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Christele Huon","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Kuang-Yu Chen","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Bernadette Crescenzo","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Sandie Munier","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Caroline Demeret","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Ludivine Grzelak","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Staropoli","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Timothee Bruel","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Pierre Gallian","author_inst":"Etablissement Francais du Sang"},{"author_name":"Simon Cauchemez","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Sylvie van der Werf","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Olivier Schwartz","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Marc Eloit","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Bruno Hoen","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.19.20068072","rel_title":"COVID-19 Asymptomatic Infection Estimation","rel_date":"2020-04-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.19.20068072","rel_abs":"Background: Mounting evidence suggests that there is an undetected pool of COVID-19 asymptomatic but infectious cases. Estimating the number of asymptomatic infections has been crucial to understand the virus and contain its spread, which is, however, hard to be accurately counted. Methods: We propose an approach of machine learning based fine-grained simulator (MLSim), which integrates multiple practical factors including disease progress in the incubation period, cross-region population movement, undetected asymptomatic patients, and prevention and containment strength. The interactions among these factors are modeled by virtual transmission dynamics with several undetermined parameters, which are determined from epidemic data by machine learning techniques. When MLSim learns to match the real data closely, it also models the number of asymptomatic patients. MLSim is learned from the open Chinese global epidemic data. Findings: MLSim showed better forecast accuracy than the SEIR and LSTM-based prediction models. The MLSim learned from the data of China's mainland reveals that there could have been 150,408 (142,178-157,417) asymptomatic and had self-healed patients, which is 65% (64% - 65%) of the inferred total infections including undetected ones. The numbers of asymptomatic but infectious patients on April 15, 2020, were inferred as, Italy: 41,387 (29,037 - 57,151), Germany: 21,118 (11,484 - 41,646), USA: 354,657 (277,641 - 495,128), France: 40,379 (10,807 - 186,878), and UK: 144,424 (127,215 - 171,930). To control the virus transmission, the containment measures taken by the government were crucial. The learned MLSim also reveals that if the date of containment measures in China's mainland was postponed for 1, 3, 5, and 7 days later than Jan. 23, there would be 109,039 (129%), 183,930 (218%), 313,342 (371%), 537,555 (637%) confirmed cases on June 12. Conclusions: Machine learning based fine-grained simulators can better model the complex real-world disease transmission process, and thus can help decision-making of balanced containment measures. The simulator also revealed the potential great number of undetected asymptomatic infections, which poses a great risk to the virus containment.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yang Yu","author_inst":"Nanjing University"},{"author_name":"Yu-Ren Liu","author_inst":"Nanjing University"},{"author_name":"Fan-Ming Luo","author_inst":"Nanjing University"},{"author_name":"Wei-Wei Tu","author_inst":"4Paradigm"},{"author_name":"De-Chuan Zhan","author_inst":"Nanjing University"},{"author_name":"Guo Yu","author_inst":"Northern Jiangsu People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhi-Hua Zhou","author_inst":"Nanjing University"},{"author_name":"Marie-Noelle Ungeheuer","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Cailleau","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Lucie Kuhmel","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Sarah Temmam","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Christele Huon","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Kuang-Yu Chen","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Bernadette Crescenzo","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Sandie Munier","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Caroline Demeret","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Ludivine Grzelak","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Staropoli","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Timothee Bruel","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Pierre Gallian","author_inst":"Etablissement Francais du Sang"},{"author_name":"Simon Cauchemez","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Sylvie van der Werf","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Olivier Schwartz","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Marc Eloit","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Bruno Hoen","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.19.20070805","rel_title":"Epidemiological impact of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination: mathematical modeling analyses","rel_date":"2020-04-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.19.20070805","rel_abs":"Background: Several SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates are currently in the pipeline. This study aims to inform SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development, licensure, decision-making, and implementation by determining key preferred vaccine product characteristics and associated population-level impact. Methods: Vaccination impact was assessed at various efficacies using an age-structured mathematical model describing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and disease progression, with application for China. Results: A prophylactic vaccine with efficacy against acquisition (VEs) of [&ge;]70% is needed to eliminate this infection. A vaccine with VEs <70% will still have a major impact, and may control the infection if it reduces infectiousness or infection duration among those vaccinated who acquire the infection, or alternatively if supplemented with a moderate social-distancing intervention (<20% reduction in contact rate), or complemented with herd immunity. Vaccination is cost-effective. For a vaccine with VEs of 50%, number of vaccinations needed to avert one infection is only 2.4, one severe disease case is 25.5, one critical disease case is 33.2, and one death is 65.1. Gains in effectiveness are achieved by initially prioritizing those [&ge;]60 years. Probability of a major outbreak is virtually zero with a vaccine with VEs [&ge;]70%, regardless of number of virus introductions. Yet, an increase in social contact rate among those vaccinated (behavior compensation) can undermine vaccine impact. Conclusions: Even a partially-efficacious vaccine can offer a fundamental solution to control SARS-CoV-2 infection and at high cost-effectiveness. In addition to the primary endpoint on infection acquisition, developers should assess natural history and disease progression outcomes and\/or proxy biomarkers, since such secondary endpoints may prove critical in licensure, decision-making, and vaccine impact.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Monia Makhoul","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Epidemiology Group, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar"},{"author_name":"Houssein H Ayoub","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Physics, Qatar University"},{"author_name":"Hiam Chemaitelly","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Epidemiology Group, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar"},{"author_name":"Shaheen Seedat","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Epidemiology Group, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar"},{"author_name":"Ghina R Mumtaz","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and population Health, American University of Beirut"},{"author_name":"Sarah Al-Omari","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and population Health, American University of Beirut"},{"author_name":"Laith J Abu-Raddad","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Epidemiology Group, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar"},{"author_name":"Marie-Noelle Ungeheuer","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Cailleau","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Lucie Kuhmel","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Sarah Temmam","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Christele Huon","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Kuang-Yu Chen","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Bernadette Crescenzo","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Sandie Munier","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Caroline Demeret","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Ludivine Grzelak","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Staropoli","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Timothee Bruel","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Pierre Gallian","author_inst":"Etablissement Francais du Sang"},{"author_name":"Simon Cauchemez","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Sylvie van der Werf","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Olivier Schwartz","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Marc Eloit","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Bruno Hoen","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.18.20070771","rel_title":"Decline in global COVID-19 transmission","rel_date":"2020-04-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.18.20070771","rel_abs":"We analyzed COVID-19 data through May 6th, 2020 using a partially observed Markov process. Our method uses a hybrid deterministic and stochastic formalism that allows for time variable transmission rates and detection probabilities. The model was fit using iterated particle filtering to case count and death count time series from 55 countries. We found evidence for a shrinking epidemic in 30 of the 55 examined countries. Of those 30 countries, 27 have significant evidence for subcritical transmission rates, although the decline in new cases is relatively slow compared to the initial growth rates. Generally, the transmission rates in Europe were lower than in the Americas and Asia. This suggests that global scale social distancing efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 are effective although they need to be strengthened in many regions and maintained in others to avoid further resurgence of COVID-19. The slow decline also suggests alternative strategies to control the virus are needed before social distancing efforts are partially relaxed.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ethan Obie Romero-Severson","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Nick Hengartner","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Grant Meadors","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Ruian Ke","author_inst":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Ghina R Mumtaz","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and population Health, American University of Beirut"},{"author_name":"Sarah Al-Omari","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and population Health, American University of Beirut"},{"author_name":"Laith J Abu-Raddad","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Epidemiology Group, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar"},{"author_name":"Marie-Noelle Ungeheuer","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Cailleau","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Lucie Kuhmel","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Sarah Temmam","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Christele Huon","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Kuang-Yu Chen","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Bernadette Crescenzo","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Sandie Munier","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Caroline Demeret","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Ludivine Grzelak","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Staropoli","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Timothee Bruel","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Pierre Gallian","author_inst":"Etablissement Francais du Sang"},{"author_name":"Simon Cauchemez","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Sylvie van der Werf","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Olivier Schwartz","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Marc Eloit","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Bruno Hoen","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.17.20064394","rel_title":"COVID-19.

The most affected European countries are, so far, Italy and Spain. In both countries (and others), the authorities decreed a lockdown, with local specificities. The objective of this work is to evaluate the impact of the measures undertaken in Spain to deal with the pandemic. Method: We estimated the number of cases and the impact of lockdown on the reproducibility number based on the hospitalization reports up to April 15th 2020. Results: The estimated number of cases shows a sharp increase until the lockdown, followed by a slowing down and then a decrease after full quarantine was implemented. Differences in the basic reproduction ratio are also very significant, dropping from de 5.89 (95% CI: 5.46-7.09) before the lockdown to 0.48 (95% CI: 0.15-1.17) afterwards. Conclusions: Handling a pandemic like Covid-19 is very complex and requires quick decision making. The large differences found in the speed of propagation of the disease show us that being able to implement interventions at the earliest stage is crucial to minimise the impact of a potential infectious threat.

Iran was among the first countries with a major outbreak outside China. Using all genomic sequences collected from patients with a travel link to Iran, we estimate that the epidemic started on 21\/01\/2020 (95% HPD: 05\/12\/2019-14\/02\/2020) with a doubling time of 3 days (95% HPD: 1.68-16.27). We also show, using air travel data from confirmed exported cases, that from late February to early March the number of active cases across the country were more than a hundred times higher than the reported cases at the time. A detailed province-level analysis of all-cause mortality shows 20,718 (CI 95%: 18,859-22,576) excess deaths during winter and spring 2020 compared to previous years, almost twice the number of reported COVID-19-related deaths at the time. Correcting for under-reporting of prevalence and deaths, we use an SEIR model to reconstruct the outbreak dynamics in Iran. Our model forecasted the second epidemic peak and suggests that by 14\/07\/2020 a total of 9M (CI 95%: 118K-44M) have recovered from the disease across the country.

Throughout two past months, governments around the world have implemented massive travel restrictions and border control to mitigate the outbreak of this global pandemic. However, the precise effects of travel restrictions on the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 remain unknown. Here we combine a global network mobility model with a local epidemiology model to simulate and predict the outbreak dynamics and outbreak control of COVID-19 across Europe. We correlate our mobility model to passenger air travel statistics and calibrate our epidemiology model using the number of reported COVID-19 cases for each country. Our simulations show that mobility networks of air travel can predict the emerging global diffusion pattern of a pandemic at the early stages of the outbreak. Our results suggest that an unconstrained mobility would have significantly accelerated the spreading of COVID-19, especially in Central Europe, Spain, and France. Ultimately, our network epidemiology model can inform political decision making and help identify exit strategies from current travel restrictions and total lockdown.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kevin Linka","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Mathias Peirlinck","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Francisco Sahli Costabal","author_inst":"Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile"},{"author_name":"Ellen Kuhl","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Alireza Kadivar","author_inst":"Statsminutes Company"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Ali Khosravi","author_inst":"Kawsar Human Genetic Research Center"},{"author_name":"Maryam Abbasalipour","author_inst":"Kawsar Human Genetic Research Center"},{"author_name":"Majid Heydari","author_inst":"Donya-e-Eqtesad Daily newspaper"},{"author_name":"Sirous Zeinali","author_inst":"Pasteur Institute of Iran"},{"author_name":"Luca Ferretti","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alice Ledda","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Aris Katzourakis","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Kuang-Yu Chen","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Bernadette Crescenzo","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Sandie Munier","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Caroline Demeret","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Ludivine Grzelak","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Isabelle Staropoli","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Timothee Bruel","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Pierre Gallian","author_inst":"Etablissement Francais du Sang"},{"author_name":"Simon Cauchemez","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Sylvie van der Werf","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Olivier Schwartz","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Marc Eloit","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"},{"author_name":"Bruno Hoen","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.19.20070995","rel_title":"Reduced expression of COVID-19 host receptor, ACE2 is associated with small bowel inflammation, more severe disease, and response to anti-TNF therapy in Crohn's disease","rel_date":"2020-04-23","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.19.20070995","rel_abs":"Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the host receptor for SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which has infected millions world-wide and likely caused hundreds of thousands of deaths. Utilizing transcriptomic data from four cohorts taken from Crohn's disease (CD) and non-inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) subjects, we observed evidence of increased ACE2 mRNA in ileum with demographic features that have been associated with poor outcomes in COVID-19 including age and raised BMI. ACE2 was downregulated in CD compared to controls in independent cohorts. Within CD, ACE2 expression was reduced in inflamed ileal tissue and also remarkably, from uninvolved tissue in patients with a worse prognosis in both adult and pediatric cohorts. In active CD, small bowel ACE2 expression was restored by anti-TNF therapy particularly in anti-TNF responders. Collectively our data suggest that ACE2 downregulation is associated with inflammation and worse outcomes in CD.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alka A Potdar","author_inst":"F.

In this situation, guidelines for health care professionals in endoscopy units with increased risk of infection from inhalation of airborne droplets, conjunctival contact and faeces are urgently needed. Recently, the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) and the German Society for Pneumology (DGP) issued recommendations. However, real-world data on the conditions and requirements of endoscopy units to adhere to this guidance are missing. Design: We conducted an internet-based survey among German endoscopy units from all levels of care from April 1st to 7th, 2020. The survey comprised 33 questions and was distributed electronically by the German Society of Gastroenterology, Digestive and Metabolic Diseases (DGVS) and the DGP. Results: In total, 656 endoscopy units completed the survey. Overall, 253 units (39%) cancelled fewer than 40% of their procedures. Of note, private practices cancelled less procedures than hospital-based units. Complete separation of high-risk and COVID-19 positive patients was achieved in only 20% of the units. Procedural measures were well adopted, with 91% of the units systematically identifying patients at risk and 85% using risk-adapted personal protective equipment (PPE). For the future, shortages in PPE (81%), staff (69%) and relevant financial losses (77%) were expected. Conclusion: Concise definitions of non-urgent, elective interventions and endoscopic surveillance strategies are needed to better guide endoscopic activity and intervention cancellations. In the short term, a lack of PPE can constitute considerable impairment of endoscopy units' operability and patient outcomes.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jakob Garbe","author_inst":"University Hospital Halle (Saale), Department for Internal Medicine I, Germany"},{"author_name":"Stephan Eisenmann","author_inst":"University Hospital Halle (Saale), Department for Internal Medicine I, Germany"},{"author_name":"Clara Sophie Heidemann","author_inst":"University Hospital Halle (Saale), Department for Internal Medicine I, Germany"},{"author_name":"Marko Damm","author_inst":"University Hospital Halle (Saale), Department for Internal Medicine I, Germany"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Krug","author_inst":"University Hospital Halle (Saale), Department for Internal Medicine I, Germany"},{"author_name":"Steffen Walter","author_inst":"University Hospital Ulm, Department for Medical Psychology, Ulm, Germany"},{"author_name":"Frank Lammert","author_inst":"Saarland University Hospital, Department for Medicine II, Homburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Kaid Darwiche","author_inst":"Ruhrland Hospital, West German Lung Center, Essen, Nordrhein-Westfalen, DE"},{"author_name":"Patrick Michl","author_inst":"University Hospital Halle (Saale), Department for Internal Medicine I, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jonas Rosendahl","author_inst":"University Hospital Halle (Saale), Department for Internal Medicine I, Germany"},{"author_name":"Stephan R Targan","author_inst":"F.

Nasopharyngeal specimens positive for SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses collected in universal viral transport (UVT) medium were pre-processed by several commercial and laboratory-developed methods and tested by RT-qPCR assays without RNA extraction using different RT-qPCR master mixes. The results were compared to that of standard approach that involves RNA extraction. Incubation of specimens at 65{degrees}C for 10 minutes along with the use of TaqPath 1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix provides higher analytical sensitivity for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA than many other conditions tested. The optimized direct RT-qPCR approach demonstrated a limit of detection of 6.6x103 copy\/ml and high reproducibility (co-efficient of variation = 1.2%). In 132 nasopharyngeal specimens submitted for SARS-CoV-2 testing, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of our optimized approach were 95%, 99% and 98.5%, respectively, with reference to the standard approach. Also, the RT-qPCR CT values obtained by the two methods were positively correlated (Pearson correlation coefficient r=0.6971, p=0.0013). The rate of PCR inhibition by the direct approach was 8% compared to 9% by the standard approach. Our simple approach to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA by direct RT-qPCR may help laboratories continue testing for the virus despite reagent shortages or expand their testing capacity in resource limited settings.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammad Rubayet Hasan","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine"},{"author_name":"Faheem Mirza","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hamad Al-Hail","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sathyavathi Sundararaju","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine"},{"author_name":"Thabisile Xaba","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Iqbal","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hashim Alhussain","author_inst":"Qatar University"},{"author_name":"Hadi Mohamad Yassine","author_inst":"Qatar University"},{"author_name":"Andres Perez Lopez","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine"},{"author_name":"Patrick Tang","author_inst":"Sidra Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stephan R Targan","author_inst":"F.

These masks are normally intended for single use, but their sterilization and subsequent reuse could substantially mitigate a world-wide shortage. Design: Quality assurance. Setting: A sealed environment chamber installed in the animal facility of an academic medical center. Interventions: One to five sterilization cycles using ionized hydrogen peroxide (iHP), generated by SteraMist equipment (TOMI; Frederick, MD). Main outcome measures: Personal protective equipment, including five N95 mask models from three manufacturers, were evaluated for efficacy of sterilization following iHP treatment (measured with bacterial spores in standard biological indicator assemblies). Additionally, N95 masks were assessed for their ability to efficiently filter particles down to 0.3um and for their ability to form an airtight seal using a quantitative fit test. Filtration efficiency was measured using ambient particulate matter at a university lab and an aerosolized NaCl challenge at a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) pre-certification laboratory. Results: The data demonstrate that N95 masks sterilized using SteraMist iHP technology retain function up to five cycles, the maximum number tested to date. Some but not all PPE could also be sterilized using an iHP environmental chamber, but pre-treatment with a handheld iHP generator was required for semi-enclosed surfaces such as respirator hoses. Conclusions: A typical iHP environment chamber with a volume of ~80 m3 can treat ~7000 masks per day, as well as other items of PPE, making this an effective approach for a busy medical center.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Avilash Cramer","author_inst":"Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences & Technology"},{"author_name":"Deborah Plana","author_inst":"Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences & Technology; Harvard Ludwig Cancer Research Center and Department of Systems Biology"},{"author_name":"Helen L Yang","author_inst":"Harvard-MIT Center for Regulatory Science, Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Mary Carmack","author_inst":"Harvard-MIT Center for Regulatory Science; Computational Health Informatics Program, Boston Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Enze Tian","author_inst":"Department of Building Science, Tsinghua University; Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering and Department of Materials Science and Engineering, MIT"},{"author_name":"Michael S Sinha","author_inst":"Harvard-MIT Center for Regulatory Science, Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"David Krikorian","author_inst":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"David Turner","author_inst":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Jinhan Mo","author_inst":"Department of Building Science, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Ju Li","author_inst":"Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering and Department of Materials Science and Engineering, MIT"},{"author_name":"Rajiv Gupta","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School; Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Heather Manning","author_inst":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Florence T.

Post-Soviet states are facing unique challenges due to their developing healthcare systems and unstable economy. The aim of this paper was to provide estimates for current development COVID-19 pandemic in the Post-Soviet states and forecast potential best and worst scenarios for spread of this deadly infection. Methods: The data on confirmed cases and deaths were extracted from official governmental sources for a period from beginning of outbreak dates for each country until April 18, 2020. A modified SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) modelling was used to plot the parameters of epidemic in 10 post-Soviet states and forecast the number of cases over a period of 10, 30 and 60 days. We also estimated the numbers of cases based on the optimal measures (best scenario) and suboptimal measures (worst scenarios) of potential spread of COVID-19 in these countries. Results: It was estimated that Armenia and Azerbaijan have reached their peaks, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova and Uzbekistan are expected to reach their peaks in the coming week (April 29 - May 7, 2020), with comparatively low cases of COVID-19 and loss of lives in the best-case scenario. In contrast, Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine would likely see the outbreaks with the largest number of COVID-19 cases amongst the studied Post-Soviet States in the worst scenario during the next 30 and 60 days. Geographical remoteness and small number of international travelers from the countries heavily affected by the pandemic could also have contributed to delay in the spread of COVID-19. Conclusion: Governmental response was shown to be as an important determining factor responsible for the development of COVID-19 epidemic in Post-Soviet states. The current protection rates should be maintained to reduce active cases during upcoming 30 and 60 days. The estimated possible scenarios based on the proposed model can potentially be used by healthcare professionals from each studied Post-Soviet States as well as others to improve plans to contain the current and future epidemic.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alpamys Issanov","author_inst":"Nazarbayev University"},{"author_name":"Yerlan Amanbek","author_inst":"Nazarbayev University"},{"author_name":"Anara Abbay","author_inst":"Nazarbayev Univesity"},{"author_name":"Shalkar Adambekov","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Mohamad Aljofan","author_inst":"Nazarbayev Univesity"},{"author_name":"Ardak Kashkynbayev","author_inst":"Nazarbayev University"},{"author_name":"Abduzhappar Gaipov","author_inst":"Nazarbayev University"},{"author_name":"David Turner","author_inst":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Jinhan Mo","author_inst":"Department of Building Science, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Ju Li","author_inst":"Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering and Department of Materials Science and Engineering, MIT"},{"author_name":"Rajiv Gupta","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School; Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Heather Manning","author_inst":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Florence T.

There are currently over 400 clinical trials (phase 2 and 3) of treatments for COVID-19 registered on clinicaltrials.gov. Covariate adjustment is a statistical analysis method with potential to improve precision and reduce the required sample size for a substantial number of these trials. Though covariate adjustment is recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency, it is underutilized, especially for the types of outcomes (binary, ordinal and time-to-event) that are common in COVID-19 trials. To demonstrate the potential value added by covariate adjustment in this context, we simulated two-arm, randomized trials comparing a hypothetical COVID-19 treatment versus standard of care, where the primary outcome is binary, ordinal, or time-to-event. Our simulated distributions are derived from two sources: longitudinal data on over 500 patients hospitalized at Weill Cornell Medicine New York Presbyterian Hospital, and a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) preliminary description of 2449 cases. We found substantial precision gains from using covariate adjustment--equivalent to 9-21% reductions in the required sample size to achieve a desired power--for a variety of estimands (targets of inference) when the trial sample size was at least 200. We provide an R package and practical recommendations for implementing covariate adjustment. The estimators that we consider are robust to model misspecification.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Benkeser","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University"},{"author_name":"Ivan Diaz","author_inst":"Division of Biostatistics, Department of Population Health Sciences, Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alex Luedtke","author_inst":"Department of Statistics, University of Washington.
