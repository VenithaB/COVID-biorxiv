This is particularly so when a large share of asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic patients escape testing, or when overwhelmed healthcare systems are forced to limit testing further to severe cases only. By leveraging data on COVID-19, we propose a novel way to estimate a disease's infected fatality rate, the true lethality of the disease, in the presence of sparse and partial information. We show that this is feasible when the disease has turned into a pandemic and data comes from a large number of countries, or regions within countries, as long as testing strategies vary sufficiently. For Italy, our method estimates an IFR of 1.1% (95% CI: 0.2% - 2.1%), which is strongly in line with other methods. At the global level, our method estimates an IFR of 1.6% (95% CI: 1.1% - 2.1%). This method also allows us to show that the IFR varies according to each country's age structure and healthcare capacity.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matteo Villa","author_inst":"Italian Institute for International Political Studies (ISPI)"},{"author_name":"James F.

Patients with comorbidity such as hypertension suffer more severe infection with elevated case fatality rate. Development of effective anti-viral drug is in urgent need to treat COVID-19 patients. Here we report that calcium channel blockers (CCBs), a type of anti-hypertension drugs that are widely used in the clinics, can significantly inhibit the post-entry replication events of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Comparison with two other major types of anti-hypertension drugs, the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), showed that only CCBs display significant anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy. Combined treatment with chloroquine and CCBs significantly enhanced the anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy. Retrospective clinical investigation of COVID-19 patients revealed that the CCB amlodipine besylate administration distinctly reduced the case fatality rate of patients with hypertension. Results from this study suggest that CCB administration for COVID-19 patients with hypertension as the comorbidity might improve the disease outcome.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Leike Zhang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, Hubei, 430071, P.

It took about 2 months for China to get this infectious disease under control in its epicenter at Wuhan. Since February 2020, COVID-19 has been spreading around the world, becoming widespread in a number of countries. The timing and nature of government actions in response to the pandemic has varied from country to country, and their role in affecting the spread of the disease has been debated. Method: The present study proposed a modified susceptible-exposed-infected-removed model (SEIR) model to perform a comparative analysis of the temporal progress of disease spread in six regions worldwide: three Chinese regions (Zhejiang, Guangdong and Xinjiang) vs. three countries (South Korea, Italy and Iran). For each region we developed detailed timelines of reported infections and outcomes, along with government-implemented measures to enforce social distancing. Simulations of the imposition of strong social distancing measures were used to evaluate the impact that these measures might have had on the duration and severity of COVID-19 outbreaks in the three countries. Results: The main results of this study are as follows: (a) an empirical COVID-19 growth law provides an excellent fit to the disease data in all study regions and potentially could be of more general validity; (b) significant differences exist in the spread characteristics of the disease among the three regions of China and between the three regions of China and the three countries; (c) under the control measures implemented in the Chinese regions (including the immediate quarantine of infected patients and their close contacts, and considerable restrictions on social contacts), the transmission rate of COVID-19 followed a modified normal distribution function, and it reached its peak after 1 to 2 days and then was reduced to zero 11, 11 and 18 days after a 1st-Level Response to Major Public Health Emergency was declared in Zhejiang, Guangdong and Xinjiang, respectively; moreover, the epidemic control times in Zhejiang, Guangdong and Xinjiang showed that the epidemic reached an \"inflection point\" after 9, 12 and 17 days, respectively, after a 1st-Level Response was issued; (d) an empirical COVID-19 law provided an excellent fit to the disease data in the six study regions, and the law can be potentially of more general validity; and (e) the curves of infected cases in South Korea, Italy and Iran would had been significantly flattened and shrunken at a relatively earlier stage of the epidemic if similar preventive measures as in the Chinese regions had been also taken in the above three countries on February 25th, February 25th and March 8th, respectively: the simulated maximum number of infected individuals in South Korea, Italy and Iran would had been 4480 cases (March 9th, 2020), 2335 cases (March 10th) and 6969 cases (March 20th), instead of the actual (reported) numbers of 7212 cases (March 9th), 8514 cases (March 10th, 2020) and 11466 cases (March 20th), respectively; moreover, up to March 29th, the simulated reduction in the accumulated number of infected cases would be 1585 for South Korea, 93490 for Italy and 23213 for Iran, respectively, accounting for 16.41% (South Korea), 95.70% (Italy) and 60.59% (Iran) of the accumulated number of actual reported infected cases. Conclusions: The implemented measures in China were very effective for controlling the spread of COVID-19. These measures should be taken as early as possible, including the early identification of all infection sources and eliminating transmission pathways. Subsequently, the number of infected cases can be controlled at a low level, and existing medical resources could be sufficient for maintaining higher cure rates and lower mortality rate compared to the current situations in these countries. The proposed model can account for these prevention and control measures by properly adjusting its parameters, it computes the corresponding variations in disease transmission rate during the outbreak period, and it can provide valuable information for public health decision-making purposes.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Junyu He","author_inst":"Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Guangwei Chen","author_inst":"Ocean College, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Yutong Jiang","author_inst":"Ocean College, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Runjie Jin","author_inst":"Ocean College, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Mingjun He","author_inst":"Ocean College, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Ashton Shortridge","author_inst":"Department of Geography, Environment and Spatial Sciences, Michigan State University, East Lansing, U.S.A"},{"author_name":"Jiaping Wu","author_inst":"Ocean College, Zhejiang University;Ocean Academy, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"George Christakos","author_inst":"Ocean College, Zhejiang University;Department of Geography, San Diego State University, San Diego, U.S.A."},{"author_name":"Yu-Lan Zhang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, Hubei, 430071, P.

Countries have adopted disparate policies in tackling the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. For example, South Korea started a vigorous campaign to suppress the virus by testing patients with respiratory symptoms and tracing and isolating all their contacts, and many European countries are trying to slow down the spread of the virus with varying degrees of shutdowns. There is clearly a need for a model that can realistically simulate different policy actions and their impacts on the disease and health care capacity in a country or a region. Specifically, there is a need to identify destructive policies, i.e. policies that are, based on scientific knowledge, worse than an alternative and should not be implemented. Methods. We developed an agent-based model (REINA) using Python and accelerated it by the Cython optimising static compiler. It follows a population over time at individual level at different stages of the disease and estimates the number of patients in hospitals and in intensive care. It estimates death rates and counts based on the treatment available. Any number of interventions can be added on the timeline from a selection including e.g. physical isolation, testing and tracing, and controlling the amount of cases entering the area. The model has open source code and runs online. Results. The model uses the demographics of the Helsinki University Hospital region (1.6 million inhabitants). A mitigation strategy aims to slow down the spread of the epidemic to maintain the hospital capacity by implementing mobility restrictions. A suppression strategy initially consists of the same restrictions but also aggressive testing, tracing, and isolating all coronavirus positive patients and their contacts. The modelling starting point is 2020-02-18. The strategies follow the actual situation until 2020-04-06 and then diverge. The default mitigation scenario with variable 30-40% mobility reduction appears to delay the peak of the epidemic (as intended) but not suppress the disease. In the suppression strategy, active testing and tracing of patients with symptoms and their contacts is implemented in addition to 20-25% mobility reduction. This results in a reduction of the cumulative number of infected individuals from 820 000 to 80 000 and the number of deaths from 6000 to only 640, when compared with the mitigation strategy (during the first year of the epidemic). Discussion. The agent-based model (REINA) can be used to simulate epidemic outcomes for various types of policy actions on a timeline. Our results lend support to the strategy of combining comprehensive testing, contact tracing and targeted isolation measures with social isolation measures. While social isolation is important in the early stages to prevent explosive growth, relying on social isolation alone (the mitigation strategy) appears to be a destructive policy. The open-source nature of the model facilitates rapid further development. The flexibility of the modelling logic supports the future implementation of several already identified refinements in terms of more realistic population models and new types of more specific policy interventions. Improving estimates of epidemic parameters will make it possible to improve modelling accuracy further.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jouni T Tuomisto","author_inst":"Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare"},{"author_name":"Juha Yrj\u00f6l\u00e4","author_inst":"Kausal Ltd"},{"author_name":"Mikko Kolehmainen","author_inst":"University of Eastern Finland"},{"author_name":"Juhani Bonsdorff","author_inst":"Stretta Capital Ltd"},{"author_name":"Jami Pekkanen","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Tero Tikkanen","author_inst":"Kausal Ltd"},{"author_name":"Jiaping Wu","author_inst":"Ocean College, Zhejiang University;Ocean Academy, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"George Christakos","author_inst":"Ocean College, Zhejiang University;Department of Geography, San Diego State University, San Diego, U.S.A."},{"author_name":"Yu-Lan Zhang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, Hubei, 430071, P.

We aimed to determine whether influenza diagnoses masked early COVID-19 cases and, if so, estimate numbers of undetected COVID-19 cases in a large database of primary-care records covering >6 million people in Catalonia. Design: Time-series study of influenza and COVID-19 cases, using all influenza seasons from autumn-winter 2010-2011 to autumn-winter 2019-2020. Setting: Primary care, Catalonia, Spain. Participants: People registered in one of the contributing primary-care practices, covering >6 million people and >85% of the population. Main outcome measures: Weekly new cases of influenza and COVID-19 diagnosed in primary care. Analyses: Daily counts of both cases were computed using the total cases recorded over the previous 7 days to avoid weekly effects on recording practice. Epidemic curves were characterised for the 2010-2011 to 2019-2020 influenza seasons. Influenza seasons with a similar epidemic curve and peak case number as the 2019-2020 season were used to model predictions for 2019-2020. ARIMA models were fitted to the included influenza seasons, overall and stratified by age, to estimate expected case numbers. Daily excess influenza cases were defined as the number of observed minus expected cases. Results: Four influenza season curves (2011-2012, 2012-2013, 2013-2014, and 2016-2017) were used to estimate the number of expected cases of influenza in 2019-2020. Between 4 February 2020 and 20 March 20202, 8,017 (95% CI: 1,841 to 14,718) excess influenza cases were identified. This excess was highest in the 15-64 age group. Conclusions: COVID-19 cases may have been present in the Catalan population when the first imported case was reported on 25 February 2020. COVID-19 carriers may have been misclassified as influenza diagnoses in primary care, boosting community transmission before public health measures were taken. In future, the surveillance of excess influenza cases using widely available primary-care electronic medical records could help detect new outbreaks of COVID-19 or other influenza-like illness-causing pathogens. Earlier detection would allow public health responses to be initiated earlier than during the current crisis.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ermengol Coma","author_inst":"Sistemes d Informacio dels Serveis d Atencio Primaria (SISAP), Institut Catala de la Salut(ICS), Barcelona, Spain; Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recer"},{"author_name":"Nuria Mora","author_inst":"Sistemes d Informacio dels Serveis d Atencio Primaria (SISAP), Institut Catala de la Salut(ICS), Barcelona, Spain; Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recer"},{"author_name":"Albert Prats-Uribe","author_inst":"Pharmaco- and Device Epidemiology, Centre for Statistics in Medicine - Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology, And Musculoskeletal Sciences, Universi"},{"author_name":"Francesc Fina","author_inst":"Sistemes d Informacio dels Serveis d Atencio Primaria (SISAP), Institut Catala de la Salut(ICS), Barcelona, Spain; Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recer"},{"author_name":"Daniel Prieto-Alhambra","author_inst":"Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol), Barcelona, Spain. ; Pharmaco- and Device Epidemiol"},{"author_name":"Manuel Medina-Peralta","author_inst":"Sistemes d Informacio dels Serveis d Atencio Primaria (SISAP), Institut Catala de la Salut(ICS), Barcelona, Spain; Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recer"},{"author_name":"Jiaping Wu","author_inst":"Ocean College, Zhejiang University;Ocean Academy, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"George Christakos","author_inst":"Ocean College, Zhejiang University;Department of Geography, San Diego State University, San Diego, U.S.A."},{"author_name":"Yu-Lan Zhang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, Hubei, 430071, P.

Variants that proxy ACE inhibitor drug effects and cardiometabolic risk factors (body mass index, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lifetime smoking index, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic blood pressure and type 2 diabetes mellitus) were selected from publicly available genome-wide association study data (sample sizes ranging from 188,577 to 898,130 participants). Genetic association estimates for lung expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were obtained from the Gene-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project (515 participants) and the Lung eQTL Consortium (1,038 participants). Genetic association estimates for circulating plasma ACE2 levels were obtained from the INTERVAL study (4,947 participants). Main outcomes and measures: Lung ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression and plasma ACE2 levels. Results: There were no association of genetically proxied ACE inhibition with any of the outcomes considered here. There was evidence of a positive association of genetic liability to type 2 diabetes mellitus with lung ACE2 gene expression in GTEx (p = 4x10-4) and with circulating plasma ACE2 levels in INTERVAL (p = 0.03), but not with lung ACE2 expression in the Lung eQTL Consortium study (p = 0.68). There were no associations between genetically predicted levels of the other cardiometabolic traits with the outcomes.

In the current COVID-19 pandemic, our findings do not support a change in ACE inhibitor medication use without clinical justification.","rel_num_authors":32,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dipender Gill","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Marios Arvanitis","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Paul Carter","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Ana I Hernandez Cordero","author_inst":"The University of British Columbia Center for Heart Lung Innovation"},{"author_name":"Brian Jo","author_inst":"Lewis Sigler Institute for Integrative Biology"},{"author_name":"Ville Karhunen","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Susanna C Larsson","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Xuan Li","author_inst":"The University of British Columbia Center for Heart Lung Innovation"},{"author_name":"Sam M Lockhart","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Amy M Mason","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Evanthia Pashos","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Ashis Saha","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Tan","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Verena Zuber","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Yohan Bosse","author_inst":"Laval University, Quebec"},{"author_name":"Sarah Fahle","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Ke Hao","author_inst":"School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Tao Jiang","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Philippe Joubert","author_inst":"Laval University, Quebec"},{"author_name":"Alan C Lunt","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Willem hendrik Ouwehand","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"David J Roberts","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Wim Timens","author_inst":"University of Groningen"},{"author_name":"Maarten van den Berge","author_inst":"University of Groningen"},{"author_name":"Nicholas A Watkins","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Alexis Battle","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Adam S Butterworth","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"John Danesh","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Barbara E Engelhard","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"James E Peters","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Don Sin","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Stephen Burgess","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"genetic and genomic medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.10.20061192","rel_title":"COVID-19 most vulnerable Mexican cities lack the public health infrastructure to face the pandemic: a new temporally-explicit model","rel_date":"2020-04-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.10.20061192","rel_abs":"Recently, a wide array of epidemiological models has been developed to guide public health actors in containing the rapid dissemination of the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), cause of COVID-19. Despite their usefulness, many epidemiological models recently developed to understand the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and infection rates of COVID-19 fall short as they ignore human mobility, limiting our understanding of the spread of the disease, together with the vulnerability of population centers in a broad scale. We developed a new temporally-explicit model and simulated several social distancing scenarios to predict the vulnerability to COVID-19 of 50 Mexican cities that are interconnected by their air transportation network. Additionally, we assessed the sufficiency of the public health infrastructure in the focal cities to face the pandemic over time. Based on our model, we show that the most important cities within the Mexican air transportation network are the most vulnerable to COVID-19, with all assessed public health infrastructure being insufficient to face the modeled scenario for the pandemic after 100 days. Despite these alarming findings, our results show that social distancing could dramatically decrease the total number of infected people (77% drop-off for the 45% distancing scenario when contrasted with no distancing), flattening the growth of infection rate. Thus, we consider that this study provides useful information that may help decision-makers to timely implement health policies to anticipate and lessen the impact of the current pandemic in Mexico.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wesley Dattilo Sr.","author_inst":"Instituto de Ecologia AC"},{"author_name":"Alcides Castro e Silva","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto"},{"author_name":"Roger Guevara Sr.","author_inst":"Instituto de Ecologia AC"},{"author_name":"Ian MacGregor-Fors","author_inst":"Instituto de Ecologia AC"},{"author_name":"Servio Pontes Ribeiro","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto"},{"author_name":"Ville Karhunen","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Susanna C Larsson","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Xuan Li","author_inst":"The University of British Columbia Center for Heart Lung Innovation"},{"author_name":"Sam M Lockhart","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Amy M Mason","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Evanthia Pashos","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Ashis Saha","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Tan","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Verena Zuber","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Yohan Bosse","author_inst":"Laval University, Quebec"},{"author_name":"Sarah Fahle","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Ke Hao","author_inst":"School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Tao Jiang","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Philippe Joubert","author_inst":"Laval University, Quebec"},{"author_name":"Alan C Lunt","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Willem hendrik Ouwehand","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"David J Roberts","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Wim Timens","author_inst":"University of Groningen"},{"author_name":"Maarten van den Berge","author_inst":"University of Groningen"},{"author_name":"Nicholas A Watkins","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Alexis Battle","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Adam S Butterworth","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"John Danesh","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Barbara E Engelhard","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"James E Peters","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Don Sin","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Stephen Burgess","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.09.20060103","rel_title":"Acceptance and preference for COVID-19 vaccination in health-care workers (HCWs)","rel_date":"2020-04-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.09.20060103","rel_abs":"The objective of the present study is to reveal the acceptance and preference for the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccination in health-care workers (HCWs). We performed an internet-based, region-stratified survey among 352 HCWs and 189 individuals in the general population enrolled on March 17th and 18th 2020 from 26 Chinese provinces. The HCWs developed a more in-depth understanding of SARS-Coronavirus-2 infection and showed a higher tolerance to the future vaccination than the general population. 76.4% of HCWs (vs. 72.5% in the general) showed their willingness to receive vaccination. Potential benefits from COVID-19 outbreak such as seeking influenza (65.3%) or pneumonia (55.7%) vaccination can be gained in HCWs. To estimate the relative effects of attributes influencing vaccination choice in the discrete choice experiment, 7 attributes (3 disease-relevant, 3 vaccine-relevant, and 1 of social acceptance) were identified as key determinants. Among them, disease trend (odds ratio, OR: 4.367 (95%CI, 3.721-5.126) for seasonal epidemic, OR: 3.069 (2.612-3.605) for persistent epidemic, with reference to disappearance in summer), social contacts decisions (0.398: 0.339-0.467 for refusal, 0.414: 0.353-0.487 for neutral, with reference to acceptance) and high possibility of being infected (2.076: 1.776-2.425 for infection probability of 30%+ ) were significantly associated with increased probability of choosing vaccination in the HCWs. In contrast, for the general population, vaccine safety and social contacts decisions were the most important predictors. For COVID-19 vaccination, education in HCWs should be taken as a priority, and further benefits of its recommendation to the general public will also be anticipated.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chuanxi Fu","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zheng Wei","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University"},{"author_name":"Sen Pei","author_inst":"Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Shunping Li","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Health Economics and Policy Research, Shandong University;School of Health Care Management, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Xiaohui Sun","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ping Liu","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Health Economics and Policy Research, Shandong University;School of Health Care Management, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Susanna C Larsson","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Xuan Li","author_inst":"The University of British Columbia Center for Heart Lung Innovation"},{"author_name":"Sam M Lockhart","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Amy M Mason","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Evanthia Pashos","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Ashis Saha","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Tan","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Verena Zuber","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Yohan Bosse","author_inst":"Laval University, Quebec"},{"author_name":"Sarah Fahle","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Ke Hao","author_inst":"School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Tao Jiang","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Philippe Joubert","author_inst":"Laval University, Quebec"},{"author_name":"Alan C Lunt","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Willem hendrik Ouwehand","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"David J Roberts","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Wim Timens","author_inst":"University of Groningen"},{"author_name":"Maarten van den Berge","author_inst":"University of Groningen"},{"author_name":"Nicholas A Watkins","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Alexis Battle","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Adam S Butterworth","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"John Danesh","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Barbara E Engelhard","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"James E Peters","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Don Sin","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Stephen Burgess","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.13.20060269","rel_title":"Sequential Vaccination for Containing Epidemics","rel_date":"2020-04-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.13.20060269","rel_abs":"The dynamics of infectious diseases spread is crucial in determining their risk and offering ways to contain them.

It is affecting the entire planet and we focus in Spain, where the first case was detected at the end of January 2020 and in recent weeks it has increased in many cases. We need predictive models in order to be efficient and take actions. The general goal of this work is present a new model of SARS-CoV-2 to predict different scenarios of accumulated cases in Spain. Material and methods: In this short report is used a model proposed previously, based on a parametric model Weibull and in a the library BDSbiost3 developed in R to infer and predict different scenarios of the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 for the accumulated cases in Spain after the spread that affects Spain detected at the end of January of this year. Results: In the analyses presented, projective curves have been generated for the evolution of accumulated cases in which they reach about 4,000 cases or about 15,000 cases, for which the lines of the day in which the value for 90 will be reached can be seen vertically 90, 95 and 99% of the asymptote (maximum number of cases, from that day they will begin to descend or remain the same), that is why the vertical lines would indicate the brake of the disease. For the worst-case scenario, it takes 118, 126 or 142 days to reach the maximum number of cases (n = 15,000) to reach 90, 95 and 99% of the asymptote (maximum number of cases), respectively. This means translated in a time scale that in the worst case the virus will not stop its progress, in Spain, until summer 2020, hopefully before. Comments and conclusions: This model could be used to plan the resources and see if the policies or means dedicated to the virus are slowing the progress of the virus or it is necessary to implement others that are more effective, and can also validate a method for future outbreaks of diseases such as these.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"TONI MONLEON-GETINO Sr.","author_inst":"UNIVERSITY OF BARCELONA"},{"author_name":"Jaume Canela-Soler","author_inst":"University of Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Shie Mannor","author_inst":"Technion - Israel Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Shunping Li","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Health Economics and Policy Research, Shandong University;School of Health Care Management, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Xiaohui Sun","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ping Liu","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Health Economics and Policy Research, Shandong University;School of Health Care Management, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Susanna C Larsson","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Xuan Li","author_inst":"The University of British Columbia Center for Heart Lung Innovation"},{"author_name":"Sam M Lockhart","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Amy M Mason","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Evanthia Pashos","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Ashis Saha","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Tan","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Verena Zuber","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Yohan Bosse","author_inst":"Laval University, Quebec"},{"author_name":"Sarah Fahle","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Ke Hao","author_inst":"School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Tao Jiang","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Philippe Joubert","author_inst":"Laval University, Quebec"},{"author_name":"Alan C Lunt","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Willem hendrik Ouwehand","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"David J Roberts","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Wim Timens","author_inst":"University of Groningen"},{"author_name":"Maarten van den Berge","author_inst":"University of Groningen"},{"author_name":"Nicholas A Watkins","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Alexis Battle","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Adam S Butterworth","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"John Danesh","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Barbara E Engelhard","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"James E Peters","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Don Sin","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Stephen Burgess","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.08.20058842","rel_title":"The Epidemiological Implications of Incarceration Dynamics in Jails for Community, Corrections Officer, and Incarcerated Population Risks from COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-04-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.08.20058842","rel_abs":"COVID-19 challenges the daily function of nearly every institution of society.

In this way, we provide estimates of the infection risks, and likely loss of life, that arise from current incarceration practices. We provide estimates for in-custody deaths and show how the within-jail dynamics lead to spill-over risks, not only affecting the incarcerated people, but increasing the exposure, infection, and death rates for both corrections officers with whom they interact within the jail system, and the broader community beyond the justice system. We show that, given a typical jail-community dynamic, operating in a business as usual way will result in significant and rapid loss of life. Large scale reductions in arrest and speeding of releases are likely to save the lives of incarcerated people, staff and the community at large.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eric Lofgren","author_inst":"Washington State University"},{"author_name":"Kristian Lum","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"},{"author_name":"Aaron Horowitz","author_inst":"American Civil Liberties Union"},{"author_name":"Brooke Madubuonwu","author_inst":"American Civil Liberties Union"},{"author_name":"Nina Fefferman","author_inst":"University of Tennessee"},{"author_name":"Ping Liu","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Health Economics and Policy Research, Shandong University;School of Health Care Management, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Susanna C Larsson","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Xuan Li","author_inst":"The University of British Columbia Center for Heart Lung Innovation"},{"author_name":"Sam M Lockhart","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Amy M Mason","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Evanthia Pashos","author_inst":"Pfizer"},{"author_name":"Ashis Saha","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Tan","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Verena Zuber","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Yohan Bosse","author_inst":"Laval University, Quebec"},{"author_name":"Sarah Fahle","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Ke Hao","author_inst":"School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Tao Jiang","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Philippe Joubert","author_inst":"Laval University, Quebec"},{"author_name":"Alan C Lunt","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Willem hendrik Ouwehand","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"David J Roberts","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Wim Timens","author_inst":"University of Groningen"},{"author_name":"Maarten van den Berge","author_inst":"University of Groningen"},{"author_name":"Nicholas A Watkins","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Alexis Battle","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Adam S Butterworth","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"John Danesh","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Barbara E Engelhard","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"James E Peters","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Don Sin","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Stephen Burgess","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.09.20059824","rel_title":"Recovery Ratios Reliably Anticipate COVID-19 Pandemic Progression","rel_date":"2020-04-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.09.20059824","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic is placing unprecedented demands on healthcare systems worldwide and exacting a massive humanitarian toll.

Here, taking an empirical approach, we report a 20-30 day lag between the peak of confirmed to recovered cases and the peak of daily deaths in each country, independent of the epoch of that country in its pandemic cycle. This analysis is expected to be largely independent of the proportion of the population being tested and therefore should aid in planning around the timing and easing of public health measures. Our data also suggests broad predictions for the number of fatalities, generally somewhat lower than most other models.

The current study assesses rates of mental health outcomes in the Italian general population three to four weeks into lockdown measures and explores the impact of COVID-19 related potential risk factors. Methods A web-based survey spread throughout the internet between March 27th and April 6th 2020. 18147 individuals completed the questionnaire, 79.6% women. Selected outcomes were post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), depression, anxiety, insomnia, perceived stress and adjustment disorder symptoms (ADS). Seemingly unrelated logistic regression analysis was performed to identify COVID-19 related risk factors. Results Respondents endorsing PTSS, depression, anxiety, insomnia, high perceived stress and adjustment disorder were 6604 (37%), 3084 (17.3%), 3700 (20.8%), 1301 (7.3%), 3895 (21.8%) and 4092 (22.9%), respectively. Being woman and younger age were associated with all of the selected outcomes. Quarantine was associated with PTSS, anxiety and ADS. Any recent COVID-related stressful life event was associated with all the selected outcomes. Discontinued working activity due to the COVID-19 was associated with all the selected outcomes, except for ADS; working more than usual was associated with PTSS, Perceived stress and ADS.

This study aims to examine the effects of airborne particulate matter (PM) pollution on COVID-19 across China. Methods: In this study, we obtained confirmed cases of COVID-19, the data of airborne ambient PM with aerodynamic diameter [&le;] 2.5 m (PM2.5) and [&le;] 10 m (PM10), ambient temperature (AT), absolute humidity (AH) and migration scale index (MSI) in 72 cities of China (excluded Wuhan city) on a daily basis, each of which confirmed more than 50 cases from January 20th to March 2nd, 2020. We applied a two-stage analysis. Generalized additive models with quasi-Poisson distribution was first fitted to estimate city-specific effects of PM10 and PM2.5 on daily confirmed COVID-19 cases while controlling AT, AH and MSI. Then, we used meta-analysis to generate the pooled effect estimates from city-specific results. Results: During the study period, there were a total of 24 939 COVID-19 cases, most of which were reported in Hubei Province. In our meta-analysis, we found each 10 g\/m3 increase in concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 in single day lag (from lag 0 to lag 7 and lag 14) were positively associated with confirmed cases of COVID-19, not including PM10 at lag 5, lag 6 and lag 7, and PM2.5 at lag 5, lag 6. Similar trend was also found in different cumulative lag days (from lag 01 to lag 07 and lag 014). The effects of PM2.5 and PM10 on daily COVID-19 confirmed cases are statistically significant for three cumulative lag periods over 3, 7 and 14 days with the greatest effect over 14 days. The estimated RRs of which were 1.64 (95% CIs: 1.47, 1.82) and 1.47 (95% CIs: 1.34, 1.61) with each 10 g\/m3 increase in concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10, respectively. In addition, we found that the effects of PM2.5 on daily confirmed cases were greater than PM10 in all included lag days. Conclusions: This nationwide study suggests that airborne PM pollution likely increases the risk of getting COVID-19 in China.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bo Wang","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Jiangtao Liu","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Shihua Fu","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xiaocheng Xu","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Lanyu Li","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yueling Ma","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Ji Zhou","author_inst":"Shanghai Meteorological Bureau"},{"author_name":"Jinxi Yao","author_inst":"Gansu Provincial Centre for Diseases Prevention and Control"},{"author_name":"Xingrong Liu","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xiuxia Zhang","author_inst":"Lanzhou University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Xiaotao He","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Jun Yan","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yanjun Shi","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xiaowei Ren","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Jingping Niu","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Bin Luo","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Kai zhang","author_inst":"The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Tao Jiang","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Philippe Joubert","author_inst":"Laval University, Quebec"},{"author_name":"Alan C Lunt","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Willem hendrik Ouwehand","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"David J Roberts","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Wim Timens","author_inst":"University of Groningen"},{"author_name":"Maarten van den Berge","author_inst":"University of Groningen"},{"author_name":"Nicholas A Watkins","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Alexis Battle","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Adam S Butterworth","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"John Danesh","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Barbara E Engelhard","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"James E Peters","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Don Sin","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Stephen Burgess","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"occupational and environmental health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.05.026633","rel_title":"ACE 2 Coding Variants: A Potential X-linked Risk Factor for COVID-19 Disease","rel_date":"2020-04-14","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.05.026633","rel_abs":"Viral genetic variants are widely known to influence disease progression among infected humans. Given the recent and rapid emergence of pandemic SARS-CoV-2 infection, the cause of COVID-19 disease, viral protein variants have attracted research interest. However, little has yet been written about genetic risk factors among human hosts. Human genetic variation has proven to affect disease progression and outcome for important diseases such as HIV infection and malaria infestation. The fact that the human ACE2 protein is encoded on the X chromosome means that males who carry rare ACE2 coding variants will express those variants in all ACE2-expressing cells, whereas females will typically express those variants in a mosaic distribution determined by early X-inactivation events. This sex-based difference in ACE2 expression has unique implications for epidemiological studies designed to assess host genetic factors influencing progression from asymptomatic SARS-coV-2 infection to COVID-19. Here we present theoretical modelling of rare ACE2 coding variants documented to occur naturally in several human superpopulations and subpopulations, and show that rare variants predicted to affect the binding of ACE2 to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein exist in people. Though the rs4646116 (p.Lys26Arg) allele is found in 1 in 70 Ashkenazi Jewish males, and in 1 in 172 non-Finnish European males, this allele is found at higher frequencies in females. Furthermore, the class of missense ACE2 alleles predicted to affect SARS-CoV-2 binding are found in aggregate among 1.43% and 2.16% of Ashkenazi males and females, respectively, as well as in 0.58% and 1.24% of European males and females outside of Finland. These alleles are rarer in other population groups, and almost absent from East Asians genotyped to date.\n\nThough we are aware that full genome-wide and exome-wide sequencing studies may ultimately be required to assess human genetic susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 fully, we argue on the basis of strong prior probabilities that genotyping of this class of alleles is justified in cases of atypical SARS-CoV-2 diseases, such as asymptomatic super-spreaders (if any are identified), and in neonatal\/paediatric-onset COVID-19 disease. Even relatively rare susceptibility factors (1% or fewer carriers) may become quantitatively important in the context of hundreds of thousands of infections. A small number of asymptomatic carriers, or a small number of super-spreaders, or a small segment of the population that is disproportionately likely to require intensive care, can magnify the medical, social and economic impacts of a pandemic of this size. The speed of the pandemic and the large number of affected cases worldwide justify efforts to identify all possible risk factors for adverse outcomes, including efforts to identify genetic susceptibility factors in human hosts.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"William T Gibson","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Daniel M Evans","author_inst":"Centre for Applied Neurogenetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada"},{"author_name":"Shihua Fu","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xiaocheng Xu","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Lanyu Li","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yueling Ma","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Ji Zhou","author_inst":"Shanghai Meteorological Bureau"},{"author_name":"Jinxi Yao","author_inst":"Gansu Provincial Centre for Diseases Prevention and Control"},{"author_name":"Xingrong Liu","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xiuxia Zhang","author_inst":"Lanzhou University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Xiaotao He","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Jun Yan","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yanjun Shi","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xiaowei Ren","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Jingping Niu","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Bin Luo","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Kai zhang","author_inst":"The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Tao Jiang","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Philippe Joubert","author_inst":"Laval University, Quebec"},{"author_name":"Alan C Lunt","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Willem hendrik Ouwehand","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"David J Roberts","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Wim Timens","author_inst":"University of Groningen"},{"author_name":"Maarten van den Berge","author_inst":"University of Groningen"},{"author_name":"Nicholas A Watkins","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Alexis Battle","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Adam S Butterworth","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"John Danesh","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Barbara E Engelhard","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"James E Peters","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Don Sin","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Stephen Burgess","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.09.20059857","rel_title":"Implementation of a Novel Remote Physician SBRT Coverage Process during the Coronavirus Pandemic","rel_date":"2020-04-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.09.20059857","rel_abs":"INTRODUCTION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, alternative methods of care are needed to reduce the relative risk of transmission in departments. Also needed is the ability to provide vital radiation oncological care if radiation oncologists (RO) are reallocated to other departments. We implemented a novel remote RO SBRT coverage practice, requiring it to be reliable, of high audio and visual quality, timely, and the same level of specialty care as our current in-person treatment coverage practice. METHODS: All observed failure modes were recorded during implementation over the first 15 sequential fractions. The time from CBCT to treatment was calculated before and after implementation to determine timeliness of remote coverage. Image quality metrics were calculated between the imaging console screen and the RO's shared screen. Comfort levels with audio\/visual communication as well as overall comfort in comparison to in-person RO coverage was evaluated using Likert scale surveys after treatment. RESULTS: Remote RO SBRT coverage was successfully implemented in 14\/15 fractions with 3 observed process failures that were all corrected before treatment. Average times of pre-treatment coverage before and after implementation were 8.74 and 8.51min, respectively. The cross correlation between the imaging console screen and RO's shared screen was r=0.96 and lag was 0.05s. The average value for all survey questions was above 4.5, approaching in-person RO coverage comfort levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel method of remote RO SBRT coverage permits reduced personnel and patient interactions surrounding RT procedures. This may help to reduce transmission of COVID-19 in our department and provides a means for SBRT coverage if ROs are reallocated to other areas of the hospital for COVID-19 support.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alex T Price","author_inst":"Washington University in St Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lauren E Henke","author_inst":"Washington University in St Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Borna Maraghechi","author_inst":"Washington University in St Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Taeho Kim","author_inst":"Washington University in St Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Matthew B Spraker","author_inst":"Washington University in St Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Geoffrey D Hugo","author_inst":"Washington University in St Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Clifford G Robinson","author_inst":"Washington University in St Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nels C Knutson","author_inst":"Washington University in St Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xingrong Liu","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xiuxia Zhang","author_inst":"Lanzhou University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Xiaotao He","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Jun Yan","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yanjun Shi","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xiaowei Ren","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Jingping Niu","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Bin Luo","author_inst":"Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Kai zhang","author_inst":"The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston"},{"author_name":"Tao Jiang","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Philippe Joubert","author_inst":"Laval University, Quebec"},{"author_name":"Alan C Lunt","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Willem hendrik Ouwehand","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"David J Roberts","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Wim Timens","author_inst":"University of Groningen"},{"author_name":"Maarten van den Berge","author_inst":"University of Groningen"},{"author_name":"Nicholas A Watkins","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Alexis Battle","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Adam S Butterworth","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"John Danesh","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Barbara E Engelhard","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"James E Peters","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Don Sin","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Stephen Burgess","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"oncology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.06.027698","rel_title":"Genetic variability in the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry factors across populations","rel_date":"2020-04-14","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.06.027698","rel_abs":"The entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells is dependent upon angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which serves as a functional attachment receptor for the viral spike glycoprotein, and the serine protease TMPRSS2 which allows fusion of the viral and host cell membranes.

The number of sick individuals would fall below 1,000 at the beginning of July. When restrictions are lifted completely on April 20, the number of sick should rise quickly again from around April 27. A balance between economic and individual costs of RSC and public health objectives consists in lifting RSC for activities that have high economic benefits but low health costs.

To advance the speed of drug discovery and development, we investigated the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro by natural products derived from Chinese traditional medicines. Baicalin and baicalein were identified as the first non-covalent, non-peptidomimetic inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and exhibited potent antiviral activities in a cell-based system. Remarkably, the binding mode of baicalein with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro determined by X-ray protein crystallography is distinctly different from those of known inhibitors. Baicalein is perfectly ensconced in the core of the substrate-binding pocket by interacting with two catalytic residues, the crucial S1\/S2 subsites and the oxyanion loop, acting as a \"shield\" in front of the catalytic dyad to prevent the peptide substrate approaching the active site. The simple chemical structure, unique mode of action, and potent antiviral activities in vitro, coupled with the favorable safety data from clinical trials, emphasize that baicalein provides a great opportunity for the development of critically needed anti-coronaviral drugs.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Haixia Su","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica"},{"author_name":"Sheng Yao","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica"},{"author_name":"Wenfeng Zhao","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica"},{"author_name":"Minjun Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Shanghai Advanced Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201210, China."},{"author_name":"Jia Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Weijuan Shang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 430071 Wuhan, China."},{"author_name":"Hang Xie","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Changqiang Ke","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Meina Gao","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Kunqian Yu","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Hong Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China"},{"author_name":"Jingshan Shen","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Wei Tang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Leike Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jianping Zuo","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Hualiang Jiang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Fang Bai","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai 201210, China."},{"author_name":"Yan Wu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 430071 Wuhan, China."},{"author_name":"Yang Ye","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Yechun Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Willem hendrik Ouwehand","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"David J Roberts","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Wim Timens","author_inst":"University of Groningen"},{"author_name":"Maarten van den Berge","author_inst":"University of Groningen"},{"author_name":"Nicholas A Watkins","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Alexis Battle","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Adam S Butterworth","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"John Danesh","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Barbara E Engelhard","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"James E Peters","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Don Sin","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Stephen Burgess","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"molecular biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.09.20059154","rel_title":"COVID-19 pandemic in the African continent: forecasts of cumulative cases, new infections, and mortality","rel_date":"2020-04-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.09.20059154","rel_abs":"Background: The epidemiology of COVID-19 remains speculative in Africa.

Results: By June 30 2020, around 16.3 million people in Africa will contract COVID-19 (95% CI 718,403 to 98,358,799). Northern and Eastern Africa will be the most and least affected areas. Cumulative cases by June 30 are expected to reach around 2.9 million (95% CI 465,028 to 18,286,358) in Southern Africa, 2.8 million (95% CI 517,489 to 15,056,314) in Western Africa, and 1.2 million (95% CI 229,111 to 6,138,692) in Central Africa. Incidence for the month of April 2020 is expected to be highest in Djibouti, 32.8 per 1000 (95% CI 6.25 to 171.77), while Morocco will experience among the highest fatalities (1,045 deaths, 95% CI 167 to 6,547). Conclusion: Less urbanized countries with low levels of socio-economic development (hence least connected to the world) are likely to register lower and slower transmissions at the early stages of an epidemic. However, the same enabling factors that worked for their benefit can hinder interventions that have lessened the impact of COVID- 19 elsewhere.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tom Achoki","author_inst":"School of Health Systems and Public Health, University of Pretoria, South Africa"},{"author_name":"Uzma Alam","author_inst":"Africa Institute for Health Policy Foundation, Kenya"},{"author_name":"Lawrence Were","author_inst":"Department of Health Sciences & Department of Global Health, Boston University, Boston, MA."},{"author_name":"Tesfaye Gebremedhin","author_inst":"Department of Economics, Faculty of Business, Government and Law, University of Canberra."},{"author_name":"Flavia Senkubuge","author_inst":"School of Health Systems and Public Health, University of Pretoria, South Africa"},{"author_name":"Abaleng Lesego","author_inst":"Kudu Communications - Health Services"},{"author_name":"Shuangzhe Liu","author_inst":"Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Canberra"},{"author_name":"Richard Wamai","author_inst":"Department of Cultures, Societies and Global Studies, and Integrated Initiative for Global Health, Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Yohannes Kinfu","author_inst":"Faculty of Health, University of Canberra, Australia"},{"author_name":"Kunqian Yu","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Hong Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China"},{"author_name":"Jingshan Shen","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Wei Tang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Leike Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jianping Zuo","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Hualiang Jiang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Fang Bai","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai 201210, China."},{"author_name":"Yan Wu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 430071 Wuhan, China."},{"author_name":"Yang Ye","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Yechun Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Willem hendrik Ouwehand","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"David J Roberts","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Wim Timens","author_inst":"University of Groningen"},{"author_name":"Maarten van den Berge","author_inst":"University of Groningen"},{"author_name":"Nicholas A Watkins","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Alexis Battle","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Adam S Butterworth","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"John Danesh","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Barbara E Engelhard","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"James E Peters","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Don Sin","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Stephen Burgess","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.12.038216","rel_title":"Detection of spreader nodes and ranking of interacting edges in Human-SARS-CoV protein interaction network","rel_date":"2020-04-14","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.12.038216","rel_abs":"The entire world has recently witnessed the commencement of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic. It is caused by a novel coronavirus (n-CoV) generally distinguished as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It has exploited human vulnerabilities to coronavirus outbreak. SARS-CoV-2 promotes fatal chronic respiratory disease followed by multiple organ failure which ultimately puts an end to human life. No proven vaccine for n-CoV is available till date in spite of significant research efforts worldwide. International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) has reached to a consensus that the virus SARS-CoV-2 is highly genetically similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak of 2003. It has been reported that SARS-CoV has [~]89% genetic similarities with n-CoV. With this hypothesis, the current work focuses on the identification of spreader nodes in SARS-CoV protein interaction network. Various network characteristics like edge ratio, neighborhood density and node weight have been explored for defining a new feature spreadability index by virtue of which spreader nodes and edges are identified. The selected top spreader nodes having high spreadability index have been also validated by Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) disease model. Initially, the proposed method is applied on a synthetic protein interaction network followed by SARS-CoV-human protein interaction network. Hence, key spreader nodes and edges (ranked edges) are unmasked in SARS-CoV proteins and its connected level 1 and level 2 human proteins. The new network attribute spreadability index along with generated SIS values of selected top spreader nodes when compared with the other network centrality based methodologies like Degree centrality (DC), Closeness centrality (CC), Local average centrality (LAC) and Betweeness centrality (BC) is found to perform relatively better than the existing-state-of-art.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sovan Saha","author_inst":"Dr. Sudhir Chandra Sur Degree Engineering College"},{"author_name":"Piyali Chatterjee","author_inst":"Netaji Subhash Engineering College"},{"author_name":"Subhadip Basu","author_inst":"Jadavpur University"},{"author_name":"Mita Nasipuri","author_inst":"Jadavpur University"},{"author_name":"Flavia Senkubuge","author_inst":"School of Health Systems and Public Health, University of Pretoria, South Africa"},{"author_name":"Abaleng Lesego","author_inst":"Kudu Communications - Health Services"},{"author_name":"Shuangzhe Liu","author_inst":"Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Canberra"},{"author_name":"Richard Wamai","author_inst":"Department of Cultures, Societies and Global Studies, and Integrated Initiative for Global Health, Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Yohannes Kinfu","author_inst":"Faculty of Health, University of Canberra, Australia"},{"author_name":"Kunqian Yu","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Hong Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China"},{"author_name":"Jingshan Shen","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Wei Tang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Leike Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jianping Zuo","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Hualiang Jiang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Fang Bai","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai 201210, China."},{"author_name":"Yan Wu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 430071 Wuhan, China."},{"author_name":"Yang Ye","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Yechun Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Willem hendrik Ouwehand","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"David J Roberts","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Wim Timens","author_inst":"University of Groningen"},{"author_name":"Maarten van den Berge","author_inst":"University of Groningen"},{"author_name":"Nicholas A Watkins","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Alexis Battle","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Adam S Butterworth","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"John Danesh","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Barbara E Engelhard","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"James E Peters","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Don Sin","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Stephen Burgess","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.09.20058651","rel_title":"Scaling diagnostics in times of COVID-19: Rapid prototyping of 3D-printed water circulators for Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) and detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus","rel_date":"2020-04-14","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.09.20058651","rel_abs":"By the third week of June 2020, more than 8,500,000 positive cases of COVID-19 and more than 450,000 deaths had been officially reported worldwide.

Here, we demonstrate the combined use of a three-dimensional (3D)-printed incubation chamber for commercial Eppendorf PCR tubes, and a colorimetric embodiment of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) reaction scheme for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids. We used this strategy to detect and amplify SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences using a set of in-house designed initiators that target regions encoding the N protein. We were able to detect and amplify SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids in the range of 62 to 200000 DNA copies by this straightforward method. Using synthetic SARS-CoV-2 samples and a limited number of RNA extracts from patients, we also demonstrate that colorimetric LAMP is a quantitative method comparable in diagnostic performance to RT-qPCR. We envision that LAMP may greatly enhance the capabilities for COVID-19 testing in situations where RT-qPCR is not feasible or is unavailable. Moreover, the portability, ease of use, and reproducibility of this strategy make it a reliable alternative for deployment of point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 detection efforts during the pandemics.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Everardo Gonzalez-Gonzalez","author_inst":"Tecnologico de Monterrey"},{"author_name":"Itzel Montserrat Lara-Mayorga","author_inst":"Tecnologico de Monterrey"},{"author_name":"Iram Pablo Rodriguez-Sanchez","author_inst":"Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon"},{"author_name":"Felipe Yee-de Leon","author_inst":"Delee, Corp."},{"author_name":"Andres Garcia-Rubio","author_inst":"Tecnologico de Monterrey"},{"author_name":"Carlos Ezio Garciamendez-Mijares","author_inst":"Division of Engineering in Medicine, Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Gilberto Emilio Guerra-Alvarez","author_inst":"Tecnologico de Monterrey"},{"author_name":"German Garcia-Martinez","author_inst":"Division of Engineering in Medicine, Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Juan Andres Aguayo-Hernandez","author_inst":"Tecnologico de Monterrey"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Marquez-Garcia","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias Ismael Cosio Villegas"},{"author_name":"Yu-Shrike Zhang","author_inst":"Division of Engineering in Medicine, Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Sergio Omar Martinez-Chapa","author_inst":"Tecnologico de Monterrey"},{"author_name":"Joaquin Zu\u00f1iga","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias Ismael Cosio Villegas"},{"author_name":"Grissel Trujillo-de Santiago","author_inst":"Tecnologico de Monterrey"},{"author_name":"Mario Moises Alvarez","author_inst":"Tecnologico de Monterrey"},{"author_name":"Hualiang Jiang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Fang Bai","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai 201210, China."},{"author_name":"Yan Wu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 430071 Wuhan, China."},{"author_name":"Yang Ye","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Yechun Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Willem hendrik Ouwehand","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"David J Roberts","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Wim Timens","author_inst":"University of Groningen"},{"author_name":"Maarten van den Berge","author_inst":"University of Groningen"},{"author_name":"Nicholas A Watkins","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Alexis Battle","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Adam S Butterworth","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"John Danesh","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Barbara E Engelhard","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"James E Peters","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Don Sin","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Stephen Burgess","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.13.039198","rel_title":"Identification of potential vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2, A step forward to fight novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV: A Reverse Vaccinology Approach","rel_date":"2020-04-14","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.13.039198","rel_abs":"The recent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes an immense health crisis to global public health.

Presently, there is no vaccine available against this emerged viral disease.

In the current study, we collected SARS-CoV-2 genome from Indian geographical origin against human host, further more using reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics tools here we claim effective vaccine candidates that can be mile stone in battle against COVID19. This novel study divulged two promising antigenic peptide GVYFASTEK and NFRVQPTESIV from surface glycoproteins (protein accession no. - QIA98583.1 and QHS34546.1) of SARS-CoV-2, which were predicated to be interacted with class I and class II MHC alleles and showed up to 90% conservancy and high value of antigenicity. Subsequently, the molecular docking studies were verified molecular interaction of these prime antigenic peptides with the residues of HLA-A*11-01 allele for MHC Class I and HLA DRB1*04-01 allele for MHC class II. After vigorous analysis, these peptides were predicted to be suitable epitopes which are capable to elicit the strong cell-mediated immune response against the SARS-CoV-2. Consequences from the present study could facilitate selecting SARS-CoV-2 epitopes for vaccine production pipelines in the immediate future. This novel research will certainly pave the way for a fast, reliable and virtuous platform to provide timely countermeasure of this dangerous pandemic disease, COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ekta Gupta","author_inst":"Dr. B.

The proposed scheme builds on the assumption that samples from the population may not be independent of each other. Our simulation results show that the proposed sampling strategy can significantly increase testing capacity under resource constraints: on average, a saving of ~40% tests can be expected assuming a positive test probability of 10% across the given samples.

Several studies predicted that high temperature and humidity could reduce COVID-19 transmission. However, exceptions exist to this observation, further thorough examinations are thus needed for their confirmation. In this study, therefore, we used a global dataset of COVID-19 cases and global climate databases and comprehensively investigated how climate parameters could contribute to the growth rate of COVID-19 cases while statistically controlling for potential confounding effects using spatial analysis. We also confirmed that the growth rate decreased with the temperature; however, the growth rate was affected by precipitation seasonality and warming velocity rather than temperature. In particular, a lower growth rate was observed for a higher precipitation seasonality and lower warming velocity. These effects were independent of population density, human life quality, and travel restrictions. The results indicate that the temperature effect is less important compared to these intrinsic climate characteristics, which might thus be useful for explaining the exceptions. However, the contributions of the climate parameters to the growth rate were moderate; rather, the contribution of travel restrictions in each country was more significant. Although our findings are preliminary owing to data-analysis limitations, they may be helpful when predicting COVID-19 transmission.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Katsumi Chiyomaru","author_inst":"Kyushu Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Kazuhiro Takemoto","author_inst":"Kyushu Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Lawrence Young","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Imran Amin","author_inst":"National Institute ofBiotechnology and Genetic Engineering, Pakistan."},{"author_name":"David Snead","author_inst":"Institute of Precision Diagnostics and Translational Medicine, Department of Pathology, University Hospitals Coventry & Warwickshire, Coventry, UK."},{"author_name":"Neil Anderson","author_inst":"Institute of Precision Diagnostics and Translational Medicine, Department of Pathology, University Hospitals Coventry & Warwickshire, Coventry, UK."},{"author_name":"Asa Ben-Hur","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science, Colorado State University, USA."},{"author_name":"Nasir Rajpoot","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK"},{"author_name":"Juan Andres Aguayo-Hernandez","author_inst":"Tecnologico de Monterrey"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Marquez-Garcia","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias Ismael Cosio Villegas"},{"author_name":"Yu-Shrike Zhang","author_inst":"Division of Engineering in Medicine, Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Sergio Omar Martinez-Chapa","author_inst":"Tecnologico de Monterrey"},{"author_name":"Joaquin Zu\u00f1iga","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias Ismael Cosio Villegas"},{"author_name":"Grissel Trujillo-de Santiago","author_inst":"Tecnologico de Monterrey"},{"author_name":"Mario Moises Alvarez","author_inst":"Tecnologico de Monterrey"},{"author_name":"Hualiang Jiang","author_inst":"CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Fang Bai","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies and School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai 201210, China."},{"author_name":"Yan Wu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 430071 Wuhan, China."},{"author_name":"Yang Ye","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China."},{"author_name":"Yechun Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Willem hendrik Ouwehand","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"David J Roberts","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Wim Timens","author_inst":"University of Groningen"},{"author_name":"Maarten van den Berge","author_inst":"University of Groningen"},{"author_name":"Nicholas A Watkins","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Alexis Battle","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Adam S Butterworth","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"John Danesh","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Barbara E Engelhard","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"James E Peters","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Don Sin","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Stephen Burgess","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.12.038554","rel_title":"The origin and underlying driving forces of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak","rel_date":"2020-04-14","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.12.038554","rel_abs":"The spread of SARS-CoV-2 since December 2019 has become a pandemic and impacted many aspects of human society. Here, we analyzed genetic variation of SARS-CoV-2 and its related coronavirus and found the evidence of intergenomic recombination. After correction for mutational bias, analysis of 137 SARS-CoV-2 genomes as of 2\/23\/2020 revealed the excess of low frequency mutations on both synonymous and nonsynonymous sites which is consistent with recent origin of the virus. In contrast to adaptive evolution previously reported for SARS-CoV in its brief epidemic in 2003, our analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes shows signs of relaxation of selection. The sequence similarity of the spike receptor binding domain between SARS-CoV-2 and a sequence from pangolin is probably due to an ancient intergenomic introgression. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 might have cryptically circulated within humans for years before being recently noticed. Data from the early outbreak and hospital archives are needed to trace its evolutionary path and reveal critical steps required for effective spreading. Two mutations, 84S in orf8 protein and 251V in orf3 protein, occurred coincidentally with human intervention. The 84S first appeared on 1\/5\/2020 and reached a plateau around 1\/23\/2020, the lockdown of Wuhan. 251V emerged on 1\/21\/2020 and rapidly increased its frequency. Thus, the roles of these mutations on infectivity need to be elucidated. Genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 collected from China was two time higher than those derived from the rest of the world. In addition, in network analysis, haplotypes collected from Wuhan city were at interior and have more mutational connections, both of which are consistent with the observation that the outbreak of cov-19 was originated from China.\n\nSUMMARYIn contrast to adaptive evolution previously reported for SARS-CoV in its brief epidemic, our analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes shows signs of relaxation of selection.

Here, we present a large-scale snATAC-seq dataset (90,980 nuclei) of the human lung, generated in parallel with snRNA-seq (46,500 nuclei), from healthy donors of ~30 weeks, ~3 years and ~30 years of age. Focusing on genes implicated in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, we observed an increase in the proportion of alveolar epithelial cells expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in adult compared to young lungs. Consistent with expression dynamics, 10 chromatin peaks linked to TMPRSS2 exhibited significantly increased activity with age and harbored IRF and STAT binding sites. Furthermore, we identified 14 common sequence variants in age-increasing peaks with predicted regulatory function, including several associated with respiratory traits and TMPRSS2 expression. Our findings reveal a plausible contributor to why children are more resistant to COVID-19 and provide an epigenomic basis for transferring this resistance to older populations.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Allen Wang","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Joshua A Chiou","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Olivier B Poirion","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Justin Buchanan","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Michael J Valdez","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Jamie M Verheyden","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Xiaomeng Hou","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Jacklyn M Newsome","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Parul Kudtarkar","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Dina A Faddah","author_inst":"Vertex Phamaceuticals"},{"author_name":"Kai Zhang","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Randee E Young","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Justinn Barr","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Ravi Misra","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Heidie Huyck","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Lisa Rogers","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Cory Poole","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Gloria Pryhuber","author_inst":"University of Rochester Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Kyle J Gaulton","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Preissl","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"Xin Sun","author_inst":"University of California San Diego"},{"author_name":"- NHLBI LungMap Consortium","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Wim Timens","author_inst":"University of Groningen"},{"author_name":"Maarten van den Berge","author_inst":"University of Groningen"},{"author_name":"Nicholas A Watkins","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Alexis Battle","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Adam S Butterworth","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"John Danesh","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Barbara E Engelhard","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"James E Peters","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Don Sin","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Stephen Burgess","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"genomics"}]}
