The incidence of AKI in patients with COIVID-19 in the largest inpatient series in the United States is 22.2%3. Development of AKI requiring kidney replacement therapy in hospitalized patients is a bad prognostic sign. Out of Fifty patients admitted to our hospital with COVID-19 13\/50(26%) developed AKI. All patients required hospitalization in intensive care unit care and 12\/13 required initiation of kidney replacement therapy. The median age was 41 years (31-85 years) and 50% were men. Common comorbidities were obesity (83%), diabetes (42%), and hypertension (25%). 10\/12 (83%) patients were hypoxemic and required oxygen therapy. 11\/12 (92%) patients required invasive ventilation. Majority of patients had elevated neutrophils counts (81.8%) and low lymphocyte counts (81.8%). All patients had chest x-ray findings suggestive of pneumonia. 11\/12(91.6%) developed septic shock requiring vasopressors. Review of UA showed all patient (9\/9) had active urine sediments with blood but 7\/9 of them have sterile pyuria. At the end of study period, 1 patient remained hospitalized. 10\/11(90%) patients died and one patient was discharged home with resolution of AKI. Median length of stay was 13 days. The exact mechanism of AKI is not well understood in COVID-19 but can be due to acute tubular necrosis due to septic shock because of cytokine storm in severe COVID-19 or direct invasion by SARS-CoV-2 on podocytes and proximal renal tubular cells. Our findings suggest poor prognosis despite continuous kidney replacement therapies in patients who develop AKI with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rahul Shekhar","author_inst":"UNM"},{"author_name":"Shubhra Upadhyaya","author_inst":"UNM"},{"author_name":"Silvi Shah","author_inst":"university of cincinati"},{"author_name":"Devika Kapuria","author_inst":"UNM"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"nephrology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.09.20096412","rel_title":"The Early Food Insecurity Impacts of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-05-13","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.09.20096412","rel_abs":"Background COVID-19 has disrupted food access and impacted food insecurity, which is associated with numerous adverse individual and public health outcomes. Methods We conducted a statewide population-level survey in Vermont from March 29-April 12, 2020, during the beginning of a statewide stay-at-home order. We utilized the USDA six-item validated food security module to measure food insecurity before COVID-19 and since COVID-19. We assessed food insecurity prevalence and reported food access challenges, coping strategies, and perceived helpful interventions among food secure, consistently food insecure (pre-and post COVID-19), and newly food insecure (post COVID-19) respondents. Results Among 3,219 respondents, there was a 33% increase in household food insecurity since COVID-19 (p<0.001), with 35.6% of food insecure households classified as newly food insecure. Respondents experiencing a job loss were more likely to experience food insecurity (OR 3.43; 95% CI, 2.45-4.80). Multiple physical and economic barriers, as well as concerns related to food access during COVID-19, are reported, with respondents experiencing household food insecurity more likely to face access challenges (p<0.001). Significant differences in coping strategies were documented between respondents in newly food insecure vs. consistently insecure households. Conclusions Since the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a significant increase in food insecurity in Vermont, accompanied by major food access barriers. These findings have important potential impacts on individual health, including mental health and malnutrition, as well as on future healthcare costs. We suggest proactive strategies to address food insecurity during this crisis.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Meredith T.

This paper sheds light on the position of Bangladesh in relation to its South Asian neighbors India and Pakistan with respect to testing capacity and ability to detect cases with increased testing. It also analyzes recent data on case counts and testing numbers in Bangladesh, to provide an idea regarding the number of extra tests needed to detect a substantial number of cases within a short period of time. Findings indicate that compared to India and Pakistan, Bangladesh was able to detect more cases by increasing testing levels and expand its testing capacity by performing more per capita tests. In spite of these achievements, the rate of reported cases per 100 tests was consistently higher for Bangladesh compared to India, which suggests that in addition to increased testing, other factors, such as, effective enforcement of social distancing and efficient contact tracing are just as important in curbing the spread of the disease. The analysis reveals that current testing levels in Bangladesh are not adequate. Based on the findings, we recommend a 30-50\\% growth of the current test rate in the next few days so that by detecting and isolating more cases, Bangladesh could, in effect, contain the spread of new infections. The challenge, however, is to mobilize resources necessary to expand geographical coverage and improve testing quality while enforcing social distancing and performing efficient contact tracing.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hasinur Rahaman Khan","author_inst":"Applied Statistics, ISRT, University of Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Tamanna Howlader","author_inst":"Applied Statistics, ISRT, University of Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Kevin A.

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of pre-existing morbidities among COVID-19 infected patients and their mortality risks against each type of pre-existing morbidity category. Methods: To conduct this systematic review and meta-analysis, Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and CINAHL databases were searched using specified relavent keywords. Further searches were conducted using the reference list of the selected studies, renowned pre-print servers (e.g., medRxiv, bioRixv, SSRN), and relevant journal websites. Studies written in the English language included if those were conducted among COVID-19 patients with and without comorbidities and presented survivor vs. non-survivor counts or hazard\/odds of deaths or survivors against types of pre-existing morbidities. Comorbidities reported in the selected studies were grouped into eight categories. The pooled likelihoods of deaths in each category were estimated using a fixed or random-effect model, based on the heterogeneity assessment. Publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of the funnel plot asymmetry and Eggers regression test. Trim and Fill method was used if there any publication bias was found. Results: A total of 42 studies included in this study comprised of 39,398 samples. The most common pre-existing morbidities in COVID-19 infected patients were hypertension (36.5%), cardiovascular disease (11.9%), and diabetes (22.0%). The higher likelihood of deaths was found among COVID-19 patients who had pre-existing cardiovascular diseases (OR: 3.32, 95% CI: 2.79-3.95), immune and metabolic disorders (OR: 2.39, 95% CI: 2.00-2.85), respiratory diseases (OR: 2.02, 95% CI: 1.80-2.26), cerebrovascular diseases (OR: 4.12, 95% CI: 3.04-5.58), any types of cancers (OR: 2.22, 95% CI: 1.63-3.03), renal (OR: 3.02, 95% CI: 2.60-3.52), and liver diseases (OR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.21-1.71). Conclusions: This study provides evidence of a higher likelihood of deaths among COVID-19 patients against morbidity categories. These findings could potentially help healthcare providers to sort out the most endangered COVID-19 patients by comorbidities, take precautionary measures during hospitalization, assess susceptibility to death, and prioritize their treatment, which could potentially reduce the number of fatalities in COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mostaured Khan","author_inst":"University of Rajshahi"},{"author_name":"Md Nuruzzaman Khan","author_inst":"Jatiya Kabi Kazi Nazrul Islam University"},{"author_name":"Md.

We evaluated a modified coating that demonstrated a residual efficacy against viruses. The coated surfaces were found to be effective against human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E, reducing the concentration of these viruses by greater than 90% in 10 minutes and by greater than 99.9% after two hours of contact.

Interestingly, the impact of such major intervention measures seems to be the same in most of these countries. The model has also provided realistic estimates of the total number of infections, active cases and future outcome. While the predictive capabilities of the model are much more uncertain before the peak of the outbreak, we could still reliably predict the evolution of the disease after a major intervention by assuming the afterwards reproduction number from current study.

We assessed how the type and timing of public- health interventions impacted the course of the outbreak in Alberta and other Canadian provinces. Methods: We used publicly-available data to summarize rates of laboratory data and mortality in relation to measures implemented to contain the outbreak and testing strategy. We estimated the transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 before the state of emergency declaration for each province (R0) and at the study end date (Rt). Results: The first cases were confirmed in Ontario (January 25) and British Columbia (January 28). All provinces implemented the same health-policy measures between March 12 and March 30. Alberta had a higher percentage of the population tested (3.8%) and a lower mortality rate (3\/100,000) than Ontario (2.6%; 11\/100,000) or Quebec (3.1%; 31\/100,000). British Columbia tested fewer people (1.7%) and had similar mortality as Alberta. Data on provincial testing strategies were insufficient to inform further analyses. Mortality rates increased with increasing rates of lab- confirmed cases in Ontario and Quebec, but not in Alberta. R0 was similar across all provinces, but varied widely from 2.6 (95% confidence intervals 1.9-3.4) to 6.4 (4.3-8.5), depending on the assumed time interval between onset of symptoms in a primary and a secondary case (serial interval). The outbreak is currently under control in Alberta, British Columbia and Nova Scotia (Rt <1). Interpretation: COVID-19-related health outcomes varied by province despite rapid implementation of similar health-policy interventions across Canada. Insufficient information about provincial testing strategies and a lack of primary data on serial interval are major limitations of existing data on the Canadian COVID-19 outbreak.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohamed Mahsin","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Seungwon Lee","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"David Vickers","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Alexis Guigue","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Tyler Williamson","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Hude Quan","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Robert Ross Quinn","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Pietro Ravani","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Philip J.

Since the COVID-19 outbreak, no study has yet estimated the effect of this pandemic on university students in the UAE or its impact on the psychological well-being of medical students. Methods: In this study, we surveyed 1485 medical (comprising medical and dental) and non-medical university students across 4 emirates within the UAE. We used an online platform to assess knowledge, sources of information, changes in hygienic behavior, perceptions of fear and worry and anxiety levels using the generalized anxiety disorder 7 (GAD-7) scale. The GAD-7 score was measured at three time points; during hospital visits for medical\/dental students, before the introduction of online learning and after online learning for all students. Results: The majority of students demonstrated high levels of knowledge and utilized reliable sources of information. Non-medical students exercised higher compliance with social restrictions, while medical students practiced better hand hygiene. Almost half of students reported anxiety levels ranging from mild to severe with females reporting higher anxiety scores during hospital visits (OR=2.02, 95% CI,1.41 to 2.91) and medical students reporting lower anxiety levels in comparison to dental students (OR=0.61, 95% CI,0.45 to 0.84). Medical students reported higher levels of anxiety during their clinical rotations which decreased with the introduction of online learning, yet, non-medical student's anxiety levels increased with online learning. Conclusions: This is the first study to provide important information on the initial response and anxiety levels in university students across the UAE during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings from our study can be used to support the development of effective screening strategies and interventions to build psychological resilience among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic or any other public health emergencies in the future.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Basema Saddik","author_inst":"The University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Amal Hussein","author_inst":"The University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Fatemeh Saheb Sharif-Askari","author_inst":"The University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Waad Kheder","author_inst":"The University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Mohamad-Hani Temsah","author_inst":"King Saud University"},{"author_name":"Rim Adnan Koutaich","author_inst":"The University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Enad Sami Haddad","author_inst":"The University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Nora Marwan Al-Roub","author_inst":"The University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Fatema Adel Marhoon","author_inst":"The University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Qutayba Hamid","author_inst":"The University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Rabih Halwani","author_inst":"The University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Joseph L.

Little is known about the impact of unhealthy lifestyles including smoking, physical inactivity, obesity, and excessive alcohol intake. We conducted the first large scale general population study on lifestyle risk factors for COVID19. Methods: Prospective cohort study with national registry linkage to hospitalisation for COVID19. Participants were 387,109 men and women (56.4, SD 8.8 yr; 55.1% women) residing in England from UK Biobank study. Physical activity, smoking, and alcohol intake, were assessed by questionnaire at baseline (2006 to 2010). Body mass index, from measured height and weight, was used as an indicator of overall obesity. Outcome was cases of COVID19 serious enough to warrant a hospital admission from 16 March 2020 to 26 April 2020. Results: There were 760 COVID19 cases. After adjustment for age, sex and mutually for each lifestyle factor, physical inactivity (Relative risk, 1.32, 95% confidence interval, 1.10, 1.58), smoking (1.42;1.12, 1.79) and obesity (2.05 ;1.68, 2.49) but not heavy alcohol consumption (1.12; 0.93, 1.35) were all related to COVID19. We also found a dose dependent increase in risk of COVID19 with less favourable lifestyle scores, such that participants in the most adverse category had four fold higher risk (4.41; 2.52, 7.71) compared to people with the most optimal lifestyle. This gradient was little affected after adjustment for a wide range of covariates. Based on UK risk factor prevalence estimates, unhealthy behaviours in combination accounted for up to 51% of the population attributable fraction of severe COVID19. Conclusions and Relevance: Our findings suggest that an unhealthy lifestyle synonymous with an elevated risk of non-communicable disease is also a risk factor for COVID19 hospital admission, accounting for up to half of severe cases. Adopting simple lifestyle changes could lower the risk of severe infection.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mark Hamer","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Mika Kivimaki","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Catharine R Gale","author_inst":"University Southampton"},{"author_name":"George David Batty","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Mohamad-Hani Temsah","author_inst":"King Saud University"},{"author_name":"Rim Adnan Koutaich","author_inst":"The University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Enad Sami Haddad","author_inst":"The University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Nora Marwan Al-Roub","author_inst":"The University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Fatema Adel Marhoon","author_inst":"The University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Qutayba Hamid","author_inst":"The University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Rabih Halwani","author_inst":"The University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Joseph L.

We use (a) the stable cumulative infection of various countries and (b) the number of infection versus the tests carried out to evaluate the model. The time-dependent infection rate is set in the model to obtain the best fit with the available data. The model is simulated aiming to project the probable features of the infection in India, various Indian states, and other countries. India imposed an early lockdown to contain the infection that can be treated by its healthcare system. We find that with the current infection rate and containment measures, the total active infection in India would be maximum at the end of June or beginning of July 2020. With proper containment measures in the infected zones and social distancing, the infection is expected to fall considerably from August. If the containment measures are relaxed before the arrival of the peak infection, more people from the susceptible population will fall sick as the infection is expected to see a three-fold rise at the peak. If the relaxation is given a month after the peak infection, a second peak with a moderate infection will follow. However, a gradual relaxation applied well ahead of peak infection, leads to a two-fold increase in the peak infection.

Our model provides a semi-quantitative overview of the progression of COVID-19 in India, with model projections reasonably replicating the current progress.

SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entry into human host cells, and ACE2 levels in target cells may influence SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility. We investigated how pre-existing conditions and drug treatments alter receptor expression in kidney tissue. Using single cell RNA profiling (scRNAseq) to assess ACE2 and associated SARS-CoV-2 proteases in healthy living donors (LD) kidneys, diabetic kidney disease (DKD), and in kidney injury during viral infection, ACE2 expression was primarily associated with proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTEC). ACE2 mRNA expression levels were significantly upregulated in DKD versus LD, however, ACE2 levels were not altered by exposures to renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors. ACE2+ expression signatures were defined by differential expression analysis and characterized by Bayesian integrative analysis of a large compendium of public -omics datasets, resulting in the identification of network modules induced in ACE2 positive PTEC in DKD and BK virus nephropathy. These ACE2 upregulated cell programs were linked to viral entry, immune activation, endomembrane reorganization, and RNA processing and overlapped significantly with the cellular responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Similar cellular programs were activated in ACE2-positive PTEC isolated in a urine sample from a COVID19 patient with acute kidney injury, suggesting a consistent ACE2-coregulated expression program that may interact with SARS-Cov-2 infection processes. The SARS-CoV-2 receptor associated gene signatures could seed further research into therapeutic strategies for COVID-19. Functional networks of gene expression signatures are available for further exploration to researchers at HumanBase (hb.flatironinstitute.org\/covid-kidney).","rel_num_authors":32,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rajasree Menon","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Edgar A Otto","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Rachel Sealfon","author_inst":"Flatiron Institute"},{"author_name":"Viji Nair","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Aaron K Wong","author_inst":"Simons Foundation Flatiron Institute"},{"author_name":"Chandra L Theesfeld","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Xi Chen","author_inst":"Flatiron Institute Center for Computational Biology"},{"author_name":"Yuan Wang","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Avinash Boppanna","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Jinghui Luo","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Yingbao Yang","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Peter M Kasson","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Jennifer A Schaub","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Celine C Berthier","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Sean Eddy","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Chrysta C Lienczewski","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Bradley Godfrey","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Susan L Dagenais","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Ryann Sohaney","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"John Hartman","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Damian Fermin","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Lalita Subramanian","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Helen C Looker","author_inst":"National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease"},{"author_name":"Jennifer L Harder","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Laura H Mariani","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey B Hodgin","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Z Sexton","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Christiane E Wobus","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Abhijit S Naik","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Robert G Nelson","author_inst":"National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"},{"author_name":"Olga G.

Here, we analyze 621 bulk RNA sequencing samples and 7,540 consensus sequences from COVID-19 patients, and identify multiple strains of the virus, SARS-CoV-2, in four major clades that are prevalent within and across hosts. In particular, we find evidence for (i) within-host diversity across phylogenetic clades, (ii) putative cases of recombination, multi-strain and\/or superinfections as well as (iii) distinct strain profiles across geographical locations and time.

Methods: Directors of 55 EDs in Northern Italy received a questionnaire focusing on the impact of pandemic on activity and organization and on the resources available at re-opening. A section was devoted to gather forecasts and proposals on the return path to normality. Results: All centres had reduced their activities of at least 50% of the pre-COVID-19 period. A rate of endoscopists (13.6%), nurses (25.2%), and health assistants (14%) were not available since infected, or relocated to other departments. One third of endoscopic rooms were converted to COVID-19 care. Two third had the waiting or the recovery areas too small for distancing. A dedicated pathway for infected patients could not be guaranteed in 20% of EDs. Only one third of EDs judged realistic to completely restore a pre-crisis workload by the next months. Optimizing appropriateness of procedures, closer interaction with GPs and triaging patients with telemedicine were the proposals to re-open EDs. Conclusions: The critical issues while re-opening EDs calls for reducing the workload in the endoscopy units through appropriate rescheduling of procedures.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gianpiero Manes","author_inst":"ASST Rhodense, Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"alessandro Repici","author_inst":"Humanitas"},{"author_name":"Franco Radaelli","author_inst":"Valduce Hospital"},{"author_name":"Simone Saibeni","author_inst":"ASST Rhodense"},{"author_name":"Cristina Bezzio","author_inst":"ASST Rhodense"},{"author_name":"Matteo Colombo","author_inst":"Humanitas"},{"author_name":"Fabio Pace","author_inst":"Seriate Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuan Wang","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Avinash Boppanna","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Jinghui Luo","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Yingbao Yang","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Peter M Kasson","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Jennifer A Schaub","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Celine C Berthier","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Sean Eddy","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Chrysta C Lienczewski","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Bradley Godfrey","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Susan L Dagenais","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Ryann Sohaney","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"John Hartman","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Damian Fermin","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Lalita Subramanian","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Helen C Looker","author_inst":"National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease"},{"author_name":"Jennifer L Harder","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Laura H Mariani","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey B Hodgin","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Z Sexton","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Christiane E Wobus","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Abhijit S Naik","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Robert G Nelson","author_inst":"National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"},{"author_name":"Olga G.

For RNA isolation we compared four different companies (Qiagen, Invitrogen, BGI and Norgen Biotek). For detection we compared two recently developed Taqman-based modules (BGI and Norgen Biotek), a SYBR green-based approach (NEB Luna Universal One-Step Kit) with published and newly-developed primers, and clinical results (Seegene STARMag RNA extraction system and Allplex 2019-nCoV RT-qPCR assay). Most RNA isolation procedures performed similarly, and while all RT-qPCR modules effectively detected purified viral RNA, the BGI system proved most sensitive, generating comparable results to clinical diagnostic data, and identifying samples ranging from 65 copies - 2.1x105 copies of viral Orf1ab\/l. However, the BGI detection system is [~]4x more expensive than other options tested here. With direct RT-qPCR we found that simply adding RNase inhibitor greatly improved sensitivity, without need for any other treatments (e.g. lysis buffers or boiling). The best direct methods were [~]10 fold less sensitive than indirect methods, but reduce sample handling, as well as assay time and cost.

Following the declaration of the outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) on January 30th, 2020, it has become imperative to develop diagnostic tools to reliably detect the virus in infected patients. Several methods based on real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA have been developed. In addition, these methods have been recommended by the WHO for laboratory diagnosis. Since all these protocols are based on the use of fluorogenic probes and one-step reagents (cDNA synthesis followed by PCR amplification in the same tube), these techniques can be difficult to perform given the limited supply of reagents in low and middle income countries. In the interest of economy, time and availability of chemicals and consumables, the SYBR Green-based detection was implemented to establish a convenient assay. Therefore, we adapted one of WHO recommended Taqman-based one-step real time PCR protocols (from the University of Hong Kong) to SYBR Green. Our results suggest that SYBR-Green detection represents a reliable cost-effective alternative to increase the testing capacity.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alvaro Fajardo","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Virologia Molecular, Centro de Investigaciones Nucleares, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de la Republica, Montevideo, Uruguay; Laboratorio de "},{"author_name":"Marianoel Pereira-Gomez","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Virologia Molecular, Centro de Investigaciones Nucleares, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de la Republica, Montevideo, Uruguay; Laboratorio de "},{"author_name":"Natalia Echeverria","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Virologia Molecular, Centro de Investigaciones Nucleares, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de la Republica, Montevideo, Uruguay; Laboratorio de "},{"author_name":"Fernando Lopez-Tort","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Virologia Molecular, Sede Salto, Centro Universitario Regional Litoral Norte, Universidad de la Republica, Salto, Uruguay."},{"author_name":"Paula Perbolianachis","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Virologia Molecular, Centro de Investigaciones Nucleares, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de la Republica, Montevideo, Uruguay; Laboratorio de "},{"author_name":"Fabian Aldunate","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Virologia Molecular, Centro de Investigaciones Nucleares, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de la Republica, Montevideo, Uruguay; Laboratorio de "},{"author_name":"Pilar Moreno","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Virologia Molecular, Centro de Investigaciones Nucleares, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de la Republica, Montevideo, Uruguay; Laboratorio de "},{"author_name":"Gonzalo Moratorio","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Virologia Molecular, Centro de Investigaciones Nucleares, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de la Republica, Montevideo, Uruguay; Laboratorio de "},{"author_name":"Kin Chan","author_inst":"Lunenfeld Tanenbaum Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jim Woodgett","author_inst":"Lunenfeld Tanenbaum Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Tony Mazzulli","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Sinai Health System\/University Health Network"},{"author_name":"Liliana Attisano","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Laurence Pelletier","author_inst":"Lunenfeld Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Myron I Cybulsky","author_inst":"Toronto General Hospital Research Institute, University Health Network"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey L Wrana","author_inst":"Samuel Lunenfeld Research Inst."},{"author_name":"Sotiris Missailidis","author_inst":"Instituto de Tecnologia em Imunobiol\u00f3gicos, Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Rafael B.

We stratify these mAbs into five major classes based on their reactivity to subdomains of S protein as well as their cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV. Many of these mAbs inhibit infection of authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus, with most neutralizing mAbs recognizing the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S.

However, there is limited information on the quality of antibody response generated following vaccination by these vaccine modalities. To better understand antibody response induced by spike protein-based vaccines, we immunized rabbits with various SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antigens: S-ectodomain (S1+S2) (aa 16-1213), which lacks the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains (CT-TM), the S1 domain (aa 16-685), the receptor-binding domain (RBD) (aa 319-541), and the S2 domain (aa 686-1213 as control). Antibody response was analyzed by ELISA, Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) against different Spike proteins in native conformation, and a pseudovirion neutralization assay to measure the quality and function of the antibodies elicited by the different Spike antigens. All three antigens (S1+S2 ectodomain, S1 domain, and RBD) generated strong neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Vaccination induced antibody repertoire was analyzed by SARS-CoV-2 spike Genome Fragment Phage Display Libraries (SARS-CoV-2 GFPDL), which identified immunodominant epitopes in the S1, S1-RBD and S2 domains. Furthermore, these analyses demonstrated that surprisingly the RBD immunogen elicited a higher antibody titer with 5-fold higher affinity antibodies to native spike antigens compared with other spike antigens. These findings may help guide rational vaccine design and facilitate development and evaluation of effective therapeutics and vaccines against COVID-19 disease.\n\nOne Sentence SummarySARS-CoV-2 Spike induced immune response","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Supriya Ravichandran","author_inst":"FDA"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth M Coyle","author_inst":"FDA"},{"author_name":"Laura Klenow","author_inst":"FDA"},{"author_name":"Juanjie Tang","author_inst":"FDA"},{"author_name":"Gabrielle Grubbs","author_inst":"FDA"},{"author_name":"Shufeng Liu","author_inst":"FDA"},{"author_name":"Tony Wang","author_inst":"FDA"},{"author_name":"Hana Golding","author_inst":"FDA"},{"author_name":"Surender Khurana","author_inst":"US Food and Drug Administration"},{"author_name":"Elaine C Chen","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Elad Binshtein","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Swathi Shrihari","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mario A Ostrowski","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Helen Y Chu","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jonathan E Didier","author_inst":"Berkeley Lights"},{"author_name":"Keith W MacRenaris","author_inst":"Berkeley Lights"},{"author_name":"Taylor Jones","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Samuel Day","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Luke Myers","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"F.

The urgent need for effective vaccines and therapies is leading to a rapid rise in the number of high resolution structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins that collectively reveal a map of virus vulnerabilities. To assist structure-based design of vaccines and therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, we have developed CoV3D, a database and resource for coronavirus protein structures, which is updated on a weekly basis. CoV3D provides users with comprehensive sets of structures of coronavirus proteins and their complexes with antibodies, receptors, and small molecules. Integrated molecular viewers allow users to visualize structures of the spike glycoprotein, which is the major target of neutralizing antibodies and vaccine design efforts, as well as sets of spike-antibody complexes, spike sequence variability, and known polymorphisms. In order to aid structure-based design and analysis of the spike glycoprotein, CoV3D permits visualization and download of spike structures with modeled N-glycosylation at known glycan sites, and contains structure-based classification of spike conformations, generated by unsupervised clustering.

Furthermore, we define a new measurement, infection group differential (IGD) score, in assessing the infection ability of two human coronavirus groups. There are nine extremely high IGD (ehIGD) sites in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) out of 40 high IGD (hIGD) sites that exhibit a unique infection-related pattern from the haplotype network and docking energy comparison. These 40 hIGD sites are basically conserved among the SARS-CoV-2, i.e. there are only two hIGD sites mutated in four out of 1,058 samples, defined as rare-mutation hIGD (rhIGD) sites.

We present fastv as an ultra-fast tool to detect microbial sequences present in sequencing data, identify target microorganisms, and visualize coverage of microbial genomes. This tool is based on the k-mer mapping and extension method. K-mer sets are generated by UniqueKMER, another tool provided in this toolset. UniqueKMER can generate complete sets of unique k-mers for each genome within a large set of viral or microbial genomes. For convenience, unique k-mers for microorganisms and common viruses that afflict humans have been generated and are provided with the tools. As a lightweight tool, fastv accepts FASTQ data as input, and directly outputs the results in both HTML and JSON formats. Prior to the k-mer analysis, fastv automatically performs adapter trimming, quality pruning, base correction, and other pre-processing to ensure the accuracy of k-mer analysis.

In response to the present crisis, understanding the molecular basis of comorbidity is essential to accelerate the development of potential drugs. To address this, we have measured the genetic association between COVID19 and various lung disorders and observed a remarkable resemblance. 141 lung disorders directly or indirectly linked to COVID19 result in a high-density disease-disease association network that shows a small-world property. The clustering of many lung diseases with COVID19 demonstrates a greater complexity and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, our results show that the functional protein-protein interaction modules involved RNA and protein metabolism, substantially hijacked by SARS-CoV-2, are connected to several lung disorders. Therefore we recommend targeting the components of these modules to inhibit the viral growth and improve the clinical conditions in comorbidity.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Asim Bikas Das","author_inst":"National Institute of Technology Warangal"},{"author_name":"Changshou He","author_inst":"HaploX Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yingqiang Li","author_inst":"HaploX Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Zhicheng Li","author_inst":"Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Charles E Melancon III","author_inst":"HaploX Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Yun Wang","author_inst":"School of Life Science and Technology, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China."},{"author_name":"Maode Lai","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China."},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"School of Life Science and Technology, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China"},{"author_name":"Amy Flaxman","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Marta Ulaszewska","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Friederike Feldmann","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Allen","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Hannah Sharpe","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Schulz","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Myndi Holbrook","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Atsushi Okumura","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Kimberly Meade-White","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Lizzette Perez-Perez","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Cameron Bissett","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Ciaran Gilbride","author_inst":"oxford"},{"author_name":"Brandi Williamson","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Rosenke","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Dan Long","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Alka Ishwarbhai","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Reshma Kailath","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Louisa Rose","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Susan Morris","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Claire Powers","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jamie Lovaglio","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Patrick Hanley","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Dana Scott","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Greg Saturday","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Emmie de Wit","author_inst":"NIAID, NIH"},{"author_name":"Sarah C Gilbert","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIAID"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"systems biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.12.092379","rel_title":"Comparison of the Accula SARS-CoV-2 Test with a Laboratory-Developed Assay for Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Clinical Nasopharyngeal Specimens","rel_date":"2020-05-13","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.12.092379","rel_abs":"BackgroundSeveral point-of-care (POC) molecular tests have received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. The test performance characteristics of the Accula (Mesa Biotech) SARS-CoV-2 POC test need to be evaluated to inform its optimal use.\n\nObjectivesThe aim of this study was to assess test performance of the Accula SARS-CoV-2 test.\n\nStudy designThe performance of the Accula test was assessed by comparing results of 100 nasopharyngeal swab samples previously characterized by the Stanford Health Care EUA laboratory-developed test (SHC-LDT) targeting the envelope (E) gene. Assay concordance was assessed by overall percent agreement, positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA), and Cohens kappa coefficient.\n\nResultsOverall percent agreement between the assays was 84.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 75.3 to 90.6%), PPA was 68.0% (95% CI 53.3 to 80.5%) and the kappa coefficient was 0.68 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.82). Sixteen specimens detected by the SHC-LDT were not detected by the Accula test, and showed low viral load burden with a median cycle threshold value of 37.7. NPA was 100% (95% CI 94.2 to 100%).\n\nConclusionCompared to the SHC-LDT, the Accula SARS-CoV-2 test showed excellent negative agreement. However, positive agreement was low for samples with low viral load. The false negative rate of the Accula POC test calls for a more thorough evaluation of POC test performance characteristics in clinical settings, and for confirmatory testing in individuals with moderate to high pre-test probability of SARS-CoV-2 who test negative on Accula.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Catherine A.

Aiming to understand a host genetic component of COVID-19, we focused on variants in genes encoding proteases and genes involved in innate immunity that could be important for susceptibility and resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nAnalysis of sequence data of coding regions of FURIN, PLG, PRSS1, TMPRSS11a, MBL2 and OAS1 genes in 143 unrelated individuals from Serbian population identified 22 variants with potential functional effect. In silico analyses (PolyPhen-2, SIFT, MutPred2 and Swiss-Pdb Viewer) predicted that 10 variants could impact the structure and\/or function of proteins. These protein-altering variants (p.Gly146Ser in FURIN; p.Arg261His and p.Ala494Val in PLG; p.Asn54Lys in PRSS1; p.Arg52Cys, p.Gly54Asp and p.Gly57Glu in MBL2; p.Arg47Gln, p.Ile99Val and p.Arg130His in OAS1) may have predictive value for inter-individual differences in the response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nNext, we performed comparative population analysis for the same variants using extracted data from the 1000 genomes project. Population genetic variability was assessed using delta MAF and Fst statistics. Our study pointed to 7 variants in PLG, TMPRSS11a, MBL2 and OAS1 genes with noticeable divergence in allelic frequencies between populations worldwide. Three of them, all in MBL2 gene, were predicted to be damaging, making them the most promising population-specific markers related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nComparing allelic frequencies between Serbian and other populations, we found that the highest level of genetic divergence related to selected loci was observed with African, followed by East Asian, Central and South American and South Asian populations. When compared with European populations, the highest divergence was observed with Italian population.\n\nIn conclusion, we identified 4 variants in genes encoding proteases (FURIN, PLG and PRSS1) and 6 in genes involved in the innate immunity (MBL2 and OAS1) that might be relevant for the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kristel Klaassen","author_inst":"Laboratory for Molecular Biomedicine, Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia"},{"author_name":"Biljana Stankovic","author_inst":"Laboratory for Molecular Biomedicine, Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia"},{"author_name":"Branka Zukic","author_inst":"Laboratory for Molecular Biomedicine, Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia"},{"author_name":"Nikola Kotur","author_inst":"Laboratory for Molecular Biomedicine, Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia"},{"author_name":"Vladimir Gasic","author_inst":"Laboratory for Molecular Biomedicine, Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia"},{"author_name":"Sonja Pavlovic","author_inst":"Laboratory for Molecular Biomedicine, Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia"},{"author_name":"Maja Stojiljkovic","author_inst":"Laboratory for Molecular Biomedicine, Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia"},{"author_name":"James Zehnder","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Benjamin A.

The comparisons of Mpro in different states reveal that substrate binding site and the active site are more flexible in the inactive conformation than that in the active conformations. Notably, compared with the active conformation of the apo state structure in pH7.6 of SARS, the SARS-CoV-2 apo state is in the inactive conformation under condition close to physiological state (pH7.5). Two water molecules are present in the oxyanion hole in our apo state structure, whereas in the ligand-bound structure, water molecular is absence in the same region.

There is an immediate need to develop a safe and efficient discharge process and recovery programme. Pulmonary rehabilitation is well placed to deliver a rehabilitation programme for this group but will most likely need to be adapted for the post Covid-19 population. The purpose of this survey was to rapidly identify the components of a post-Covid-19 rehabilitation assessment and elements of a successful rehabilitation programme that would be required to deliver a comprehensive service for those post Covid-19 to inform service delivery. Design A survey comprising a series of closed questions and a free text comments box allowing for a qualitative analysis. Setting Online survey. Participants British Thoracic Society members and multi-professional clinicians, across specialities were invited to take part. Results 1031 participants responded from a broad range of specialities over 6 days. There was overwhelming support for early post discharge from hospital phase of the recovery programme to advise patients about the management of fatigue (95% agreed\/ strongly agreed), breathlessness (94%), and mood disturbances (including symptoms of anxiety and depression) 92%. At the 6-8-week time point an assessment was considered important, focusing on the assessment of a broad range of possible symptoms and the need to potentially return to work. Recommendations for the intervention described a holistic programme focusing on symptom management, return of function and return to employment. The free text comments added depth to the survey and the need not to reinvent the wheel rather adapt well established (pulmonary rehabilitation) services to accommodate the needs of the post Covid-19 population. Conclusion The responses indicate the huge interest and the urgent need establish a programme to support and mitigate the long term impact of Covid-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sally J Singh","author_inst":"University of Leicester; University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Amy C Barradell","author_inst":"University of Leicester; University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Neil J Greening","author_inst":"University of Leicester, University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Charlotte E Bolton","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Gisli Jenkins","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Louise Preston","author_inst":"British Thoracic Society"},{"author_name":"John R Hurst","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Jinheng Fu","author_inst":"Jiangxi-OAI Joint Research Institution, Nanchang University, Nanchang, 330047, China."},{"author_name":"Wei He","author_inst":"College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou, 341000, Jiangxi, PR,China."},{"author_name":"Jingjing Duan","author_inst":"Human Aging Research Institute (HARI), School of Life Sciences, Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, 330031, China"},{"author_name":"Yang Fu","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China 518055"},{"author_name":"Huan Zhou","author_inst":"Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Shanghai Advanced Research Institute,Chinese Academy of Sciences 239 Zhangheng Road, Pudong District, Shanghai 201204, "},{"author_name":"Qisheng Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Shanghai Advanced Research Institute,Chinese Academy of Sciences 239 Zhangheng Road, Pudong District, Shanghai 201204, "},{"author_name":"Jian Li","author_inst":"College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou, 341000, Jiangxi, PR,China."},{"author_name":"Jin Zhang","author_inst":"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, 330031, China."},{"author_name":"Atsushi Okumura","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Kimberly Meade-White","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Lizzette Perez-Perez","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Cameron Bissett","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Ciaran Gilbride","author_inst":"oxford"},{"author_name":"Brandi Williamson","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Rosenke","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Dan Long","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Alka Ishwarbhai","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Reshma Kailath","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Louisa Rose","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Susan Morris","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Claire Powers","author_inst":"Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jamie Lovaglio","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Patrick Hanley","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Dana Scott","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Greg Saturday","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Emmie de Wit","author_inst":"NIAID, NIH"},{"author_name":"Sarah C Gilbert","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Vincent Munster","author_inst":"NIAID"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"rehabilitation medicine and physical therapy"}]}
