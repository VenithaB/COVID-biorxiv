Two months later, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced SARS-CoV-2 as the name for the new virus and COVID-19 for the associated illness. On March 12, 2020, the WHO officially declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. The scientific community has raced to find effective therapeutic agents against the virus. Gautret et al 2020 is among one of the first purportedly positive trials of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. However, it is imperative that a thorough analysis and understanding of trial data be undertaken prior to making claims about safety and efficacy. Our group assessed the statistical robustness of the trial using the Fragility Index (FI). The FI provides a numerical quantification of a clinical trial's conclusions. The index is based on iterative statistical calculations to determine the minimum number of events within a trial that would theoretically need to change from positive to negative in order for the trial's endpoint to convert from significant to non-significant; the higher the index, the more statistically robust the study results. For the Gautret et al trial, one endpoint had an FI of 1, two had indices of 2, and another had an index of 4. The primary endpoint of viral clearance on day 6 had an FI of 4. This indicates that if 4 events were to change from positive to negative, the conclusion of the trial would become mathematically non-significant. This index is comparable to many other published trials of established agents; the median FI across the reported literature appears to be 2. In conclusion, the trial results reported by Gautret et al are statistically robust, assuming that data quality is not compromised; however, the study was an open-label trial with non-homogenous groups, with analysis conducted per-protocol. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 Reverse Transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) testing was not conducted in a systematic way amongst the two groups. Further analyses of this trial and future trials of antiviral agents with potential activity against SARS-CoV-2 should be performed with complementary epidemiologic and statistical techniques to determine whether the trial's results are clinically important and\/or should be explored in depth. Given the statistically robust results reported by Gautret et al, despite the study's inherent methodological and analytical flaws, hydroxychloroquine should be studied as a potential agent against COVID-19 in larger clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ronald Chow","author_inst":"Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, University of Western Ontario"},{"author_name":"Sameer Elsayed","author_inst":"Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, University of Western Ontario"},{"author_name":"Michael Lock","author_inst":"Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, University of Western Ontario"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.06.20093138","rel_title":"A study on the relationship between BCG vaccination and Covid-19 prevalence: Do other confounders warrant investigation?","rel_date":"2020-05-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.06.20093138","rel_abs":"The Covid-19 pandemic, which originated from Wuhan, Hubei province, China, and quickly spread to the rest of the globe is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a single-stranded RNA virus. Preliminary data suggest a relationship between the BCG vaccine and the prevalence of Covid-19. The BCG vaccine is used in the prevention of tuberculosis, a disease that is most prevalent in developing countries. To determine the potential protective role of BCG vaccination, this study investigated the occurrence of Covid-19 and the relationship between the spread of Covid-19 in countries that offer BCG vaccination and those that do not. The study also performed a phylogenetic analysis of the strains involved in the Covid-19 outbreak from the representative countries. To achieve the objectives, the study utilized publicly available data on population size, vaccination coverage, and Covid-19 cases. Phylogenetic analysis was used to determine if some SARS-CoV-2 strains were more prevalent than others. The study revealed a significant negative trend between countries that offer the BCG vaccine to the general population and the reported cases of Covid-19. The study proposes future molecular and immunological analyses to determine the potential role of BCG vaccination in protection against Covid-19. This will determine if BCG has antiviral properties, with the possibility of recommending it for widespread use if supported by scientific data.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Richard M Mariita","author_inst":"Microbial BioSolutions"},{"author_name":"Jonathan M Musila","author_inst":"Fayetteville State University"},{"author_name":"Michael Lock","author_inst":"Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, University of Western Ontario"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.05.20088757","rel_title":"Hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin: a potential interest in reducing in-hospital morbidity due to COVID-19 pneumonia (HI-ZY-COVID)?","rel_date":"2020-05-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.05.20088757","rel_abs":"The authors have withdrawn this manuscript and do not wish it to be cited.

Up to March 11, 2020, 2019-nCov thoroughly broke out in Italy with over 10,000 confirmed cases notwithstanding the gradually block of the country since March 9, 2020. Estimation of possible infection population and prospective suggestion of handling spread based on exist data are of crucial importance. Considering of the biology parameters obtained based on Chinese clinical data in Wuhan, other scholars' work and real spread feature of 2019-nCov in Italy, we built a more applicable model called SEIJR with log-normal distributed time delay to forecast the trend of spreading. Adopting Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), we estimated the early period average spreading velocity (0) and conducted inversion analysis of time point (T0) when the virus first hit the Italy. Based on fixed 0 and T0, we then obtained the average spreading velocity 1 after the lock by PSO. For the aim of offering expeditious advice, we generated the prediction trends with different  which we considered would be helpful in addressing the infection. Not only solved the complex, nondifferentiable equation of epidemic model, our research also performs well in inversion analysis based on PSO which conveys informative outcomes for further discussion on precatious action. To conclude, the first day of spread is around February 1, 2020 with the early period average spreading velocity 0=0.330 which is higher than most cities in China except Wuhan. After locking the country and attaching great attention to public precaution, the 1 sharply descended to 0.278, indicting the effectiveness of these measures.

Although 61,888 confirmed cases had been reported in Brazil by 28 April 2020, little was known about the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in the country. To better understand the recent epidemic in the second most populous state in southeast Brazil (Minas Gerais, MG), we looked at existing epidemiological data from 3 states and sequenced 40 complete genomes from MG cases using Nanopore. We found evidence of multiple independent introductions from outside MG, both from genome analyses and the overly dispersed distribution of reported cases and deaths. Epidemiological estimates of the reproductive number using different data sources and theoretical assumptions all suggest a reduction in transmission potential since the first reported case, but potential for sustained transmission in the near future. The estimated date of introduction in Brazil was consistent with epidemiological data from the first case of a returning-traveler from Lombardia, Italy. These findings highlight the unique reality of MGs epidemic and reinforce the need for real-time and continued genomic surveillance strategies as a way of understanding and therefore preparing against the epidemic spread of emerging viral pathogens.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joilson Xavier","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Genetica Celular e Molecular, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Marta Giovanetti","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Flavivirus, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil;"},{"author_name":"Talita Adelino","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Vagner Fonseca","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Genetica Celular e Molecular, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Alana Vitor Barbosa da Costa","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Adriana Aparecida Ribeiro","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Katlin Nascimento Felicio","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Clara Guerra Duarte","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Marcos Vinicius Ferreira Silva","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Salgado","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Genetica Celular e Molecular, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Mauricio Teixeira Lima","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Ronaldo de Jesus","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Genetica Celular e Molecular, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Allison Fabri","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Flavivirus, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Cristiane Franco Soares Zoboli","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Thales Gutemberg Souza Santos","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Felipe Iani","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Ana Maria Bispo de Filippis","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Flavivirus, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Marilda Agudo Mendonca Teixeira de Siqueira","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Virus Respiratorios e Sarampo, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz Fiocruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Andre Luiz de Abreu","author_inst":"Coordenacao Geral dos Laboratorios de Saude Publica\/Secretaria de Vigilancia em Saude, Ministerio da Saude, (CGLAB\/SVS-MS) Brasilia, Distrito Federal, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Vasco de Azevedo","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Genetica Celular e Molecular, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Dario Brock Ramalho","author_inst":"Secretaria de Estado de Saude de Minas Gerais; Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Carlos F.

This paper presents a prospective service evaluation during establishment of urgent dental care in the North-East of England over a six-week period. Aim: To monitor patient volumes, demographics and outcomes at the North-East urgent dental care service and confirm appropriate care pathways. Main Outcome Methods: Data were collected on key characteristics of patients accessing urgent care from 23rd March to 3rd May 2020. Analysis was with descriptive statistics. Results: There were 1746 patient triages, (1595 telephone and 151 face-to-face) resulting in 1322 clinical consultations. The most common diagnoses were: symptomatic irreversible pulpitis or apical periodontitis. 65% of clinical consultations resulted in extractions, 0.5% an aerosol generating procedure. Patients travelled 25km on average to access care, however this reduced as more urgent care centres were established. The majority of patients were asymptomatic of COVID-19 and to our knowledge no staff acquired infection due to occupational exposure. Conclusion: The urgent dental care centre effectively managed urgent and emergency dental care, with appropriate patient pathways established over the 6-week period. Dental preparedness for future pandemic crisis could be improved and informed by this data.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emily Carter","author_inst":"Newcastle Dental Hospital"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Currie","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Abisola Asuni","author_inst":"Newcastle Dental Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rachel Goldsmith","author_inst":"Newcastle Dental Hospital"},{"author_name":"Grace Toon","author_inst":"Newcastle Dental Hospital"},{"author_name":"Catherine Horridge","author_inst":"Newcastle Dental Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sarah Simpson","author_inst":"Newcastle Dental Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christopher Donnell","author_inst":"Newcastle Dental Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mark Greenwood","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Graham Walton","author_inst":"Newcastle Dental Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ben Cole","author_inst":"Newcastle Dental Hospital"},{"author_name":"Justin Durham","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Richard Holliday","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Cristiane Franco Soares Zoboli","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Thales Gutemberg Souza Santos","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Felipe Iani","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Ana Maria Bispo de Filippis","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Flavivirus, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Marilda Agudo Mendonca Teixeira de Siqueira","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Virus Respiratorios e Sarampo, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz Fiocruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Andre Luiz de Abreu","author_inst":"Coordenacao Geral dos Laboratorios de Saude Publica\/Secretaria de Vigilancia em Saude, Ministerio da Saude, (CGLAB\/SVS-MS) Brasilia, Distrito Federal, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Vasco de Azevedo","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Genetica Celular e Molecular, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Dario Brock Ramalho","author_inst":"Secretaria de Estado de Saude de Minas Gerais; Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Carlos F.

PPE-preparedness was defined as the adherence to guidelines, training HCWs, procuring PPE stocks and responding appropriately to a suspected case (transportation and admission to hospital). Design: Cross-sectional web-based survey. Setting: ICUs in Australia, New Zealand (NZ), Singapore, Hong Kong (HK), India and Philippines with a 24\/7 Emergency\/Casualty Department, and capable of mechanically ventilating patients for more than 24 hours. Interventions: Questionnaire sent to intensivists in 633 Level II\/III ICUs in 6 Asia-Pacific countries by email, WhatsApp and text messaging. Main outcome measures: 263 intensivists responded, of whom 231 were eligible for analysis. Response rates were 68%-100% in all countries except India, where it was 24%. 97% either conformed to or exceeded WHO recommendations for PPE-practice. 59% employed airborne precautions irrespective of aerosol-generation-procedures. There were variations in negative-pressure room use (highest in HK\/Singapore), training (best in NZ), and PPE stock-awareness (best in HK\/Singapore\/NZ). High-flow-nasal-oxygenation and non-invasive ventilation were not options in most HK (66.7%, 83.3% respectively) and Singapore ICUs (50%, 80% respectively), but were considered in other countries to a greater extent. 38% reported not having specialized airway teams. Showering and buddy-systems were underutilized. Clinical waste disposal training was suboptimal (38%). Conclusions: Most intensivists from six Asia-Pacific countries appeared to be aware of the WHO PPE-guidelines by either conforming to\/exceeding the recommendations. Despite this, there were widespread variabilities across ICUs and countries in several domains, particularly related to PPE-training and preparedness. Standardising PPE guidelines may translate to better training, better compliance and policies that improve HCW safety. Adopting low-cost approaches such as buddy-systems should be encouraged. More importantly, better pandemic preparedness and building systems with deeply embedded culture of safety is essential to ensure the safety and well-being of HCWs during such pandemics.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arvind Rajamani","author_inst":"Nepean Clinical School University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Ashwin SUBRAMANIAM","author_inst":"Frankston Hospital and Monash University, VIC"},{"author_name":"Kiran Shekar","author_inst":"The Prince Charles Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jumana Haji","author_inst":"ECMO program director, Consultant anesthesia and critical care 8.\tAster CMI hospital Bangalore"},{"author_name":"Jinghang Luo","author_inst":"Basic Physician Trainee 9.\tWestern Health, VIC"},{"author_name":"Shailesh BIHARI","author_inst":"Flinders university and Flinders Medical center, Bedford Park SA 5042"},{"author_name":"Wai Tat Wong","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Navya GULLAPALLI","author_inst":"Final Year Medical Student Monash University, Clayton VIC"},{"author_name":"Markus RENNER","author_inst":"Senior clinical lecturer Otago University, NZ."},{"author_name":"Claudia Maria ALCANCIA","author_inst":"Makati Medical Center, Philippines"},{"author_name":"Kollengode RAMANATHAN","author_inst":"National University Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Justin Durham","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Richard Holliday","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Cristiane Franco Soares Zoboli","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Thales Gutemberg Souza Santos","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Felipe Iani","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Ana Maria Bispo de Filippis","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Flavivirus, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Marilda Agudo Mendonca Teixeira de Siqueira","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Virus Respiratorios e Sarampo, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz Fiocruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Andre Luiz de Abreu","author_inst":"Coordenacao Geral dos Laboratorios de Saude Publica\/Secretaria de Vigilancia em Saude, Ministerio da Saude, (CGLAB\/SVS-MS) Brasilia, Distrito Federal, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Vasco de Azevedo","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Genetica Celular e Molecular, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Dario Brock Ramalho","author_inst":"Secretaria de Estado de Saude de Minas Gerais; Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Carlos F.

Though current evidence on the epidemiology of the disease is emerging, very little is known about the predictors of recovery. We describe the epidemiology of confirmed CoVID-19 patients in Republic of Korea and identify predictors of recovery. Materials and methods: Using publicly available data for confirmed CoVID-19 cases from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from January 20, 2020 to April 30, 2020, we undertook descriptive analyses of cases stratified by sex, age group, place of exposure, date of confirmation and province. Correlation was tested among all predictors (sex, age group, place of exposure and province) with the Pearsons correlation coefficient. Associations between recovery from CoVID-19 and predictors were estimated using a multivariable logistic regression model. Results: Majority of the confirmed cases were females (56 percent), from 20-29 age group (24.3 percent), and primarily from three provinces Gyeongsangbuk (36.9 percent), Gyeonggi (20.5 percent) and Seoul (17.1 percent). Case fatality ratio was 2.1 percent and 41.6 percent cases recovered. Older patients, patients from certain provinces such as Daegu, Gyeonggi, Gyeongsangbuk, Jeju, Jeollabuk and Jeollanam, and those contracting the disease from healthcare settings had lower recovery. Conclusions: Our study adds to the very limited evidence base on potential predictors of recovery among confirmed CoVID-19 cases.

A number of studies and reviews have been performed regarding the use of medical grade masks like surgical masks, N95 respirators etc. However, the use of cloth masks has received little attention. Objectives: The purpose of this review is to analyze the available data regarding the use of cloth masks for the prevention of respiratory infections. We intended to use data from both clinical and non-clinical studies to arrive at our conclusion. Methods: We used PubMed, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar as our source databases. Both clinical and non-clinical studies, which had data regarding the efficacy of cloth masks, were selected. Articles not containing analyzable data including opinion articles, review articles etc. were excluded. After screening the search results, ten studies could be included in our review. Data relevant to our objective was extracted from each study including clinical efficacy, compliance, filtration efficacy etc. Data from some studies were simplified for the purpose of comparison. Extracted data was summarized and categorized for detailed analysis. Qualitative synthesis of the data was performed. But the heterogeneity between the studies did not allow for a meta-analysis. Discussion: The review was limited by a lack of sufficient clinical studies. Lack of standardization between studies was another limitation. Although cloth masks generally perform poorer than the medical grade masks, they may be better than no masks at all. Filtration efficacy varied greatly depending on the material used, with some materials showing a filtration efficacy above 90%. However, leakage could reduce efficacy of masks by about 50%. Standardization of cloth masks and appropriate use is essential for cloth masks to be effective. However, result of a randomized controlled trial suggest that they may be ineffective in the healthcare setting.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Agnibho Mondal","author_inst":"School of Tropical Medicine, Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Arnavjyoti Das","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University"},{"author_name":"Rama Prosad Goswami","author_inst":"School of Tropical Medicine, Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Jumana Haji","author_inst":"ECMO program director, Consultant anesthesia and critical care 8.\tAster CMI hospital Bangalore"},{"author_name":"Jinghang Luo","author_inst":"Basic Physician Trainee 9.\tWestern Health, VIC"},{"author_name":"Shailesh BIHARI","author_inst":"Flinders university and Flinders Medical center, Bedford Park SA 5042"},{"author_name":"Wai Tat Wong","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Navya GULLAPALLI","author_inst":"Final Year Medical Student Monash University, Clayton VIC"},{"author_name":"Markus RENNER","author_inst":"Senior clinical lecturer Otago University, NZ."},{"author_name":"Claudia Maria ALCANCIA","author_inst":"Makati Medical Center, Philippines"},{"author_name":"Kollengode RAMANATHAN","author_inst":"National University Hospital, Singapore"},{"author_name":"Justin Durham","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Richard Holliday","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Cristiane Franco Soares Zoboli","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Thales Gutemberg Souza Santos","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Felipe Iani","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Ana Maria Bispo de Filippis","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Flavivirus, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Marilda Agudo Mendonca Teixeira de Siqueira","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Virus Respiratorios e Sarampo, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz Fiocruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Andre Luiz de Abreu","author_inst":"Coordenacao Geral dos Laboratorios de Saude Publica\/Secretaria de Vigilancia em Saude, Ministerio da Saude, (CGLAB\/SVS-MS) Brasilia, Distrito Federal, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Vasco de Azevedo","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Genetica Celular e Molecular, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Dario Brock Ramalho","author_inst":"Secretaria de Estado de Saude de Minas Gerais; Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Carlos F.

One of them is the contribution to transmission from individuals experiencing asymptomatic infections. We aimed to characterise the proportion and infectiousness of asymptomatic infections using data from the outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Methods: We used a transmission model of COVID-19 with asymptomatic and presymptomatic states calibrated to outbreak data from the Diamond Princess, to quantify the contribution of asymptomatic infections to transmission. Data available included the date of symptom onset for symptomatic disease for passengers and crew, the number of symptom agnostic tests done each day, and date of positive test for asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals. Findings: On the Diamond Princess 74% (70-78%) of infections proceeded asymptomatically, i.e. a 1:3.8 case-to-infection ratio. Despite the intense testing 53%, (51-56%) of infections remained undetected, most of them asymptomatic. Asymptomatic individuals were the source for 69% (20-85%) of all infections. While the data did not allow identification of the infectiousness of asymptomatic infections, assuming no or low infectiousness resulted in posterior estimates for the net reproduction number of an individual progressing through presymptomatic and symptomatic stages in excess of 15. Interpretation: Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections may contribute substantially to transmission. This is essential to consider for countries when assessing the potential effectiveness of ongoing control measures to contain COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jon C Emery","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Timothy W Russel","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yang Liu","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Joel Hellewell","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Carl AB Pearson","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"- CMMID 2019-nCoV working group","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Gwen M Knight","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adam J Kucharski","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Funk","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stefan Flasche","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rein M G J Houben","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Richard Holliday","author_inst":"Newcastle University"},{"author_name":"Cristiane Franco Soares Zoboli","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Thales Gutemberg Souza Santos","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Felipe Iani","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Ana Maria Bispo de Filippis","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Flavivirus, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Marilda Agudo Mendonca Teixeira de Siqueira","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Virus Respiratorios e Sarampo, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz Fiocruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Andre Luiz de Abreu","author_inst":"Coordenacao Geral dos Laboratorios de Saude Publica\/Secretaria de Vigilancia em Saude, Ministerio da Saude, (CGLAB\/SVS-MS) Brasilia, Distrito Federal, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Vasco de Azevedo","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Genetica Celular e Molecular, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Dario Brock Ramalho","author_inst":"Secretaria de Estado de Saude de Minas Gerais; Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Carlos F.

We describe our optimizations of the LAMP reaction and saliva pretreatment protocols that enabled rapid and sensitive detection of < 102 viral genomes per reaction in contrived saliva controls. Moreover, our saliva pretreatment protocol enabled sensitive viral detection by conventional quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) without RNA extraction. We validated the high performance of these assays on clinical samples and demonstrate a promising approach to overcome the current bottlenecks limiting widespread testing.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matthew A Lalli","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"S Joshua Langmade","author_inst":"Washington University in St Louis"},{"author_name":"Xuhua Chen","author_inst":"Washington University in St Louis"},{"author_name":"Catrina C Fronick","author_inst":"Washington University in St Louis"},{"author_name":"Christopher S Sawyer","author_inst":"Washington University in St Louis"},{"author_name":"Lauren C Burcea","author_inst":"Washington University in St Louis"},{"author_name":"Michael N Wilkinson","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis"},{"author_name":"Robert S Fulton","author_inst":"Washington University in St Louis"},{"author_name":"Michael Heinz","author_inst":"Washington University in St Louis"},{"author_name":"William J Buchser","author_inst":"Washington University in St Louis"},{"author_name":"Richard D Head","author_inst":"Washington University in St Louis"},{"author_name":"Robi D Mitra","author_inst":"Washington University in St Louis"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Milbrandt","author_inst":"Washington University in St Louis"},{"author_name":"Cristiane Franco Soares Zoboli","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Thales Gutemberg Souza Santos","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Felipe Iani","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Ana Maria Bispo de Filippis","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Flavivirus, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Marilda Agudo Mendonca Teixeira de Siqueira","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Virus Respiratorios e Sarampo, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz Fiocruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Andre Luiz de Abreu","author_inst":"Coordenacao Geral dos Laboratorios de Saude Publica\/Secretaria de Vigilancia em Saude, Ministerio da Saude, (CGLAB\/SVS-MS) Brasilia, Distrito Federal, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Vasco de Azevedo","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Genetica Celular e Molecular, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Dario Brock Ramalho","author_inst":"Secretaria de Estado de Saude de Minas Gerais; Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Carlos F.

However, its psychological impact on patients is unclear. We aim to examine the prevalence and associated risk factors for psychological morbidities and fatigue in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Methods: Amidst the disease outbreak, 41 out of 105 COVID-19 patients in a local designated hospital in China were successfully assessed using a constellation of psychometric questionnaires to determine their psychological morbidities and fatigue. Several potential biopsychosocial risk factors (including pre-existing disabilities, CT severity score of pneumonia, social support, coping strategies) were assessed through multivariable logistic regression analyses to clarify their association with mental health in patients. Results: 43.9% of 41 patients presented with impaired general mental health, 12.2% had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, 26.8% had anxiety and\/or depression symptoms, and 53.6% had fatigue. We did not find any association between pneumonia severity and psychological morbidities or fatigue in COVID-19 patients. However, high perceived stigmatization was associated with an increased risk of impaired general mental health and high perceived social support was associated with decreased risk. Besides, negative coping inclination was associated with an increased risk of PTSD symptoms; high perceived social support was associated with a decreased risk of anxiety and\/or depression symptoms. Conclusions: Psychological morbidities and chronic fatigue are common among COVID-19 patients. Negative coping inclination and being stigmatized are primary risk factors while perceived social support is the main protective factor.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rongfeng Qi","author_inst":"Department of Medical Imaging, Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University; Department of Radiology, Jinling Hospital, Southern Medical University."},{"author_name":"Wei Chen","author_inst":"Jinling Hospital, Southern Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China; The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children Hospital of Wenzhou Medical Universit"},{"author_name":"Saiduo Liu","author_inst":"Departments of Infectious Disease, Wenzhou Central Hospital, 32 West Jiangbin Road, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China."},{"author_name":"Paul M Thompson","author_inst":"Imaging Genetics Center, Mark and Mary Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute, University of Southern California"},{"author_name":"Long Jiang Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Medical Imaging, Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University"},{"author_name":"Fei Xia","author_inst":"Department of Medical Imaging, Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University"},{"author_name":"Fang Cheng","author_inst":"Departments of Infectious Disease, Wenzhou Central Hospital, 32 West Jiangbin Road, Wenzhou, Zhejiang"},{"author_name":"Ailing Hong","author_inst":"Departments of Infectious Disease, Wenzhou Central Hospital, 32 West Jiangbin Road, Wenzhou, Zhejiang"},{"author_name":"Wesley Surento","author_inst":"Imaging Genetics Center, Mark and Mary Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute, University of Southern California, Marina del Rey, CA, 90292, USA."},{"author_name":"Song Luo","author_inst":"Department of Medical Imaging, Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"},{"author_name":"Zhi Yuan Sun","author_inst":"Department of Medical Imaging, Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"},{"author_name":"Chang Sheng Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Medical Imaging, Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"},{"author_name":"Lingjiang Li","author_inst":"Mental Health Institute, the Second Xiangya Hospital, National Technology Institute of Psychiatry, Key Laboratory of Psychiatry and Mental Health of Hunan Provi"},{"author_name":"Xiangao Jiang","author_inst":"Departments of Infectious Disease, Wenzhou Central Hospital, 32 West Jiangbin Road, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China."},{"author_name":"Guang Ming Lu","author_inst":"Department of Medical Imaging, Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"},{"author_name":"Felipe Iani","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Ana Maria Bispo de Filippis","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Flavivirus, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Marilda Agudo Mendonca Teixeira de Siqueira","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Virus Respiratorios e Sarampo, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz Fiocruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Andre Luiz de Abreu","author_inst":"Coordenacao Geral dos Laboratorios de Saude Publica\/Secretaria de Vigilancia em Saude, Ministerio da Saude, (CGLAB\/SVS-MS) Brasilia, Distrito Federal, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Vasco de Azevedo","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Genetica Celular e Molecular, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Dario Brock Ramalho","author_inst":"Secretaria de Estado de Saude de Minas Gerais; Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Carlos F.

Chamber slides and N95 respirator material were directly inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 and exposed to different durations of PX-UV disinfection. For hard surfaces, disinfection for 1, 2, and 5 minutes resulted in 3.53 Log10, >4.54 Log10, and >4.12 Log10 reductions in viral load, respectively. For N95 respirators, disinfection for 5 minutes resulted in >4.79 Log10 reduction in viral load. We found that PX-UV significantly reduces SARS-CoV-2 on hard surfaces and N95 respirators. With the potential to rapidly disinfectant environmental surfaces and N95 respirators, PX-UV devices are a promising technology for the reduction of environmental and PPE bioburden and to enhance both HCW and patient safety by reducing the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sarah Simmons","author_inst":"Xenex Disinfection Services, Inc., San Antonio, TX"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Carrion Jr.","author_inst":"Department of Virology and Immunology, Texas Biomedical Research Institute, San Antonio, TX"},{"author_name":"Kendra Alfson","author_inst":"Department of Virology and Immunology, Texas Biomedical Research Institute, San Antonio, TX"},{"author_name":"Hilary Staples","author_inst":"Department of Virology and Immunology, Texas Biomedical Research Institute, San Antonio, TX"},{"author_name":"Chetan Jinadatha","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Central Texas Veterans Healthcare System, Temple, TX, Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, Texas A&M Health Science Center, Brya"},{"author_name":"William Jarvis","author_inst":"Jason and Jarvis Associates, Hilton Head Island, SC"},{"author_name":"Priya Sampathkumar","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN"},{"author_name":"Roy Chemaly","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control and Employee Health, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX"},{"author_name":"Fareed Khawaja","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control and Employee Health, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX"},{"author_name":"Mark Povroznik","author_inst":"Department of Quality, WVU Medicine: United Hospital Center, Bridgeport, WV"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Jackson","author_inst":"Department of Quality, HonorHealth, Scottsdale, AZ"},{"author_name":"Keith Kaye","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Department of Infectious Diseases, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI"},{"author_name":"Robert Rodriguez","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA"},{"author_name":"Mark Stibich","author_inst":"Xenex Disinfection Services, Inc., San Antonio, TX"},{"author_name":"Guang Ming Lu","author_inst":"Department of Medical Imaging, Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"},{"author_name":"Felipe Iani","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Ana Maria Bispo de Filippis","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Flavivirus, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Marilda Agudo Mendonca Teixeira de Siqueira","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Virus Respiratorios e Sarampo, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz Fiocruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Andre Luiz de Abreu","author_inst":"Coordenacao Geral dos Laboratorios de Saude Publica\/Secretaria de Vigilancia em Saude, Ministerio da Saude, (CGLAB\/SVS-MS) Brasilia, Distrito Federal, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Vasco de Azevedo","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Genetica Celular e Molecular, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Dario Brock Ramalho","author_inst":"Secretaria de Estado de Saude de Minas Gerais; Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Carlos F.

As of May 2020, gaps in the existing literature remain unidentified and, hence, unaddressed. In this paper, we summarise the medical literature on COVID-19 between 1 January and 24 March 2020 using evidence maps and bibliometric analysis in order to systematically identify gaps and propose areas for valuable future research. The examined COVID-19 medical literature originated primarily from Asia and focussed mainly on clinical features and diagnosis of the disease. Many areas of potential research remain underexplored, such as mental health research, the use of novel technologies and artificial intelligence, research on the pathophysiology of COVID-19 within different body systems, and research on indirect effects of COVID-19 on the care of non-COVID-19 patients. Research collaboration at the international level was limited although improvements may aid global containment efforts.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nan Liu","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Marcel Lucas Chee","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Chenglin Niu","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Pin Pin Pek","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Fahad Javaid Siddiqui","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"John Pastor Ansah","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"David Bruce Matchar","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Sean Shao Wei Lam","author_inst":"Singapore Health Services"},{"author_name":"Hairil Rizal Abdullah","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Angelique Chan","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Rahul Malhotra","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Graves","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Mariko Siyue Koh","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sungwon Yoon","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Andrew Fu Wah Ho","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Daniel Shu Wei Ting","author_inst":"Singapore National Eye Centre"},{"author_name":"Jenny Guek Hong Low","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Marcus Eng Hock Ong","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Andre Luiz de Abreu","author_inst":"Coordenacao Geral dos Laboratorios de Saude Publica\/Secretaria de Vigilancia em Saude, Ministerio da Saude, (CGLAB\/SVS-MS) Brasilia, Distrito Federal, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Vasco de Azevedo","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Genetica Celular e Molecular, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Dario Brock Ramalho","author_inst":"Secretaria de Estado de Saude de Minas Gerais; Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Carlos F.

The most severe measures to date include all restaurants, pubs and cafes being ordered to close on 20th March, followed by a \"stay at home\" order on the 23rd March and the closure of all non-essential retail outlets for an indefinite period. Government agencies are presently analysing how best to develop an exit strategy from these measures and to determine how the epidemic may progress once measures are lifted. Mathematical models are currently providing short and long term forecasts regarding the future course of the COVID-19 outbreak in the UK to support evidence-based policymaking. Methods: We present a deterministic, age-structured transmission model that uses real-time data on confirmed cases requiring hospital care and mortality to provide up-to-date predictions on epidemic spread in ten regions of the UK. We simulated a suite of scenarios to assess the impact of differing approaches to relaxing social distancing measures from 7th May 2020, on the estimated number of patients requiring inpatient and critical care treatment, and deaths. With regard to future epidemic outcomes, we investigated the impact of reducing compliance, ongoing shielding of elder age groups, reapplying stringent social distancing measures using region based triggers and the role of asymptomatic transmission. Findings: We find that significant relaxation of social distancing measures on 7th May can lead to a rapid resurgence of COVID-19 disease and the health system being quickly overwhelmed by a sizeable, second epidemic wave. In all considered age-shielding based strategies, we projected serious demand on critical care resources during the course of the pandemic. The reintroduction and release of strict measures on a regional basis, based on ICU bed occupancy, results in a long epidemic tail, until the second half of 2021, but ensures that the health service is protected by reintroducing social distancing measures for all individuals in a region when required. Conclusions: Our work supports the decision to apply stringent non-pharmaceutical measures in March 2020 to suppress the epidemic. We provide strong evidence to support the need for a cautious, measured approach to relaxation of lockdown measures, to protect the most vulnerable members of society and support the health service through subduing demand on hospital beds, in particular bed occupancy in intensive care units.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matt J Keeling","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Edward Hill","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Erin Gorsich","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Bridget Penman","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Glen Guyver-Fletcher","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Alex Holmes","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Trystan Leng","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Hector McKimm","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Tamborrino","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Louise Dyson","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Michael Tildesley","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Graves","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Mariko Siyue Koh","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sungwon Yoon","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Andrew Fu Wah Ho","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Daniel Shu Wei Ting","author_inst":"Singapore National Eye Centre"},{"author_name":"Jenny Guek Hong Low","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Marcus Eng Hock Ong","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Andre Luiz de Abreu","author_inst":"Coordenacao Geral dos Laboratorios de Saude Publica\/Secretaria de Vigilancia em Saude, Ministerio da Saude, (CGLAB\/SVS-MS) Brasilia, Distrito Federal, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Vasco de Azevedo","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Genetica Celular e Molecular, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Dario Brock Ramalho","author_inst":"Secretaria de Estado de Saude de Minas Gerais; Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Carlos F.

In anticipation of subsequent waves, reliable prediction of disease severity is essential for critical care capacity management and may enable earlier targeted interventions to improve patient outcomes. The purpose of this study is to develop and externally validate a prognostic model\/clinical tool for predicting COVID-19 critical disease at presentation to medical care. Methods: This is a retrospective study of a prognostic model for the prediction of COVID-19 critical disease where critical disease was defined as ICU admission, ventilation, and\/or death. The derivation cohort was used to develop a multivariable logistic regression model. Covariates included patient comorbidities, presenting vital signs, and laboratory values. Model performance was assessed on the validation cohort by concordance statistics. The model was developed with consecutive patients with COVID-19 who presented to University of California Irvine Medical Center in Orange County, California. External validation was performed with a random sample of patients with COVID-19 at Emory Healthcare in Atlanta, Georgia. Results: Of a total 3208 patients tested in the derivation cohort, 9% (299\/3028) were positive for COVID-19. Clinical data including past medical history and presenting laboratory values were available for 29% (87\/299) of patients (median age, 48 years [range, 21-88 years]; 64% [36\/55] male). The most common comorbidities included obesity (37%, 31\/87), hypertension (37%, 32\/87), and diabetes (24%, 24\/87). Critical disease was present in 24% (21\/87). After backward stepwise selection, the following factors were associated with greatest increased risk of critical disease: number of comorbidities, body mass index, respiratory rate, white blood cell count, % lymphocytes, serum creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, high sensitivity troponin I, ferritin, procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein. Of a total of 40 patients in the validation cohort (median age, 60 years [range, 27-88 years]; 55% [22\/40] male), critical disease was present in 65% (26\/40). Model discrimination in the validation cohort was high (concordance statistic: 0.94, 95% confidence interval 0.87-1.01). A web-based tool was developed to enable clinicians to input patient data and view likelihood of critical disease. Conclusions and Relevance: We present a model which accurately predicted COVID-19 critical disease risk using comorbidities and presenting vital signs and laboratory values, on derivation and validation cohorts from two different institutions. If further validated on additional cohorts of patients, this model\/clinical tool may provide useful prognostication of critical care needs.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel S Chow","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Justin Glabis-Bloom","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Soun","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Brent Weinberg","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Theresa Berens-Loveless","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Xiaohui Xie","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Simukayi Mutasa","author_inst":"Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Edwin Monuki","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Jung In Park","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Daniela Bota","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Jie Wu","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Leslie Thompson","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Bernadette Boden-Albala","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Saahir Khan","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Alpesh Amin","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Peter Chang","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Jenny Guek Hong Low","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Marcus Eng Hock Ong","author_inst":"Duke-NUS Medical School"},{"author_name":"Andre Luiz de Abreu","author_inst":"Coordenacao Geral dos Laboratorios de Saude Publica\/Secretaria de Vigilancia em Saude, Ministerio da Saude, (CGLAB\/SVS-MS) Brasilia, Distrito Federal, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Vasco de Azevedo","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Genetica Celular e Molecular, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Dario Brock Ramalho","author_inst":"Secretaria de Estado de Saude de Minas Gerais; Belo Horizonte, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Carlos F.

For countries that have implemented restrictions on its population in a step-wise manner, monitoring of COVID-19 prevalence is of importance to guide decision on when to impose new, or when to abolish old, restrictions. We are here determining whether measures of odor intensity in a large sample can serve as one such measure. Online measures of how intense common household odors are perceived and symptoms of COVID-19 were collected from 2440 Swedes. Average odor intensity ratings were then compared to predicted COVID-19 population prevalence over time in the Swedish population and were found to closely track each other (r=-0.83). Moreover, we found that there was a large difference in rated intensity between individuals with and without COVID-19 symptoms and number of symptoms was related to odor intensity ratings. Finally, we found that individuals progressing from reporting no symptoms to subsequently reporting COVID-19 symptoms demonstrated a large drop in olfactory performance. These data suggest that measures of odor intensity, if obtained in a large and representative sample, can be used as an indicator of COVID-19 disease in the general population. Importantly, this simple measure could easily be implemented in countries without widespread access to COVID-19 testing or implemented as a fast early response before wide-spread testing can be facilitated.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Behzad Iravani","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Artin Arshamian","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Ahron Ravia","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Eva Mishor","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Kobi Snitz","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Sagit Shushan","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Edith Wolfson Medical Center, Holon, Israel"},{"author_name":"Yehudah Roth","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Edith Wolfson Medical Center, Holon, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ofer Perl","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Danielle Honigstein","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Reut Weissgross","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Shiri Karagach","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Gernot Ernst","author_inst":"Vestre Viken, Kongsberg hospital and Psychological institute, University in Oslo, Norway"},{"author_name":"Masako Okamoto","author_inst":"Department of Applied Biological Chemistry, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Zachary Mainen","author_inst":"Champalimaud Research, Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown, Lisbon, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Erminio Monteleone","author_inst":"Department of Agriculture, Food, Environment and Forestry, University of Florence, Italy"},{"author_name":"Caterina Dinnella","author_inst":"Department of Agriculture, Food, Environment and Forestry, University of Florence, Italy"},{"author_name":"Sara Spinelli","author_inst":"Department of Agriculture, Food, Environment and Forestry, University of Florence, Italy"},{"author_name":"Franklin Marino-Sanchez","author_inst":"Rhinology and Skull Base Surgery Unit.

Using this proposed index (snr), it was possible to carry out a data-driven comparison among different countries in their efforts of dealing with the crisis. The primary focus of this study was to assess the interventions' effectiveness by the decision makers along with the health system's efficiency of the countries that experienced a relatively high pressure on their systems. In this study, 19 countries were selected based on predefined criteria that included: (1) reported confirmed cases should exceed 5,000, and (2) confirmed cases per 1 million people should exceed 200, at the time this study was concluded. According to the proposed, snr index, the findings showed that Germany and South Korea were ahead of the game, compared to other countries such as the USA, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, and UK. Some other countries, such as Canada, Austria, Switzerland managed to slightly pivot their interventions at a later stage in effective manners according to the snr index. The study explains the foundation, and the underlying calculations of the proposed, snr index. Moreover, the study shows how reliably the snr index measures the interventions' effectiveness and health system's efficiency during the crisis or during any health-related crisis. An additional, yet interesting finding from this study, was that the snr curve showed a persistent four-episode (segment) structure during the pandemic. This finding could suggest a benchmark of the expected pattern of the fight against the virus spread during the pandemic that could offer a significant tool, for the decision makers. Finally, it is worth mentioning that the implementation of this proposed index is only valid and meaningful during a crisis. In a none-crisis time, the required data to calculate the snr index is not available and rather mathematically misleading.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Khaled Wahba","author_inst":"Algoma university"},{"author_name":"Artin Arshamian","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Ahron Ravia","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Eva Mishor","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Kobi Snitz","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Sagit Shushan","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Edith Wolfson Medical Center, Holon, Israel"},{"author_name":"Yehudah Roth","author_inst":"Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Edith Wolfson Medical Center, Holon, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ofer Perl","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Danielle Honigstein","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Reut Weissgross","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Shiri Karagach","author_inst":"Department of Neurobiology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Gernot Ernst","author_inst":"Vestre Viken, Kongsberg hospital and Psychological institute, University in Oslo, Norway"},{"author_name":"Masako Okamoto","author_inst":"Department of Applied Biological Chemistry, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Japan"},{"author_name":"Zachary Mainen","author_inst":"Champalimaud Research, Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown, Lisbon, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Erminio Monteleone","author_inst":"Department of Agriculture, Food, Environment and Forestry, University of Florence, Italy"},{"author_name":"Caterina Dinnella","author_inst":"Department of Agriculture, Food, Environment and Forestry, University of Florence, Italy"},{"author_name":"Sara Spinelli","author_inst":"Department of Agriculture, Food, Environment and Forestry, University of Florence, Italy"},{"author_name":"Franklin Marino-Sanchez","author_inst":"Rhinology and Skull Base Surgery Unit.

And its viewing numbers tend to increase exponentially in extraordinary situations. Our aim in this study was to evaluate the contents of the most frequently viewed YouTube videos during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: In this study, contents of the most frequently viewed Turkish and English videos regarding COVID-19 pandemics are examined and scored with modified DISCERN, MICI and VPI. Results: The mean DISCERN score of Turkish videos is similar to English videos (2.55 and 2.43 respectively). Total MICI score tends to be higher in Turkish videos. 86.9% of all 168 videos and 65.2% of all 23 misleading videos were released by news channels. Average view counts, view ratios, and VPIs of misleading videos are higher than the useful videos. Conclusions: Since there is not a peer-review system on YouTube, it is very important for the content of videos that are released through news channels to be accurate because the important messages can be spread among people in society through them.

Methods: From 16th to 24th March 2020, 241 consecutive patients addressed to hospital for COVID-19 suspicion had both chest CT and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. Eight observers (2 thoracic and 2 general senior radiologists, 2 junior radiologists and 2 emergency physicians) retrospectively categorized each CT into one out of 3 categories (evocative, compatible for COVID-19 pneumonia, and not evocative or normal). Observer agreement for categorization between all readers and pairs of readers with similar experience was evaluated with the Kappa coefficient. The results of a consensus categorization were correlated to RT-PCR. Results: Observer agreement across the 3 categories was good between all readers (kappa value 0.68 95%CI 0.67-0.70) and good to very good between pairs of readers (0.64-0.85). It was very good (0.81 95%CI 0.79-0.83), fair (0.32 95%CI 0.29-0.34) and good (0.74 95%CI 0.71-0.76) for the categories evocative, compatible and not evocative or normal, respectively. RT-PCR was positive in 97%, 50% and 27% of cases classified in the respective categories. Observer agreement was lower (p=0.045) and RT-PCR positive cases were less frequently categorized evocative in presence of an underlying pulmonary disease (p<0.001). Conclusion: Inter-observer agreement for chest CT reporting using categorization of findings is good in patients suspected of COVID-19. Among patients considered for hospitalization in an epidemic context, CT categorized evocative is highly predictive of COVID-19, whereas the predictive value of CT decreases between the categories compatible and not evocative.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marie-Pierre Debray","author_inst":"APHP, Hopital Bichat, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Helena Tarabay","author_inst":"APHP, Hopital Bichat, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Lisa Males","author_inst":"APHP, Hopital Bichat, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Nisrine Chalhoub","author_inst":"APHP, Hopital Bichat, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Elyas Mahdjoub","author_inst":"APHP, Hopital Bichat, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Thomas Pavlovsky","author_inst":"APHP, Hopital Bichat, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Benoit Visseaux","author_inst":"APHP, Hopital Bichat, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Donia Bouzid","author_inst":"APHP, Hopital Bichat, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Raphael Borie","author_inst":"APHP, Hopital Bichat, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Catherine Wackenheim","author_inst":"APHP, Hopital Bichat, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Bruno Crestani","author_inst":"APHP, Hopital Bichat, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Christophe Rioux","author_inst":"APHP, Hopital Bichat, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Loukbi Saker","author_inst":"APHP, Hopital Bichat, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Christophe Choquet","author_inst":"APHP, Hopital Bichat, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Jimmy Mullaert","author_inst":"APHP, Hopital Bichat, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Antoine Khalil","author_inst":"APHP, Hopital Bichat, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Sara Spinelli","author_inst":"Department of Agriculture, Food, Environment and Forestry, University of Florence, Italy"},{"author_name":"Franklin Marino-Sanchez","author_inst":"Rhinology and Skull Base Surgery Unit.

Design Cross-sectional study via an online survey disseminated through professional networks and social media in 12 languages. We analysed responses using descriptive statistics and qualitative thematic analysis disaggregating by low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and high-income countries (HICs). Setting 81 countries, between March 24 and April 10, 2020. Participants 714 maternal and newborn healthcare providers. Main outcome measures Preparedness for and response to COVID-19, experiences of health workers providing care to women and newborns, and adaptations to 17 outpatient and inpatient care processes during the pandemic. Results Only one third of respondents received training on COVID-19 from their health facility and nearly all searched for information themselves. Half of respondents in LMICs received updated guidelines for care provision compared with 82% in HICs. Overall, only 47% of participants in LMICs, and 69% in HICs felt mostly or completely knowledgeable in how to care for COVID-19 maternity patients. Facility-level responses to COVID-19 (signage, screening, testing, and isolation rooms) were more common in HICs than LMICs. Globally, 90% of respondents reported somewhat or substantially higher levels of stress. There was a widespread perception of reduced use of routine maternity care services, and of modification in care processes, some of which were not evidence-based. Conclusions Substantial knowledge gaps exist in guidance on management of maternity cases with or without COVID-19. Formal information sharing channels for providers must be established and mental health support provided. Surveys of maternity care providers can help track the situation, capture innovations, and support rapid development of effective responses.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aline T Semaan","author_inst":"Department of Public Health, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp Belgium and Center for Research on Population and Health, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ameri"},{"author_name":"Constance Audet","author_inst":"Department of Public Health, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp Belgium"},{"author_name":"Elise Huysmans","author_inst":"Department of Public Health, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp Belgium"},{"author_name":"Bosede B Afolabi","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, College of Medicine, University of Lagos, Lagos, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Bouchra Assarag","author_inst":"National School of Public Health, Ministry of Health, Morocco"},{"author_name":"Aduragbemi Banke-Thomas","author_inst":"LSE Health, London School of Economics and Political Sciences, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Hannah Blencowe","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Severine Caluwaerts","author_inst":"Department of Public Health, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp Belgium"},{"author_name":"Oona M R Campbell","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Francesca L Cavallaro","author_inst":"Institute of Child Health, University College London, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Chavane","author_inst":"Department of Community Health, Faculty of Medicine, Eduardo Mondlane University, Maputo, Mozambique"},{"author_name":"Louise Tina Day","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Delamou","author_inst":"Africa Centre of Excellence for Prevention and Control of Transmissible Diseases (CEA-PCMT), University Gamal Abdel Nasser, Conakry, Guinea"},{"author_name":"Therese Delvaux","author_inst":"Department of Public Health, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp Belgium"},{"author_name":"Wendy Graham","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Giorgia Gon","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Peter Kascak","author_inst":"Trencin University Hospital, Trencin Slovakia"},{"author_name":"Mitsuaki Matsui","author_inst":"Department of Global Health, Nagasaki University School of Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nagasaki, Japan"},{"author_name":"Sarah G Moxon","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Annettee Nakimuli","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Makerere University and Mulago Specialized Women and Neonatal Hospital, Kampala Uganda"},{"author_name":"Andrea B Pembe","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences, Dar es Salaam Tanzania"},{"author_name":"Emma Radovich","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Thomas van den Akker","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Leiden University Medical Centre and Athena Institute, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Lenka Benova","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Johan N Lundstrom","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Luiz Carlos Junior Alcantara","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Foundation"},{"author_name":"Marluce Aparecida Assuncao Oliveira","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"sexual and reproductive health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20094409","rel_title":"APOE E4 GENOTYPE PREDICTS SEVERE COVID-19 IN THE UK BIOBANK COMMUNITY COHORT","rel_date":"2020-05-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20094409","rel_abs":"The novel respiratory disease COVID-19 produces varying symptoms, with fever, cough, and shortness of breath being common.

Results: We established a machine learning approach that trained on records from 51,831 tested individuals (of whom 4,769 were confirmed COVID-19 cases) while the test set contained data from the following week (47,401 tested individuals of whom 3,624 were confirmed COVID-19 cases). Our model predicts COVID-19 test results with high accuracy using only eight features: gender, whether age is above 60, known contact with an infected individual, and five initial clinical symptoms. Summary: Overall, based on the nationwide data publicly reported by the Israeli Ministry of Health, we developed a model that detects COVID-19 cases by simple features accessed by asking basic questions.

As new symptoms are being discovered for COVID-19 and the pandemic continues to spread around the globe, the lesson learned here, that correlation between public interest in novel symptoms of infectious disease has an initial spike (the ''surprise rise'') and subsequently goes to a new baseline due to ''knowledge saturation'', is of general and practical value for the public.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kim Asseo","author_inst":"The Hebrew University of Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Fabrizio Fierro","author_inst":"The Hebrew University of Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Yuli Slavutsky","author_inst":"The Hebrew University of Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Johannes Frasnelli","author_inst":"University of Quebec in Trois-Rivieres"},{"author_name":"Masha Y Niv","author_inst":"The Hebrew University of Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"George A Kuchel","author_inst":"University of Connecticut Health"},{"author_name":"David Melzer","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Severine Caluwaerts","author_inst":"Department of Public Health, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp Belgium"},{"author_name":"Oona M R Campbell","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Francesca L Cavallaro","author_inst":"Institute of Child Health, University College London, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Chavane","author_inst":"Department of Community Health, Faculty of Medicine, Eduardo Mondlane University, Maputo, Mozambique"},{"author_name":"Louise Tina Day","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Delamou","author_inst":"Africa Centre of Excellence for Prevention and Control of Transmissible Diseases (CEA-PCMT), University Gamal Abdel Nasser, Conakry, Guinea"},{"author_name":"Therese Delvaux","author_inst":"Department of Public Health, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp Belgium"},{"author_name":"Wendy Graham","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Giorgia Gon","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Peter Kascak","author_inst":"Trencin University Hospital, Trencin Slovakia"},{"author_name":"Mitsuaki Matsui","author_inst":"Department of Global Health, Nagasaki University School of Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nagasaki, Japan"},{"author_name":"Sarah G Moxon","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Annettee Nakimuli","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Makerere University and Mulago Specialized Women and Neonatal Hospital, Kampala Uganda"},{"author_name":"Andrea B Pembe","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences, Dar es Salaam Tanzania"},{"author_name":"Emma Radovich","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Thomas van den Akker","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Leiden University Medical Centre and Athena Institute, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Lenka Benova","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Johan N Lundstrom","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Luiz Carlos Junior Alcantara","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Foundation"},{"author_name":"Marluce Aparecida Assuncao Oliveira","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20094607","rel_title":"Early Mandated Social Distancing is a Strong Predictor of Reduction in Highest Number of New COVID-19 cases per Day within Various Geographic Regions","rel_date":"2020-05-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20094607","rel_abs":"Mandated social distancing has been globally applied to limit the spread of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from highly pathogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) -associated coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The benefit of this community-based intervention in limiting COVID-19 has not been proven nor quantified. We examined the effect of timing of mandated social distancing on the rate of COVID-19 in 119 geographic regions derived from 41 states within United States and 78 countries. We found that highest number of new COVID-19 cases per day per million persons was significantly associated with total number of COVID-19 cases per million persons on the day before mandated social distancing (Beta;=0.66, p<0.0001). Our findings suggest that the initiation of mandated social distancing for each doubling in number of existing COVID-19 cases would result in eventual peak with 58% higher number of COVID-19 infections per day. Subgroup analysis on those regions where the highest number of new COVID-19 cases per day have peaked increased Beta to .85 (p<0.0001). We demonstrate that initiating mandated social distancing at a 10 times smaller number of COVID-19 cases will reduce the number of daily new COVID-19 cases at peak by 80% highlighting the importance of this community-based intervention.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"M.

Current human deaths due to the infection have raised the threat globally with only 1 African country free of Virus (Lesotho) as of May 6th, 2020. Different countries have adopted different interventions at different stages of the outbreak, with social distancing being the first option while lock down the preferred option for flattening the curve at the peak of the pandemic. Lock down is aimed at adherence to social distancing, preserve the health system and improve survival. We propose a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Expected recoveries (SEIR) mathematical model to study the impact of a variety of prevention and control strategies Uganda has applied since the eruption of the pandemic in the country. We analyze the model using available data to find the infection-free, endemic\/infection steady states and the basic reproduction number. In addition, a sensitivity analysis done shows that the transmission rate and the rate at which persons acquire the virus, have a positive influence on the basic reproduction number. On other hand the rate of evacuation by rescue ambulance greatly reduces the reproduction number. The results have potential to inform the impact and effect of early strict interventions including lock down in resource limited settings and social distancing","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fulgensia Kamugisha Mbabazi","author_inst":"Busitema University, Tororo, Uganda and Uganda Martyrs University, Uganda"},{"author_name":"Gavamukulya Yahaya","author_inst":"Busitema University"},{"author_name":"Richard Awichi","author_inst":"Busitema University"},{"author_name":"Peter Olupot Olupot","author_inst":"Busitema University"},{"author_name":"Samson Rwahwire","author_inst":"Busitema University"},{"author_name":"Saphina Biira","author_inst":"Busitema University"},{"author_name":"Livingstone Serwadda Luboobi","author_inst":"Strathmore University"},{"author_name":"Severine Caluwaerts","author_inst":"Department of Public Health, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp Belgium"},{"author_name":"Oona M R Campbell","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Francesca L Cavallaro","author_inst":"Institute of Child Health, University College London, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Chavane","author_inst":"Department of Community Health, Faculty of Medicine, Eduardo Mondlane University, Maputo, Mozambique"},{"author_name":"Louise Tina Day","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Delamou","author_inst":"Africa Centre of Excellence for Prevention and Control of Transmissible Diseases (CEA-PCMT), University Gamal Abdel Nasser, Conakry, Guinea"},{"author_name":"Therese Delvaux","author_inst":"Department of Public Health, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp Belgium"},{"author_name":"Wendy Graham","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Giorgia Gon","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Peter Kascak","author_inst":"Trencin University Hospital, Trencin Slovakia"},{"author_name":"Mitsuaki Matsui","author_inst":"Department of Global Health, Nagasaki University School of Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nagasaki, Japan"},{"author_name":"Sarah G Moxon","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Annettee Nakimuli","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Makerere University and Mulago Specialized Women and Neonatal Hospital, Kampala Uganda"},{"author_name":"Andrea B Pembe","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences, Dar es Salaam Tanzania"},{"author_name":"Emma Radovich","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Thomas van den Akker","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Leiden University Medical Centre and Athena Institute, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Lenka Benova","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Johan N Lundstrom","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Luiz Carlos Junior Alcantara","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Foundation"},{"author_name":"Marluce Aparecida Assuncao Oliveira","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20094177","rel_title":"Clinical and behavioural characteristics of self-isolating healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: a single-centre observational study","rel_date":"2020-05-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20094177","rel_abs":"Objectives:To describe a cohort of self-isolating healthcare workers (HCWs) with presumed COVID-19. Design: A cross-sectional, single-centre study. Setting: A large, teaching hospital based in Central London with tertiary infection services. Participants: 236 HCWs completed a survey distributed by internal staff email bulletin. 167 were female and 65 male. Measures: Information on symptomatology, exposures and health-seeking behaviour were collected from participants by self-report. Results: The 236 respondents reported illness compatible with COVID-19 and there was an increase in illness reporting during March 2020. Diagnostic swabs were not routinely performed. Cough (n=179, 75.8%), fever (n=138, 58.5%), breathlessness (n=84, 35.6%) were reported. Anosmia was reported in 42.2%. Fever generally settled within 1 week (n=110, 88%). Several respondents remained at home and did not seek formal medical attention despite reporting severe breathlessness and measuring hypoxia (n=5\/9, 55.6%). 2 patients required hospital admission but recovered following oxygen therapy. 84 respondents (41.2%) required greater than the obligated 7 days off work and 9 required greater than 3 weeks off. Conclusion: There was a significant increase in staff reporting illness compatible with possible COVID-19 during March 2020. Conclusions cannot be drawn about exact numbers of confirmed cases due to lack of diagnostic swabbing. There were significant numbers of respondents reporting anosmia; as well as early non-specific illness prior to onset of cough and fever. This may represent pre-symptomatic HCWs who are likely to be infectious and thus criteria for isolation and swabbing should be broadened. The study also revealed concerning lack of healthcare seeking in respondents with significant red flag symptoms (severe breathlessness, hypoxia). This should be addressed urgently to reduce risk of severe disease being detected late. Finally, this study should inform trusts that HCWs may require longer than 7 days off work to recover from illness.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Angus de Wilton","author_inst":"COVID-19 Response Team, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; Hospital of Tropical Diseases, London"},{"author_name":"Eliz Kilich","author_inst":"COVID-19 Response Team, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; Hospital of Tropical Diseases, London"},{"author_name":"Zain Chaudhry","author_inst":"COVID-19 Response Team, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; Hospital of Tropical Diseases, London"},{"author_name":"Lucy CK Bell","author_inst":"COVID-19 Response Team, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; Hospital of Tropical Diseases, London"},{"author_name":"Joshua Gahir","author_inst":"COVID-19 Response Team, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; Hospital of Tropical Diseases, London"},{"author_name":"Jane Cadman","author_inst":"COVID-19 Response Team, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Robert A Lever","author_inst":"Hospital of Tropical Diseases, London; University College London"},{"author_name":"Sarah Logan","author_inst":"Hospital of Tropical Diseases, London; COVID-19 Response Team, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust;"},{"author_name":"Oona M R Campbell","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Francesca L Cavallaro","author_inst":"Institute of Child Health, University College London, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Chavane","author_inst":"Department of Community Health, Faculty of Medicine, Eduardo Mondlane University, Maputo, Mozambique"},{"author_name":"Louise Tina Day","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Delamou","author_inst":"Africa Centre of Excellence for Prevention and Control of Transmissible Diseases (CEA-PCMT), University Gamal Abdel Nasser, Conakry, Guinea"},{"author_name":"Therese Delvaux","author_inst":"Department of Public Health, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp Belgium"},{"author_name":"Wendy Graham","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Giorgia Gon","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Peter Kascak","author_inst":"Trencin University Hospital, Trencin Slovakia"},{"author_name":"Mitsuaki Matsui","author_inst":"Department of Global Health, Nagasaki University School of Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nagasaki, Japan"},{"author_name":"Sarah G Moxon","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Annettee Nakimuli","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Makerere University and Mulago Specialized Women and Neonatal Hospital, Kampala Uganda"},{"author_name":"Andrea B Pembe","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences, Dar es Salaam Tanzania"},{"author_name":"Emma Radovich","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Thomas van den Akker","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Leiden University Medical Centre and Athena Institute, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Lenka Benova","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Johan N Lundstrom","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Luiz Carlos Junior Alcantara","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Foundation"},{"author_name":"Marluce Aparecida Assuncao Oliveira","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.07.20094276","rel_title":"Characteristics of 1,573 healthcare workers who underwent nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 in Milano, Lombardy, Italy","rel_date":"2020-05-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.07.20094276","rel_abs":"Background The management of healthcare workers (HCWs) exposed to confirmed cases of COVID-19 is still a matter of debate. It is unclear whether these subjects should be tested in the absence of symptoms and if those can guide diagnosis. Methods Occupational and clinical characteristics of all the consecutive HCWs who performed a nasopharyngeal swab for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in a University Hospital from February 24, 2020, to March 31, 2020, were collected. Frequencies of positive tests were compared according to selected variables. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were then applied. Findings Positive tests were 138 among 1,573 HCWs (8.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.4-10.3), with a marked difference between symptomatic (20.2%, 95%CI: 16.7-24.1) and asymptomatic (3.7%, 95%CI: 2.7-5.1) subjects (p<0.001). Physicians were the group with the highest frequency of positive tests (10.6%, 95%CI: 8.3-13.4) whereas clerical workers and technicians displayed the lowest frequency (2.9%, 95%CI: 0.8-7.3). The likelihood of being positive increased with the number of reported symptoms and the strongest predictors of a positive test were taste and smell alterations (odds ratio [OR]= 29.7) and fever (OR = 7.21). The median time from first positive test to a negative test was 23 days (95%CI: 19-24). Interpretation In this Italian group of HCWs exposed to confirmed cases of COVID-19 the presence of symptoms, especially taste and smell alterations and fever, was associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The median time to clear the virus from nasopharynx was 23 days.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"ANDREA LOMBARDI","author_inst":"IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Foundation"},{"author_name":"Dario Consonni","author_inst":"IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Foundation"},{"author_name":"Michele Carugno","author_inst":"IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Foundation"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Bozzi","author_inst":"IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Foundation"},{"author_name":"Davide Mangioni","author_inst":"IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Foundation"},{"author_name":"Antonio Muscatello","author_inst":"IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Foundation"},{"author_name":"Valeria Castelli","author_inst":"IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Foundation"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Palomba","author_inst":"IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Foundation"},{"author_name":"Anna Paola Cantu'","author_inst":"IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Foundation"},{"author_name":"Ferruccio Ceriotti","author_inst":"IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Foundation"},{"author_name":"Basilio Tiso","author_inst":"IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Foundation"},{"author_name":"Angela Cecilia Pesatori","author_inst":"IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Foundation"},{"author_name":"Luciano Riboldi","author_inst":"IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Foundation"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Bandera","author_inst":"IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Foundation"},{"author_name":"Andrea Gori","author_inst":"IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Foundation"},{"author_name":"Giorgia Gon","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Peter Kascak","author_inst":"Trencin University Hospital, Trencin Slovakia"},{"author_name":"Mitsuaki Matsui","author_inst":"Department of Global Health, Nagasaki University School of Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nagasaki, Japan"},{"author_name":"Sarah G Moxon","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Annettee Nakimuli","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Makerere University and Mulago Specialized Women and Neonatal Hospital, Kampala Uganda"},{"author_name":"Andrea B Pembe","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences, Dar es Salaam Tanzania"},{"author_name":"Emma Radovich","author_inst":"Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Thomas van den Akker","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Leiden University Medical Centre and Athena Institute, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Lenka Benova","author_inst":"Institute of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Johan N Lundstrom","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Luiz Carlos Junior Alcantara","author_inst":"Oswaldo Cruz Foundation"},{"author_name":"Marluce Aparecida Assuncao Oliveira","author_inst":"Laboratorio Central de Saude Publica, Fundacao Ezequiel Dias, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"}]}
