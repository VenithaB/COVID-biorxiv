Although vaccines against the virus are under development, the antigen epitopes on the virus and their immunogenicity are poorly understood. Here, we simulated the three-dimensional structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins with high performance computer, predicted the B cell epitopes on spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 using structure-based approaches, and then validated the epitope immunogenicity by immunizing mice. Almost all 33 predicted epitopes effectively induced antibody production, six of which were immunodominant epitopes in patients identified via the binding of epitopes with the sera from domestic and imported COVID-19 patients, and 23 were conserved within SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and bat coronavirus RaTG13. We also found that the immunodominant epitopes of domestic SARS-CoV-2 were different from that of the imported, which may be caused by the mutations on S (G614D) and N proteins. Importantly, we validated that eight epitopes on S protein elicited neutralizing antibodies that blocked the cell entry of both D614 and G614 pseudo-virus of SARS-CoV-2, three and nine epitopes induced D614 or G614 neutralizing antibodies, respectively. Our present study shed light on the immunodominance, neutralization, and conserved epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 which are potently used for the diagnosis, virus classification and the vaccine design tackling inefficiency, virus mutation and different species of coronaviruses.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shuai Lu","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xi-xiu Xie","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Lei Zhao","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Bin Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jie Zhu","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ting-rui Yang","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Guang-wen Yang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Mei Ji","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Cui-ping Lv","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jian Xue","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Er-hei Dai","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Xi-ming Fu","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Dong-qun Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Lun Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sheng-jie Hou","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiao-lin Yu","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yu-ling Wang","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Hui-xia Gao","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Xue-han Shi","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Chang-wen Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Bi-xia Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chun-guo Jiang","author_inst":"Beijing Chaoyang Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rui-tian Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.26.269159","rel_title":"Rethinking Remdesivir: Synthesis of Lipid Prodrugs that Substantially Enhance Anti-Coronavirus Activity","rel_date":"2020-08-27","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.26.269159","rel_abs":"The FDA has granted Remdesivir (RDV, GS-5734) an emergency use authorization on the basis of an acceleration of clinical recovery in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

A potent orally bioavailable antiviral for early treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection is needed. We focused on making simple orally bioavailable lipid analogs of Remdesivir nucleoside (RVn, GS-441524) that are processed to RVn-monophosphate, the precursor of the active RVn-triphosphate, by a single step intracellular cleavage.

Since there is no therapy available that is proven as fully protective against COVID-19, a vaccine to protect against deadly COVID-19 is urgently needed. Nucleocapsid protein (N protein), is one of the most abundant proteins in coronaviruses and is a potential target for both vaccine development and point of care diagnostics. The variable mass of N protein (45 to 60 kDa), suggests the presence of post-translational modifications (PTMs), and it is critical to clearly define these PTMs to gain the structural understanding necessary for further vaccine research. There have been several reports suggesting that the N protein is phosphorylated but lacks glycosylation. Our comprehensive glycomics and glycoproteomics experiments confirm that the N protein is highly O-glycosylated and also contains significant levels of N-glycosylation. We were able to confirm the presence of O-glycans on seven sites with substantial glycan occupancy, in addition to less abundant O-glycans on four sites. We also detected N-glycans on two out of five potential N-glycosylation sites. Moreover, we were able to confirm one phosphorylation site. Recent studies have indicated that the N protein can serve as an important diagnostic marker for coronavirus disease and a major immunogen by priming protective immune responses. Thus, detailed structural characterization of the N protein may provide useful insights for understanding the roles of glycosylation on viral pathogenesis and also in vaccine design and development.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nitin T Supekar","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, The University of Georgia,"},{"author_name":"Asif Shajahan","author_inst":"University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Anne Gleinich","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, The University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602"},{"author_name":"Daniel Rouhani","author_inst":"The University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602"},{"author_name":"Christian Heiss","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, The University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602"},{"author_name":"Parastoo Azadi","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, The University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602"},{"author_name":"Peter van Run","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Geert van Amerongen","author_inst":"Viroclinics"},{"author_name":"Leon de Waal","author_inst":"Viroclinics"},{"author_name":"Marion Koopmans","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Koert J Stittelaar","author_inst":"Viroclinics"},{"author_name":"Judith van den Brand","author_inst":"Utrecht University"},{"author_name":"Bart L Haagmans","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Lun Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sheng-jie Hou","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiao-lin Yu","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yu-ling Wang","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Hui-xia Gao","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Xue-han Shi","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Chang-wen Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Bi-xia Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chun-guo Jiang","author_inst":"Beijing Chaoyang Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rui-tian Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.27.269456","rel_title":"Designing of Epitope-Based Vaccine from the Conserved Region of the Spike Glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-08-27","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.27.269456","rel_abs":"The emergence of COVID-19 as a pandemic with a high morbidity rate is posing serious global concern. There is an urgent need to design a suitable therapy or vaccine that could fight against SARS-CoV-2 infection. As spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 plays a crucial role in receptor binding and membrane fusion inside the host, it could be a suitable target for designing of an epitope-based vaccine. SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus and thus has a property to mutate. So, a conserved peptide region of spike glycoprotein was used for predicting suitable B cell and T cell epitopes. 4 T cell epitopes were selected based on stability, antigenicity, allergenicity and toxicity. Further, MHC-I were found from the immune database that could best interact with the selected epitopes. Population coverage analysis was also done to check the presence of identified MHC-I, in the human population of the affected countries. The T cell epitope that binds with the respective MHC-I with highest affinity was chosen. Molecular dynamic simulation results show that the epitope is well selected. This is an in-silico based study that predicts a novel T cell epitope from the conserved spike glycoprotein that could act as a target for designing of the epitope-based vaccine. Further, B cell epitopes have also been found but the main work focuses on T cell epitope as the immunity generated by it is long lasting as compared to B cell epitope.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vidhu Agarwal","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad"},{"author_name":"Akhilesh Tiwari","author_inst":"Indian Insitute of Information Technology, Allahabad"},{"author_name":"Pritish Kumar Varadwaj","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Information Technology Allahabad"},{"author_name":"Daniel Rouhani","author_inst":"The University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602"},{"author_name":"Christian Heiss","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, The University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602"},{"author_name":"Parastoo Azadi","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, The University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602"},{"author_name":"Peter van Run","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Geert van Amerongen","author_inst":"Viroclinics"},{"author_name":"Leon de Waal","author_inst":"Viroclinics"},{"author_name":"Marion Koopmans","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Koert J Stittelaar","author_inst":"Viroclinics"},{"author_name":"Judith van den Brand","author_inst":"Utrecht University"},{"author_name":"Bart L Haagmans","author_inst":"Erasmus Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Lun Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sheng-jie Hou","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiao-lin Yu","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yu-ling Wang","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Hui-xia Gao","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Xue-han Shi","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Chang-wen Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Bi-xia Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chun-guo Jiang","author_inst":"Beijing Chaoyang Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rui-tian Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.24.20181123","rel_title":"The Coronavirus Health and Impact Survey (CRISIS) reveals reproducible correlates of pandemic-related mood states across the Atlantic.","rel_date":"2020-08-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.24.20181123","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic and its social and economic consequences have had adverse impacts on physical and mental health worldwide and exposed all segments of the population to protracted uncertainty and daily disruptions.

The structure reveals a ~60 residue core similar to SARS-CoV ORF7a with the addition of two dimerization interfaces unique to SARS-CoV-2 ORF8. A covalent disulfide-linked dimer is formed through an N-terminal sequence specific to SARS-CoV-2, while a separate non-covalent interface is formed by another SARS-CoV-2-specific sequence, 73YIDI76.

Here, we describe an analysis procedure where genome composition and its variables are related, through the genetic code, to molecular mechanisms based on understanding of RNA replication and its feedback loop from mutation to viral proteome sequence fraternity including effective sites on replicase-transcriptase complex. Our analysis starts with primary sequence information and identity-based phylogeny based on 22,051 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and evaluation of sequence variation patterns as mutation spectrum and its 12 permutations among organized clades tailored to two key mechanisms: strand-biased and function-associated mutations. Our findings include: (1) The most dominant mutation is C-to-U permutation whose abundant second-codon-position counts alter amino acid composition toward higher molecular weight and lower hydrophobicity albeit assumed most slightly deleterious. (2) The second abundance group includes: three negative-strand mutations U-to-C, A-to-G, G-to-A and a positive-strand mutation G-to-U generated through an identical mechanism as C-to-U. (3) A clade-associated and biased mutation trend is found attributable to elevated level of the negative-sense strand synthesis. (4) Within-clade permutation variation is very informative for associating non-synonymous mutations and viral proteome changes. These findings demand a bioinformatics platform where emerging mutations are mapped on to mostly subtle but fast-adjusting viral proteomes and transcriptomes to provide biological and clinical information after logical convergence for effective pharmaceutical and diagnostic applications. Such thoughts and actions are in desperate need, especially in the middle of the War against COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xufei Teng","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Qianpeng Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zhao Li","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yuansheng Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Guangyi Niu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jingfa Xiao","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jun Yu","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Zhang Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Shuhui Song","author_inst":"Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Evelyn Bromet","author_inst":"Stony Brook University"},{"author_name":"Michael P Milham","author_inst":"Child Mind Institute"},{"author_name":"Argyris Stringaris","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health"},{"author_name":"Kathleen R Merikangas","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health"},{"author_name":"Lun Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sheng-jie Hou","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiao-lin Yu","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yu-ling Wang","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Hui-xia Gao","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Xue-han Shi","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Chang-wen Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Bi-xia Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chun-guo Jiang","author_inst":"Beijing Chaoyang Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rui-tian Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.27.269738","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.6 is the major contributor to transmission in Malaysia","rel_date":"2020-08-27","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.27.269738","rel_abs":"BackgroundAs of June 30, 2020, Malaysia had confirmed 8,639 cases of COVID-19. About 39% of these were associated with a religious mass gathering event held in Kuala Lumpur between February 27 and March 1, 2020, which drove community transmission during Malaysias main wave. We analysed genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from Malaysia to understand the molecular epidemiology.\n\nMethodsWe obtained whole genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from 58 COVID-19 patients in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and performed phylogenetic analyses on these and a further 50 Malaysian sequences available in the GISAID database. Malaysian lineage B.6 sequences were further analysed with all available worldwide lineage B.6 sequences.\n\nResultsNine different SARS-CoV-2 lineages (A, B, B.1, B.1.1, B.1.1.1, B.1.36, B.2, B.3 and B.6) were detected in Malaysia. The B.6 lineage was first reported a week after the mass gathering and became predominant (63%) despite being relatively rare (1.4%) among available global sequences. Increases in reported cases and community-acquired B.6 lineage strains were temporally linked. Non-B.6 lineages were mainly associated with travel and showed limited onward transmission. There were also temporally-correlated increases in B.6 sequences in other Southeast Asian countries, India and Australia, linked to participants returning from this event. We also report the presence of a nsp3-C6310A substitution found in 40.5% of global B.6 sequences which has associated with reduced sensitivity in a commercial assay.\n\nConclusionLineage B.6 became the predominant cause of community transmission in Malaysia after likely introduction during a religious mass gathering. This event also contributed to spikes of lineage B.6 in other countries in the region.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia was driven mainly by transmission following a religious mass gathering held in Kuala Lumpur at the end of February. To study the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Malaysia, we analysed 50 available and 58 newly-generated Malaysian whole genome virus sequences. We found that lineage B.6, rare (1.4%) globally, first appeared after the mass gathering and became the most predominant (62.9%) in Malaysia. Increases in COVID-19 cases and locally-acquired B.6 strains were temporally linked. Non-B.6 viruses were mainly associated with travel and showed limited spread. Increases in B.6 viruses in Southeast Asian countries, India and Australia were linked to participants returning from this mass gathering. Altogether, 95.3% of global B.6 sequences originated in Asia or Australia. We also report a mutation in the virus nsP3 gene found in 40.5% of global B.6 sequences and associated with reduced detection by a commercial diagnostic test. In conclusion, the religious mass gathering in Kuala Lumpur was associated with the main wave of COVID-19 cases of predominantly B.6 lineage in Malaysia, and subsequent spread of B.6 viruses regionally. Genome sequence data provides valuable insight into virus spread and is important for monitoring continued accuracy of diagnostic kits.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yoong Min Chong","author_inst":"University of Malaya Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"I-Ching Sam","author_inst":"University of Malaya Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Chong","author_inst":"University of Malaya Medical Centre"},{"author_name":"Maria Kahar Bador","author_inst":"University of Malaya Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sasheela Ponnampalavanar","author_inst":"University of Malaya Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sharifah  Faridah Syed Omar","author_inst":"University of Malaya Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adeeba Kamarulzaman","author_inst":"University of Malaya Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Vijayan Munusamy","author_inst":"University of Malaya Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Chee Kuan Wong","author_inst":"University of Malaya Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fadhil Hadi Jamaluddin","author_inst":"University of Malaya Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yoke Fun Chan","author_inst":"University of Malaya Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Argyris Stringaris","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health"},{"author_name":"Kathleen R Merikangas","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health"},{"author_name":"Lun Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sheng-jie Hou","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiao-lin Yu","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yu-ling Wang","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Hui-xia Gao","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Xue-han Shi","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Chang-wen Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Bi-xia Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chun-guo Jiang","author_inst":"Beijing Chaoyang Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rui-tian Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.24.20180745","rel_title":"Anxiety and media exposure during COVID-19 outbreak in Kuwait","rel_date":"2020-08-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.24.20180745","rel_abs":"Background: Rising fear and panic among public during COVID19 pandemic increase concern regarding anxiety cases in Kuwait.

Methods: The assessment used the Benefit-Risk Action Team (BRAT) framework. Convalescent plasma treatment in severe COVID-19 was compared to standard of care, placebo or other treatments. A literature search was conducted to identify published papers from January 1st, 2019 until July 8th, 2020. A value tree was constructed which included ranked key benefits and risks. Results: We screened 396 papers from PubMed and 127 papers from Embase. Four studies were eligible for inclusion as they contained comparative data. Results from a randomised controlled trial revealed a non-statistically significant shortening of time to clinical improvement of 2.15 days (95% CI, -5.28 to 0.99 days) in the intervention group compared with the control group, with a possible signal of increased efficacy amongst a small subset of patients with severe disease (but not life threatening disease), however this study may have been underpowered. Interpretation of findings amongst the three controlled non-randomised studies were limited by small patient numbers, lack of randomisation, and confounding by co-administration of other treatments. Limited data availability at the current time precluded construction of a data summary table and further quantitative analysis. Conclusions: There was insufficient evidence from controlled studies to complete a data summary table for a systematic benefit-risk assessment of the use of CP for severe COVID-19 disease at the current time, and as such a benefit-risk conclusion could not be made. Whilst uncontrolled case series have suggested positive findings with CP, results from these studies are very difficult to interpret. We provide a framework which can be updated when further data that have an impact on the benefit-risk become available.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Miranda Davies","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Samantha Lane","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Alison Evans","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline Denyer","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Sandeep Dhanda","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Debabrata Roy","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Vicki Osborne","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Saad AW Shakir","author_inst":"Drug Safety Research Unit, Southampton, UK"},{"author_name":"Chee Kuan Wong","author_inst":"University of Malaya Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fadhil Hadi Jamaluddin","author_inst":"University of Malaya Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yoke Fun Chan","author_inst":"University of Malaya Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Argyris Stringaris","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health"},{"author_name":"Kathleen R Merikangas","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health"},{"author_name":"Lun Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sheng-jie Hou","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiao-lin Yu","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yu-ling Wang","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Hui-xia Gao","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Xue-han Shi","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Chang-wen Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Bi-xia Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chun-guo Jiang","author_inst":"Beijing Chaoyang Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rui-tian Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.24.20180810","rel_title":"Mutational landscape and dominant lineages in the SARS-CoV-2 infections in the state of Telangana, India","rel_date":"2020-08-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.24.20180810","rel_abs":"The novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19 has rapidly turned into a pandemic, infecting millions and causing ~7 million deaths across the globe.

Such a tool can save time in interpreting chest X-rays and increase the accuracy and thereby enhance our medical capacity for detection and diagnosis COVID-19. The idea is that a set of X-ray medical lung images (which include normal, infected by bacteria, infected by virus including COVID-19) were used to train a deep CNN which can be able to distinguish between the noise and the useful information and then uses this training to interpret new images by recognizing patterns that indicate certain diseases such as coronavirus infection in the individual images. The supervised learning method is used as the process of learning from the training dataset can be thought of as a doctor supervising the learning process. It becomes more accurate as the number of analyzed images growing. In this way, it imitates the training for a doctor, but the theory is that since it is capable of learning from a far larger set of images than any human, can have the potential of being more accurate.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Terry Gao Sr.","author_inst":"CMDHB"},{"author_name":"Grace Wang","author_inst":"AUT"},{"author_name":"Pratyusha Bala","author_inst":"Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics, Hyderabad, India"},{"author_name":"Vinay Donipadi","author_inst":"Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics, Hyderabad, India"},{"author_name":"Divya Vashisht","author_inst":"Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics, Hyderabad"},{"author_name":"Madhumohan Rao Katika","author_inst":"Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, India"},{"author_name":"Manohar Kandakatla","author_inst":"Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, India"},{"author_name":"Debashis Mitra","author_inst":"Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics, Hyderabad, India"},{"author_name":"Ashwin Dalal","author_inst":"Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics, Hyderabad, India"},{"author_name":"Murali Dharan Bashyam","author_inst":"Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics,, Hyderabad, India"},{"author_name":"Yoke Fun Chan","author_inst":"University of Malaya Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Argyris Stringaris","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health"},{"author_name":"Kathleen R Merikangas","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health"},{"author_name":"Lun Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sheng-jie Hou","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiao-lin Yu","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yu-ling Wang","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Hui-xia Gao","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Xue-han Shi","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Chang-wen Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Bi-xia Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chun-guo Jiang","author_inst":"Beijing Chaoyang Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rui-tian Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.24.20180836","rel_title":"Perceptions of Risk of Attending Hospital during the COVID-19 Pandemic: a UK public opinion survey","rel_date":"2020-08-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.24.20180836","rel_abs":"In order to inform clinical and research practice in secondary care in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, an online survey was used to collect public opinions on attending hospitals.

Participants age ranged from the 18-85+, with the majority (337 (84%)) aged between 35 to 74 years. There were a higher number of women (77%) compared to men (23%); and were mainly White European (91%) compared to BAME (6%), or other (2%). Data collection included self-identified risk status due to comorbidity or age, and 100 point Likert-type scales to measures feelings of safety, factors affecting feelings of safety, intention to participate in research, comfort with new ways of working and attitudes to research. Results for feelings of safety scales indicate two distinct groups; one of respondents who felt quite safe and one of those who did not. Implementation of COVID-19 related safety measures such as social distancing, use of PPE and cleaning were strongly supported by most respondents. There was ambivalence around less certain measures such as regular staff antigen and antibody testing. Respondents were most likely to participate in research related to their own condition, COVID-19 research and vaccine research, but less likely to participate in healthy volunteer research, especially if suffering from a pre-existing comorbidity identified with increased risk or were female. There was general agreement that participants are comfortable with new ways of working, such as remote consultation, though women and BAME respondents were less comfortable. Findings raise concerns for health inequalities already impacting some groups in the pandemic. The role of clinical necessity and personal benefit support the reopening of services in line with clinical necessity. Moderate caution in respect of vaccine research relative to patient-participant research presents a challenge for pending recruitment demands, and would benefit from qualitative research to explore themes and concerns in more depth and support development and targeting of key messaging.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rebecca Pritchard","author_inst":"University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Emer Brady","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Yogini Chudasama","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Melanie Davies","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Gerry McCann","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Madhumohan Rao Katika","author_inst":"Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, India"},{"author_name":"Manohar Kandakatla","author_inst":"Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, India"},{"author_name":"Debashis Mitra","author_inst":"Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics, Hyderabad, India"},{"author_name":"Ashwin Dalal","author_inst":"Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics, Hyderabad, India"},{"author_name":"Murali Dharan Bashyam","author_inst":"Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics,, Hyderabad, India"},{"author_name":"Yoke Fun Chan","author_inst":"University of Malaya Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Argyris Stringaris","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health"},{"author_name":"Kathleen R Merikangas","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health"},{"author_name":"Lun Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sheng-jie Hou","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiao-lin Yu","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yu-ling Wang","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Hui-xia Gao","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Xue-han Shi","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Chang-wen Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Bi-xia Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chun-guo Jiang","author_inst":"Beijing Chaoyang Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rui-tian Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.22.20179911","rel_title":"Clinical Outcomes of Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 on Therapeutic Anticoagulants","rel_date":"2020-08-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.22.20179911","rel_abs":"Background: COVID-19 is associated with hypercoagulability and an increased incidence of thrombosis.

Methods: We performed an observational study of adult inpatients with COVID-19 at 10 hospitals affiliated with Northwestern Medicine in the Chicagoland area from March 9 to June 26, 2020. We evaluated clinical outcomes of subjects with COVID-19 who were continued on their outpatient therapeutic anticoagulation during hospitalization and those who were newly started on these medications compared to those who were on prophylactic doses of these medications based on the World Health Organization (WHO) Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement. The primary outcome was overall death while secondary outcomes were critical illness (WHO score >5), need for mechanical ventilation, and death among those subjects who first had critical illness adjusted for age, sex, race, body mass index (BMI), Charlson score, glucose on admission, and use of antiplatelet agents. Results: 1,716 subjects with COVID-19 were included in the analysis. 171 subjects (10.0%) were continued on their outpatient therapeutic anticoagulation and 201(11.7%) were started on new therapeutic anticoagulation during hospitalization. In subjects continued on home therapeutic anticoagulation, there were no differences in overall death, critical illness, mechanical ventilation, or death among subjects with critical illness compared to subjects on prophylactic anticoagulation. Subjects receiving new therapeutic anticoagulation for COVID-19 were more likely to die (OR 5.93; 95% CI 3.71-9.47), have critical illness (OR 14.51; 95% CI 7.43-28.31), need mechanical ventilation (OR 11.22; 95% CI 6.67-18.86), and die after first having critical illness.

Therapeutic anticoagulation for COVID-19 in absence of other indications was associated with worse clinical outcomes.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Niti G Patel","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of medicine"},{"author_name":"Ajay Bhasin","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Joseph M Feinglass","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Steven M Belknap","author_inst":"Independent Researcher"},{"author_name":"Michael P Angarone","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Elaine R Cohen","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey H Barsuk","author_inst":"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Debashis Mitra","author_inst":"Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics, Hyderabad, India"},{"author_name":"Ashwin Dalal","author_inst":"Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics, Hyderabad, India"},{"author_name":"Murali Dharan Bashyam","author_inst":"Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics,, Hyderabad, India"},{"author_name":"Yoke Fun Chan","author_inst":"University of Malaya Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Argyris Stringaris","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health"},{"author_name":"Kathleen R Merikangas","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health"},{"author_name":"Lun Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sheng-jie Hou","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiao-lin Yu","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yu-ling Wang","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Hui-xia Gao","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Xue-han Shi","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Chang-wen Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Bi-xia Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chun-guo Jiang","author_inst":"Beijing Chaoyang Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rui-tian Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"hematology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.19.20178376","rel_title":"Preventing disease after exposure to COVID-19 using hydroxychloroquine: A summary of a protocol for exploratory re-analysis of age and time-nuanced effects.","rel_date":"2020-08-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.19.20178376","rel_abs":"BACKGROUND: A recently published randomized trial (Boulware et al., 2020, NCT04308668) of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for post-exposure prophylaxis found a reduction in Covid-19 of 17%. In the context of ambitious powering to detect a 50% reduction, this non-statistically significant finding could translate to a reduction of 22,000\/130,828 cases (CDC 8\/12\/20) among US health care workers (HCW), impacting trajectory and resource utilization models that drive decisions on lockdowns and social distancing. Data found only in the appendix of Boulware et al. suggested greater differences in the effect of HCQ among sub-groups. There were reductions (36%) in younger (<35 years) and increases (110%) in older (>50 years) subjects. Our preliminary analysis revealed a significant negative correlation (slope -0.211, CI -0.328-0.094, p=0.016) between treatment lag and disease reduction, reaching 49% when initiated within one day (RR 0.51, CI 0.176-1.46, p=0.249). There were also differences in disease reduction by HCQ by type of exposure (HCW - 8% vs. household contacts - 31%; RR 0.691, CI 0.398-1.2). The definitions of exposure severity did not discriminate between the numbers or duration (> 10 minutes) of exposures. Differences between exposure types may result from younger HCW and higher risks in less trained household contacts with little access to advanced PPE. The ex-protocol use of zinc and ascorbic acid were likely confounders, as was the possibly active folate placebo. Exploratory reanalysis of the raw dataset may inform an age- and stage- nuanced approach to COVID-19 using HCQ testable by prospective studies and may provide insight into the various proposed mechanisms of HCQ. OBJECTIVES: To conduct an exploratory re-analysis of the de-identified raw dataset from a randomized study of the use of HCQ for post-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19 with view to further defining: a) The time dependent effect of HCQ, b) The age dependent effect of HCQ; c) The sub-stratification of time- and age-dependent effects by exposure type and risk level, as well as by the use of zinc and ascorbic acid. d) The design of future clinical trials to test the hypotheses generated by this study. METHODS: Should granularity of data (by age, time-lag, level and type of exposure) be greater than that originally reported, Fisher Exact test will be used to compare the incidence of COVID-19 in HCQ- and control groups, for each sub-group stratification. Since the degree of loss of data granularity due to de-identification is yet unknown, exploratory analyses involving other demographic characteristics cannot be planned. Where sufficient data granularity exists, univariate regression analyses will be conducted to examine the effect of age- and time lag on any effect of HCQ. The possibility will be explored of conducting multivariate Cox regression analyses with propensity score matching to examine observational data relating to the use of zinc and ascorbic acid.

However, although a cardiac tropism of SARS-CoV-2 for inflammatory cells in autopsy heart samples of COVID-19 patients has been reported, the presence of the virus in cardiomyocytes has not been documented yet. Methods - We investigated for SARS-CoV-2 presence in heart tissue autopsies of 6 consecutive COVID-19 patients deceased for respiratory failure showing no signs of cardiac involvement and with no history of heart disease. Cardiac autopsy samples were analysed by digital PCR, Western blot, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, RNAScope, and transmission electron microscopy assays. Results - The presence of SARS-CoV-2 into cardiomyocytes was invariably detected. A variable pattern of cardiomyocytes injury was observed, spanning from the absence of cell death and subcellular alterations hallmarks to the intracellular oedema and sarcomere ruptures. In addition, we found active viral transcription in cardiomyocytes, by detecting both sense and antisense SARS-CoV-2 spike RNA. Conclusions - In this analysis of autopsy cases, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 into cardiomyocytes, determining variable patterns of intracellular involvement, has been documented. All these findings suggest the need of a cardiologic surveillance even in survived COVID-19 patients not displaying a cardiac phenotype, in order to monitor potential long-term cardiac sequelae.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gaetano Pietro Bulfamante","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Gianluca Lorenzo Perrucci","author_inst":"Centro Cardiologico Monzino-IRRCS"},{"author_name":"Monica Falleni","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Elena Sommariva","author_inst":"Centro Cardiologico Monzino-IRCCS"},{"author_name":"Delfina Tosi","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Carla Martinelli","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Paola Songia","author_inst":"Centro Cardiologico Monzino-IRCCS"},{"author_name":"Paolo Poggio","author_inst":"Centro Cardiologico Monzino-IRCCS"},{"author_name":"Stefano Carugo","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Giulio Pompilio","author_inst":"Centro Cardiologico Monzino-IRCCS"},{"author_name":"Yoke Fun Chan","author_inst":"University of Malaya Faculty of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Argyris Stringaris","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health"},{"author_name":"Kathleen R Merikangas","author_inst":"National Institute of Mental Health"},{"author_name":"Lun Zhang","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sheng-jie Hou","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xiao-lin Yu","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yu-ling Wang","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Hui-xia Gao","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Xue-han Shi","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Chang-wen Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Bi-xia Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chun-guo Jiang","author_inst":"Beijing Chaoyang Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rui-tian Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"cardiovascular medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.24.20174367","rel_title":"COVID-19 and heart medications: What's the connection?","rel_date":"2020-08-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.24.20174367","rel_abs":"Aim: To determine association between clinical outcome of COVID-19 and prior usage of cardiovascular and metabolic drugs, including, Aspirin, ACEIs, ARBs, Clopidogrel, metformin, and Statins.

We aimed to assess the risk and incidence rate of documented SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in a large cohort of laboratory-confirmed cases in Qatar. Methods: All SARS-CoV-2 laboratory-confirmed cases with at least one PCR positive swab that is [&ge;]45 days after a first positive swab were individually investigated for evidence of reinfection, and classified as showing strong, good, some, or weak\/no evidence for reinfection. Risk and incidence rate of reinfection were estimated. Results: Out of 133,266 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases, 243 persons (0.18%) had at least one subsequent positive swab [&ge;]45 days after the first positive swab. Of these, 54 cases (22.2%) had strong or good evidence for reinfection. Median time between first and reinfection swab was 64.5 days (range: 45-129). Twenty-three of the 54 cases (42.6%) were diagnosed at a health facility suggesting presence of symptoms, while 31 (57.4%) were identified incidentally through random testing campaigns\/surveys or contact tracing. Only one person was hospitalized at or following time of reinfection swab, but still had relatively mild infection. No deaths were recorded. Risk of reinfection was estimated at 0.04% (95% CI: 0.03-0.05%) and incidence rate of reinfection was estimated at 1.09 (95% CI: 0.84-1.42) per 10,000 person-weeks. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 reinfection appears to be a rare phenomenon suggestive of a strong protective immunity against reinfection that lasts for at least a few months post primary infection.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Laith J Abu-Raddad","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Epidemiology Group, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar"},{"author_name":"Hiam Chemaitelly","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Epidemiology Group, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar"},{"author_name":"Houssein H.

Home containment and education lockdown had the largest independent impacts and were predicted to reduce the reproduction number by 35% and 26%, respectively. However, we find that in contexts with a reproduction number >2, no individual intervention is sufficient to stop the epidemic and increasingly stringent intervention combinations may be required.

Examples include targeted messaging for men and younger age groups, social supports for those who need to self-isolate but may not have the means to do so, changes in workplace policies to discourage presenteeism, and provincially co-ordinated masking and safe school reopening policies.

Neighborhood deprivation has been observed to be associated with poorer health outcomes. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between neighborhood deprivation and COVID-19 in Louisiana. Methods: The Area Deprivation Index (ADI) was calculated and used to classify neighborhood deprivation at the census tract level. A total of 17 US census variables were used to calculate the ADI for each of the 1148 census tracts in Louisiana. The data were extracted from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2018. The neighborhoods were categorized into quintiles as well as low and high deprivation. The publicly available COVID-19 cumulative case counts by census tract was obtained from the Louisiana Department of Health website on July 31, 2020. Descriptive and Poisson regression analyses were performed. Results: Neighborhoods in Louisiana were substantially different with respect to deprivation. The ADI ranged from 136.00 for the most deprived neighborhood and -33.87 in the least deprived neighborhood. We observed that individuals residing in the most deprived neighborhoods had a 45% higher risk of COVID-19 disease compared to those residing in the least deprived neighborhoods. Conclusion: While the majority of previous studies were focused on very limited socio-environmental factors such as crowding and income, this study used a composite area-based deprivation index to examine the role of neighborhood environment on COVID-19. We observed a positive relationship between neighborhood deprivation and COVID-19 risk in Louisiana. The study findings can be utilized to promote public health preventions measures besides social distancing, wearing a mask while in public and frequent handwashing in vulnerable neighborhoods with greater deprivation.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Madhav KC","author_inst":"Epidemiology Program, School of Public Health, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center New Orleans, New Orleans, LA, United States"},{"author_name":"Evrim Oral","author_inst":"Biostatistics Program, School of Public Health, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center New Orleans, New Orleans, LA, United States"},{"author_name":"Susanne Straif-Bourgeois","author_inst":"Epidemiology Program, School of Public Health, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center New Orleans, New Orleans, LA, United States"},{"author_name":"Ariane L Rung","author_inst":"Epidemiology Program, School of Public Health, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center New Orleans, New Orleans, LA, United States"},{"author_name":"Edward S Peters","author_inst":"Epidemiology Program, School of Public Health, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center New Orleans, New Orleans, LA, United States"},{"author_name":"Peter J Loewen","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Amy L Greer","author_inst":"University of Guelph"},{"author_name":"Philippe Vanhems","author_inst":"Lyon University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Bruno Lina","author_inst":"University of Lyon"},{"author_name":"Laurence Josset","author_inst":"University of Lyon"},{"author_name":"Thierry Wirth","author_inst":"PSL University"},{"author_name":"Hanan F Abdul Rahim","author_inst":"College of Health Sciences, QU Health, Qatar University"},{"author_name":"Mohamed Ghaith Al Kuwari","author_inst":"Primary Health Care Corporation"},{"author_name":"Hamad Eid Al Romaihi","author_inst":"Ministry of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Sheikh Mohammad Al Thani","author_inst":"Ministry of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Roberto Bertollini","author_inst":"Ministry of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Yu-ling Wang","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Hui-xia Gao","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Xue-han Shi","author_inst":"The fifth hospital of Shijiazhuang"},{"author_name":"Chang-wen Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Bi-xia Ke","author_inst":"Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chun-guo Jiang","author_inst":"Beijing Chaoyang Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rui-tian Liu","author_inst":"Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.24.20179192","rel_title":"UK prevalence of underlying conditions which increase the risk of severe COVID-19 disease: a point prevalence study using electronic health records","rel_date":"2020-08-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.24.20179192","rel_abs":"Background This study aimed to describe the population at risk of severe COVID-19 due to underlying health conditions across the United Kingdom in 2019. Methods We used anonymised electronic health records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD to describe the point prevalence on 5 March 2019 of the at-risk population following national guidance. Prevalence for any risk condition and for each individual condition is given overall and stratified by age and region. We repeated the analysis on 5 March 2014 for full regional representation and to describe prevalence of underlying health conditions in pregnancy. We additionally described the population of cancer survivors, and assessed the value of linked secondary care records for ascertaining COVID-19 at-risk status. Findings On 5 March 2019, 24.4% of the UK population were at risk due to a record of at least one underlying health condition, including 8.3% of school-aged children, 19.6% of working-aged adults, and 66.2% of individuals aged 70 years or more. 7.1% of the population had multimorbidity. The size of the at-risk population was stable over time comparing 2014 to 2019, despite increases in chronic liver disease and diabetes and decreases in chronic kidney disease and current asthma.

A multi-national survey about such mental health information about COVID-19 was conducted in May 2020 across six Asian regions: Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. Data were collected from a population representative sample of 11,895 adults on their stress symptoms and reactions to COVID-19 and the related public health measures. 59.1% of the respondents showed at least one substantial stress symptom. The situation was particularly worrying in South Korea, where 75% of the respondents reported substantial stress symptoms. Respondents who were young, educated, lived in an urban area, had a high socio-economic status, had a history of chronic illness or mental illness, or who lived with a pregnant woman, elderly or children were most vulnerable to stress during the pandemic. Stress reactions showed a positive relationship with the amount of time spent following news about the COVID-19 outbreak. Asian adults coped with their stress by preparing safety equipment and extra daily commodities (62.4%) and by following government-issued public health measures (60.1%). Most Asian (71%) also frequently checked on the safety of family members and friends to keep each other safe. The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated stringent public health measures have largely increased the prevalence of substantial stress symptoms across multiple Asian regions. Governments should prepare this mental health pandemic and the associated social repercussions.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ricci P.H.

However, the applicability of internet searches to monitor COVID-19 infections and public health awareness in South Asian countries are unclear. Objectives To assess the association of public interest and health literacy in COVID-19 with the actual number of infected cases for countries in South Asia. Methods Google Trends data from January to March 2020 were used to correlate public interest and health literacy with official data on COVID-19 cases using the relative search volume (RSV) index. Public interest in COVID-19 was retrieved in RSV indices with the search term Coronavirus (Virus). Similarly, an OR combination of search terms hand wash, face mask, hand sanitizer, face shield, and gloves were used to retrieve RSV indices as a surrogate of population health literacy in COVID-19. Daily confirmed COVID-19 cases were obtained from the COVID-19 data repository managed by the Johns Hopkins University. Country-level time-lag correlation analyses were performed for a time lag between 30 and +30 days. Results COVID-19-related worldwide public interest reached a peak on March 16, 2020, right after the WHO announcement of coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic. COVID-19 related public interest reached the highest peak in South Asian countries a few days after each county reported 100th confirmed cases. There were significant positive correlations between COVID-19 related public interest and daily laboratory-confirmed cases in countries expect Nepal, Bhutan, and Sri Lanka. The highest public interest in South Asian Countries was on average 12 days before the local maximum of new confirmed cases. Similarly, web searches related to personal hygiene and COVID-19 preventive measures in south Asia correlated to the number of confirmed cases as well as national restriction measures. Conclusion Public interest indicated by RSV indices can help to monitor the progression of an outbreak such as the current COVID-19 pandemic particularly in countries with a lack of diagnostic and surveillance capacity, and thereby distribute appropriate health information to the general public.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hasan Symum","author_inst":"University of South Florida"},{"author_name":"Kh Mohammed Ali","author_inst":"Dhaka Medical College Hospital,  Dhaka,  Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Nick H.K.

Many protective materials were not available when the pandemic reached India forcing laboratory managers to take innovative measures to protect the laboratory staffs. Methods: We made face shields from OHP sheets and substitute of biosafety cabinets from cardboard boxes fitted with hypochlorite spraying devices. Here we present if these two in-house developed safety devices when incorporated in standard operating procedure (SOP) of laboratory safety were effective in clinical biochemistry laboratory of dedicated COVID hospitals. Results: We assessed contamination of laboratory surfaces (n=6) and rate of SARS-nCov-2 positivity from their nasal and throat swab by RT-PCR among laboratory personnel (n=18) after 14 days of their use along with other routine safety devices like use of gloves, surgical masks, OT gowns etc. These HCWs were checked regularly for signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and none had any signs and symptoms during these 14days. The SARS-nCov-2 test report was negative for the staff members and no surface contamination was detected. We conclude that innovative and cost effective protective devices can be built in-house with locally available resources and are effective in preventing the spread of COVID 19 among the staff working in clinical biochemistry laboratories. Conclusions: Laboratory managers in resource scarce areas need to be innovative to face such sudden safety challenges like COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abhishek Dubey","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, Maulana Azad Medical College & Associated Hospitals New Delhi- 110002"},{"author_name":"Aastha Bansal","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, Maulana Azad Medical College & Associated Hospitals New Delhi- 110002"},{"author_name":"Subash Chandra Sonkar","author_inst":"Multidisciplinary Research Unit, Maulana Azad Medical College and Associated Hospital, New Delhi, India-110002"},{"author_name":"Binita Goswami","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, Maulana Azad Medical College & Associated Hospitals New Delhi- 110002"},{"author_name":"Naina Makwane","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, Maulana Azad Medical College & Associated Hospitals New Delhi- 110002"},{"author_name":"Vikas Manchanda","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Maulana Azad Medical College & Associated Hospitals New Delhi- 110002"},{"author_name":"Bidhan Chandra Koner","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, Maulana Azad Medical College & Associated Hospitals New Delhi- 110002"},{"author_name":"Christopher T.

The disease-free equilibrium point is computed and its stability analysis is studied. The basic reproduction number(R 0 ) of the model is computed and the disease-free equilibrium point is locally and globally stable for R 0<1 and unstable for R 0 >1. Based on the available data the unknown model parameters are estimated using a combination of least square and Bayesian estimation methods for different countries. Using forward sensitivity index the model parameters are carried out to determine and identify the key factors for the spread of disease dynamics. From country to country the sensitive parameters for the spread of the virus varies. It is found out that the reproduction number depends mostly on the infection rates, the threshold value of the force of infection for a population, the recovery rates, and the virus decay rate in the environment. It is also demonstrated that control of the effective transmission rate (recommended human behavioral change towards self-protective measures) is essential to stop the spreading of the virus. Numerical simulations also show that the virus transmission dynamics depend mostly on those sensitive parameters.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kassahun Getnet Mekonen","author_inst":"Adama Science and Technology University"},{"author_name":"Tatek Getachew Habtemicheal","author_inst":"Adama Science and Technology University"},{"author_name":"Shiferaw Feyissa Balcha","author_inst":"Adama Science and Technology University"},{"author_name":"Binita Goswami","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, Maulana Azad Medical College & Associated Hospitals New Delhi- 110002"},{"author_name":"Naina Makwane","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, Maulana Azad Medical College & Associated Hospitals New Delhi- 110002"},{"author_name":"Vikas Manchanda","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Maulana Azad Medical College & Associated Hospitals New Delhi- 110002"},{"author_name":"Bidhan Chandra Koner","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry, Maulana Azad Medical College & Associated Hospitals New Delhi- 110002"},{"author_name":"Christopher T.

During COVID-19 pandemic, usual diagnostic practices such as bronchoalveolar lavage and tracheal aspirate are limited due to their associated high risk of exposure for the operator. In order to set primary focus on the protection of health care personnel, a modified tracheal aspiration (M-TA) technique is developed and used for acquiring a lower respiratory tract of microbiological samples with a closed suction device. Method: Retrospective observational study to evaluate effectiveness of M-TA is conducted. Results: A total of 33 M-TA samples were analyzed. In 66,6% of the cases, results led to a change in medical decision making. A 100% accuracy was achieved regarding COVID-19 diagnosis and a 56% bacterial growth-rate in cultives where VAP was suspected.
