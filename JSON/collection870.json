Recently, the cryo-EM structure in complex with 40S ribosome is deciphered. However, the structure of full length NSP1 without any partner has not been studies. Also, the conformation of NSP1-C terminal region in isolation is not been studied. In this study, we have investigated the conformational dynamics of NSP1C-terminal region (NSP1-CTR; amino acids 130-180) in isolation and under different solvent environments. The NSP1-CTR is found to be intrinsically disordered in aqueous solution. Further, we used alpha helix inducer, trifluoroethanol, and found induction of alpha helical conformation using CD spectroscopy. Additionally, in the presence of SDS, NSP1-CTR is showing a conformational change from disordered to ordered, possibly gaining alpha helix in part. But in presence of neutral lipid DOPC, a slight change in conformation is observed. This implies the possible role of hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic interaction on the conformational changes of NSP1. The changes in structural conformation were further studied by fluorescence-based studies, which showed significant blue shift and fluorescence quenching in the presence of SDS and TFE. Lipid vesicles also showed fluorescence-based quenching. In agreement to these result, fluorescence lifetime and fluorescence anisotropy decay suggests a change in conformational dynamics. The zeta potential studies further validated that the conformational dynamics is mostly because of hydrophobic interaction. In last, these experimental studies were complemented through Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation which have also shown a good correlation and testify our experiments. We believe that the intrinsically disordered nature of the NSP1-CTR will have implications in disorder based binding promiscuity with its interacting proteins.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amit Kumar","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Mandi"},{"author_name":"Ankur Kumar","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Mandi"},{"author_name":"Prateek Kumar","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Mandi"},{"author_name":"Neha Garg","author_inst":"Banaras Hindu University Varanasi"},{"author_name":"Rajanish Giri","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Mandi"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"biophysics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.09.20191684","rel_title":"Malaria Endemicity Influence on COVID -19 Mortality: New Evidence Added to BCG and  TB Prevalence","rel_date":"2020-09-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.09.20191684","rel_abs":"Background: Regarding SARS-CoV-2 it is well known that a substantial percentage of adult population cannot get infected if exposed to this novel coronavirus.

The diagnosis of COVID-19 is done by quantitative reverse-transcription polymer chain reaction (qRT-PCR) testing which utilizes different primer-probe sets depending on the assay used. Using in silico analysis we aimed to determine how the secondary structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome affects the interaction between the reverse primer during qRT-PCR and how it relates to the experimental primer-probe test efficiencies. We introduce the program DinoKnot (Duplex Interaction of Nucleic acids with pseudoKnots) that follows the hierarchical folding hypothesis to predict the secondary structure of two interacting nucleic acid strands (DNA\/RNA) of similar or different type. DinoKnot is the first program that utilizes stable stems in both strands as a guide to find the structure of their interaction. Using DinoKnot we predicted the interaction of the reverse primers used in four common COVID-19 qRT-PCR tests with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome. In addition, we predicted how 12 mutations in the primer\/probe binding region may affect the primer\/probe ability and subsequent SARS-CoV-2 detection. While we found all reverse primers are capable of interacting with their target area, we identified partial mismatching between the SARS-CoV-2 genome and some reverse primers. We predicted three mutations that may prevent primer binding, reducing the ability for SARS-CoV-2 detection. We believe our contributions can aid in the design of a more sensitive SARS-CoV-2 test.\n\nAuthor summaryThe current testing for the disease COVID-19 that is caused by the novel cornonavirus SARS-CoV-2 uses oligonucleotides called primers that bind to specific target regions on the SARS-CoV-2 genome to detect the virus. Our goal was to use computational tools to predict how the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome affects the ability of the primers to bind to their target region. We introduce the program DinoKnot (Duplex interaction of nucleic acids with pseudoknots) that is able to predict the interactions between two DNA or RNA molecules. We used DinoKnot to predict the efficiency of four common COVID-19 tests, and the effect of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus on ability of the COVID-19 tests in detecting those strains. We predict partial mismatching between some primers and the SARS-CoV-2 genome but that all primers are capable of interacting with their target areas. We also predict three mutations that prevent primer binding and thus SARS-CoV-2 detection. We discuss the limitations of the current COVID-19 testing and suggest the design of a more sensitive COVID-19 test that can be aided by our findings.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tara Newman","author_inst":"University of Victoria Faculty of Engineering: University of Victoria Faculty of Engineering & Computer Science"},{"author_name":"Hiu Fung Kevin Chang","author_inst":"University of Victoria"},{"author_name":"Hosna Jabbari","author_inst":"University of Victoria"},{"author_name":"Neha Garg","author_inst":"Banaras Hindu University Varanasi"},{"author_name":"Rajanish Giri","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Mandi"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.08.20190629","rel_title":"Model-informed COVID-19 vaccine prioritization strategies by age and serostatus","rel_date":"2020-09-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.08.20190629","rel_abs":"When a vaccine for COVID-19 becomes available, limited initial supply will raise the question of how to prioritize the available doses and thus underscores the need for transparent, evidence-based strategies that relate knowledge of, and uncertainty in, disease transmission, risk, vaccine efficacy, and existing population immunity. Here, we employ a model-informed approach to vaccine prioritization that evaluates the impact of prioritization strategies on cumulative incidence and mortality and accounts for population factors such as age, contact structure, and seroprevalence, and vaccine factors including imperfect and age-varying efficacy. This framework can be used to evaluate and compare existing strategies, and it can also be used to derive an optimal prioritization strategy to minimize mortality or incidence. We find that a transmission-blocking vaccine should be prioritized to adults ages 20-49y to minimize cumulative incidence and to adults over 60y to minimize mortality. Direct vaccination of adults over 60y minimizes mortality for vaccines that do not block transmission. We also estimate the potential benefit of using individual-level serological tests to redirect doses to only seronegative individuals, improving the marginal impact of each dose. We argue that this serology-informed vaccination approach may improve the efficiency of vaccination efforts while partially addressing existing inequities in COVID-19 burden and impact.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kate M Bubar","author_inst":"University of Colorado Boulder"},{"author_name":"Stephen M Kissler","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

Approximately, one-third of all exported cases were confirmed within 3 days of entry suggesting these travelers were mildly symptomatic or symptomatic in arrival. We also found that earlier exported cases from each country had a longer time between entry to confirmation by an average of 3 days compared to later exports.

However, vitamin D levels are associated with many confounding variables and thus associations described to date may not be causal. Vitamin D MR studies have provided results that are concordant with large-scale vitamin D randomized trials. Here, we used two-sample MR to assess the effect of circulating 25OHD levels on Covid-19 susceptibility. METHODS: Genetic variants strongly associated with 25OHD levels in a 443,734-participant genome-wide association study (GWAS) were used as instrumental variables. GWASs of Covid-19 susceptibility and severity from the Covid-19 Host Genetics Initiative were used to test the effect of 25OHD levels on these outcomes. Cohorts from the Covid-19 Host Genetics Initiative GWAS included up to 966,395 individuals of European ancestry. RESULTS: Genetically increased 25OHD levels by one standard deviation on the logarithmic scale had no clear effect on susceptibility but tended to increase the odds ratio of hospitalization (OR = 2.34; 95% CI: 1.33, 4.11) and severe disease (OR = 2.21; 95% CI: 0.87, 5.55). Extensive sensitivity analyses probing the assumptions of MR provided consistent estimates. CONCLUSION: These findings do not support a protective role of increased 25OHD levels on Covid-19 outcomes and may suggest harm. At present, individuals should not use vitamin D supplements to protect against Covid-19 outcomes, and on-going supplementation trials should closely monitor for signals of harm.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guillaume Butler-Laporte","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Tomoko Nakanishi","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Vincent Mooser","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"David R Morrison","author_inst":"Lady Davis Institute"},{"author_name":"Tala Abdullah","author_inst":"Lady Davis Institute"},{"author_name":"Olumide Adeleye","author_inst":"Lady Davis Institute"},{"author_name":"Noor Mamlook","author_inst":"Lady Davis Institute"},{"author_name":"Nofar Kimchi","author_inst":"Lady Davis Institute"},{"author_name":"Zaman Afrasiabi","author_inst":"Lady Davis Institute"},{"author_name":"Nardin Rezk","author_inst":"Lady Davis Institute"},{"author_name":"Annarita Giliberti","author_inst":"University of Siena"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Renieri","author_inst":"University of Siena"},{"author_name":"Yiheng Chen","author_inst":"Lady Davis Institute"},{"author_name":"Sirui Zhou","author_inst":"Lady Davis Institute"},{"author_name":"Vincenzo Forgetta","author_inst":"Lady Davis Institute"},{"author_name":"J Brent Richards","author_inst":"McGill University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.08.20190918","rel_title":"Assessing the influence of climate on future wintertime SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks","rel_date":"2020-09-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.08.20190918","rel_abs":"High susceptibility has limited the role of the climate in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic to date.

Here we use an epidemiological model, constrained by observations, to assess the sensitivity of future SARS-CoV-2 disease trajectories to local climate conditions. We find this sensitivity depends on both the susceptibility of the population and the efficacy of non-pharmaceutical controls (NPIs) in reducing transmission. Assuming high susceptibility, more stringent NPIs may be required to minimize outbreak risk in the winter months. Our results imply a role for meteorological forecasts in projecting outbreak severity, however, reducing uncertainty in epidemiological parameters will likely have a greater impact on generating accurate predictions and reflects the strong leverage of NPIs on future outbreak severity.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rachel E.

In the face of significant uncertainty around the epidemic impact of in-person schooling, policymakers, parents, and teachers are weighing the risks and benefits of returning to in-person education. In this context, we examined the impact of different school reopening scenarios on transmission within and outside of schools and on the share of school days that would need to be spent learning at a distance. Methods: We used an agent-based mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission and interventions to quantify the impact of school reopening on disease transmission and the extent to which school-based interventions could mitigate epidemic spread within and outside schools. We compared seven school reopening strategies that vary the degree of countermeasures within schools to mitigate COVID-19 transmission, including the use of face masks, physical distancing, classroom cohorting, screening, testing, and contact tracing, as well as schedule changes to reduce the number of students in school. We considered three scenarios for the size of the epidemic in the two weeks prior to school reopening: 20, 50, or 110 detected cases per 100,000 individuals and assumed the epidemic was slowly declining with full school closures. For each scenario, we calculated the percentage of schools that would have at least one person arriving at school with an active COVID-19 infection on the first day of school; the percentage of in-person school days that would be lost due to scheduled distance learning, symptomatic screening or quarantine; the cumulative infection rate for students, staff and teachers over the first three months of school; and the effective reproduction number averaged over the first three months of school within the community. Findings: In-person schooling poses significant risks to students, teachers, and staff. On the first day of school, 5-42% of schools would have at least one person arrive at school with active COVID-19, depending on the incidence of COVID in the community and the school type. However, reducing class sizes via A\/B school scheduling, combined with an incremental approach that returns elementary schools in person and keeps all other students remote, can mitigate COVID transmission. In the absence of any countermeasures in schools, we expect 6-25% of teaching and non-teaching staff and 4-20% of students to be infected with COVID in the first three months of school, depending upon the case detection rate. Schools can lower this risk to as low as 0.2% for staff and 0.1% for students by returning elementary schools with a hybrid schedule while all other grades continue learning remotely. However, this approach would require 60-85% of all school days to be spent at home. Despite the significant risks to the school population, reopening schools would not significantly increase community-wide transmission, provided sufficient countermeasures are implemented in schools. Interpretation: Without extensive countermeasures, school reopening may lead to an increase in infections and a significant number of re-closures as cases are identified among staff and students. Returning elementary schools only with A\/B scheduling is the lowest risk school reopening strategy that includes some in-person learning.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jamie A.

Methods: A cross-sectional retrospective study was conducted among 1,021 RT-PCR confirmed but recovered COVID-19 cases from six participating hospitals in Bangladesh. Results: Of the total sample, 111 (10.9%) cases were asymptomatic while the number of symptomatic cases were 910 (89.1%). Higher prevalence of COVID-19 persisted in the male population (75%) and for the 31-40 age group. More than 85% of the samples reported BCG vaccination mark.

Methods: To identify intermediate traits of the COVID-19 risk variant, we performed a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) with 923 phenotypes in 310,999 European individuals from UK Biobank. For candidate target genes, we examined associations between their expression and the polygenic score (PGS) of 1,263 complex traits in a meta-analysis of 31,684 blood samples. Results: Our PheWAS identified and replicated multiple blood cell traits to be associated with the COVID-19 risk variant, including monocyte count and percentage (p = 1.07e-8, 4.09e-13), eosinophil count and percentage (p = 5.73e-3, 2.20e-3), and neutrophil percentage (p = 3.23e-3). The PGS analysis revealed positive associations between the expression of candidate genes and genetically predicted counts of specific blood cells: CCR3 with eosinophil and basophil (p = 5.73e-21, 5.08e-19); CCR2 with monocytes (p = 2.40e-10); and CCR1 with monocytes and neutrophil (p = 1.78e-6, 7.17e-5). Conclusions: Multiple blood cell traits, especially monocyte, eosinophil, and neutrophil numbers, are associated with the COVID-19 risk variant and the expression of its candidate target genes, representing probable mechanistic links between the genetic locus 3p21.31 and severe COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jingqi Zhou","author_inst":"University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Yitang Sun","author_inst":"University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Weishan Huang","author_inst":"Louisiana State University"},{"author_name":"Kaixiong Ye","author_inst":"University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Karolina Akinosoglou","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, University Hospital of Patras, Patras, Greece"},{"author_name":"Vicky Pliaka","author_inst":"ProtATonce Ltd,"},{"author_name":"Angeliki Minia","author_inst":"ProtATonce Ltd"},{"author_name":"Evangelos Terpos","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Therapeutics, Alexandra General Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece"},{"author_name":"Ioannis P.

Public health professionals and prison administrators seek information to guide best practices regarding prison population to capacity rates for the COVID-19 outbreak. Objective: Using latent profile analysis, we sought to characterize Texas prisons on levels of COVID-19 cases and deaths among incarcerated residents, and COVID-19 cases among prison staff. Design: This observational study was a secondary data analysis of publicly available data from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TBDJ). Data were downloaded and analyzed on July 24, 2020. This project was completed in collaboration with the COVID Prison Project. Setting: One-hundred and three prisons in the state of Texas. Participants: The unit of analysis is the individual prison units that comprise the TDCJ. Exposures: None Main Outcomes and Measures: Latent profiles on levels of incarcerated resident COVID-19 cases, staff COVID-19 cases, and incarcerated resident COVID-19 deaths. Results: We identified relevant profiles from the data: a low outbreak profile, a high outbreak profile, and a high death profile. Additionally, current prison population and level of employee staffing predicted membership in the high outbreak and high death profiles when compared to the low outbreak profile. Conclusions and Relevance: Housing persons at 85% of prison capacity may minimize the risk of infection and death related to COVID-19. Implementing this 85% standard as an absolute minimum should be prioritized at prisons across the US.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Noel A.

Risk Ratios (RRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random-effects models. Results: A total of 10 studies were identified which fulfill the inclusion criteria. Patients taking antivirals had 26% less risk of having a severe adverse event (SAE) compared to controls (RR, 0.74, CI:0.62 to 0.89, P=0.002). Clinical improvement at day 14 was observed among the cases treated with antivirals compared to the control group (RR 1.24, CI: 1.00 to 1.53 p=0.05). Conclusion: There is evidence that Remdesivir and LPV\/r reduces the hospital length of stay and that patients to which antivirals were administered had less SAE and improvement when compared to patients not prescribed with antivirals. Due to a lack of power and the quality of the studies, it was not possible to determine which antivirals have a greater risk-benefit balance, and therefore the optimal approach to antiviral treatment is still uncertain.

With the outbreak of the epidemic, many researchers are devoting themselves to the COVID-19 screening system. The standard practices for rapid risk screening of COVID-19 are the CT imaging or RT-PCR (real-time polymerase chain reaction). However, these methods demand professional efforts of the acquisition of CT images and saliva samples, a certain amount of waiting time, and most importantly prohibitive examination fee in some countries. Recently, some literatures have shown that the COVID-19 patients usually accompanied by ocular manifestations consistent with the conjunctivitis, including conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, epiphora, or increased secretions. After more than four months study, we found that the confirmed cases of COVID-19 present the consistent ocular pathological symbols; and we propose a new screening method of analyzing the eye-region images, captured by common CCD and CMOS cameras, could reliably make a rapid risk screening of COVID-19 with very high accuracy. We believe a system implementing such an algorithm should assist the triage management or the clinical diagnosis. To further evaluate our algorithm and approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai public health clinic center of Fudan University, we conduct a study of analyzing the eye-region images of 303 patients (104 COVID-19, 131 pulmonary, and 68 ocular patients), as well as 136 healthy people. Remarkably, our results of COVID-19 patients in testing set consistently present similar ocular pathological symbols; and very high testing results have been achieved in terms of sensitivity and specificity.

Animal studies and the scarcity of confirmed re-infection suggests immune protection is likely, although the durability of this protection is debated. Lasting immunity following acute viral infection requires maintenance of both serum antibody and antigen-specific memory B and T lymphocytes and is notoriously pathogen specific, ranging from life-long for smallpox or measles4, to highly transient for common cold coronaviruses (CCC). Neutralising antibody responses are a likely correlate of protective immunity and exclusively recognise the viral spike (S) protein, predominantly targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) within the S1 sub-domain. Multiple reports describe waning of S-specific antibodies in the first 2-3 months following infection. However, extrapolation of early linear trends in decay might be overly pessimistic, with several groups reporting that serum neutralisation is stable over time in a proportion of convalescent subjects. While SARS-CoV-2 specific B and T cell responses are readily induced by infection, the longitudinal dynamics of these key memory populations remains poorly resolved. Here we comprehensively profiled antibody, B and T cell dynamics over time in a cohort recovered from mild-moderate COVID-19. We find that binding and neutralising antibody responses, together with individual serum clonotypes, decay over the first 4 months post-infection, as expected, with a similar decline in S-specific CD4+ and circulating T follicular helper (cTFH) frequencies. In contrast, S-specific IgG+ memory B cells (MBC) consistently accumulate over time, eventually comprising a significant fraction of circulating MBC. Modelling of the concomitant immune kinetics predicts maintenance of serological neutralising activity above a titre of 1:40 in 50% of convalescent subjects to 74 days, with probable additive protection from B and T cells. Overall, our study suggests SARS-CoV-2 immunity after infection is likely to be transiently protective at a population level. SARS-CoV-2 vaccines may require greater immunogenicity and durability than natural infection to drive long-term protection.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adam K Wheatley","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Jennifer A Juno","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Jing J Wang","author_inst":"Flinders University"},{"author_name":"Kevin J Selva","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Arnold Reynaldi","author_inst":"University of New South Wales"},{"author_name":"Hyon-Xhi Tan","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Wen Shi Lee","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Kathleen M Wragg","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Hannah G Kelly","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Robyn Esterbauer","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Samantha K Davis","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Helen E Kent","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Francesca L Mordant","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Timothy E Schlub","author_inst":"University of New South Wales"},{"author_name":"David L Gordon","author_inst":"Flinders Medical Centre"},{"author_name":"David S Khoury","author_inst":"University of New South Wales"},{"author_name":"Kanta Subbarao","author_inst":"WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza"},{"author_name":"Deborah Cromer","author_inst":"University of New South Wales"},{"author_name":"Tom P Gordon","author_inst":"Flinders University"},{"author_name":"Amy W Chung","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Miles P Davenport","author_inst":"University of New South Wales"},{"author_name":"Stephen J Kent","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.09.20187625","rel_title":"Quantifying proximity, confinement, and interventions in disease outbreaks: a decision support framework for air-transported pathogens","rel_date":"2020-09-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.09.20187625","rel_abs":"The inability to communicate how infectious diseases are transmitted in human environments has triggered avoidance of interactions during the COVID-19 pandemic. We define a metric, Effective ReBreathed Volume (ERBV), that encapsulates how infectious pathogens transport in air. This measure distinguishes environmental transport from other factors in the chain of infection, thus allowing quantitative comparisons of the riskiness of different situations for any pathogens transported in air, including SARS-CoV-2. Particle size is a key factor in transport, removal onto surfaces, and elimination by mitigation measures, so ERBV is presented for a range of exhaled particle diameters: 1 m, 10 m, and 100 m. Pathogen transport is enhanced by two separate but interacting effects: proximity and confinement. Confinement in enclosed spaces overwhelms proximity after 10-15 minutes for all but the largest particles. Therefore, we review plausible strategies to reduce the confinement effect. Changes in standard ventilation and filtration can reduce person-to-person transport of 1-m particles (ERBV1) by 13-85% in residential and commercial situations. Deposition to surfaces competes with intentional removal for 10-m and 100-m particles, so the same interventions reduce ERBV10 by only 3-50%, and ERBV100 is unaffected. Determining transmission modes is critical to identify intervention effectiveness, and would be accelerated with prior knowledge of ERBV. When judiciously selected, the interventions examined can provide substantial reduction in risk, and the conditions for selection are identified. The framework of size-dependent ERBV supports analysis and mitigation decisions in an emerging situation, even before other infectious parameters are well known.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tami C.

As countries across the world loosen their lockdown restrictions, the assumption is generally made that the risk of COVID-19 transmission is lower outdoors, and this assumption has shaped decisions about what activities can re-commence, the circumstances in which they should re-commence, and the conditions under which they should re-commence. This is important for events and activities that generate outdoor gatherings of people, including both participatory and spectator sport events, protests, concerts, carnivals, festivals, and other celebrations. The review, which was designed to be undertaken rapidly in 15 days, returned 14 sources of evidence of outdoor transmission of COVID-19, and a further 21 sources that were used to set the context and understand the caveats that should be considered in interpreting the review findings. The review found very few examples of outdoor transmission of COVID-19 in everyday life among c. 25,000 cases considered, suggesting a very low risk. However risk of outdoor transmission increases when the natural social distancing of everyday life is breached, and gathering density, circulation and size increases, particularly for an extended duration. There was also evidence that weather had a behavioural effect on transmission, with temperatures that encourage outdoor activity associated with lower COVID-19 transmission. Due to lack of surveillance and tracing systems, and confounding factors and variables, there was no evidence that robustly tested transmission at outdoor mass gatherings (circa 10,000+ people), which are as likely to generate transmission from the activities they prompt (e.g. communal travel and congregation in bars) as from outdoor transmission at the gathering itself. The goal of hosts and organisers of events and activities that generate outdoor gatherings of people is to prevent the escalation of risk from sporadic transmission to the risk of transmission through a cluster outbreak. Considerations for such hosts and organisers include: (1) does the gathering prompt other behaviours that might increase transmission risk?; (2) for each part of the event or activity, how dense is the gathering, how much do people circulate, how large is the gathering, and how long are people there?; (3) is rapid contact tracing possible in the event of an outbreak? These considerations should take place relevant to the size of the underlying risk, which includes the rate of infection in the community and the likely attendance of vulnerable groups. Risk must be balanced and mitigated across the risk factors of density, circulation, size and duration. No one risk factor presents an inherently larger risk than any other, but neither is any one risk factor a magic bullet to eliminate risk. Finally, it is clear that the largest risks from gatherings come from spontaneous or informal unregulated and unmitigated events or activities which do not consider any of the issues, risks and risk factors outlined in this paper","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mike Weed","author_inst":"Canterbury Christ Church University"},{"author_name":"Abby Foad","author_inst":"Canterbury Christ Church University"},{"author_name":"Delphine K.

At that stage, containment measures were put in place. The health authority in Qatar developed an emergency action plan to respond to the outbreak with the Primary Health Care as the main component of that response and suspended all non-urgent services including preventive health services. The aim of the retrospective analysis to measure the Impact of COVID 19 on the preventive services provided in Qatar. Methods: A retrospective data analysis was conducted for all the preventive services utilization volume across the 27 PHCC health centers from the 1st of January 2017 to the 31st of July 2020. Results: With 17,012 no-show appointments, well-baby and Immunization services utilization demonstrated a reduction of 40% in May and started to come back to volumes higher than expected in June. The number of cancelled appointments for breast cancer and colorectal cancer screening programs were 3,481 and 5,854 respectively. The expected volumes demand has dropped by 100% in comparison to 2017 demand. Wellness services only met 20% of its projected utilization in April, however, the services picked up in June. Conclusion: These findings will guide the public health policymakers to understand the effects COVID-19 on preventive services and the risk of having an increased number of outbreaks for childhood communicable disease, cancer cases with delayed diagnosis due to the screening services suspension. In addition, the plan will address the increased number of sedately behavior due to the service's reduced utilization of wellness services.

Governments across the globe have been implementing preventive measures towards curbing the spread of the virus. These measures have continued to interfere with the general lifestyle of the people. Hence, this study was aimed at examining the socio-demographic predictors of adherence to prescribed recommendations and the psychological impacts of COVID-19 pandemic lockdown among Nigerian social media users. Methods: This research implemented a cross-sectional survey using an online Google-based questionnaire to elicit required information from potential respondents via social media platforms. An external link to the questionnaire was shared among Nigerian social media users between for a month, and a total of 1,131 respondents participated in the survey. The explanatory and outcome variables were displayed by frequency and percentage distribution, while chi-square analysis was used to show the relationship between the explanatory and outcome variables at a 5% level of significance. Results: The study showed that 99% of the respondents reported following some of the prescribed recommendations; however, only 40.4% of the respondents followed all the recommendations. More than three fifths (63.4%) of the respondents also reported that they feel stressed during the lockdown. All the selected socio-demographic characteristics were not predictors of the outcome variables as p>0.05 except the professional background of the respondents (P<0.05).

Recently, many high-resolution apo and inhibitor-bound structures of Mpro, a cysteine protease, have been determined, facilitating structure-based drug design. Mpro plays a central role in the viral life cycle by catalyzing the cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 polyproteins. In addition to the catalytic dyad His41-Cys145, Mpro contains multiple histidines including His163, His164, and His172. The protonation states of these histidines and the catalytic nu-cleophile Cys145 have been debated in previous studies of SARS-CoV Mpro, but have yet to be investigated for SARS-CoV-2. In this work we have used molecular dynamics simulations to determine the structural stability of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro as a function of the protonation assignments for these residues. We simulated both the apo and inhibitor-bound enzyme and found that the conformational stability of the binding site, bound inhibitors, and the hydrogen bond networks of Mpro are highly sensitive to these assignments. Additionally, the two inhibitors studied, the peptidomimetic N3 and an -ketoamide, display distinct His41\/His164 protonation-state-dependent stabilities. While the apo and the N3-bound systems favored N{delta} (HD) and N{epsilon} (HE) protonation of His41 and His164, respectively, the -ketoamide was not stably bound in this state. Our results illustrate the importance of using appropriate histidine protonation states to accurately model the structure and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in both the apo and inhibitor-bound states, a necessary prerequisite for drug-design efforts.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anna Pavlova","author_inst":"Georgia Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Diane L.

The role of domestic livestock and the risk associated for humans in close contact remains unknown for many production animals. Determination of the susceptibility of pigs to SARS-CoV-2 is critical towards a One Health approach to manage the potential risk of zoonotic transmission. Here, pigs undergoing experimental inoculation are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 at low levels. Viral RNA was detected in group oral fluids and nasal wash from at least two animals while live virus was isolated from a pig. Further, antibodies could be detected in two animals at 11 and 13 days post infection, while oral fluid samples at 6 days post inoculation indicated the presence of secreted antibodies. These data highlight the need for additional livestock assessment to better determine the potential role domestic animals may contribute towards the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brad Pickering","author_inst":"Canadian Food Inspection Agency"},{"author_name":"Greg Smith","author_inst":"Canadian Food Inspection Agency"},{"author_name":"Mathieu Pinette","author_inst":"Canadian Food Inspection Agency"},{"author_name":"Carissa Embury-Hyatt","author_inst":"Canadian Food Inspection Agency"},{"author_name":"Estella Moffat","author_inst":"Canadian Food Inspection Agency"},{"author_name":"Peter Marszal","author_inst":"Canadian Food Inspection Agency"},{"author_name":"Charles E Lewis","author_inst":"Iowa State University"},{"author_name":"Leighton Coates","author_inst":"Oak Ridge National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Andrei A.

SARS-CoV-2 viral main protease (Mpro, also called 3C-like protease, 3CLpro) is a potential target for drug design. Crystal and co-crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro have been solved, enabling the rational design of inhibitory compounds. In this study we analyzed the available SARS-CoV-2 and the highly similar SARS-CoV-1 crystal structures. We identified within the active site of the Mpro, in addition to the inhibitory ligands interaction with the catalytic C145, two key H-bond interactions with the conserved H163 and E166 residues. Both H-bond interactions are present in almost all co-crystals and are likely to occur also during the viral polypeptide cleavage process as suggested from docking of the Mpro cleavage recognition sequence. We screened in silico a library of 6,900 FDA-approved drugs (ChEMBL) and filtered using these key interactions and selected 29 non-covalent compounds predicted to bind to the protease. Additional screen, using DOCKovalent was carried out on DrugBank library (11,414 experimental and approved drugs) and resulted in 6 covalent compounds. The selected compounds from both screens were tested in vitro by a protease activity inhibition assay. Two compounds showed activity at the 50M concentration range. Our analysis and findings can facilitate and focus the development of highly potent inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alina Shitrit","author_inst":"The Department of Clinical Microbiology and Immunology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel"},{"author_name":"Daniel Zaidman","author_inst":"Department of Organic Chemistry Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"},{"author_name":"Ori Kalid","author_inst":"Pardes Hana, Israel"},{"author_name":"Itai Bloch","author_inst":"Biotechnology Department, MIGAL-Galilee Research Institute, Kiryat-Shmona, Israel"},{"author_name":"Dvir Doron","author_inst":"Chemical & Computational Toxicology, Non-Clinical Development, Global R&D, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Netanya, Israel"},{"author_name":"Tali Yarnizky","author_inst":"Tali Yarnizky Scientific Consulting, Maccabim-Reut, Israel"},{"author_name":"Idit Buch","author_inst":"Emendo Biotherapeutics Ltd.

Here, we describe a deep mutational scanning method to map how all amino-acid mutations in the RBD affect antibody binding, and apply this method to 10 human monoclonal antibodies. The escape mutations cluster on several surfaces of the RBD that broadly correspond to structurally defined antibody epitopes. However, even antibodies targeting the same RBD surface often have distinct escape mutations. The complete escape maps predict which mutations are selected during viral growth in the presence of single antibodies, and enable us to design escape-resistant antibody cocktails-including cocktails of antibodies that compete for binding to the same surface of the RBD but have different escape mutations. Therefore, complete escape-mutation maps enable rational design of antibody therapeutics and assessment of the antigenic consequences of viral evolution.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Allison J Greaney","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Tyler N Starr","author_inst":"Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Pavlo Gilchuk","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University"},{"author_name":"Seth J Zost","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University"},{"author_name":"Elad Binshtein","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University"},{"author_name":"Andrea N Loes","author_inst":"Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Sarah K Hilton","author_inst":"Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"John Huddleston","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Rachel Eguia","author_inst":"Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Katharine HD Crawford","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Adam S Dingens","author_inst":"Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Rachel S Nargi","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University"},{"author_name":"Rachel E Sutton","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University"},{"author_name":"Naveenchandra Suryadevara","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University"},{"author_name":"Paul W Rothlauf","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Zhuoming Liu","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Sean PJ Whelan","author_inst":"Washington University"},{"author_name":"Robert H Carnahan","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University"},{"author_name":"James E Crowe Jr.","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University"},{"author_name":"Jesse D Bloom","author_inst":"Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Miles P Davenport","author_inst":"University of New South Wales"},{"author_name":"Stephen J Kent","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"}]}
