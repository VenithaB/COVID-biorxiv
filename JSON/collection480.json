In this study, we use district-level disease data to perform an ecological analysis of Covid19 outcomes in India vis a vis the local socioeconomic gradient. Average doubling times and case fatality ratios have been quantified as measures of transmission and mortality, respectively, and association analysis performed with twenty variables of socioeconomic vulnerability. Persistent patterns are observed between disease outcome and social inequality, linking poor living conditions to a faster spread, an elderly populace to a slower spread, and both a college education and the presence of medical facilities to low fatality rates.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Soham Dibyachintan","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"},{"author_name":"Priyanka Nandy","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"},{"author_name":"Kalyan Das","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"},{"author_name":"Sai Vinjanampathy","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"},{"author_name":"Mithun K.

A large percentage of the patients are asymptomatic and hospitals around the world are struggling to restart routine services. We report the results of a universal testing protocol of all patients who underwent orthopaedic surgery in the month of July 2020 in a large orthopaedic speciality hospital in Bangalore, India. Methods - A retrospective study of all patients who underwent orthopaedic surgery in the month of July 2020 at a tertiary care orthopaedic speciality hospital in Bangalore, India. All patients underwent nasopharyngeal swab test before surgery. A questionnaire was used to assess the patient before the RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab test. Data regarding imaging, investigations and follow up was recorded. Results - In the month of July 2020, 168 patients underwent routine nasopharyngeal RT -PCR swab test for COVID - 19 prior to planned orthopaedic surgical procedure (Both trauma and elective cases). 16 of the RT-PCR tests were positive. However vascular cases and absolute emergencies were done without a RT -PCR test with PPE and all universal precautions. 11 patients underwent emergency surgery without a RT-PCR test. All 16 cases who were positive were asymptomatic. The asymptomatic positive rate was 9.52%. Of the 11 patients who underwent emergency surgery without a RT-PCR test, only one patient had a positive test post - operatively. Conclusions - Routine nasopharyngeal RT-PCR testing revealed a high rate of asymptomatic cases. If the RT-PCR test is positive, it is best to defer the case till the test returns negative. All precautions must be taken while performing emergency surgeries. Our algorithm in managing patients has proven to be effective and can be replicated with ease to continue operating and taking care of orthopaedic patients during this pandemic.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kannan Karuppiah Kumar","author_inst":"Hosmat hospital"},{"author_name":"Thomas Chandy","author_inst":"Hosmat hospital"},{"author_name":"M N Kumar","author_inst":"Hosmat hospital"},{"author_name":"Muniramaiah Ravishankar","author_inst":"Hosmat hospital"},{"author_name":"Krishan Prasad","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chetan Rai","author_inst":"Hosmat hospital"},{"author_name":"Chetan A","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Girish Vijayakumar","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Noel nalin kumar","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Harshavardhan v","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Harish Puranik","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Krishna Kumar","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Praveen S Battepatti","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Deepu N K","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mayur Shetty","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"orthopedics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.06.20189258","rel_title":"Superspreaders and High Variance Infectious Diseases","rel_date":"2020-09-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.06.20189258","rel_abs":"A well-known characteristic of pandemics such as COVID-19 is the high level of transmission heterogeneity in the infection spread: not all infected individuals spread the disease at the same rate and some individuals (superspreaders) are responsible for most of the infections.

Working in the framework of stochastic branching processes, we derive an approximate analytical formula for the probability of an outbreak in the high variance regime of the infection distribution, verify it numerically and analyze its regime of validity in various examples.We show that it is possible for an outbreak not to occur in the high variance regime even when the basic reproduction number R0 is larger than one and discuss the implications of our results for COVID-19 and other pandemics.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shmuel Safra","author_inst":"Tel Aviv university"},{"author_name":"Yaron Oz","author_inst":"Tel Aviv university"},{"author_name":"Ittai Rubinstein","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University"},{"author_name":"Muniramaiah Ravishankar","author_inst":"Hosmat hospital"},{"author_name":"Krishan Prasad","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chetan Rai","author_inst":"Hosmat hospital"},{"author_name":"Chetan A","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Girish Vijayakumar","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Noel nalin kumar","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Harshavardhan v","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Harish Puranik","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Krishna Kumar","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Praveen S Battepatti","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Deepu N K","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mayur Shetty","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.04.20188110","rel_title":"Modelling the transmission of infectious diseases inside hospital bays: implications for Covid-19","rel_date":"2020-09-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.04.20188110","rel_abs":"Healthcare associated transmission of viral infections is a major problem that has significant economic costs and can lead to loss of life. Infections with the highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus have been shown to have a high prevalence in hospitals around the world. The spread of this virus might be impacted by the density of patients inside hospital bays. To investigate this aspect, in this study we consider a mathematical modelling and computational approach to describe the spread of SARS-CoV-2 among hospitalised patients. We focus on 4-bed bays and 6-bed bays, which are commonly used to accommodate various non-Covid-19 patients in many hospitals across UK. We use this mathematical model to investigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections among patients in non-Covid bays, in the context of various scenarios: changes in the number of contacts with infected patients and staff, having symptomatic vs. asymptomatic patients, removing infected individuals from these hospital bays once they are known to be infected, and the role of periodic testing of hospitalised patients. Our results show that 4-bed bays reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 compared to 6-bed bays. Moreover, we show that the position of a new (not infected) patient in specific beds in a 6-bed bay might also slow the spread of the disease. Finally, we propose that regular SARS-CoV-2 testing of hospitalised patients would allow appropriate placement of infected patients in specific (Covid-only) hospital bays.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Moreno Martos","author_inst":"University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Parcell","author_inst":"NHS Tayside"},{"author_name":"Raluca Eftimie","author_inst":"University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Muniramaiah Ravishankar","author_inst":"Hosmat hospital"},{"author_name":"Krishan Prasad","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chetan Rai","author_inst":"Hosmat hospital"},{"author_name":"Chetan A","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Girish Vijayakumar","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Noel nalin kumar","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Harshavardhan v","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Harish Puranik","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Krishna Kumar","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Praveen S Battepatti","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Deepu N K","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mayur Shetty","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.05.20189142","rel_title":"Development and Validation of the Patient History COVID-19 (PH-Covid19) Scoring System: A Multivariable Prediction Model of Death in Mexican Patients with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-09-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.05.20189142","rel_abs":"We sought to develop and validate a multivariable prediction model of death in Mexican patients with COVID-19, by using demographic and patient history predictors.

To validate the model, 592,160 patients studied between June 1 and July 23, 2020 were included. Patients with a positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 and complete unduplicated data were eligible. Demographic and patient history variables were analyzed through Multivariable Cox regression models to evaluate predictors to be included in the prognostic scoring system called PH-Covid19. 83,779 patients were included to develop the model; 100,000, to validate the model. Eight predictors (age, sex, diabetes, COPD, immunosuppression, hypertension, obesity, and CKD) were included in the PH-Covid19 scoring system (range of values: -2 to 25 points). The predictive model has a discrimination of death of 0.8 (95%CI:0.796-0.804). The PH-Covid19 scoring system was developed and validated in Mexican patients to aid clinicians to stratify patients with COVID-19 at risk of fatal outcomes, allowing for better and efficient use of resources.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Javier Mancilla-Galindo","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Cardiologia"},{"author_name":"Juan Mauricio Vera-Zertuche","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Slavador Zubiran"},{"author_name":"Addi Rhode Navarro-Cruz","author_inst":"Benemerita Universidad Autonoma de Puebla"},{"author_name":"Orietta Segura-Badilla","author_inst":"Universidad del Bio-Bio"},{"author_name":"Gerardo Reyez-Velazquez","author_inst":"Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social"},{"author_name":"Francisco Javier Tepepa-Lopez","author_inst":"Instituto Politecnico Nacional"},{"author_name":"Patricia Aguilar-Alonso","author_inst":"Benemerita Universidad Autonoma de Puebla"},{"author_name":"Jose de Jesus Vidal-Mayo","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran"},{"author_name":"Ashuin Kammar-Garcia","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran"},{"author_name":"Harshavardhan v","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Harish Puranik","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Krishna Kumar","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Praveen S Battepatti","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Deepu N K","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mayur Shetty","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.06.20189373","rel_title":"The impact of mobility restriction measures on the reproduction index of Covid-19 in the city of Queretaro, Mexico","rel_date":"2020-09-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.06.20189373","rel_abs":"An observational study based on official data (CONACYT and Ministry of Health) was carried out in which the effective reproduction index R(e) and the reproduction index R0 are compared with the mobility presented by Google. Additionally, an overview of the development of the pandemic in Queretaro, Mexico. Highlights key events; such as the main government interventions and social factors that could affect the society behavior. A positive relationship is observed between Re, R0, and the levels of mobility presented by Google. This indicates that an increase in mobility is associated with the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. In February, a significant decrease in mobility is observed, which lasts until approximately May 1st. This period corresponds to an R0 and R(e) between 1.17 and 1.87. After May 1st, there is a sustained increase in mobility levels. And, as of May 16, the effective reproduction index R (e) and the reproduction index R0 begin to increase. This is expected as it reflects the delay between the infection and the diagnosis of COVID-19. The R0 and R (e) increase from 1.45 on May 16 to 3.59 on July 5. According to the baseline of normal mobility levels, an increase from -49.6% on May 1st, to -20.6% on July 5 was observed. Based on these data, we conclude that the relaxation of restrictive mobility measures should be reconsidered. Despite this, mobility restrictions must not be a unique mitigation strategy for controlling the Reproductive Index. A comprehensive approach is needed, which generates socio-behavioral changes that allow a further reduction in reproductive rates.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Oscar San Roman Orozco","author_inst":"New York University, School of Global Public Health, Applied Global Public Health Initiative"},{"author_name":"Santiago Agraz Orozco","author_inst":"Universidad Anahuac Queretaro, School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Isidro A Gutierrez Alvarez","author_inst":"Universidad Autonoma de Queretaro, School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Vasiliki Radaios","author_inst":"New York University, School of Global Public Health, Applied Global Public Health Initiative"},{"author_name":"Gerardo Reyez-Velazquez","author_inst":"Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social"},{"author_name":"Francisco Javier Tepepa-Lopez","author_inst":"Instituto Politecnico Nacional"},{"author_name":"Patricia Aguilar-Alonso","author_inst":"Benemerita Universidad Autonoma de Puebla"},{"author_name":"Jose de Jesus Vidal-Mayo","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran"},{"author_name":"Ashuin Kammar-Garcia","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran"},{"author_name":"Harshavardhan v","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Harish Puranik","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Krishna Kumar","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Praveen S Battepatti","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Deepu N K","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mayur Shetty","author_inst":"Hosmat Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.09.03.20187252","rel_title":"Convalescent plasma in the management of moderate COVID-19 in India: An open-label parallel-arm phase II multicentre randomized controlled trial (PLACID Trial)","rel_date":"2020-09-08","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.03.20187252","rel_abs":"Objectives: Convalescent plasma (CP) as a passive source of neutralizing antibodies and immunomodulators is a century-old therapeutic option used for the management of viral diseases. We investigated its effectiveness for the treatment of COVID-19. Design: Open-label, parallel-arm, phase II, multicentre, randomized controlled trial. Setting: Thirty-nine public and private hospitals across India. Participants: Hospitalized, moderately ill confirmed COVID-19 patients (PaO2\/FiO2: 200-300 or respiratory rate > 24\/min and SpO2 [&le;] 93% on room air). Intervention: Participants were randomized to either control (best standard of care (BSC)) or intervention (CP + BSC) arm. Two doses of 200 mL CP was transfused 24 hours apart in the intervention arm. Main Outcome Measure: Composite of progression to severe disease (PaO2\/FiO2<100) or all-cause mortality at 28 days post-enrolment. Results: Between 22 nd April to 14 th July 2020, 464 participants were enrolled; 235 and 229 in intervention and control arm, respectively. Composite primary outcome was achieved in 44 (18.7%) participants in the intervention arm and 41 (17.9%) in the control arm [aOR: 1.09; 95% CI: 0.67, 1.77]. Mortality was documented in 34 (14.5%) and 31 (13.5%) participants in intervention and control arm, respectively [aOR) 1.06 95% CI: 0.61 to 1.83]. Interpretation: CP was not associated with reduction in mortality or progression to severe COVID-19. This trial has high generalizability and approximates real-life setting of CP therapy in settings with limited laboratory capacity. A priori measurement of neutralizing antibody titres in donors and participants may further clarify the role of CP in management of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":264,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anup Agarwal","author_inst":"Clinical Trial & Health Systems Research Unit,  Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Aparna Mukherjee","author_inst":"Clinical Trial & Health Systems Research Unit, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Gunjan Kumar","author_inst":"Clinical Trial & Health Systems Research Unit,  Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Pranab Chatterjee","author_inst":"Scientist B,  Translational Global Health Policy and Research Cell,  Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Tarun Bhatnagar","author_inst":"ICMR School of Public Health,  Indian Council of Medical Research -National Institute of Epidemiology, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India"},{"author_name":"Pankaj Malhotra","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine,  Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India"},{"author_name":"B Latha","author_inst":"Department of Transfusion Medicine, Madras Medical College, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India"},{"author_name":"Sunita Bundas","author_inst":"Department of Immunohaematology and Transfusion Medicine, SMS Medical College and Hospital, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India"},{"author_name":"Vivek Kumar","author_inst":"Dept. of Critical Care Medicine,  Sir H N Reliance Foundation Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India"},{"author_name":"Ravi Dosi","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine,  Sri Aurobindo Institute of Medical Sciences, Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India"},{"author_name":"Janak Kumar Khambholja","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine,  Smt NHL Municipal Medical College, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India"},{"author_name":"Rosemarie de Souza","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine,  BYL Nair Charitable Hospital & TN Medical College, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India"},{"author_name":"Raja Rao Mesipogu","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine,  Gandhi Medical College, Hyderabad, Telangana, India"},{"author_name":"Saurabh Srivastava","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, Government Institute of Medical Sciences, Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India"},{"author_name":"Simmi Dube","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine,  Gandhi Medical College, Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India"},{"author_name":"Kiran Chaudhary","author_inst":"Department of Transfusion Medicine,  Atal Bihari Vajpayee Institute of Medical Sciences and Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Subash S","author_inst":"Department of Transfusion Medicine,  Madras Medical College, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India"},{"author_name":"S.

response triggered by SARS-CoV-2 in severely affected COVID-19 patients, as reflected by activated B cells egressing into the blood, at the single cell level. Early on, before seroconversion in response to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, activated peripheral B cells displayed a type 1 interferon-induced gene expression signature. After seroconversion, activated B cells lost this signature, expressed IL-21- and TGF-{beta}-induced gene expression signatures, and mostly IgG1 and IgA1. In the sustained immune reaction of the COVID-19 patients, until day 59, activated peripheral B cells shifted to expression of IgA2, reflecting instruction by TGF-{beta}. Despite the continued generation of activated B cells, those cells were not found in the lungs of deceased COVID-19 patients, nor did the IgA2 bind to dominant antigens of SARS-CoV-2. In severe COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 thus triggers a chronic immune reaction distracted from itself and instructed by TGF-{beta}.","rel_num_authors":42,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marta Ferreira-Gomes","author_inst":"Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ), an Institute of the Leibniz Association"},{"author_name":"Andrey Kruglov","author_inst":"Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ), an Institute of the Leibniz Association"},{"author_name":"Pawel Durek","author_inst":"Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ), an Institute of the Leibniz Association"},{"author_name":"Frederik Heinrich","author_inst":"Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ), an Institute of the Leibniz Association,"},{"author_name":"Caroline Tizian","author_inst":"Laboratory of Innate Immunity, Department of Microbiology and Infection Immunology, Charite-Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Gitta Anne Heinz","author_inst":"Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ), an Institute of the Leibniz Association,"},{"author_name":"Anna Pascual-Reguant","author_inst":"Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ), an Institute of the Leibniz Association"},{"author_name":"Weijie Du","author_inst":"Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ), an Institute of the Leibniz Association"},{"author_name":"Ronja Mothes","author_inst":"Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ), an Institute of the Leibniz Association"},{"author_name":"Chaofan Fan","author_inst":"Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ), an Institute of the Leibniz Association"},{"author_name":"Stefan Frischbutter","author_inst":"Dermatological Allergology, Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Charite-Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Katharina Habenicht","author_inst":"Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Lisa Budzinski","author_inst":"Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ), an Institute of the Leibniz Association"},{"author_name":"Justus Ninnemann","author_inst":"Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ), an Institute of the Leibniz Association"},{"author_name":"Peter K.

used to investigate the influence of SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins on the function of human cells, laying out a deeper understanding of COVID--19 and providing ground for drug repurposing strategies. However, our knowledge of (dis)similarities between this one and other viral agents is still very limited. Here we compare the novel coronavirus PPI network against 45 known viruses, from the perspective of statistical physics. Our results show that classic analysis such as percolation is not sensitive to the distinguishing features of viruses, whereas the analysis of biochemical spreading patterns allows us to meaningfully categorize the viruses and quantitatively compare their impact on human proteins. Remarkably, when Gibbsian-like density matrices are used to represent each system's state, the corresponding macroscopic statistical properties measured by the spectral entropy reveals the existence of clusters of viruses at multiple scales. Overall, our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits similarities to viruses like SARS-CoV and Influenza A at small scales, while at larger scales it exhibits more similarities to viruses such as HIV1 and HTLV1.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arsham Ghavasieh","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Sebastiano Bontorin","author_inst":"Universita' degli Studi di Trento and Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Oriol Artime","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Manlio De Domenico","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Caroline Tizian","author_inst":"Laboratory of Innate Immunity, Department of Microbiology and Infection Immunology, Charite-Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Gitta Anne Heinz","author_inst":"Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ), an Institute of the Leibniz Association,"},{"author_name":"Anna Pascual-Reguant","author_inst":"Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ), an Institute of the Leibniz Association"},{"author_name":"Weijie Du","author_inst":"Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ), an Institute of the Leibniz Association"},{"author_name":"Ronja Mothes","author_inst":"Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ), an Institute of the Leibniz Association"},{"author_name":"Chaofan Fan","author_inst":"Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ), an Institute of the Leibniz Association"},{"author_name":"Stefan Frischbutter","author_inst":"Dermatological Allergology, Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Charite-Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Katharina Habenicht","author_inst":"Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Lisa Budzinski","author_inst":"Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ), an Institute of the Leibniz Association"},{"author_name":"Justus Ninnemann","author_inst":"Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ), an Institute of the Leibniz Association"},{"author_name":"Peter K.

SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-09-08","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.07.286666","rel_abs":"Past experiments demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 inactivation by simulated sunlight; models have considered exclusively mechanisms involving UVB acting directly on RNA. However, UVA inactivation has been demonstrated for other enveloped RNA viruses, through indirect mechanisms involving the suspension medium. We propose a model combining UVB and UVA inactivation for SARS-CoV-2, which improves predictions by accounting for effects associated with the medium. UVA sensitivities deduced for SARS-CoV-2 are consistent with data for SARS-CoV-1 under UVA only. This analysis calls for experiments to separately assess effects of UVA and UVB in different media, and for including UVA in inactivation models.\n\nLay summaryRecent experiments have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 is inactivated by simulated sunlight; however, there are still many unknowns, including the mechanism of action and which part of the light spectrum is principally responsible. Our analysis indicates the need for targeted experiments that can separately assess the effects of UVA and UVB on SARS-CoV-2, and that sunlight inactivation models may need to be expanded to also include the effect of UVA. A first UVA-inclusive model is also proposed here. These findings have implications for how to improve the safety of the built environment, and for the seasonality of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paolo Luzzatto-Fegiz","author_inst":"University of California, Santa Barbara"},{"author_name":"Fernando Temprano-Coleto","author_inst":"University of California Santa Barbara"},{"author_name":"Francois J Peaudecerf","author_inst":"Institute for Environmental Engineering, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Julien R Landel","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, University of Manchester, UK"},{"author_name":"Yangying Zhu","author_inst":"Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"},{"author_name":"Julie A McMurry","author_inst":"Oregon State University"},{"author_name":"Anna Pascual-Reguant","author_inst":"Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ), an Institute of the Leibniz Association"},{"author_name":"Weijie Du","author_inst":"Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ), an Institute of the Leibniz Association"},{"author_name":"Ronja Mothes","author_inst":"Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ), an Institute of the Leibniz Association"},{"author_name":"Chaofan Fan","author_inst":"Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ), an Institute of the Leibniz Association"},{"author_name":"Stefan Frischbutter","author_inst":"Dermatological Allergology, Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Charite-Universitaetsmedizin Berlin"},{"author_name":"Katharina Habenicht","author_inst":"Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Lisa Budzinski","author_inst":"Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ), an Institute of the Leibniz Association"},{"author_name":"Justus Ninnemann","author_inst":"Deutsches Rheuma-Forschungszentrum (DRFZ), an Institute of the Leibniz Association"},{"author_name":"Peter K.

mutations.","rel_date":"2020-09-08","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.08.287201","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus, the etiologic agent of the novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In December 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 began in Wuhan province of the Hubei district in China and rapidly spread across the globe. On March 11th, 2020, the World Health Organization officially designated COVID-19 as a pandemic. Across the continents and specifically in Africa, all index cases were travel related. Thus, it is crucial to compare COVID-19 genome sequences from the African continent with sequences from COVID-19 hotspots (including China, Brazil, Italy, United State of America and the United Kingdom). To identify if there are distinguishing mutations in the African SARS-CoV-2 genomes compared to genomes from other countries, including disease hotspots, we conducted in silico analyses and comparisons. Complete African SARS-CoV-2 genomes deposited in GISAID and NCBI databases as of June 2020 were downloaded and aligned with genomes from Wuhan, China and other SARS-CoV-2 hotspots. Using phylogenetic analysis and amino acid sequence alignments of the spike and replicase (NSP12) proteins, we searched for possible targets for vaccine coverage or potential therapeutic agents. Our results showed a similarity between the African SARS-CoV-2 genomes and genomes in countries including China, Brazil, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, France and the United States of America. This study shows for the first time, an in-depth analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 landscape across Africa and will potentially provide insights into specific mutations to relevant proteins in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes in African populations.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Benson C.

primates","rel_date":"2020-09-08","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.08.280818","rel_abs":"To contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a safe and effective vaccine against the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is urgently needed in quantities sufficient to immunise large populations. In this study, we report the design, preclinical development, immunogenicity and anti-viral protective effect in rhesus macaques of the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate. BNT162b2 contains an LNP-formulated nucleoside-modified mRNA that encodes the spike glycoprotein captured in its prefusion conformation. After expression of the BNT162b2 coding sequence in cells, approximately 20% of the spike molecules are in the one-RBD  up, two-RBD  down state. Immunisation of mice with a single dose of BNT162b2 induced dose level-dependent increases in pseudovirus neutralisation titers. Prime-boost vaccination of rhesus macaques elicited authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralising geometric mean titers 10.2 to 18.0 times that of a SARS-CoV-2 convalescent human serum panel. BNT162b2 generated strong TH1 type CD4+ and IFN{gamma}+ CD8+ T-cell responses in mice and rhesus macaques. The BNT162b2 vaccine candidate fully protected the lungs of immunised rhesus macaques from infectious SARS-CoV-2 challenge. BNT162b2 is currently being evaluated in a global, pivotal Phase 2\/3 trial (NCT04368728).","rel_num_authors":61,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Annette Vogel","author_inst":"BioNTech RNA

neutralization","rel_date":"2020-09-08","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.08.287482","rel_abs":"Convalescent plasma from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals and monoclonal antibodies were shown to potently neutralize viral and pseudoviral particles carrying the S glycoprotein. However, a non-negligent proportion of plasma samples from infected individuals as well as S-specific monoclonal antibodies were reported to be non-neutralizing despite efficient interaction with the S glycoprotein in different biochemical assays using soluble recombinant forms of S or when expressed at the cell surface. How neutralization relates to binding of S glycoprotein in the context of viral particles remains to be established. Here we developed a pseudovirus capture assay (VCA) to measure the capacity of plasma samples or antibodies immobilized on ELISA plates to bind to membrane-bound S glycoproteins from SARS-CoV-2 expressed at the surface of lentiviral particles. By performing VCA and neutralization assays we observed a strong correlation between these two parameters. However, while we found that plasma samples unable to capture viral particles did not neutralize, capture did not guarantee neutralization, indicating that the capacity of antibodies to bind to the S glycoprotein at the surface of viral particles is required but not sufficient to mediate neutralization. Altogether, our results highlights the importance of better understanding the inactivation of S by plasma and neutralizing antibodies.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shilei

concentrations","rel_date":"2020-09-08","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.07.286906","rel_abs":"ObjectivesSARS-CoV-2 infection is the cause of a worldwide pandemic, currently with limited therapeutic options. It is characterised by being highly contagious and nasal mucosa appears to be the primary site with subsequent spread to the lungs and elsewhere. BromAc (Bromelain & Acetylcysteine) has been described to disrupt glycoproteins by the synchronous breakage of glycosidic linkages and disulphide bonds. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is an attractive target as it is essential for binding to the ACE2 receptor in host cells and is formed of glycoprotein and disulphide bridges for stabilisation. Hence, we sought to determine whether BromAc has activity on the spike and envelope protein specific to SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\nDesignGel electrophoresis analysis was carried out on recombinant spike and envelope proteins that were treated with a range of concentrations of single agents and BromAc. For UV analysis of disulfide bonds reduction, both spike and envelope protein were treated with Acetylcysteine with the determination of loss of disulfide bonds.\n\nResultsRecombinant spike and envelope SARS-CoV-2 protein were fragmented by BromAc whilst single agents had minimal effect. Spike and envelope proteins disulphide bonds were reduced by Acetylcysteine.\n\nConclusionBromAc disintegrates the spike and envelope protein from SARS-CoV-2 and may render it non-infective. In vitro tests on live virus have been encouraging and clinical testing through nasal administration in patients with early SARS-CoV-2 infection is imminent.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Javed Akhter","author_inst":"St George Hospital"},{"author_name":"Krishna Pillai","author_inst":"St George

glycoproteins","rel_date":"2020-09-08","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.07.286567","rel_abs":"A novel severe acute respiratory (SARS)-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the current global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, infecting millions of people and causing hundreds of thousands of deaths. The viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 depends on an interaction between the receptor binding domain of its trimeric Spike glycoprotein and the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. A better understanding of the Spike\/ACE2 interaction is still required to design anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics. Here, we investigated the degree of cooperativity of ACE2 within both the SARS-CoV-2 and the closely related SARS-CoV-1 membrane-bound S glycoproteins. We show that there exist differential inter-protomer conformational transitions between both Spike trimers. Interestingly, the SARS-CoV-2 spike exhibits a positive cooperativity for monomeric soluble ACE2 binding when compared to the SARS-CoV-1 spike, which might have more structural restrains. Our findings can be of importance in the development of therapeutics that block the Spike\/ACE2 interaction.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sai Priya Anand","author_inst":"CRCHUM

population","rel_date":"2020-09-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.04.20188268","rel_abs":"BACKGROUND Recent studies suggest a link between vitamin D deficiency and Covid-19 infection. In our population we observe major differences in Covid-19 incidence in ethnic groups and genders in each group. METHODS We carried out a population-based study among 4.6 million members of Clalit Health Services (CHS). We collected results from vitamin D tests performed between 2010 and 2019 and used weighted linear regression to assess the relationship between prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and Covid-19 incidence in 200 localities. Additionally, we matched 52,405 infected patients with 524,050 control individuals of the same sex, age, geographical region and used conditional logistic regression to assess the relationship between baseline vitamin D levels, acquisition of vitamin D supplements in the last 4 months, and positive Covid-19. RESULTS We observe a highly significant correlation between prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and Covid-19 incidence, and between female-to-male ratio for severe vitamin D deficiency and female-to-male ratio for Covid-19 incidence in localities (P<0.001). In the matched cohort, we found a significant association between low vitamin D levels and the risk of Covid-19, with the highest risk observed for severe vitamin D deficiency. A significant protective effect was observed for members who acquired liquid vitamin D formulations (drops) in the last 4 months. CONCLUSION In this large observational population study, we show a strong association between vitamin D deficiency and Covid-19 occurrence. After adjustment for baseline characteristics and prior vitamin D levels, acquisition of liquid vitamin D formulations is associated with decreased risk for Covid-19 infection.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ariel Israel","author_inst":"Clalit Health Services"},{"author_name":"Assi Albert Cicurel","author_inst":"Clalit Health

Ethiopia","rel_date":"2020-09-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.04.20188094","rel_abs":"As the 15 of June 2020, we have 7,984,067 total COVID-19 cases, globally and 435,181 total deaths. Ethiopia was ranked 2nd and 15th in the table by 176 new cases and by 3,521 total new cases from African countries. Then, this study aimed to predict COVID-19 new cases and new deaths based on May\/June data in Ethiopia using regression model. In this study, I used Pearson correlation analysis and the linear regression model to predict COVID-19 new cases and new deaths based on the available data from 12th May to 10th June 2020 in Ethiopia. There was a significant positive correlation between COVID-19 new cases and new deaths with different related variables. In the regression models, the simple linear regression model was a better fit the data of COVID-19 new cases and new deaths than as compared with quadratic and cubic regression models. In the multiple linear regression model, variables such as the number of days, the number of new laboratory tests, and the number of new cases from AA city significantly predicted the COVID-19 new cases. In this model, the number of days and new recoveries significantly predicted new deaths of COVID-19. The number of days, daily laboratory tests, and new cases from Addis Ababa city significantly predicted new COVID-19 cases, and the number of days and new recoveries significantly predicted new deaths from COVID-19. According to this analysis, if strong preventions and action are not taken in the country, the predicted values of COVID-19 new cases and new deaths will be 590 and 12 after two months (after 9th of August) from now, respectively. The researcher recommended that the Ethiopia government, Ministry of Health and Addis Ababa city administrative should give more awareness and protections for societies, and they should also open more COVID-19 laboratory testing centers. Generally, the obtained results of this study may help Ethiopian decision-makers put short-term future plans to face this epidemic.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alemayehu Siffir

Scenarios","rel_date":"2020-09-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.04.20188102","rel_abs":"Objectives As of August 24th 2020, there have been 1,084,904 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 and 24,683 deaths across the African continent. Despite relatively lower numbers of cases initially, many African countries are now experiencing an exponential increase in case numbers. Estimates of the progression of disease and potential impact of different interventions are needed to inform policy making decisions. Herein, we model the possible trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in 52 African countries under different intervention scenarios. Design We developed a compartmental model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to estimate the COVID-19 case burden for all African countries while considering four scenarios: no intervention, moderate lockdown, hard lockdown, and hard lockdown with continued restrictions once lockdown is lifted. We further analyzed the potential impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable populations affected by HIV\/AIDS and TB. Results In the absence of an intervention, the most populous countries had the highest peaks in active projected number of infections with Nigeria having an estimated 645,081 severe infections. The scenario with a hard lockdown and continued post-lockdown interventions to reduce transmission was the most efficacious strategy for delaying the time to the peak and reducing the number of cases. In South Africa projected peak severe infections increase from 162,977 to 203,261, when vulnerable populations with HIV\/AIDS and TB are included in the analysis. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly spreading across the African continent. Estimates of the potential impact of interventions and burden of disease are essential for policy makers to make evidence-based decisions on the distribution of limited resources and to balance the economic costs of interventions with the potential for saving lives.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Isabel Frost","author_inst":"Center for Disease Dynamics Economics &

pneumonia.","rel_date":"2020-09-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.01.20184390","rel_abs":"At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was high mortality and a lack of effective treatment for critically ill patients. Build on the experience in argentine hemorrhagic fever with convalescent plasma, we incorporated 90 patients into a multicenter study, and 87 were evaluable. We collected 397 donations from 278 convalescent donors. Patients received plasma with an IgG concentration of 0.7-0.8 (measured by Abbott chemiluminescence) for every 10 kg of body weight. Survival during the first 28 days was the primary objective. 77% were male, age 54 (+\/-15.6 y\/o (range 27-85); body mass index 29.7 +\/-; 4,4; hypertension 39% and diabetes 20%; 19.5% had an immunosuppression condition; 23% were healthcare workers. Plasma was administered to 55 patients (63%) on spontaneous breathing with oxygen supplementation (mainly oxygen mask with reservoir bag in 80%), and 32 patients (37%) were infused on mechanical ventilation. The 28-day survival rate was 80%, with 91% in patients infused on spontaneous breathing and 63% in those infused on mechanical ventilation (p = 0.0002). There was a significant improvement in the WHO pneumonia clinical scale at 7 and 14 days, and in PaO2 \/ FiO2, ferritin and LDH, in the week post-infusion. We observed an episode of circulatory volume overload and a febrile reaction, both mild. Convalescent plasma infusions are feasible, safe, and potentially effective, especially before requiring mechanical ventilation, and are an attractive clinical option for treating severe forms of COVID-19 until other effective therapies become available.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ricardo Valentini","author_inst":"Centro de Educacion Medica e Investigaciones

reducing the COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-09-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.04.20187849","rel_abs":"Background: Currently, the 2019-nCoV has spread to most countries of the world. Understanding the environmental factors that affect the spread of the disease COVID-19 infection is critical to stop the spread of the disease. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether population density is associated with the infection rate of the COVID-19. Methods: We collected data from official webpages of cities in China and in the US. The data were uploaded on Excel spreadsheets for statistical analyses. We calculated the morbidity and population density of cities and regions in these two countries. We then examined the relationship between the morbidity and other factors. Results: Our analysis indicated that the population density in cities in Hubei province where the COVID-19 was severe was associated with a higher percentage of morbidity, with an r value of 0.62. Similarly, in the US, the density of 51 states and territories is also associated with morbidity from COVID-19 with an r value of 0.55. In contrast, as a control group, there is no association between the morbidity and population density in 33 other regions of China, where the COVID-19 epidemic is well under control. Interestingly, our study also indicated that these associations were not influenced by the first case of COVID-19. The rate of morbidity and the number of days from the first case in the US has no association, with an r value of -0.1288. Conclusions: Population density is positively associated with the percentage of patients with COVID-19 infection in the population. Our data support the importance of such as social distancing and travel restriction in the prevention of COVID-19 spread.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Heliang Yin","author_inst":"Center of Integrative Research, The First Hospital of Qiqihar City, Qiqihar, Heilongjiang 161005, P.R.

accessing routine childhood vaccinations during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic: A mixed methods study in England","rel_date":"2020-09-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.04.20186569","rel_abs":"Objective: To explore parents' and guardians' views and experiences of accessing National Health Service (NHS) general practices for routine childhood vaccinations during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in England. Design: Mixed methods approach involving an online cross-sectional survey (conducted between 19th April and 11th May 2020) and semi-structured telephone interviews (conducted between 27th April and 27th May 2020). Participants: 1252 parents and guardians (aged 16+ years) who reported living in England with a child aged 18 months or under completed the survey. Nineteen survey respondents took part in follow-up interviews. Results: The majority of survey respondents (85.7%) considered it important for their children to receive routine vaccinations on schedule during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, several barriers to vaccination were identified. These included a lack of clarity around whether vaccination services were operating as usual, particularly amongst respondents from lower income households and those self-reporting as Black, Asian, Chinese, Mixed or Other ethnicity; difficulties in organising vaccination appointments; and fears around contracting COVID-19 while attending general practice. Concerns about catching COVID-19 while accessing general practice were weighed against concerns about children acquiring a vaccine-preventable disease if they did not receive scheduled routine childhood vaccinations. Many parents and guardians felt their child's risk of acquiring a vaccine-preventable disease was low as the implementation of stringent physical distancing measures (from March 23rd 2020) meant they were not mixing with others. Conclusion: To promote routine childhood vaccination uptake during the current COVID-19 outbreak, further waves of COVID-19 infection, and future pandemics, prompt and sustained national and general practice level communication is needed to raise awareness of vaccination service continuation and the importance of timely vaccination, and invitation-reminder systems for vaccination need to be maintained. To allay concerns about the safety of accessing general practice, practices should communicate the measures being implemented to prevent COVID-19 transmission.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sadie L Bell","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Richard Clarke","author_inst":"Newcastle University London"},{"author_name":"Pauline Paterson","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sandra Mounier-Jack","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ma Li","author_inst":"Center of Integrative Research, The First Hospital of Qiqihar City, Qiqihar, Heilongjiang 161005, P.R.

protocol","rel_date":"2020-09-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.04.20187971","rel_abs":"Objective: The main objectives of this review are to summarise the existing literature and to identify strategies for exiting lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on reopening schools and returning to work. Introduction: After months of strict quarantine, several countries are planning exit strategies to progressively lift social restrictions without giving rise to an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. Although several strategies have been studied in terms of how and when to relax such stringent constraints, there is a lack of consensus on the optimal strategy for managing the pandemic beyond lockdown. The risks posed by delaying return to work and school openings are real and sizeable, particularly for relevant working sectors and for students from low-income families Inclusion criteria: This review will consider studies that focussed on relaxation strategies for lockdown exit among workers and students facing an epidemic \/pandemic crisis. Methods: The searches will be conducted across four databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, SciSearch, Google Scholar), and the bibliography of all selected studies will be hand-searched. In addition, because the topic is new, relevant literature will be checked using daily, updated COVID-19 collections from NCBI (LitCovid) and MedRxiv servers. Studies published in English, German, Spanish, Italian and French will be included, with no limits on publication dates. This review will consider all study designs, regardless of their rigor. The review method will be based on a two-phase approach: a title and abstract screening, and a full-text review performed by two independent researchers. Data will be summarised and categorised, and results will be presented in a tabular\/diagrammatic form.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniela D'Angelo Sr.","author_inst":"National Center of Clinical Excellence, Healthcare Quality and Safety (CNEC), National Institute of Health, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Daniela Coclite Sr.","author_inst":"National Center of Clinical Excellence, Healthcare Quality and Safety (CNEC), National Institute of Health, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Antonello Napoletano Sr.","author_inst":"National Center of Clinical Excellence, Healthcare Quality and Safety (CNEC), National Institute of Health, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alice Josephine Fauci Sr.","author_inst":"National Center of Clinical Excellence, Healthcare Quality and Safety (CNEC), National Institute of Health, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Roberto Latina Sr.","author_inst":"National Center of Clinical Excellence, Healthcare Quality and Safety (CNEC), National Institute of Health, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Laura Iacorossi Sr.","author_inst":"National Center of Clinical Excellence, Healthcare Quality and Safety (CNEC), National Institute of Health, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marco Di Nitto Sr.","author_inst":"Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata.

production and test capacity of FFP2-respirators. Such facemasks are required to be worn by healthcare professionals when performing aerosol-generating procedures on COVID-19 patients. In response to the high demand and short supply, we designed three models of facemasks that are suitable for local production. As these facemasks should meet the requirements of an FFP2-certified facemask, the newly-designed facemasks were tested on the filtration efficiency of the filter material, inward leakage, and breathing resistance with custom-made experimental setups. In these tests, the locally-produced facemasks were benchmarked against a commercial FFP2 facemask. Furthermore, the protective capacity of the facemasks was tested for the first time with coronavirus-loaded aerosols under physiologically relevant conditions. This multidisciplinary effort resulted in the design and production of facemasks that meet the FFP2 requirements, and which can be mass-produced at local production facilities.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bob Boogaard","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Joep Nijssen","author_inst":"Delft University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Freek Broeren","author_inst":"Delft University of Technology"},{"author_name":"John van den Dobbelsteen","author_inst":"Delft University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Vincent Verhoeven","author_inst":"Reinier de Graaf Gasthuis"},{"author_name":"Jip Pluim","author_inst":"Reinier de Graaf Gasthuis"},{"author_name":"Sing Dekker","author_inst":"Reinier de Graaf Gasthuis"},{"author_name":"Eric Snijder","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC)"},{"author_name":"Martijn van Hemert","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC)"},{"author_name":"Sander Herfst","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Hong Chen","author_inst":"Center of Integrative Research, The First Hospital of Qiqihar City, Qiqihar, Heilongjiang 161005, P.R.

cohort study","rel_date":"2020-09-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.02.20185892","rel_abs":"Objectives: The World Health Organisation (WHO) and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommend various triage tools to assist decision-making for patients with suspected COVID-19. We aimed to estimate the accuracy of triage tools for predicting severe illness in adults presenting to the emergency department (ED) with suspected COVID-19 infection. Methods: We undertook a mixed prospective and retrospective observational cohort study in 70 EDs across the United Kingdom (UK). We collected data from people attending with suspected COVID-19 between 26 March 2020 and 28 May 2020, and used presenting data to determine the results of assessment with the following triage tools: the WHO algorithm, NEWS2, CURB-65, CRB-65, PMEWS and the swine flu adult hospital pathway (SFAHP). We used 30-day outcome data (death or receipt of respiratory, cardiovascular or renal support) to determine prognostic accuracy for adverse outcome. Results: We analysed data from 20892 adults, of whom 4672 (22.4%) died or received organ support (primary outcome), with 2058 (9.9%) receiving organ support and 2614 (12.5%) dying without organ support (secondary outcomes). C-statistics for the primary outcome were: CURB-65 0.75; CRB-65 0.70; PMEWS 0.77; NEWS2 (score) 0.77; NEWS2 (rule) 0.69; SFAHP (6-point) 0.70; SFAHP (7-point) 0.68; WHO algorithm 0.61. All triage tools showed worse prediction for receipt of organ support and better prediction for death without organ support. At the recommended threshold, PMEWS and the WHO criteria showed good sensitivity (0.96 and 0.95 respectively), at the expense of specificity (0.31 and 0.27 respectively). NEWS2 showed similar sensitivity (0.96) and specificity (0.28) when a lower threshold than recommended was used. Conclusion: CURB-65, PMEWS and NEWS2 provide good but not excellent prediction for adverse outcome in suspected COVID-19, and predicted death without organ support better than receipt of organ support. PMEWS, the WHO criteria and NEWS2 (using a lower threshold than usually recommended) provide good sensitivity at the expense of specificity.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ben

study","rel_date":"2020-09-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.04.20185645","rel_abs":"Importance: The spread of COVID-19 has led to a severe strain on hospital capacity in many countries. There is a need for a model to help planners assess expected COVID-19 hospital resource utilization. Objective: Provide publicly available tools for predicting future hospital-bed utilization given a succinct characterization of the status of currently hospitalized patients and scenarios for future incoming patients. Design: Retrospective cohort study following the day-by-day clinical status of all hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Israel from March 1st to May 2nd, 2020. Patient clinical course was modelled with a machine learning approach based on a set of multistate Cox regression-based models with adjustments for right censoring, recurrent events, competing events, left truncation, and time-dependent covariates. The model predicts the patient's entire disease course in terms of clinical states, from which we derive the patient's hospital length-of-stay, length-of-stay in critical state, risk of in-hospital mortality, and overall hospital-bed utilization. Accuracy assessed over 8 cross-validation cohorts of size 330, using per-day Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of predicted hospital utilization over time; and area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) for individual risk of critical illness and in-hospital mortality, assessed on the first day of hospitalization. We present predicted hospital utilization under hypothetical incoming patient scenarios. Setting: 27 Israeli hospitals. Participants: During the study period, 2,703 confirmed COVID-19 patients were hospitalized in Israel for 1 day or more; 28 were excluded due to missing age or sex; the remaining 2,675 patients were included in the analysis. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome: per-day estimate of total number of hospitalized patients and number of patients in critical state; secondary outcome: risk of a single patient experiencing critical illness or in-hospital mortality. Results: For random validation samples of 330 patients, the per-day MAEs for total hospital-bed utilization and critical-bed utilization, averaged over 64 days, were 4.72 {+\/-} 1.07 and $1.68 {+\/-} 0.40 respectively; the AUROCs for prediction of the probabilities of critical illness and in-hospital mortality were 0.88 {+\/-} 0.04 and 0.96 {+\/-} 0.04, respectively. We further present the impact of several scenarios of patient influx on healthcare system utilization, demonstrating the ability to accurately plan ahead how to allocate healthcare resources. Conclusions and Relevance: We developed a model that, given basic easily obtained data as input, accurately predicts total and critical care hospital utilization. The model enables evaluating the impact of various patient influx scenarios on hospital utilization. Accurate predictions are also given for individual patients' probability of in-hospital mortality and critical illness. We further provide an R software package and a web-application for the model.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael Roimi","author_inst":"Rambam Health Care

important public health impact, as has been observed in the world. In Brazil, the Amazon Region contributed with a large number of cases of COVID-19, especially in the beginning of the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in the country. Thus, we describe the epidemiological profile of COVID-19 and the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating in the Amazon Region. We observe an extensive spread of virus in this Brazilian site. The data on sex, age and symptoms presented by the investigated individuals were similar to what has been observed worldwide. The genomic analysis of the viruses revealed important amino acid changes, including the D614G and the I33T in Spike and ORF6 proteins, respectively. The latter found in strains originating in Brazil. The phylogenetic analyzes demonstrated the circulation of the lineages B.1 and B.1.1, whose circulation in Brazil has already been previous reported. Our data reveals molecular epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in the Amazon Region. These findings also reinforce the importance of continuous genomic surveillance this virus with the aim of providing accurate and updated data to understand and map the transmission network of this agent in order to subsidize operational decisions in public health.","rel_num_authors":44,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mirleide C dos Santos","author_inst":"Instituto Evandro

epidemics","rel_date":"2020-09-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.04.20188631","rel_abs":"Simultaneously controlling COVID-19 epidemics and limiting economic and societal impacts presents a difficult challenge, especially with limited public health budgets. Testing, contact tracing, and isolating\/quarantining is a key strategy that has been used to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. However, manual contact tracing is a time-consuming process and as case numbers increase it takes longer to reach each cases' contacts, leading to additional virus spread. Delays between symptom onset and being tested (and receiving results), and a low fraction of symptomatic cases being tested and traced can also reduce the impact of contact tracing on transmission. We examined the relationship between cases and delays and the pathogen reproductive number Rt, and the implications for infection dynamics using a stochastic compartment model of SARS-CoV-2. We found that Rt increases sigmoidally with the number of cases due to decreasing contact tracing efficacy. This relationship results in accelerating epidemics because Rt increases, rather than declines, as infections increase. Shifting contact tracers from locations with high and low case burdens relative to capacity to locations with intermediate case burdens maximizes their impact in reducing Rt (but minimizing total infections is more complicated). Contact tracing efficacy also decreased with increasing delays between symptom onset and tracing and with lower fraction of symptomatic infections being tested. Finally, testing and tracing reductions in Rt can sometimes greatly delay epidemics due to the highly heterogeneous transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. These results demonstrate the importance of having an expandable or mobile team of contact tracers that can be used to control surges in cases, and the value of easy access, high testing capacity and rapid turn-around of testing results, as well as outreach efforts to encourage symptomatic infections to be tested immediately after symptom onset.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Billy J Gardner","author_inst":"University of California, Santa Cruz"},{"author_name":"A.

asymptomatic in some individuals to fatal in others. Based on a study of over one million 23andMe research participants, we report genetic and non-genetic associations with testing positive for COVID-19, respiratory symptoms, and hospitalization. Risk factors for hospitalization include advancing age, male sex, elevated body mass index, lower socio-economic status, non-European ancestry, and pre-existing cardio-metabolic and respiratory conditions. Using trans-ethnic genome-wide association studies, we identify a strong association between blood type and COVID-19 diagnosis, as well as a gene-rich locus on chr3p21.31 that is more strongly associated with outcome severity. While non-European ancestry was found to be a significant risk factor for hospitalization after adjusting for socio-demographics and pre-existing health conditions, we did not find evidence that these two primary genetic associations explain differences between populations in terms of risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Janie F.

Method","rel_date":"2020-09-07","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.09.04.20188771","rel_abs":"Context: As the COVID-19 pandemic persists around the world, the scientific community continues to produce and circulate knowledge on the deadly disease at an unprecedented rate. During the early stage of the pandemic, preprints represented nearly 40% of all English-language COVID-19 scientific corpus (6, 000+ preprints | 16, 000+ articles). As of mid-August 2020, that proportion dropped to around 28% (13, 000+ preprints | 49, 000+ articles). Nevertheless, preprint servers remain a key engine in the efficient dissemination of scientific work on this infectious disease. But, giving the uncertified nature of the scientific manuscripts curated on preprint repositories, their integration to the global ecosystem of scientific communication is not without creating serious tensions. This is especially the case for biomedical knowledge since the dissemination of bad science can have widespread societal consequences. Scope: In this paper, I propose a robust method that will allow the repeated monitoring and measuring of COVID-19 preprint's publication rate. I also introduce a new API called Upload-or-Perish. It is a micro-API service that enables a client to query a specific preprint manuscript's publication status and associated meta-data using a unique ID. This tool is in active development. Data: I use Covid-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) to calculate COVID-19 preprint corpus' conversion rate to peer-reviewed articles. CORD-19 dataset includes preprints from arXiv, bioRxiv, and medRxiv. Methods: I utilize conditional fuzzy logic on article titles to determine if a preprint has a published counterpart version in the database. My approach is an important departure from previous studies that rely exclusively on bioRxiv API to ascertain preprints' publication status. This is problematic since the level of false positives in bioRxiv metadata could be as high as 37%. Findings: My analysis reveals that around 15% of COVID-19 preprint manuscripts in CORD-19 dataset that were uploaded on from arXiv, bioRxiv, and medRxiv between January and early August 2020 were published in a peer-reviewed venue. When compared to the most recent measure available, this represents a two-fold increase in a period of two months. My discussion review and theorize on the potential explanations for COVID-19 preprints' low conversion rate.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Francois Lachapelle","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Anjali J.
