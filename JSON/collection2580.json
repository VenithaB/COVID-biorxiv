The degree of severity of NPIs is found to be a good gauge of the stage of the pandemic for individual countries. Data points are classified according to the stringency index of the NPIs in order to ensure that comparisons between countries are made on equal footing. We find that temperature and relative humidity gradients do not significantly deviate from the zero-gradient hypothesis. Upper limits on the absolute value of the gradients are set. The procedure chosen here yields 6{middle dot}10^-3{degrees}C^-1 and 3.3{middle dot}10^-3(%)^-1 upper limits on the absolute values of the temperature and relative humidity gradients, respectively, with a 95% Confidence Level. These findings do not preclude existence of seasonal effects and are indicative that these are likely to be nuanced.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joshua Choma","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"},{"author_name":"Bruce Mellado","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Lieberman","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"},{"author_name":"Fabio Correa","author_inst":"Rhodes University"},{"author_name":"Caroline Maslo","author_inst":"Netcare Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Jacques Naude","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"},{"author_name":"Xifeng Ruan","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"},{"author_name":"Kentaro Hayashi","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"},{"author_name":"Kgomotso Monnakgotla","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"},{"author_name":"Salah-Eddine Dahbi","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"},{"author_name":"Finn D Stevenson","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.20.20158345","rel_title":"A vulnerability analysis for the management of and response to the COVID-19 epidemic in the second most populous state in Brazil","rel_date":"2020-07-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.20.20158345","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to affect all individuals, however in a heterogeneous way. In this sense, identifying specificities of each location is essential to minimize the damage caused by the disease. Therefore, the aim of this research was to assess the vulnerability of the 853 municipalities in the second most populous state in Brazil, Minas Gerais (MG), in order to direct public policies. Then, an epidemiological study was carried out based on Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) using indicators with some relation to the process of illness and death caused by COVID-19. The indicators were selected by a literature review and categorized into: demographic, social, economic, health infrastructure, population at risk and epidemiological. The variables were collected in Brazilian government databases at the municipal level and evaluated according to MCDA, through the Program to Support Decision Making based on indicators (PRADIN). Based on this approach, the study performed simulations by category of indicators and a general simulation that allowed to divide the municipalities into groups of 1 to 5, with 1 being the least vulnerable and 5 being the most vulnerable. The groupings of municipalities were exposed in their respective mesoregions of MG in a thematic map, using the software Tabwin 32. The results revealed that the mesoregion of Norte de Minas stands out with more than 40% of its municipalities belonging to group 5, according to economic, social and health infrastructure indicators. Similarly, the Jequitinhonha mesoregion exhibited almost 60% of the municipalities in this group for economic and health infrastructure indicators. For demographic and epidemiological criteria, the Metropolitana de Belo Horizonte mesoregion is the most vulnerable, with 42.9% and 26.7% of the municipalities in group 5, respectively. Considering the presence of a population at risk, Zona da Mata reported 42.3% of the municipalities in the most vulnerable group. In the joint analysis of data, the Jequitinhonha, Vale do Mucuri and Vale do Rio Doce mesoregions were the most vulnerable in the state of MG. Thus, through the outlined profile, the present study proved how socioeconomic diversity affects the vulnerability of the municipalities to face COVID-19 outbreak, highlighting the need for interventions directed to each reality.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Igor Silva Campos","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Uberlandia"},{"author_name":"Vinicius Ferreira Aratani","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Uberlandia"},{"author_name":"Karina Baltor Cabral","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Uberlandia"},{"author_name":"Jean Ezequiel Limongi","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Uberlandia"},{"author_name":"Stefan Vilges de Oliveira","author_inst":"Federal University of Uberlandia"},{"author_name":"Jacques Naude","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"},{"author_name":"Xifeng Ruan","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"},{"author_name":"Kentaro Hayashi","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"},{"author_name":"Kgomotso Monnakgotla","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"},{"author_name":"Salah-Eddine Dahbi","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"},{"author_name":"Finn D Stevenson","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.20.20158139","rel_title":"Confirmed and Unreported COVID-19 Death Counts: An Assessment of Reporting Discrepancy","rel_date":"2020-07-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.20.20158139","rel_abs":"Objective: To assess the reporting discrepancy between officially confirmed COVID-19 death counts and unreported COVID-19-like illness (CLI) death counts. Study Design: The study is based on secondary time-series data. Methods: We used publicly available data to explore the differences between confirmed COVID-19 death counts and deaths with probable COVID-19 symptoms in Bangladesh between March 8, 2020, and July 18, 2020. Both tabular analysis and statistical tests were performed. Results: During the week ending May 9, 2020, the unreported CLI death count was higher than the confirmed COVID-19 death count; however, it was lower in the following weeks. On average, unreported CLI death counts were almost equal to the confirmed COVID-19 death counts during the study period. However, the reporting authority neither considers CLI deaths nor adjusts for potential seasonal influenza-like illness or other related deaths, which might produce incomplete and unreliable COVID-19 data and respective mortality rates. Conclusions: Deaths with probable COVID-19 symptoms needs to be included in provisional death counts in order to estimate an accurate COVID-19 mortality rate and to offer data-driven pandemic response strategies. An urgent initiative is needed to prepare a comprehensive guideline for reporting COVID-19 deaths.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mazbahul G Ahamad","author_inst":"University of Nebraska-Lincoln"},{"author_name":"Fahian Tanin","author_inst":"Independent Researcher"},{"author_name":"Byomkes Talukder","author_inst":"York University"},{"author_name":"Jean Ezequiel Limongi","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Uberlandia"},{"author_name":"Stefan Vilges de Oliveira","author_inst":"Federal University of Uberlandia"},{"author_name":"Jacques Naude","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"},{"author_name":"Xifeng Ruan","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"},{"author_name":"Kentaro Hayashi","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"},{"author_name":"Kgomotso Monnakgotla","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"},{"author_name":"Salah-Eddine Dahbi","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"},{"author_name":"Finn D Stevenson","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.20.20157925","rel_title":"Factors Associated with COVID-19 Mitigation Behavior among US Adults","rel_date":"2020-07-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.20.20157925","rel_abs":"In January 2020, the US declared the coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency and subsequently the CDC issued guidelines for personal mitigation behavior, such as mask-wearing, hand-washing, and social-distancing.

We hypothesize that health risk factors, presence of symptoms, and psychological wellbeing predict mitigation behavior. Understanding what factors are associated with mitigation behavior will be important for policy makers in their efforts to curb the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic prompted strong mitigation behavior by adults, especially among females, non-whites, urban dwellers, and the psychological unwell. Other positive predictors were post-secondary education and higher income. Health symptoms and clinical risk factors did not predict increased mitigation practices, nor did age 65+ and proximity to infected persons. Our study findings are congruent with a report that pointed to a lack of increased pandemic mitigation practices in households with confirmed infections and health risks. Our results also point to lower levels of psychological resilience, lower socio-economic status, and non-urban location as potential explanatory factors for lack of mitigation behavior.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Debra Lemke","author_inst":"McDaniel College"},{"author_name":"Klaus Lemke","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Byomkes Talukder","author_inst":"York University"},{"author_name":"Jean Ezequiel Limongi","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Uberlandia"},{"author_name":"Stefan Vilges de Oliveira","author_inst":"Federal University of Uberlandia"},{"author_name":"Jacques Naude","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"},{"author_name":"Xifeng Ruan","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"},{"author_name":"Kentaro Hayashi","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"},{"author_name":"Kgomotso Monnakgotla","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"},{"author_name":"Salah-Eddine Dahbi","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"},{"author_name":"Finn D Stevenson","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand (ZA)"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.25.192310","rel_title":"\u03b2-Coronaviruses use lysosomal organelles for cellular egress.","rel_date":"2020-07-25","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.25.192310","rel_abs":"{beta}-Coronaviruses are a family of positive-strand enveloped RNA viruses that include the severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV2 (SARS-CoV2).

Using imaging methodologies in combination with virus-specific reporters, we demonstrate that {beta}-Coronaviruses utilize lysosomal trafficking for egress from cells. This pathway is regulated by the Arf-like small GTPase Arl8b; thus, virus egress is insensitive to inhibitors of the biosynthetic secretory pathway. Coronavirus infection results in lysosome deacidification, inactivation of lysosomal degradation and disruption of antigen presentation pathways. This coronavirus-induced exploitation of lysosomes provides insights into the cellular and immunological abnormalities observed in patients and suggests new therapeutic modalities.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nihal Altan-Bonnet","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Gregoire Yves Altan-Bonnet","author_inst":"National Cancer Institute"},{"author_name":"Sourish Ghosh","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Teegan Dellibovi-Ragheb","author_inst":"FDA"},{"author_name":"Eowyn Pak","author_inst":"Dartmouth College"},{"author_name":"Qi Qiu","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Matthew Fisher","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Peter Takvorian","author_inst":"State University of New Jersey-Rutgers University- Newark"},{"author_name":"Christopher Bleck","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Victor Hsu","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Anthony Fehr","author_inst":"University of Kentucky"},{"author_name":"Stanley Perlman","author_inst":"University of Iowa"},{"author_name":"Marco Straus","author_inst":"Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Gary Whittaker","author_inst":"Cornell University"},{"author_name":"C AM de Haan","author_inst":"Utrecht University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.25.221135","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 differs from SARS-CoV in the requirements for receptor expression and proteolytic activation to trigger cell-cell fusion and is not inhibited by Bromhexine","rel_date":"2020-07-25","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.25.221135","rel_abs":"The SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects cells through interaction of its spike protein (SARS-CoV-2-S) with the ACE2 receptor and activation by proteases, in particular TMPRSS2. Viruses can also spread through fusion of infected with uninfected cells. We therefore analyzed cell-cell fusion activity of SARS-CoV-2-S with regard to the requirements for ACE2 expression, proteolytic activation, and sensitivity to inhibitors and compared it to SARS-CoV-S. We compared S-protein-driven fusion with target cells recombinantly overexpressing ACE2, TMPRSS2, or both. SARS-CoV-2-S-driven fusion was moderately increased by TMPRSS2 and strongly by ACE2, while the reverse observation was made for SARS-CoV-S. TMPRSS2-mediated effects were inhibited by the serine protease inhibitor Camostat. Effector-target-cell fusion by SARS-CoV-2-S was only affected by Camostat when receptor expression was limiting or when the S1\/S2 cleavage site was mutated. Mutational ablation of the SARS-CoV-2-S S2 cleavage site abrogated any effects of TMPRSS2 on fusion. Mutation of the SARS-CoV-2-S S1\/S2 cleavage site reduced effector-target-cell fusion when ACE2 or TMPRSS2 were limiting. When both factors were abundant, initial target-effector-cell fusion was unaltered, but syncytia remained smaller over time. Overall, its polybasic cleavage site renders SARS-CoV-2-S-mediated cell-cell fusion less dependent on TMPRSS2 activity on target cells. Unexpectedly, we observed enhancement of SARS-CoV-2-S-mediated fusion by Bromhexine, another TMPRSS2 inhibitor. This effect required intact proteolytic cleavage sites, suggesting interference of Bromhexine with proteolytic priming, but not in a therapeutically desired way. Infection with SARS-CoV-2-S-pseudotyped particles clearly differed in the requirements for proteolytic activation from cell-cell fusion. TMPRSS2 strongly enhanced infection, which was reversed by Camostat but not by Bromhexine.\n\nIMPORTANCECell-cell fusion allows the virus to infect additional target cells without the need to produce free virus. Fusion likely also contributes to tissue damage by creating virus-infected syncytia. Our results demonstrate that the S2 cleavage site is essential for activation by TMPRSS2 in trans and unravel important differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Bromhexine, an inhibitor of the TMPRSS2 protease, is currently tested in clinical trials against COVID-19. Our results indicate that Bromhexine does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2-S-mediated particle entry and enhances fusion. We therefore caution against overly optimistic use of Bromhexine in higher dosage in clinical trials or as a therapy, at least until its effects on SARS-CoV-2 spike activation are better understood. The related compound Ambroxol, which similar to Bromhexine is clinically used as an expectorant, did not exhibit activating effects on SARS-CoV-2-S-mediated fusion and may therefore currently represent a better choice in therapeutic regimens for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bojan F H\u00f6rnich","author_inst":"Nachwuchsgruppe Herpesviren, Abteilung Infektionsbiologie, Deutsches Primatenzentrum - Leibniz-Institut f\u00fcr Primatenforschung, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Anna K Gro\u00dfkopf","author_inst":"Nachwuchsgruppe Herpesviren, Abteilung Infektionsbiologie, Deutsches Primatenzentrum - Leibniz-Institut f\u00fcr Primatenforschung, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Sarah Schlagowski","author_inst":"Nachwuchsgruppe Herpesviren, Abteilung Infektionsbiologie, Deutsches Primatenzentrum - Leibniz-Institut f\u00fcr Primatenforschung, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Matthias Tenbusch","author_inst":"Virologisches Institut, Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Frank Neipel","author_inst":"Virologisches Institut, Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Alexander S Hahn","author_inst":"Nachwuchsgruppe Herpesviren, Abteilung Infektionsbiologie, Deutsches Primatenzentrum - Leibniz-Institut f\u00fcr Primatenforschung, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Matthew Fisher","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Peter Takvorian","author_inst":"State University of New Jersey-Rutgers University- Newark"},{"author_name":"Christopher Bleck","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Victor Hsu","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Anthony Fehr","author_inst":"University of Kentucky"},{"author_name":"Stanley Perlman","author_inst":"University of Iowa"},{"author_name":"Marco Straus","author_inst":"Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Gary Whittaker","author_inst":"Cornell University"},{"author_name":"C AM de Haan","author_inst":"Utrecht University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.22.20159830","rel_title":"Clustering, diffusion and evolution of COVID19 infections during lock-down","rel_date":"2020-07-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.22.20159830","rel_abs":"Epidemics such as the spreading of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are highly non linear, and therefore difficult to predict.

This means that the disease rapidly evolves within spatially localized networks, that diffuse and eventually create new clusters. We improve upon the simplest possible compartmental model, the SIR model, by adding an additional compartment associated with the clustered individuals. The so-obtained SBIR model compares satisfactorily with results on the pandemic propagation in a number of European countries, during and immediately after lock-down. Especially, the decay exponent of the number of new cases after the first peak of the epidemic, is observed to be very similar for countries in which a strict lock-down was applied.

Heterologous polyclonal antibodies of animal origin have been used to fight against infectious agents and are a possible alternative to the use of CP in SARS-CoV-2 disease. However, heterologous polyclonal antibodies trigger human natural xenogeneic antibody responses particularly directed against animal-type carbohydrate epitopes, mainly the N-glycolyl form of the neuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) and the Gal 1,3-galactose (-Gal), ultimately forming immune complexes and potentially leading to serum sickness or allergy. To circumvent these drawbacks, we engineered animals lacking the genes coding for the cytidine monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH) and 1,3-galactosyltransferase (GGTA1) enzymes to produce glyco-humanized polyclonal antibodies (GH-pAb) lacking Neu5Gc and -Gal epitopes. We also found that pig IgG Fc domains fail to interact with human Fc receptors and thereby should confer the safety advantage to avoiding macrophage dependent exacerbated inflammatory responses or elicit antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), two drawbacks possibly associated with antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we immunized CMAH\/GGTA1 double knockout (DKO) pigs with the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD) to elicit neutralizing antibodies. Animals rapidly developed a hyperimmune response with anti-SARS-CoV-2 end-titers binding dilutions over one to a million and end-titers neutralizing dilutions of 1:10,000. The IgG fraction purified and formulated following clinical Good Manufacturing Practices, named XAV-19, neutralized Spike\/angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) interaction at a concentration < 1g\/mL and inhibited infection of human cells by SARS-CoV-2 in cytopathic assays. These data and the accumulating safety advantages of using glyco-humanized swine antibodies in humans warrant clinical assessment of XAV-19 to fight against COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":29,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bernard Vanhove","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Odile Duvaux","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Juliette Rousse","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Pierre-Joseph Royer","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Gwenaelle Evanno","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Carine Ciron","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Elsa Lheriteau","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Laurent Vacher","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Nadine Gervois","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Romain Oger","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Yannick Jacques","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Sophie Conchon","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Apolline Salama","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Roberto Duchi","author_inst":"Avantea"},{"author_name":"Irina Lagutina","author_inst":"Avantea"},{"author_name":"Andrea Perota","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Philippe Delahaut","author_inst":"CER Groupe"},{"author_name":"Matthieu Ledure","author_inst":"CER Groupe"},{"author_name":"Melody Paulus","author_inst":"CER Groupe"},{"author_name":"Ray So","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Chris Ka Pun Mok","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Roberto Bruzzone","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Marc Bouillet","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Sophie Brouard","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Cozzi","author_inst":"Padua University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cesare Galli","author_inst":"Avantea"},{"author_name":"Dominique Blanchard","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Jean-Marie Bach","author_inst":"Oniris"},{"author_name":"Jean-Paul Soulillou","author_inst":"University of Nantes"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.24.205583","rel_title":"Rapid generation of circulating and mucosal decoy ACE2 using mRNA nanotherapeutics for the potential treatment of SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-07-25","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.24.205583","rel_abs":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enters through the airways and infects the lungs, causing lethal pulmonary damage in vulnerable patients. This virus contains spike proteins on its envelope that binds to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) expressed on the surface of airway cells, enabling entry of the virus for causing infection1,2. In severe cases, the virus enters the circulatory system, contributing to multiorgan failure. Soluble form of hACE2 binds to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and prevents viral entry into target cells3. Moreover, soluble recombinant ACE2 ameliorates lung injury4 but its short half-life limits its therapeutic utility5. Here, we engineered synthetic mRNA to encode a soluble form of hACE2 (hsACE2) to prevent viral infection. Novel lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) were used to package mRNA and transfect mammalian cells for enhanced production of secreted proteins. Intravenously administered LNP led to hepatic delivery of the mRNA. This elicited secretion of hsACE2 into the blood circulation within 2 h, and levels of circulating hsACE2 peaked at 6 h and gradually decreased over several days. Since the primary site of entry and pathogenesis for SARS-CoV-2 is the lungs, we instilled LNPs into the lungs and were able to detect hsACE2 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid within 24 h and lasted for 48 h. Through co-immunoprecipitation, we found that mRNA-generated hsACE2 was able to bind with the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Furthermore, hsACE2 was able to strongly inhibit (over 90%) SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection. Our proof of principle study shows that mRNA-based nanotherapeutics can be potentially deployed for pulmonary and extrapulmonary neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 and open new treatment opportunities for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jeongwhan Kim","author_inst":"Oregon State University"},{"author_name":"Anindit Mukherjee","author_inst":"Oregon State University"},{"author_name":"Dylan Nelson","author_inst":"Oregon State University"},{"author_name":"Antony Jozic","author_inst":"Oregon State University"},{"author_name":"Gaurav Sahay","author_inst":"Oregon State University"},{"author_name":"Carine Ciron","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Elsa Lheriteau","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Laurent Vacher","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Nadine Gervois","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Romain Oger","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Yannick Jacques","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Sophie Conchon","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Apolline Salama","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Roberto Duchi","author_inst":"Avantea"},{"author_name":"Irina Lagutina","author_inst":"Avantea"},{"author_name":"Andrea Perota","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Philippe Delahaut","author_inst":"CER Groupe"},{"author_name":"Matthieu Ledure","author_inst":"CER Groupe"},{"author_name":"Melody Paulus","author_inst":"CER Groupe"},{"author_name":"Ray So","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Chris Ka Pun Mok","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Roberto Bruzzone","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Marc Bouillet","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Sophie Brouard","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Cozzi","author_inst":"Padua University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cesare Galli","author_inst":"Avantea"},{"author_name":"Dominique Blanchard","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Jean-Marie Bach","author_inst":"Oniris"},{"author_name":"Jean-Paul Soulillou","author_inst":"University of Nantes"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"bioengineering"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.21.20159350","rel_title":"Reducing COVID-19 hospitalization risk through behavior change","rel_date":"2020-07-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.21.20159350","rel_abs":"Our objective was to determine strategies that could potentially reduce the risk of hospitalizations from COVID-19 due to underlying conditions.

Risk factors included lifetime smoking, sedentary lifestyle, and inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption. Multiple logistic regression in Stata produced adjusted odds ratios (AORs) used to estimate population attributable-risk (PAR) in Excel. PARs for the 3 risk factors ranged from 12.4% for inactivity to 15.6% for diet for a combined PAR of 36.3%, implying that total elimination of these 3 risk factors could potentially reduce underlying conditions as much as 36%. This suggests that reducing COVID-19 hospitalizations might be a measurable and feasible US goal for the coronavirus pandemic. The simple lifestyle changes of increasing physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption could reduce obesity, a key underlying condition and risk factor for 4 others. Reducing obesity and inactivity may also boost immunity. With uncertainly around how long the pandemic might last, other proposed strategies include wearing face masks when social distancing is not feasible, and addressing the special issues for nursing home residents. Such actions have the potential to lessen the impact of COVID-19 in the short term along with providing long term health benefits regarding chronic conditions.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"MARY L ADAMS","author_inst":"On Target Health Data LLC"},{"author_name":"David L Katz","author_inst":"True Health Initiative"},{"author_name":"Joseph Grandpre","author_inst":"Wyoming Department of Health"},{"author_name":"Douglas Shenson","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Gaurav Sahay","author_inst":"Oregon State University"},{"author_name":"Carine Ciron","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Elsa Lheriteau","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Laurent Vacher","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Nadine Gervois","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Romain Oger","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Yannick Jacques","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Sophie Conchon","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Apolline Salama","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Roberto Duchi","author_inst":"Avantea"},{"author_name":"Irina Lagutina","author_inst":"Avantea"},{"author_name":"Andrea Perota","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Philippe Delahaut","author_inst":"CER Groupe"},{"author_name":"Matthieu Ledure","author_inst":"CER Groupe"},{"author_name":"Melody Paulus","author_inst":"CER Groupe"},{"author_name":"Ray So","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Chris Ka Pun Mok","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Roberto Bruzzone","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Marc Bouillet","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Sophie Brouard","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Cozzi","author_inst":"Padua University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cesare Galli","author_inst":"Avantea"},{"author_name":"Dominique Blanchard","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Jean-Marie Bach","author_inst":"Oniris"},{"author_name":"Jean-Paul Soulillou","author_inst":"University of Nantes"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.22.20159707","rel_title":"A reference for mortality in Spain from 2001 to 2019 records with an accurate estimate of excess deaths during the 2020 spring covid-19 outbreak","rel_date":"2020-07-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.22.20159707","rel_abs":"Spanish official records of mortality and population in the 21st century are analyzed to determine the reference value of all cause, all age, all sex per capita death rate in the country.

This study presents an analysis of the excess mortality across the 107 Italian provinces, stratified by sex, age group, and period of the outbreak. Methods: The analysis was performed using a two-stage interrupted time series design using daily mortality data for the period January 2015 - May 2020. In the first stage, we performed province-level quasi-Poisson regression models, with smooth functions to define a baseline risk while accounting for trends and weather conditions and to flexibly estimate the variation in excess risk during the outbreak. Estimates were pooled in the second stage using a mixed-effects multivariate meta-analysis. Results: In the period 15 February - 15 May 2020, we estimated an excess of 47,490 (95% empirical confidence intervals: 43,984 to 50,362) deaths in Italy, corresponding to an increase of 29.5% (95%eCI: 26.8 to 31.9%) from the expected mortality. The analysis indicates a strong geographical pattern, with the majority of excess deaths occurring in northern regions, where few provinces experienced up to 800% increase during the peak in late March. There were differences by sex, age, and area both in the overall impact and in its temporal distribution. Conclusions: This study offers a detailed picture of excess mortality during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. The strong geographical and temporal patterns can be related to implementation of lockdown policies and multiple direct and indirect pathways in mortality risk.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matteo Scortichini","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rochelle Schneider dos Santos","author_inst":"LSHTM"},{"author_name":"Francesca De' Donato","author_inst":"Lazio Regional Health Service"},{"author_name":"Manuela De Sario","author_inst":"Lazio Regional Health Service"},{"author_name":"Paola Michelozzi","author_inst":"Lazio Regional Health Service"},{"author_name":"Marina Davoli","author_inst":"Lazio Regional Health Service"},{"author_name":"Pierre Masselot","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Francesco Sera","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Antonio Gasparrini","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Romain Oger","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Yannick Jacques","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Sophie Conchon","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Apolline Salama","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Roberto Duchi","author_inst":"Avantea"},{"author_name":"Irina Lagutina","author_inst":"Avantea"},{"author_name":"Andrea Perota","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Philippe Delahaut","author_inst":"CER Groupe"},{"author_name":"Matthieu Ledure","author_inst":"CER Groupe"},{"author_name":"Melody Paulus","author_inst":"CER Groupe"},{"author_name":"Ray So","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Chris Ka Pun Mok","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Roberto Bruzzone","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Marc Bouillet","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Sophie Brouard","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Cozzi","author_inst":"Padua University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cesare Galli","author_inst":"Avantea"},{"author_name":"Dominique Blanchard","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Jean-Marie Bach","author_inst":"Oniris"},{"author_name":"Jean-Paul Soulillou","author_inst":"University of Nantes"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.21.20159236","rel_title":"We are at risk too: The disparate impacts of the pandemic on younger generations","rel_date":"2020-07-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.21.20159236","rel_abs":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in profound global impact with high rates of morbidity and mortality.

Across generational groups, this study examined: (1) rates of precautions and adaptive and maladaptive health behaviours, (2) differences in levels of anxiety, and (3) rates of and changes in COVID-related concerns over time during the early outbreak of COVID-19 in Canada. Methods: We analyzed data from two Canadian population-based datasets: the Canadian Perspective Survey Series: Impact of COVID-19 survey (N=4,627; March 29-April 3, 2020), and Crowdsourcing: Impacts of COVID-19 on Canadians: Your Mental Health (N=45,989; April 24-May 11, 2020). We categorized generational age group, participants self-reported changes in behaviours and COVID-related concerns, and a validated measure assessed anxiety symptoms. Results: There are age differences in behavioural responses to the pandemic; adaptive health habits (e.g., exercise) were stable across groups, while maladaptive health habits (e.g., substance use) were highest among younger groups. COVID-related precautions were also highest among the younger generations, with Generation X exhibiting the highest rate of precautionary behaviour. Results also revealed that anxiety and worry are prevalent in response to the pandemic across all generations, with the highest rate of clinically significant anxiety among Millennials (36.0%). Finally, COVID-related concerns are greatest for younger generations and appear to be decreasing with time.

However, there is a dearth of data describing the impact of COVID-19 infection in patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (ESRD-HD). Methods This retrospective case series analyzed 362 adult patients consecutively hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 illness between March 12, 2020 and May 13, 2020, at a teaching hospital in the New York City metropolitan area. Primary outcome was severe pneumonia as defined by the World Health Organization. Secondary outcomes were: 1) the Combined Outcome of Acute respiratory distress syndrome or in-hospital Death (COAD), and 2) the need for High-levels of Oxygen supplementation (HiO2). Results Patients with ESRD-HD had lower odds for poor outcomes including severe pneumonia [Odds Ratio (OR) 0.4, Confidence Interval (CI) (0.2-0.9) p=.04], HiO2 [OR 0.3, CI (0.1-0.8) p=.02] and COAD [OR 0.4, CI (0.2-1.05) p=.06], when compared to patients without ESRD. In contrast, higher odds for severe pneumonia, COAD and HiO2 were seen with advancing age. African-Americans were over-represented in the hospitalized patient cohort, when compared to their representation in the community (35% vs 18%). Hispanics had higher odds for severe-illness and HiO2 when compared to Caucasians. Conclusions Patients with ESRD-HD had a milder course of illness with a lower likelihood of severe pneumonia and a lesser need for aggressive oxygen supplementation when compared to patients not on chronic dialysis. This protective effect, might have a pathophysiologic basis and needs to be further explored.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ashutossh Naaraayan","author_inst":"Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital"},{"author_name":"Abhishek Nimkar","author_inst":"Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital"},{"author_name":"Amrah Hasan","author_inst":"Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sushil Pant","author_inst":"Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital"},{"author_name":"Momcilo Durdevic","author_inst":"Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital"},{"author_name":"Henrik Elenius","author_inst":"Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital"},{"author_name":"Corina Nava Suarez","author_inst":"Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital"},{"author_name":"Prasanta Basak","author_inst":"Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kameswari Lakshmi","author_inst":"Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michael Mandel","author_inst":"Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital"},{"author_name":"Stephen Jesmajian","author_inst":"Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sophie Conchon","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Apolline Salama","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Roberto Duchi","author_inst":"Avantea"},{"author_name":"Irina Lagutina","author_inst":"Avantea"},{"author_name":"Andrea Perota","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Philippe Delahaut","author_inst":"CER Groupe"},{"author_name":"Matthieu Ledure","author_inst":"CER Groupe"},{"author_name":"Melody Paulus","author_inst":"CER Groupe"},{"author_name":"Ray So","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Chris Ka Pun Mok","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Roberto Bruzzone","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Marc Bouillet","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Sophie Brouard","author_inst":"University of Nantes"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Cozzi","author_inst":"Padua University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Cesare Galli","author_inst":"Avantea"},{"author_name":"Dominique Blanchard","author_inst":"Xenothera"},{"author_name":"Jean-Marie Bach","author_inst":"Oniris"},{"author_name":"Jean-Paul Soulillou","author_inst":"University of Nantes"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"nephrology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.21.20159376","rel_title":"Cerebral Microvascular Injury in Severe COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-07-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.21.20159376","rel_abs":"IMPORTANCE: Microvascular lesions are common in patients with severe COVID-19. Radiologic-pathologic correlation in one case suggests a combination of microvascular hemorrhagic and ischemic lesions that may reflect an underlying hypoxic mechanism of injury, which requires validation in larger studies. OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence, distribution, and clinical and histopathologic correlates of microvascular lesions in patients with severe COVID-19. DESIGN: Observational, retrospective cohort study: March to May 2020. SETTING: Single academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive patients (16) admitted to the intensive care unit with severe COVID-19, undergoing brain MRI for evaluation of coma or focal neurologic deficits. EXPOSURES: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Hypointense microvascular lesions identified by a prototype ultrafast high-resolution susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) MRI sequence, counted by two neuroradiologists and categorized by neuroanatomic location. Clinical and laboratory data (most recent measurements before brain MRI). Brain autopsy and cerebrospinal fluid PCR for SARS-CoV 2 in one patient who died from severe COVID-19. RESULTS: Eleven of 16 patients (69%) had punctate and linear SWI lesions in the subcortical and deep white matter, and eight patients (50%) had >10 SWI lesions. In 4\/16 patients (25%), lesions involved the corpus callosum. Brain autopsy in one patient revealed that SWI lesions corresponded to widespread microvascular injury, characterized by perivascular and parenchymal petechial hemorrhages and microscopic ischemic lesions. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: SWI lesions are common in patients with neurological manifestations of severe COVID-19 (coma and focal neurologic deficits). The distribution of lesions is similar to that seen in patients with hypoxic respiratory failure, sepsis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Collectively, these radiologic and histopathologic findings suggest that patients with severe COVID-19 are at risk for multifocal microvascular hemorrhagic and ischemic lesions in the subcortical and deep white matter.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"John Conklin","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Matthew P.

Gender identity is not reported, therefore data are absent on the impact of COVID-19 on transgender people, including transgender people with HIV. Baseline data from the American Cohort to Study HIV Acquisition Among Transgender Women in High Risk Areas (LITE) Study provide an opportunity to examine pre-COVID vulnerability among transgender women. Setting: Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Miami, New York City, Washington, DC Methods: Baseline data from LITE were analysed for demographic, psychosocial, and material factors that may affect risk for COVID-related harms. Results: The 1020 participants had high rates of poverty, unemployment, food insecurity, homelessness, and sex work. Transgender women with HIV (n=273) were older, more likely to be Black, had lower educational attainment, and were more likely to experience material hardship. Mental and behavioural health symptoms were common and did not differ by HIV status. Barriers to healthcare included being mistreated mistreatment, uncomfortable providers, and past negative experiences; as well as material hardships, such as cost and transportation. However, most reported access to material and social support - demonstrating resilience. Conclusions: Transgender women with HIV may be particularly vulnerable to pandemic harms. Mitigating this harm would have positive effects for everyone, given the highly infectious nature of this coronavirus. Collecting gender identity in COVID-19 data is crucial to inform an effective public health response. Transgender-led organizations' response to this crisis serve as an important model for effective community-led interventions.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tonia Poteat","author_inst":"Department of Social Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Sari Reisner","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School; Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.

The rapid and sensitive immunoassays are urgently demanded for detecting specific antibodies as assistant diagnosis for primary screening of asymptomatic individuals, close contacts,suspected or recovered patients of COIVD-19 during the pandemic period. Methods: The recombinant receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-RBD) was used as the antigen to detect specific IgM and the mixture of recombinant nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (NP) and S-RBD were used to detect specific IgG by the newly designed quantum-dot lateral flow immunoassay strip (QD-LFIA), respectively. Results: A rapid and sensitive QD-LFIA based portable fluorescence smart-phone system was developed for detecting specific IgM\/IgG to SARS-CoV-2 from 100 serum samples of COVID-19 patients and 450 plasma samples from healthy blood donors. Among 100 COVID-19 patients diagnosed with NAT previously, 3 were severe, 35 mild and 62 recovered cases. By using QD-LFIA, 78 (78%) and 99 (99%) samples from 100 COVID-19 patients serum were detected positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG, respectively, but only one sample (0.22%) was cross-reactive with S-RBD from 450 healthy blood donor plasmas that were collected from different areas of China. Conclusion: An ultrasensitive and specific QD-LFIA based portable fluorescence smart-phone system was developed fo r detection of specific IgM and IgG to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which could be used for investigating the prevalence or assistant diagnosis of COVID-19 in humans.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bochao Liu","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jinfeng Li","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xi Tang","author_inst":"The First People Hospital of Foshan"},{"author_name":"Ze Wu","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jinhui Lu","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chaolan Liang","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Shuiping Hou","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ling Zhang","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Tingting Li","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhao","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yongshui Fu","author_inst":"Guangzhou Blood Center"},{"author_name":"Yuebin Ke","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chengyao Li","author_inst":"Southern medical university"},{"author_name":"Haitham Alabsi","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Erica Normandin","author_inst":"Broad Institute, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Bennett Shaw","author_inst":"Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jacob Lemieux","author_inst":"Division of Infectious Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Pardis Sabeti","author_inst":"Broad Institute, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University"},{"author_name":"John A.

Objective: To determine, whether COVID-19 is associated with a vigorous total IgA response and whether IgA autoantibodies are associated with complications of severe illness. Since thrombotic events are frequent in severe COVID-19 and resemble hypercoagulation of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), our approach focused on antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). Materials and methods: In this retrospective cohort study we compared clinical data and aPL from 64 patients with COVID-19 from three independent centers (two in Switzerland, one in Liechtenstein). Samples were collected from April 9, 2020 to May 1, 2020. Total IgA and aPL were measured with FDA-approved commercially available clinical diagnostic kits. Results: Clinical records of the 64 patients with COVID-19 were reviewed and divided into a cohort with mild illness (mCOVID, n=26 [41%]), a discovery cohort with severe illness (sdCOVD, n=14 [22%]) and a confirmation cohort with severe illness (scCOVID, n=24 [38%]). Severe illness was significantly associated with increased total IgA (sdCOVID, P=0.01; scCOVID, P<0.001). Total IgG levels were similar in both cohorts. Among aPL, both cohorts with severe illness significantly correlated with elevated anti-Cardiolipin IgA (sdCOVID and scCOVID, P<0.001), anti-Cardiolipin IgM (sdCOVID, P=0.003; scCOVID, P<0.001), and anti-Beta2 Glycoprotein-1 IgA (sdCOVID and scCOVID, P<0.001). Systemic lupus erythematosus was excluded from all patients as a potential confounder of APS. Conclusions: Higher total IgA and IgA-aPL were consistently associated with severe illness. These novel data strongly suggest that a vigorous antiviral IgA-response triggered in the bronchial mucosa induces systemic autoimmunity.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Omar Hasan Ali","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"David Bomze","author_inst":"Kantonsspital St. Gallen, St. Gallen, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Lorenz Risch","author_inst":"Labormedizinisches Zentrum Dr. Risch, Vaduz, Liechtenstein"},{"author_name":"Silvio D Brugger","author_inst":"University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Matthias Paprotny","author_inst":"Landesspital Liechtenstein, Vaduz, Liechtenstein"},{"author_name":"Myriam Weber","author_inst":"Landesspital Liechtenstein, Vaduz, Liechtenstein"},{"author_name":"Sarah Thiel","author_inst":"Landesspital Liechtenstein, Vaduz, Liechtenstein"},{"author_name":"Lukas Kern","author_inst":"Kantonsspital St. Gallen, St. Gallen, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Werner C Albrich","author_inst":"Kantonsspital St. Gallen, St. Gallen, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Philipp Kohler","author_inst":"Kantonsspital St. Gallen, St. Gallen, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Christian R Kahlert","author_inst":"Kantonsspital St. Gallen, St. Gallen, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Pietro Vernazza","author_inst":"Kantonsspital St. Gallen, St. Gallen, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Philipp K Buehler","author_inst":"University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Reto A Schuepbach","author_inst":"University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Alejandro Gomez-Mejia","author_inst":"University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Alexandra M Popa","author_inst":"Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Andreas Bergthaler","author_inst":"Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria"},{"author_name":"Josef M Penninger","author_inst":"University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada"},{"author_name":"Lukas Flatz","author_inst":"Kantonsspital St. Gallen, St. Gallen, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Emery N.

We quantified immunoglobulin M (IgM) and G (IgG) antibodies recognizing the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) or the nucleocapsid (N) protein, and neutralizing antibodies during a period of six months following COVID-19 disease onset in 349 symptomatic COVID-19 patients, which were among the first world-wide being infected. The positivity rate and magnitude of IgM-S and IgG-N responses increased rapidly. High levels of IgM-S\/N and IgG-S\/N at 2-3 weeks after disease onset were associated with virus control and IgG-S titers correlated closely with the capacity to neutralize SARS-CoV-2. While specific IgM-S\/N became undetectable 12 weeks after disease onset in most patients, IgG-S\/N titers showed an intermediate contraction phase, but stabilized at relatively high levels over the six months observation period. At late time points the positivity rates for binding and neutralizing SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies was still over 70%. Taken together, our data indicate sustained humoral immunity in recovered patients who suffer from symptomatic COVID-19, suggesting prolonged immunity.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jun Wu","author_inst":"1 Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan,China;

Six of 15 sets of primers were firstly identified to have faster amplification when tested with four RNA standards, and were further subjected to parallel comparison with the remaining four primer sets using 29 clinical samples.

Design: Retrospective cohort study, enrollment from March 24 to May 26, 2020 with follow-up calls until hospitalization or clinical improvement (final calls until June 19, 2020) Setting: Single center telemedicine program managing outpatients from a large medical system in Atlanta, Georgia Participants: 496 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in isolation at home. Exclusion criteria included: (1) hospitalization prior to telemedicine program enrollment, (2) immediate discharge with no follow-up calls due to resolution. Exposure: Acute COVID-19 illness Main Outcome and Measures: Hospitalization was the outcome. Days to hospitalization was the metric. Survival analysis using Cox regression was used to determine factors associated with hospitalization. Results: The risk-assessment rubric assigned 496 outpatients to risk tiers as follows: Tier 1, 237 (47.8%); Tier 2, 185 (37.3%); Tier 3, 74 (14.9%). Subsequent hospitalizations numbered 3 (1%), 15 (7%), and 17 (23%) and for Tiers 1-3, respectively. From a Cox regression model with age [&ge;] 60, gender, and self-reported obesity as covariates, the adjusted hazard ratios using Tier 1 as reference were: Tier 2 HR=3.74 (95% CI, 1.06-13.27; P=0.041); Tier 3 HR=10.87 (95% CI, 3.09-38.27; P<0.001). Tier was the strongest predictor of time to hospitalization. Conclusions and Relevance: A telemedicine risk assessment tool prospectively applied to an outpatient population with COVID-19 identified both low-risk and high-risk patients with better performance than individual risk factors alone. This approach may be appropriate for optimum allocation of resources.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"James B O'Keefe","author_inst":"Emory University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth J Tong","author_inst":"Emory University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Thomas H Taylor Jr.","author_inst":"Taylor Engineering, Inc."},{"author_name":"Ghazala D Datoo O'Keefe","author_inst":"Emory University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David C Tong","author_inst":"Emory University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jianru Qin","author_inst":"College of Life Sciences, Henan Normal University"},{"author_name":"Guoying Yu","author_inst":"College of Life Sciences, Henan Normal University"},{"author_name":"Xia Jin","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University"},{"author_name":"Chiyu Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center"},{"author_name":"Qi Chen","author_inst":"Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Wuhan 430079, China"},{"author_name":"Yang Wu","author_inst":"Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Wuhan 430079, China"},{"author_name":"Jia Liu","author_inst":"1 Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan,China; 2 Joint International L"},{"author_name":"Xuecheng Yang","author_inst":"1 Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan,China; 2 Joint International L"},{"author_name":"Wei Li","author_inst":"1 Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan,China; 2 Joint International L"},{"author_name":"Bin Zhu","author_inst":"1 Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan,China; 2 Joint International L"},{"author_name":"Wenqing Zhou","author_inst":"1 Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan,China; 2 Joint International L"},{"author_name":"Huan Wang","author_inst":"1 Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan,China; 2 Joint International L"},{"author_name":"Shumeng Li","author_inst":"1 Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan,China; 2 Joint International L"},{"author_name":"Sihong Lu","author_inst":"1 Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan,China; 2 Joint International L"},{"author_name":"Di Liu","author_inst":"7 Pritzker School of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, USA"},{"author_name":"Huadong Li","author_inst":"Jin Yin-tan Hospital, Wuhan 430022, China"},{"author_name":"Adalbert Krawczyk","author_inst":"9 Department of Infectious Diseases, University Hospital of Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen 45147, Germany."},{"author_name":"Mengji Lu","author_inst":"2 Joint International Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan,China;10 Institute for Virology, University Hos"},{"author_name":"Dongliang Yang","author_inst":"1 Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan,China; 2 Joint International L"},{"author_name":"Fei Deng","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, China"},{"author_name":"Ulf Dittmer","author_inst":"2 Joint International Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan,China;10 Institute for Virology, University Hos"},{"author_name":"Mirko Trilling","author_inst":"2 Joint International Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan,China;10 Institute for Virology, University Hos"},{"author_name":"Xin Zheng","author_inst":"1 Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan,China; 2 Joint International L"},{"author_name":"Jean-Paul Soulillou","author_inst":"University of Nantes"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.21.20159335","rel_title":"Model-free estimation of COVID-19 transmission dynamics from a complete outbreak","rel_date":"2020-07-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.21.20159335","rel_abs":"Background New Zealand had 1499 cases of COVID-19 before eliminating transmission of the virus. Extensive contract tracing during the outbreak has resulted in a dataset of epidemiologically linked cases. This data contains useful information about the transmission dynamics of the virus, its dependence on factors such as age, and its response to different control measures. Method We use Monte-Carlo network construction techniques to provide an estimate of the number of secondary cases for every individual infected during the outbreak. We then apply standard statistical techniques to quantify differences between groups of individuals. Findings Children under 10 years old are significantly under-represented in the case data. Children infected fewer people on average and had a lower secondary attack rate in comparison to adults and the elderly. Imported cases infected fewer people on average and had a lower secondary attack rate than domestically acquired cases. Superspreading is a significant contributor to the epidemic dynamics, with 20% of cases among adults responsible for 65-85% of transmission. Asymptomatic cases infected fewer individuals than clinical cases. Serial intervals are approximately normally distributed (=5.0 days, {sigma}=5.7 days). Early isolation and quarantine of cases reduced secondary transmission rates.

Potential explanations (e.g., warmer environments [1], younger populations [2,3,4]) have yet to be framed within a comprehensive analysis accounting for factors that may offset the effects of climate and demography. Here, we synthesize factors hypothesized to shape the pace of this pandemic and its burden as it moves across SSA, encompassing demographic, comorbidity, climatic, healthcare and intervention capacity, and human mobility dimensions of risk. We find large scale diversity in probable drivers, such that outcomes are likely to be highly variable among SSA countries. While simulation shows that extensive climatic variation among SSA population centers has little effect on early outbreak trajectories, heterogeneity in connectivity is likely to play a large role in shaping the pace of viral spread. The prolonged, asynchronous outbreaks expected in weakly connected settings may result in extended stress to health systems. In addition, the observed variability in comorbidities and access to care will likely modulate the severity of infection: We show that even small shifts in the infection fatality ratio towards younger ages, which are likely in high risk settings, can eliminate the protective effect of younger populations. We highlight countries with elevated risk of slow pace, high burden outbreaks. Empirical data on the spatial extent of outbreaks within SSA countries, their patterns in severity over age, and the relationship between epidemic pace and health system disruptions are urgently needed to guide efforts to mitigate the high burden scenarios explored here.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Benjamin L Rice","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Akshaya V Annapragada","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rachel E.

However, the factors determining whether or not pneumonia develops remain to be fully uncovered. We therefore explored the associations of several lifestyle factors with signs of pneumonia in COVID-19. Methods Between May and July 2020, we conducted an online survey of 201 adults in Germany who had recently gone through COVID-19, predominantly as outpatients. Of these, 165 had a PCR-based diagnosis and 36 had a retrospective diagnosis by antibody testing. The survey covered demographic information, eight lifestyle factors, comorbidities and medication use. We defined the main outcome as the presence vs. the absence of signs of pneumonia, represented by dyspnea, the requirement for oxygen therapy or intubation. Results Signs of pneumonia occurred in 39 of the 165 individuals with a PCR-based diagnosis of COVID-19 (23.6%). Among the lifestyle factors examined, only overweight\/obesity associated with signs of pneumonia (odds ratio 2.68 (1.29 - 5.59) p=0.008). The observed association remained significant after multivariate adjustment, with BMI as a metric variable, and also after including the antibody-positive individuals into the analysis. Conclusions This exploratory study finds an association of overweight\/obesity with signs of pneumonia in COVID-19. This finding suggests that a signal proportional to body fat mass, such as the hormone leptin, impairs the body's ability to clear SARS-CoV-2 before pneumonia develops. This hypothesis concurs with previous work and should be investigated further to possibly reduce the proportion of severe cases of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vanessa Sacco","author_inst":"LMU Klinikum"},{"author_name":"Barbara Rauch","author_inst":"LMU Klinikum"},{"author_name":"Christina Gar","author_inst":"LMU Klinikum"},{"author_name":"Stefanie Haschka","author_inst":"LMU Klinikum"},{"author_name":"Anne L Potzel","author_inst":"LMU Klinikum"},{"author_name":"Stefanie Kern-Matschilles","author_inst":"LMU Klinikum"},{"author_name":"Friederike Banning","author_inst":"LMU Klinikum"},{"author_name":"Irina Benz","author_inst":"LMU Klinikum"},{"author_name":"Mandy Meisel","author_inst":"LMU Klinikum"},{"author_name":"Jochen Seissler","author_inst":"LMU Klinikum"},{"author_name":"Andreas Lechner","author_inst":"LMU Klinikum"},{"author_name":"Tanjona Ramiadantsoa","author_inst":"University of Fianarantsoa"},{"author_name":"Fidisoa Rasambainarivo","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Weiyu Yu","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"B.T.

Many scientists have struggled to make forecasts about its impact. Especially, appropriate preparations for a second wave are needed not to move in a costly panic mode again. It is necessary to get ideas about worst case scenarios regarding incidences, hospitalization, or use of ICU resources. They can be described in terms of extreme quantiles (95%, 99%, 99.9%) of specific distributions that supposedly formalize the data mechanism behind future observations. Therefore, distributional issues do matter. Cirillo and Taleb argue that a natural and empirically correct framework for assessing and managing real risk in pandemics is provided by extreme value theory dealing with extrema and not averages. We explore this idea in more detail. In this paper we discuss the fat-tail patterns in the distribution of the global COVID-19 data by analyzing data from 66 countries worldwide. We also explore their relevance at a lower, regional scale perspective (national, federal state), which is in our opinion more relevant for planning measures against the epidemic spread. For this we analyze data from the German federal state of Bavaria. We conclude that fat-tail patterns are seen in global data, possibly reflecting the respective heterogeneity between different countries regarding incidences and fatalities during the ongoing epidemic. However, the disease activity at regional level seems to be better described by classical Poisson based models. To bridge the gap between regional and global phenomena we refer to mixtures of slim-tail distributions that may create fat-tail features. Especially in the beginning of a pandemic acting according to the \"better safe than sorry\" principle and taking extreme forecasts as the basis for the decisions might be justified. However, as the pandemic continues and control measures are partially lifted, there is a need for a careful discussion how to choose relevant distributions and their respective quantiles for future resource planning in order not to cause more harm as the pandemic itself.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kirsi Manz","author_inst":"Ludwig Maximilians University Munich"},{"author_name":"Ulrich Mansmann","author_inst":"Ludwig Maximilians University Munich"},{"author_name":"Christina Gar","author_inst":"LMU Klinikum"},{"author_name":"Stefanie Haschka","author_inst":"LMU Klinikum"},{"author_name":"Anne L Potzel","author_inst":"LMU Klinikum"},{"author_name":"Stefanie Kern-Matschilles","author_inst":"LMU Klinikum"},{"author_name":"Friederike Banning","author_inst":"LMU Klinikum"},{"author_name":"Irina Benz","author_inst":"LMU Klinikum"},{"author_name":"Mandy Meisel","author_inst":"LMU Klinikum"},{"author_name":"Jochen Seissler","author_inst":"LMU Klinikum"},{"author_name":"Andreas Lechner","author_inst":"LMU Klinikum"},{"author_name":"Tanjona Ramiadantsoa","author_inst":"University of Fianarantsoa"},{"author_name":"Fidisoa Rasambainarivo","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Weiyu Yu","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"B.T.

In extreme situations, patients develop a dysregulated inflammatory lung injury called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that causes progressive respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilatory support. Recent studies have demonstrated immunologic dysfunction in severely ill COVID-19 patients. To further delineate the dysregulated immune response driving more severe clinical course from SARS-CoV-2 infection, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to analyze the transcriptome of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from hospitalized COVID-19 patients having mild disease (n = 5), developing ARDS (n = 6), and recovering from ARDS (n = 6). Our data demonstrated an overwhelming inflammatory response with select immunodeficiencies within various immune populations in ARDS patients. Specifically, their monocytes had defects in antigen presentation and deficiencies in interferon responsiveness that contrasted the higher interferon signals in lymphocytes. Furthermore, cytotoxic activity was suppressed in both NK and CD8 lymphocytes whereas B cell activation was deficient, which is consistent with the delayed viral clearance in severely ill COVID-19 patients. Finally, we identified altered signaling pathways in the severe group that suggests immunosenescence and immunometabolic changes could be contributing to the dysfunctional immune response. Our study demonstrates that COVID-19 patients with ARDS have an immunologically distinct response when compared to those with a more innocuous disease course and show a state of immune imbalance in which deficiencies in both the innate and adaptive immune response may be contributing to a more severe disease course in COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Changfu Yao","author_inst":"Cedars Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Stephanie A Bora","author_inst":"Cedars Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Tanyalak Parimon","author_inst":"Cedars Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Tanzira Zaman","author_inst":"Cedars Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Oren A Friedman","author_inst":"Cedars Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Joseph A Palatinus","author_inst":"Cedars Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Nirmala S Surapaneni","author_inst":"Cedars Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yuri P Matusov","author_inst":"Cedars Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Giuliana Cerro Chiang","author_inst":"Cedars Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Alexander G Kassar","author_inst":"Cedars Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Nayan Patel","author_inst":"Cedars Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Chelsi ER Green","author_inst":"Cedars Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Adam W Aziz","author_inst":"Cedars Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Harshpreet Suri","author_inst":"Cedars Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jo Suda","author_inst":"Cedars Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Andres A Lopez","author_inst":"Cedars Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Gislaine A Martins","author_inst":"Cedars Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Barry R Stripp","author_inst":"Cedars Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Sina A Gharib","author_inst":"University of Washington Seattle"},{"author_name":"Helen S Goodridge","author_inst":"Cedars Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Peter Chen","author_inst":"Cedars Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Adalbert Krawczyk","author_inst":"9 Department of Infectious Diseases, University Hospital of Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen 45147, Germany."},{"author_name":"Mengji Lu","author_inst":"2 Joint International Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan,China;10 Institute for Virology, University Hos"},{"author_name":"Dongliang Yang","author_inst":"1 Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan,China; 2 Joint International L"},{"author_name":"Fei Deng","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, China"},{"author_name":"Ulf Dittmer","author_inst":"2 Joint International Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan,China;10 Institute for Virology, University Hos"},{"author_name":"Mirko Trilling","author_inst":"2 Joint International Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan,China;10 Institute for Virology, University Hos"},{"author_name":"Xin Zheng","author_inst":"1 Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan,China; 2 Joint International L"},{"author_name":"Jean-Paul Soulillou","author_inst":"University of Nantes"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.23.217083","rel_title":"An in-silico study on SARS-CoV-2: Its compatibility with human tRNA pool, and the polymorphism arising in a single lineage over a month","rel_date":"2020-07-24","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.23.217083","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic that has costed enormous human lives in the recent past. The present study is an investigation of the viral codon adaptation, ORFs stability and tRNA co-adaptation with humans. We observed that for the codon usage bias in viral ssRNA, ORFs have near values of folding free energies and codon adaptation index with mRNAs of the human housekeeping CDS. However, the correlation between the stability of the ORFs in ssRNA and CAI is stronger than the mRNA stability and CAI of HKG, suggesting a greater expression capacity of SARS-CoV-2. Mutational analysis reflects polymorphism in the virus for ORF1ab, surface glycoprotein and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein ORFs. Non-synonymous mutations have shown non-polar substitutions. Out of the twelve mutations nine are for a higher t-RNA copy number. Viruses in general have high mutation rates. To understand the chances of survival for the mutated SARS-CoV-2 we did simulation for synonymous mutations. It resulted in 50% ORFs with higher stability than their native equivalents. Thus, considering only the synonymous mutations the virus can exhibit a lot of polymorphism. Collectively our data provides new insights for SARS-CoV-2 mutations and the human t-RNA compatibility.\n\nSignificanceSurvivability of SARS-CoV-2 in humans is essential for its spread. It has overlapping genes exhibiting a high codon optimization with humans even after a higher codon usage bias. They seem to possess cognizance for high copy number t-RNA (cognate or near-cognate) in humans, while mutating. Even though, it has been well established that native transcripts posses the highest stability, our in-silico studies show that SARS-CoV-2 under mutations give rise to ORFs with higher stability. These results significantly present the viruss ability and the credibility of survival for the mutants. Despite its focus on a geographical location it explains the ongoing behavior of SARS-CoV-2 for a steady existence in humans as all the different lineages have a common origin.
