Existing academic, governmental and industrial institutions and companies have engaged in large-scale screening of existing drugs, in vitro, in vivo and in silico. Here, we are using in silico modelling of SARS-CoV-2 drug targets, i.e. SARS-CoV-2 protein structures as deposited on the Protein Databank (PDB). We study their flexibility, rigidity and mobility, an important first step in trying to ascertain their dynamics for further drug-related docking studies. We are using a recent protein flexibility modelling approach, combining protein structural rigidity with possible motion consistent with chemical bonds and sterics. For example, for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the open configuration, our method identifies a possible further opening and closing of the S1 subunit through movement of SB domain. With full structural information of this process available, docking studies with possible drug structures are then possible in silico. In our study, we present full results for the more than 200 thus far published SARS-CoV-2-related protein structures in the PDB.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rudolf A Roemer","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Navodya Sophie Roemer","author_inst":"University of Lincoln"},{"author_name":"Anne Katrine Wallis","author_inst":"University of Warwick"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"molecular biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.10.20150045","rel_title":"Genomic epidemiology reveals multiple introductions and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the Indian state of Karnataka","rel_date":"2020-07-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.10.20150045","rel_abs":"Karnataka, a state in south India, reported its first case of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on March 8, 2020, more than a month after the first case was reported in India. We used a combination of contact tracing and genomic epidemiology to trace the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the state up until May 21, 2020 (1578 cases). We obtained 47 full genomes of SARS-CoV-2 which clustered into six lineages (Pangolin lineages-A, B, B.1, B.1.1, B.4, and B.6). The lineages in Karnataka were known to be circulating in China, Southeast Asia, Iran, Europe and other parts of India and are likely to have been imported into the state both by international and domestic travel. Our sequences grouped into 12 contact clusters and 11 cases with no known contacts. We found nine of the 12 contact clusters had a single lineage of the virus, consistent with multiple introductions and most (8\/12) were contained within a single district, reflecting local spread. In most of the twelve clusters, the index case (9\/12) and spreaders (8\/12) were symptomatic. Of the 47 sequences, 31 belonged to the B\/B.6 lineage, including seven of eleven cases with no known contact, indicating ongoing transmission of this lineage in the state. Genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Karnataka suggests multiple introductions of the virus followed by local transmission in parallel with ongoing viral evolution. This is the first study from India combining genomic data with epidemiological information emphasizing the need for an integrated approach to outbreak response.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chitra Pattabiraman","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Farhat Habib","author_inst":"TruFactor-InMobi Group, Bangalore"},{"author_name":"Harsha PK","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Risha Rasheed","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Vijayalakshmi Reddy","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Prameela Dinesh","author_inst":"Directorate of Health and Family Welfare Services, Government of Karnataka, Bangalore- 560012"},{"author_name":"Tina Damodar","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Nakka Vijay Kiran Reddy","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Kiran Hosallimath","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Anson K George","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Banerjee John","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Amrita Pattanaik","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Narendra Kumar","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Reeta S Mani","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Manjunatha M Venkataswamy","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Shafeeq K Shahul Hameed","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Prakash Kumar B.G.","author_inst":"Directorate of Health and Family Welfare Services, Government of Karnataka, Bangalore, - 560012"},{"author_name":"Anita Desai","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Ravi Vasanthapuram","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.09.20150086","rel_title":"Transmission dynamics and control measures of COVID-19 outbreak in China: a modelling study","rel_date":"2020-07-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.09.20150086","rel_abs":"COVID-19 is reported to have been effectively brought under control in China at its initial start place. To understand the COVID-19 outbreak in China and provide potential lessons for other parts of the world, in this study we combine a mathematical modelling with multiple datasets to estimate its transmissibility and severity and how it was affected by the unprecedented control measures. Our analyses show that before 29th January 2020, the ascertainment rate is 6.9%(95%CI: 3.5 - 14.6%); then it increased to 41.5%(95%CI: 30.6 - 65.1%). The basic reproduction number (R0) was 2.23(95%CI: 1.86 - 3.22) before 8th February 2020; then it dropped to 0.04(95%CI: 0.01 - 0.10). This estimation also indicates that the effect on transmissibility of control measures taken since 23rd January 2020 emerged about two weeks late. The confirmed case fatality rate is estimated at 4.41%(95%CI: 3.65 - 5.30%). This shows that SARS-CoV-2 virus is highly transmissible but less severe than SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. We found that at the early stage, the majority of R0 comes from the undetected infected people. This implies that the successful control in China was achieved through decreasing the contact rates among people in general populations and increasing the rate of detection and quarantine of the infected cases.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"XuSheng Zhang","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Emilia Vynnycky","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Andre Charlett","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Daniela de Angelis","author_inst":"Cambridge University"},{"author_name":"Zhengji Chen","author_inst":"Kunming medical university"},{"author_name":"Wei Liu","author_inst":"Kunming medical University"},{"author_name":"Tina Damodar","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Nakka Vijay Kiran Reddy","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Kiran Hosallimath","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Anson K George","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Banerjee John","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Amrita Pattanaik","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Narendra Kumar","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Reeta S Mani","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Manjunatha M Venkataswamy","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Shafeeq K Shahul Hameed","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Prakash Kumar B.G.","author_inst":"Directorate of Health and Family Welfare Services, Government of Karnataka, Bangalore, - 560012"},{"author_name":"Anita Desai","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Ravi Vasanthapuram","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.09.20150235","rel_title":"The diagnostic accuracy of nucleic acid point-of-care tests for human coronavirus: A systematic review and meta-analysis","rel_date":"2020-07-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.09.20150235","rel_abs":"Many recent studies reported coronavirus point of care tests (POCTs) based on isothermal amplification.

Most studies had high risk of patient selection and index test bias but low risk in other domains. Most studies (n = 21) used reverse-transcribed loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) to diagnose Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Summary estimated ln(DOR) for RT-LAMP of RNA purified COVID-19 samples is 6.50 (95%CI 5.25-7.76), similar to the previously reported value for RT-LAMP of other RNA virus. RT-LAMP from crude samples has significantly lower ln(DOR) at 4.46 (95%CI 3.53-5.38). SAMBA-II has the highest ln(DOR) at 8.00 (95%CI 6.14-9.87). Abbott ID Now performance is similar to RT-LAMP of crude sample. The performances of CRISPR diagnosis and RT-LAMP are not significantly different. Types of coronaviruses and publication status have no significant effect on diagnosis performance. Existing nucleic acid POCTs, particularly RT-LAMP, CRISPR diagnosis and SAMBA-II, have good diagnostic performance. Future work should focus on improving a study design to minimize the risk of biases.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pakpoom Subsoontorn","author_inst":"Naresuan University"},{"author_name":"Manupat Lohitnavy","author_inst":"Naresuan University"},{"author_name":"Chuenjid Kongkaew","author_inst":"Naresuan University"},{"author_name":"Daniela de Angelis","author_inst":"Cambridge University"},{"author_name":"Zhengji Chen","author_inst":"Kunming medical university"},{"author_name":"Wei Liu","author_inst":"Kunming medical University"},{"author_name":"Tina Damodar","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Nakka Vijay Kiran Reddy","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Kiran Hosallimath","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Anson K George","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Banerjee John","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Amrita Pattanaik","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Narendra Kumar","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Reeta S Mani","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Manjunatha M Venkataswamy","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Shafeeq K Shahul Hameed","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Prakash Kumar B.G.","author_inst":"Directorate of Health and Family Welfare Services, Government of Karnataka, Bangalore, - 560012"},{"author_name":"Anita Desai","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"},{"author_name":"Ravi Vasanthapuram","author_inst":"Department of Neurovirology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.10.20150375","rel_title":"Poor correlation between antibody titers and neutralizing activity in sera from SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects","rel_date":"2020-07-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.10.20150375","rel_abs":"Plenty of serologic tests for SARS-CoV-2 have been developed so far, thus documenting the importance of evaluating the relevant features of the immune response to this viral agent.

Secondly, eighty-five negative serum samples collected before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic were analyzed. Thirdly, possible correlations between antibody levels and the resulting neutralizing activity against a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated. Results revealed that both tests are endowed with low sensitivity on the day of hospital admission, which increased to 97.8 and 100% for samples collected after 15 days for DiaSorin and Roche tests, respectively. The specificity of the two tests ranges from 96.5 to 100%, respectively.

SARS-CoV-2 virus has circulated in hospitals, care homes and the community since January 2020. Our current epidemiological knowledge is largely informed by clinical cases with far less understanding of community transmission. Methods The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT) study is a nationally representative prevalence survey of SARS-CoV-2 virus swab-positivity in the community in England. We recruited participants regardless of symptom status. Results We found 159 positives from 120,610 swabs giving an average prevalence of 0.13% (95% CI: 0.11%,0.15%) from 1st May to 1st June 2020. We showed decreasing prevalence with a halving time of 8.6 (6.2, 13.6) days, implying an overall reproduction number R of 0.57 (0.45, 0.72). Adults aged 18 to 24 yrs had the highest swab-positivity rates, while those >64 yrs had the lowest. Of the 126 participants who tested positive with known symptom status in the week prior to their swab, 39 reported symptoms while 87 did not, giving an estimate that 69% (61%,76%) of people were symptom-free for the 7 days prior testing positive in our community sample. Symptoms strongly associated with swab-positivity were: nausea and\/or vomiting, diarrhoea, blocked nose, loss of smell, loss of taste, headache, chills and severe fatigue. Recent contact with a known COVID-19 case was associated with odds of 24 (16, 38) for swab-positivity. Compared with non-key workers, odds of swab-positivity were 7.7 (2.4, 25) among care home (long-term care facilities) workers and 5.2 (2.9, 9.3) among health care workers. However, some of the excess risk associated with key worker status was explained by recent contact with COVID-19 cases. We found no strong evidence for geographical variability in positive swab results. Conclusion Our results provide a reliable baseline against which the impact of subsequent relaxation of lockdown can be assessed to inform future public health efforts to control transmission.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Steven Riley","author_inst":"Dept Inf Dis Epi, Imperial College"},{"author_name":"Kylie E.

Design: Prospective evaluation of initial three weeks of a daily Monday to Friday pilot SARS-CoV-2 serology service for patients. Setting: Early post 'first-wave' SARS-CoV-2 transmission period at single centre London teaching hospital that provides care to the local community, as well as regional and national referral pathways for specialist services. Participants: 110 (72 adults, 38 children, age range 0-83 years, 52.7% female (n=58)). Interventions: Patient serum from vetted referrals tested on CE marked and internally validated lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) (SureScreen Diagnostics) detecting antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, with result and clinical interpretation provided to the direct care team. Main outcome measures: Performance characteristics, source and nature of referrals, feasibility and clinical utility of the service, particularly the benefit for clinical decision-making. Results: The LFIA was deemed suitable for clinical advice and decision making following evaluation with 310 serum samples from SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patients and 300 pre-pandemic samples, giving a sensitivity and specificity of 96.1% and 99.3% respectively. For the pilot, 115 referrals were received leading to 113 tests performed on 108 participants (sample not available for two participants); paediatrics (n=35), medicine (n=69), surgery (n=2) and general practice (n=2). 43.4% participants (n=49) had detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. There were three main indications for serology; new acute presentations potentially triggered by recent COVID-19 infection e.g. PIMS-TS (n=26) and pulmonary embolism (n=5), potential missed diagnoses in context of a recent compatible illness (n=40), and making infection control and immunosuppression treatment decisions in persistently SARS-CoV-2 RNA PCR positive individuals (n=6). Conclusions: This study shows acceptable performance characteristics, feasibility and clinical utility of a SARS-CoV-2 serology service using a rapid, inexpensive and portable assay for adults and children presenting with a range of clinical indications. Results correlated closely with a confirmatory in-house ELISA. The study showed the benefit of introducing a serology service where there is a reasonable pre-test probability, and the result can be linked with clinical advice or intervention. Experience thus far is that the volume of requests from hospital referral routes are manageable within existing clinical and laboratory services; however, the demand from community referrals has not yet been assessed. Given recent evidence for a rapid decline in antibodies, particularly following mild infection, there is likely a limited window of opportunity to realise the benefit of serology testing for individuals infected during the 'first-wave' before they potentially fall below a measurable threshold. Rapidly expanding availability of serology services for NHS patients will also help understand the long-term implications of serostatus and prior infection in different patient groups, particularly before emergence of any 'second-wave' outbreak or introduction of a vaccination programme.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicola Sweeney","author_inst":"Guy's & St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Blair Merrick","author_inst":"Guy's & St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Suzanne Pickering","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rui Pedro Galao","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Alina Botgros","author_inst":"Guy's & St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Harry D.

Aim of this study is to assess the excess mortality (EM) during COVID-19 outbreak in highly impacted areas of northern Italy. Methods: We analyzed data on deaths occurred in the first four months of 2020 in health protection agencies (HPA) of Bergamo and Brescia (Lombardy), building a time-series of daily number of deaths and predicting the daily standardized mortality ratio (SMR) and cumulative number of excess deaths (ED) through a Poisson generalized additive model of the observed counts in 2020, using 2019 data as a reference. Results: We estimated 5740 (95% Credible Set (CS): 5552-5936) ED in the HPA of Bergamo and 3703 (95% CS: 3535 - 3877) in Brescia, corresponding to 2.55 (95% CS: 2.50-2.61) and 1.93 (95% CS: 1.89-1.98) folds increase in the number of deaths. The ED wave started a few days later in Brescia, but the daily estimated SMR peaked at the end of March in both HPAs, roughly two weeks after the introduction of lock-down measures, with significantly higher estimates in Bergamo (9.4, 95% CI: 9.1-9.7). Conclusion: EM was significantly larger than that officially attributed to COVID-19, disclosing its hidden burden likely due to indirect effects on health system. Time-series analyses highlighted the impact of lockdown restrictions, with a lower EM in the HPA where there was a smaller delay between the epidemic outbreak and their enforcement.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sara Conti","author_inst":"Center for Public Health Research, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy"},{"author_name":"Pietro Ferrara","author_inst":"Center for Public Health Research, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giampiero Mazzaglia","author_inst":"Center for Public Health Research, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marco I D'Orso","author_inst":"Center for Public Health Research, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy"},{"author_name":"Roberta Ciampichini","author_inst":"ATS Bergamo"},{"author_name":"Carla Fornari","author_inst":"Center for Public Health Research, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy"},{"author_name":"Fabiana Madotto","author_inst":"Center for Public Health Research, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy"},{"author_name":"Michele Magoni","author_inst":"ATS Brescia"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Sampietro","author_inst":"ATS Bergamo"},{"author_name":"Andrea Silenzi","author_inst":"ATS Brescia"},{"author_name":"Claudio V Sileo","author_inst":"ATS Brescia"},{"author_name":"Andrea Zucchi","author_inst":"ATS Bergamo"},{"author_name":"Giancarlo Cesana","author_inst":"Center for Public Health Research, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy"},{"author_name":"Lamberto Manzoli","author_inst":"University of Ferrara"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo G Mantovani","author_inst":"Center for Public Health Research, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy"},{"author_name":"Stuart J.

At this stage, it is desirable to monitor the degree to which political measures or social affairs have exerted influence on the spread of disease. Though it is difficult to trace back individual transmission of infections whose incubation periods are long and highly variable, estimating the average spreading rate is possible if a proper mathematical model can be devised to analyze daily event-occurrences. To render an accurate assessment, we have devised a state-space method for fitting the Hawkes process to a given dataset of daily confirmed cases. The proposed method detects changes occurring in each country and assesses the impact of social events in terms of the temporally varying reproduction number, which corresponds to the average number of cases directly caused by a single infected case. Moreover, the proposed method can be used to predict the possible consequences of alternative political measures. This information can serve as a reference for behavioral guidelines that should be adopted according to the varying risk of infection.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shinsuke Koyama","author_inst":"The Institute of Statistical Mathematics, Tokyo 190-8562, Japan"},{"author_name":"Taiki Horie","author_inst":"Department of Physics, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8502, Japan"},{"author_name":"Shigeru Shinomoto","author_inst":"Kyoto University"},{"author_name":"Marco I D'Orso","author_inst":"Center for Public Health Research, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy"},{"author_name":"Roberta Ciampichini","author_inst":"ATS Bergamo"},{"author_name":"Carla Fornari","author_inst":"Center for Public Health Research, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy"},{"author_name":"Fabiana Madotto","author_inst":"Center for Public Health Research, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy"},{"author_name":"Michele Magoni","author_inst":"ATS Brescia"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Sampietro","author_inst":"ATS Bergamo"},{"author_name":"Andrea Silenzi","author_inst":"ATS Brescia"},{"author_name":"Claudio V Sileo","author_inst":"ATS Brescia"},{"author_name":"Andrea Zucchi","author_inst":"ATS Bergamo"},{"author_name":"Giancarlo Cesana","author_inst":"Center for Public Health Research, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy"},{"author_name":"Lamberto Manzoli","author_inst":"University of Ferrara"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo G Mantovani","author_inst":"Center for Public Health Research, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy"},{"author_name":"Stuart J.

We show that the most widely referenced parameter, the 'basic reproduction number' (R0), is fundamentally connected to the relative odds of increasing or decreasing the infectives population. As a consequence, for R0 > 1 the probability that no outbreak occurs is 1\/R0. In stark contrast to a deterministic SIR, when R0 = 1.5 the random walk has a 67% chance of avoiding outbreak. Thus, an alternative, probabilistic, interpretation of R0 arises, which provides a novel estimate of the critical population density {gamma}\/r without fitting SIR models. We demonstrate that SARS-CoV2 in the United States is consistent with our model and attempt an estimate of {gamma}\/r. In doing so, we uncover a significant source of bias in public data reporting. Data are aggregated on political boundaries, which bear no concern for dispersion of population density. We show that this introduces bias in fits and parameter estimates, a concern for understanding fundamental virus parameters and for policy making. Anonymized data at the resolution required for contact tracing would afford access to {gamma}\/r without fitting. The random walk SIR developed here highlights the intuition that any epidemic is stochastic and recovers all the key parameter values noted by Kermack and McKendrick in 1927.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bradley M Dickson","author_inst":"Van Andel Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Elaina Pascarella","author_inst":"University of Virginia"},{"author_name":"Shigeru Shinomoto","author_inst":"Kyoto University"},{"author_name":"Marco I D'Orso","author_inst":"Center for Public Health Research, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy"},{"author_name":"Roberta Ciampichini","author_inst":"ATS Bergamo"},{"author_name":"Carla Fornari","author_inst":"Center for Public Health Research, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy"},{"author_name":"Fabiana Madotto","author_inst":"Center for Public Health Research, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy"},{"author_name":"Michele Magoni","author_inst":"ATS Brescia"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Sampietro","author_inst":"ATS Bergamo"},{"author_name":"Andrea Silenzi","author_inst":"ATS Brescia"},{"author_name":"Claudio V Sileo","author_inst":"ATS Brescia"},{"author_name":"Andrea Zucchi","author_inst":"ATS Bergamo"},{"author_name":"Giancarlo Cesana","author_inst":"Center for Public Health Research, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy"},{"author_name":"Lamberto Manzoli","author_inst":"University of Ferrara"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo G Mantovani","author_inst":"Center for Public Health Research, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy"},{"author_name":"Stuart J.

Eurofins performed >700 tests on 78 unique samples from 18 sites in Denmark, France and Belgium. Ten variant test protocols were trialed. Protocol variations trialed included centrifugation, precipitation of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA, agitation prior to precipitation, cooling, and pasteurization of the samples. A method was succesfully developed and reliability was supported by stability, reproducibility, and dilution & linearity studies. Results obtained showed a direct link to number of RNA copies in the sample using a calibration curve with synthetic SARS-CoV-2. Analysis was performed on both the liquid phase and solid phase of wastewater samples, with virus RNA detected in both phases but more frequently in the liquid phase. The virus was present in a sample from a Danish community wastewater treatment plant collected on February 24, 3 days before the first COVID-19 case was officially reported in the country. The greatest concentration of virus detected corresponded to when the COVID-19 crisis was at its peak in Denmark. Based on studies carried out in a Danish hospital, the wastewater testing method is expected to be able to detect a community COVID-19 prevalence rate as low as a 0,02%-0,1% (i.e. between 2 virus shedders per 10000 and 1 virus shedder per 1000).

Simple measures of physical fitness, such as self-reported walking pace, could also be important risk factors, but have not been well documented. This analysis includes 414,201 UK Biobank participants with complete covariate and linked COVID-19 data. We analysed the risk of severe (in-hospital) COVID-19 across categories of obesity status and walking pace. As of June 20th 2020 there were 972 cases of severe COVID-19 that had occurred within the cohort. Compared to normal weight individuals, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for severe COVID-9 in those with obesity was 1.49 (1.24, 1.78). Compared to those with a brisk walking pace, the OR in slow walkers was 1.84 (1.49, 2.27). Slow walkers had the highest risk of severe COVID-19 regardless of obesity status. For example, compared to normal weight brisk walkers, the odds of severe COVID-19 in obese brisk walkers was 1.39 (0.99, 1.98), whereas the odds in normal weight slow walkers was 2.48 (1.56, 3.93). Self-reported walking pace, a simple measure of functional fitness, appears to be a risk factor for severe COVID-19 that is independent of obesity. This may help inform simple pragmatic public health risk stratification and preventative strategies.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas Yates","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Cameron Razieh","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Francesco Zaccardi","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Samuel Seidu","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Melanie J Davies","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Kamlesh Khunti","author_inst":"University of Leicester"},{"author_name":"Dan Zigmond","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Initiative"},{"author_name":"Michele Magoni","author_inst":"ATS Brescia"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Sampietro","author_inst":"ATS Bergamo"},{"author_name":"Andrea Silenzi","author_inst":"ATS Brescia"},{"author_name":"Claudio V Sileo","author_inst":"ATS Brescia"},{"author_name":"Andrea Zucchi","author_inst":"ATS Bergamo"},{"author_name":"Giancarlo Cesana","author_inst":"Center for Public Health Research, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy"},{"author_name":"Lamberto Manzoli","author_inst":"University of Ferrara"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo G Mantovani","author_inst":"Center for Public Health Research, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy"},{"author_name":"Stuart J.

The disease has become a pandemic in just a few months and spread globally with more than 2.89 million cases and 203,000 deaths across 185 countries, as of April 26th, 2020. Ecuador has reported one of the highest rates of COVID-19 in Latin America, with more than 10K cases and 500 deaths in a country of approximately 17 million people. The dynamics of the outbreak is being observed quite different in different provinces of Ecuador with high reported prevalence in some low population density provinces. In this study, we aim to understand variations in outbreaks between provinces and provide assistance in essential preparedness planning in order to respond effectively to ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. The study estimated the critical level of quarantine rate along with corresponding leakage in order to avoid overwhelming the local health care system. The results suggest that provinces with high population density can avoid a large disease burden provided they initiate early and stricter quarantine measures even under low isolation rate. To best of our knowledge, this study is first from the region to determine which provinces will need much preparation for current outbreak in fall and which might need more help.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carlos Enrique Bustamante Orellana","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Jordy Jose Cevallos Chavez","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Cesar Montalvo","author_inst":"University of Virgina"},{"author_name":"Jeff Sullivan","author_inst":"Precisionheor"},{"author_name":"Edwin Michael","author_inst":"University of Notre Dame"},{"author_name":"Anuj Mubayi","author_inst":"Precisionheor"},{"author_name":"Dan Zigmond","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Initiative"},{"author_name":"Michele Magoni","author_inst":"ATS Brescia"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Sampietro","author_inst":"ATS Bergamo"},{"author_name":"Andrea Silenzi","author_inst":"ATS Brescia"},{"author_name":"Claudio V Sileo","author_inst":"ATS Brescia"},{"author_name":"Andrea Zucchi","author_inst":"ATS Bergamo"},{"author_name":"Giancarlo Cesana","author_inst":"Center for Public Health Research, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy"},{"author_name":"Lamberto Manzoli","author_inst":"University of Ferrara"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo G Mantovani","author_inst":"Center for Public Health Research, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy"},{"author_name":"Stuart J.

This study examined the prevalence of anxiety and depression, including associated factors and coping methods among undergraduate students in a Nigerian university. It also examined the association between psychological state and family functioning. Methods: The study design was cross-sectional and involved 386 undergraduate students across the main faculties. The university's ethical review board approved the study with approval number UI\/EC\/20\/0242. An online questionnaire, using Google form, was circulated among the students through their faculty representatives. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADs) was used in assessing anxiety and depression, while family functioning was assessed using the McMaster Family Assessment Device, (FAD). Data was entered into Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), and analysis carried out using descriptive statistics, chi-square, independent t-test, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Post-Hoc analysis and linear logistics regression, at  0.05. Results: The mean age was 21 {+\/-} 2.9 years, with a female population of 60.1%. Prevalence of anxiety and depression were 41.5% and 31.9% respectively. Students in health-related faculties were significantly less anxious than those in other faculties. Inability to afford three square meals, negative family functioning, having a chronic illness and living in a State\/Region with a high incidence of COVID-19, was significantly associated with depression. These factors jointly accounted for 14% of depression seen in undergraduate students. Most of the students coped by engaging themselves in social media, watching television\/movies and participating in other online skill development programmes. Conclusion: There was a high prevalence of anxiety and depression among university students with poor family functioning, inability to afford three meals\/day, living in a state with a high incidence of COVID-19 and having a chronic illness, contributing to depression. Measures need to be taken to support undergraduate students and their families to prevent the negative consequences of poor mental health.

Low-resource countries, however, experience barriers to preparedness due to limited resources. In Ghana, a country with a constrained healthcare system and high COVID-19 cases, we examined HCWs' perceived preparedness to respond to COVID-19 and associated factors. Methods: 472 HCWs completed questions in a cross-sectional self-administered online survey. Perceived preparedness was assessed using a 15-question scale (Cronbach alpha=0.91) and summative scores were created (range=0-45). Higher scores meant greater perceived preparedness. We used linear regression with robust standard errors to examine associations between perceived preparedness and potential predictors. Results: The average preparedness score was 24 (SD=8.9); 27.8% of HCWs felt prepared. In multivariate analysis, factors associated with higher perceived preparedness were: training ({beta}=3.35, 95%CI: 2.01 to 4.69); having adequate PPE ({beta}=2.27, 95%CI: 0.26 to 4.29), an isolation ward ({beta}=2.74, 95%CI: 1.15 to 4.33), and protocols for screening ({beta}=2.76, 95%CI: 0.95 to 4.58); and good perceived communication from management ({beta}=5.37, 95%CI: 4.03 to 7.90). When added to the model, perceived knowledge decreased the effect of training by 28.0%, although training remained significant, suggesting a partial mediating role. Perceived knowledge was associated with a 6-point increase in perceived preparedness score ({beta}=6.04, 95%CI: 4.19 to 7.90). Conclusion: HCWs reported low perceived preparedness to respond to COVID-19. Training, clear protocols, PPE availability, isolation wards, and communication play an important role in increasing preparedness. Government stakeholders must institute necessary interventions to increase HCWs' preparedness to respond to the ongoing pandemic and prepare for future pandemics.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patience A Afulani","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Akua O Gyamerah","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Raymond Aborigo","author_inst":"Navrongo Health Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Jerry Nutor","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Hawa Malechi","author_inst":"Tamale Teaching Hospital"},{"author_name":"Amos Laar","author_inst":"School of Public Health, University of Ghana"},{"author_name":"Mona Sterling","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"John J.K.

Utilizing data from the UK Biobank (UKB), a population-based prospective cohort, we formally tested the association of over 44 different types of cancer with COVID-19 infection and mortality among 7,661 subjects who were tested by June 17, 2020. Compared to non-cancer subjects, cancer subjects (N=1,521) had significantly lower overall risk for COVID-19 infection [odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.79 (0.68-0.92), P=2.60E-03]. However, a trend of higher risk for COVID-19 mortality was found among 256 COVID-19 positive cancer patients, especially for hematologic cancers such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma [3.82 (1.17-12.01), P=0.02]. In cancer patients, while few demographic, lifestyle, genetic and comorbidity factors predicted risk for COVID-19 infection, older age, male sex, heart disease and hypertension significantly predicted COVID-19 mortality. The lower risk for COVID-19 infection is likely due to extra caution in COVID-19 prevention and more testing among cancer patients, an encouraging finding that demonstrates the feasibility of intervention. These results, if confirmed in future releases of UKB data and other independent populations, may provide guidance for COVID-19 prevention and treatment among cancer patients.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhuqing Shi","author_inst":"NorthShore University HealthSystem"},{"author_name":"W.

However, the concrete evidence of its benefit in reducing the mortality in severe COVID-19 is lacking. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of relevant studies that compared the efficacy of Tocilizumab in severe COVID-19 vs. standard of care alone. Methods: The literature search for studies that compared Tocilizumab and Standard of care in the treatment of COVID-19 was done using major online databases from December 2019 to June 14th, 2020. Search words Tocilizumab, anti-interleukin-6 antibody, and COVID-19 or coronavirus 2019 in various combinations were used. Articles in the form of abstracts, letters without original data, case reports, and reviews were excluded. Data was gathered on an excel sheet, and statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.3. Results: Sixteen studies were eligible from 693 initial studies, including 3,641 patients (64% males). There were thirteen retrospective studies and three prospective studies. There were 2,488 patients in the standard of care group (61.7%) and 1,153 patients (68.7%) in the Tocilizumab group. The death rate in the tocilizumab group, 22.4% (258\/1153), was lower than the standard of care group, 26.21% (652\/2,488) (Pooled odds ratio 0.57 [95% CI 0.36-0.92] p=0.02). There was a significant heterogeneity (Inconsistency index= 80%) among the included studies. Conclusion: The addition of Tocilizumab to the standard of care might reduce the mortality in severe COVID-19. Larger randomized clinical trials are needed to validate these findings.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Umesha Boregowda","author_inst":"Bassett Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Abhilash Perisetti","author_inst":"University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Arpitha Nanjappa","author_inst":"Bassett Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Mahesh Gajendran","author_inst":"Texas Tech University, Paul L Foster School of Medicine,"},{"author_name":"Gurusaravanan Kutti Sridharan","author_inst":"University of Arizona, Banner University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Hemant Goyal","author_inst":"Wright Center for Graduate Medical Education"},{"author_name":"Liana K.

This study aimed to describe serum-IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of patients with both severe and mild COVID-19, including extended studies of patients who remained seronegative more than 90 days post symptom onset. Results: Forty-seven patients (mean age 49 years, 38% female) were included. All (15\/15) patients with severe symptoms and 29\/32 (90.6%) patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19 developed SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies in serum. Time to seroconversion was significantly shorter (median 11 vs. 22 days, P=0.04) in patients with severe compared to mild symptoms. Of the three patients without detectable IgG-responses after >90 days, all had detectable virus-neutralizing antibodies and in two, spike-protein receptor binding domain-specific IgG was detected with an in-house assay. Antibody titers were preserved during follow-up and all patients who seroconverted, irrespective of the severity of symptoms, still had detectable IgG levels >75 days post symptom onset. Conclusions: Patients with severe COVID-19 both seroconvert earlier and develop higher concentrations of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG than patients with mild symptoms. Of those patients who not develop detectable IgG antibodies, all have detectable virus-neutralizing antibodies, suggesting immunity. Our results showing that not all COVID-19 patients develop detectable IgG using two validated commercial clinical methods, even over time, are vital for the interpretation of COVID-19 seroprevalence surveys and for estimating the true infection prevalence in populations.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emelie Marklund","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Susannah Leach","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Hannes Axelsson","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Kristina Nordstr\u00f6m","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Hel\u00e9ne Norder","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Mats Bemark","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Davide Angeletti","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Anna Lundgren","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Staffan Nilsson","author_inst":"Chalmers University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Lars-Magnus Andersson","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Aylin Yilmaz","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Magnus Lindh","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Jan-\u00c5ke Liljeqvist","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Magnus Gissl\u00e9n","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo G Mantovani","author_inst":"Center for Public Health Research, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy"},{"author_name":"Stuart J.

An invaluable resource in this task is numerical modeling that can reveal key factors in COVID-19 pandemic development. On the other hand, it has become evident that regional infection curves of COVID-19 exhibit complex patterns which often differ from curves predicted by forecasting models. The wide variations in attack rate observed among different social strata suggest that this may be due to social heterogeneity not accounted for by regional models. We investigated this hypothesis by developing and using a new Stochastic Heterogeneous Epidemic Model (SHEM) that focuses on vulnerable subpopulations. We found that the isolation or embedding of vulnerable sub-clusters in a major population hub generated complex stochastic infection patterns which included multiple peaks and growth periods, an extended plateau, a prolonged tail, or a delayed second wave of infection. Embedded vulnerable groups became hotspots that drove infection despite efforts of the main population to socially distance, while isolated groups suffered delayed but intense infection. Amplification of infection by these hotspots facilitated transmission from one urban area to another, causing the epidemic to hopscotch in a stochastic manner to places it would not otherwise reach, resembling a microcosm of the situation worldwide as of September 2020. Our results suggest that social heterogeneity is a key factor in the formation of complex infection propagation patterns. Thus, the mitigation of vulnerable groups is essential to control the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. The design of our new model allows it to be applied in future studies of real-world scenarios on any scale, limited only by memory and the ability to determine the underlying topology and parameters.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexander V Maltsev","author_inst":"National Institute on Aging, NIH"},{"author_name":"Michael D Stern","author_inst":"National Institute on Aging, NIH"},{"author_name":"Hannes Axelsson","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Kristina Nordstr\u00f6m","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Hel\u00e9ne Norder","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Mats Bemark","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Davide Angeletti","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Anna Lundgren","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Staffan Nilsson","author_inst":"Chalmers University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Lars-Magnus Andersson","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Aylin Yilmaz","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Magnus Lindh","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Jan-\u00c5ke Liljeqvist","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Magnus Gissl\u00e9n","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo G Mantovani","author_inst":"Center for Public Health Research, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy"},{"author_name":"Stuart J.

Because medical treatments for the virus are still emerging and a vaccine is not yet available, state and local governments have sought to limit its spread by enacting various social distancing interventions such as school closures and lockdown, but the effectiveness of these interventions is unknown. We applied an established, semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model of these interventions on SARS-CoV-2 spread in Europe to the United States. We estimated the effect of interventions across all states, contrasted the estimated reproduction number, Rt , for each state before and after lockdown, and contrasted predicted future fatalities with actual fatalities as a check on the model's validity. Overall, school closures and lockdown are the only interventions modeled that have a reliable impact on Rt , and lockdown appears to have played a key role in reducing Rt below 1.0. We conclude that reversal of lockdown, without implementation of additional, equally effective interventions, will enable continued, sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew M.

Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Indonesia announced the first COVID-19 case on 2 March 2020. East Kalimantan has been determined as the new capital of Indonesia since 2019. This makes Samarinda as the capital of East Kalimantan has been focused for its capability of handling COVID-19 patients. We report the epidemiological characteristics and immunofluorescence assay results of these patients. Methods. All patients with positive confirmed COVID-19 by RT-PCR were admitted to hospitals and quarantine center in Samarinda. We retrospectively analyzed data from the daily report of the Samarinda City and East Kalimantan Health Office information system. Results. By June 25, 2020, 64 patients had been identified as having positive confirmed COVID-19. The mean age of the patients was 37.3 {+\/-} 13.8 years. Most of the patients were men (57 [90.6%] patients). Thirty-nine COVID-19 patients were imported cases with a history of traveling from South Sulawesi. Most of the patients were admitted to the Quarantine Center of Samarinda City. The mean duration from the first hospital admission for isolation to discharge was 25.6 {+\/-} 13.1 days. There was only one death case of COVID-19 patients in Samarinda. There were the highest confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Samarinda in early June 2020. There was a declining trend in the age of COVID-19 patients and the duration of isolation time in the hospital. Discussion. Imported cases still contributed to the increase of COVID-19 cases in Samarinda. Younger age of COVID-19 patients was more involved in frequent mobility which makes them cause the spread of the disease. Activation of the national reference laboratory for the COVID-19 examination in Samarinda has reduced the length of time patients treated in hospitals. Conclusion. The epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 patients show the ability of local governments to deal with this pandemic. This can be seen from the low case fatality rate in Samarinda.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Swandari Paramita","author_inst":"Mulawarman University"},{"author_name":"Ronny Isnuwardana","author_inst":"Mulawarman University"},{"author_name":"Anton Rahmadi","author_inst":"Mulawarman University"},{"author_name":"Osa Rafshodia","author_inst":"Samarinda City Health Office"},{"author_name":"Ismid Kusasih","author_inst":"Samarinda City Health Office"},{"author_name":"Mats Bemark","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Davide Angeletti","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Anna Lundgren","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Staffan Nilsson","author_inst":"Chalmers University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Lars-Magnus Andersson","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Aylin Yilmaz","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Magnus Lindh","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Jan-\u00c5ke Liljeqvist","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Magnus Gissl\u00e9n","author_inst":"University of Gothenburg"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo G Mantovani","author_inst":"Center for Public Health Research, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy"},{"author_name":"Stuart J.

Methods: From March 17, 2020 - May 26, 2020, we prospectively identified hospitalized children at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta with MIS-C (n=10), symptomatic PCR-confirmed COVID-19 (n=10), KD (n=5), and hospitalized controls (n=4). With IRB approval, we obtained prospective and residual blood samples from these children and measured SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) receptor binding domain (RBD) IgM and IgG binding antibodies by quantitative ELISA and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies by live-virus focus reduction neutralization assay. We statistically compared the log-transformed antibody titers among groups and performed correlation analyses using linear regression. Results: All children with MIS-C had high titers of SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG antibodies, which correlated strongly with neutralizing antibodies (R2=0.667, P<0.001). Children with MIS-C had significantly higher SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG antibody titers (geometric mean titer [GMT] 6800, 95%CI 3495-13231) than children with COVID-19 (GMT 626, 95%CI 251-1563, P<0.001), children with KD (GMT 124, 95%CI 91-170, P<0.001) and other hospitalized pediatric controls (GMT 85 [all below assay limit of detection], P<0.001). All children with MIS-C also had detectable RBD IgM antibodies, indicating recent SARS-CoV-2 infection. RBD IgG titers correlated with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (R2=0.512, P<0.046) and with hospital and ICU lengths of stay (R2=0.590, P=0.010). Conclusion: Quantitative SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibody titers may have a role in establishing the diagnosis of MIS-C, distinguishing it from other similar clinical entities, and stratifying risk for adverse outcomes.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christina A.

Real-time data are needed to quantify direct and indirect effects. We aimed to monitor hospital activity for presentation, diagnosis and treatment of CVDs during the pandemic to inform on indirect effects. Methods: We analysed aggregate data on presentations, diagnoses and treatments or procedures for selected CVDs (acute coronary syndromes, heart failure, stroke and transient ischaemic attack, venous thromboembolism, peripheral arterial disease and aortic aneurysm) in UK hospitals before and during the COVID-19 epidemic. We produced an online visualisation tool to enable near real-time monitoring of trends. Findings: Nine hospitals across England and Scotland contributed hospital activity data from 28 Oct 2019 (pre-COVID-19) to 10 May 2020 (pre-easing of lockdown), and for the same weeks during 2018-2019. Across all hospitals, total admissions and emergency department (ED) attendances decreased after lockdown (23 March 2020) by 57.9% (57.1-58.6%) and 52.9% (52.2-53.5%) respectively compared with the previous year. Activity for cardiac, cerebrovascular and other vascular conditions started to decline 1-2 weeks before lockdown, and fell by 31-88% after lockdown, with the greatest reductions observed for coronary artery bypass grafts, carotid endarterectomy, aortic aneurysm repair and peripheral arterial disease procedures. Compared with before the first UK COVID-19 (31 January 2020), activity declined across diseases and specialties between the first case and lockdown (total ED attendances RR 0.94, 0.93-0.95; total hospital admissions RR 0.96, 0.95-0.97) and after lockdown (attendances RR 0.63, 0.62-0.64; admissions RR 0.59, 0.57-0.60). There was limited recovery towards usual levels of some activities from mid-April 2020. Interpretation: Substantial reductions in total and cardiovascular activities are likely to contribute to a major burden of indirect effects of the pandemic, suggesting they should be monitored and mitigated urgently.","rel_num_authors":34,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"- TC CVD-COVID-UK Consortium","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Simon Ball","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK Midlands, University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Amitava Banerjee","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Colin Berry","author_inst":"Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, University of Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Boyle","author_inst":"Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Bray","author_inst":"IQVIA"},{"author_name":"William Bradlow","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Afzal Chaudhry","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Rikki Crawley","author_inst":"Barnsley Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"John Danesh","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Alastair Denniston","author_inst":"University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Florian Falter","author_inst":"Royal Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Jonine Figueroa","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Christopher Hall","author_inst":"Health Informatics Centre, University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Harry Hemingway","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK London, Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"},{"author_name":"Emily Jefferson","author_inst":"Population Health and Genomics, University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"Tom Johnson","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Graham King","author_inst":"Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Ken Lee","author_inst":"Centre for Cardiovascular cience, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Paul McKean","author_inst":"Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Suzanne Mason","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK North"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Mills","author_inst":"Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ewen Pearson","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK Scotland"},{"author_name":"Munir Pirmohamed","author_inst":"Institute of Systems, Molecular and Integrative Biology and MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Michael TC Poon","author_inst":"Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Rouven Priedon","author_inst":"BHF Data Science Centre, Health Data Research UK"},{"author_name":"Anoop Shah","author_inst":"Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Reecha Sofat","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK London, Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Sterne","author_inst":"Health Data Research UK South West, Population Health Sciences, University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Fiona Strachan","author_inst":"Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Cathie LM Sudlow","author_inst":"BHF Data Science Centre, Health Data Research UK"},{"author_name":"Zsolt Szarka","author_inst":"Health Informatics Centre, University of Dundee"},{"author_name":"William Whiteley","author_inst":"Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Mike Wyatt","author_inst":"University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.11.20151332","rel_title":"Diagnosis of COVID-19 using CT scan images and deep learning techniques","rel_date":"2020-07-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.11.20151332","rel_abs":"Early diagnosis of the coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) is essential for controlling this pandemic. COVID-19 has been spreading rapidly all over the world. There is no vaccine available for this virus yet. Fast and accurate COVID-19 screening is possible using computed tomography (CT) scan images. The deep learning techniques used in the proposed method was based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). Our manuscript focuses on differentiating the CT scan images of COVID-19 and non-COVID 19 CT using different deep learning techniques. A self developed model named CTnet-10 was designed for the COVID-19 diagnosis, having an accuracy of 82.1 %. Also, other models that we tested are DenseNet-169, VGG-16, ResNet-50, InceptionV3, and VGG-19. The VGG-19 proved to be superior with an accuracy of 94.52 % as compared to all other deep learning models. Automated diagnosis of COVID-19 from the CT scan pictures can be used by the doctors as a quick and efficient method for COVID-19 screening.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vruddhi Shah","author_inst":"K.

We performed genome-wide association scans of two age-adjusted biological age measures (PhenoAgeAcceleration and BioAgeAcceleration), estimated from clinical biochemistry markers1,2 in European-descent participants from UK Biobank. The strongest signals were found in the APOE gene, tagged by the two major protein-coding SNPs, PhenoAgeAccel-rs429358 (APOE e4 determinant) (p=1.50 x 10-72); BioAgeAccel-rs7412 (APOE e2 determinant) (p=3.16 x 10-60). Interestingly, we observed inverse APOE e2 and e4 associations and unique pathway enrichments when comparing the two biological age measures. Genes associated with BioAgeAccel were enriched in lipid related pathways, while genes associated with PhenoAgeAccel showed enrichment for immune system, cell function, and carbohydrate homeostasis pathways, suggesting the two measures capture different aging domains.
