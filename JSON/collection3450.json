However, data on clinical characteristics and prognostic factors in such settings are scarce. We conducted a retrospective, observational cohort study to assess clinical characteristics and baseline predictors of mortality of COVID-19 patients hospitalized after an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a LTCF. A total of 50 patients were included. Mean age was 80 years (SD, 12 years), and 24\/50 (57.1%) patients were males. A total of 42\/50 (84%) patients experienced symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 32%. In Cox regression, significant predictors of in-hospital mortality were: hypernatremia (HR 9.12), lymphocyte count <1000 cells\/L (HR 7.45), cardiovascular diseases other than hypertension (HR 6.41), and higher levels of serum interleukin-6 (IL-6, pg\/mL) (HR 1.005). Our study shows a high in-hospital mortality rate in a cohort of elderly patients with COVID-19 and hypernatremia, lymphopenia, CVD other than hypertension, and higher IL-6 serum levels were identified as independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. Further studies are necessary to better understand and confirm our findings in the setting of a LTCF outbreak of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"ENRICO MARIA TRECARICHI","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"MARIA MAZZITELLI","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"FRANCESCA SERAPIDE","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"MARIA CHIARA PELLE","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"BRUNO TASSONE","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"EUGENIO ARRIGHI","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"GRAZIELLA PERRI","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"PAOLO FUSCO","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"VINCENZO SCAGLIONE","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"CHIARA DAVOLI","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"ROSARIA LIONELLO","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"VALENTINA LA GAMBA","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"GIUSEPPINA MARRAZZO","author_inst":"MATER DOMINI TEACHING HOSPITAL"},{"author_name":"MARIA TERESA BUSCETI","author_inst":"MATER DOMINI TEACHING HOSPITAL"},{"author_name":"AMERIGO GIUDICE","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"MARCO RICCHIO","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"ANNA CANCELLIERE","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"ELENA LIO","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"GIADA PROCOPIO","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"FRANCESCO SAVERIO COSTANZO","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"DANIELA FOTI","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"GIOVANNI MATERA","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"CARLO TORTI","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.30.20143818","rel_title":"COVID-MATCH65 - A prospectively derived clinical decision rule for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2","rel_date":"2020-07-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.30.20143818","rel_abs":"Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and increased pressure on testing resources, understanding the clinical and epidemiological features closely associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is vital at point of care to enable risk stratification.

The picture is still not clear because of many limitations including testing tools, time of sampling, and the unclear impact of varying clinical status. In addition to these problems, antibody levels may not be equivalent to protective capacity. Objective: To define the key factor for the different patterns of COVID-19 antibody response. Design: We elucidated the antibody response with time-series throat and serum samples for viral loads and antibody levels, then used a neutralization test to evaluate protectiveness. Setting: A medical center that typically cares for patients with moderate to severe diseases. Because of the low prevalence of COVID-19 in Taiwan and local government policy, however, we also admit COVID-19 patients with mild disease or even those without symptoms for inpatient care. Participants: RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients. Results: We found that only patients with relative persistence of virus at pharynx displayed strong antibody responses that were proportional to the pharyngeal viral load. They also had proportional neutralization titers per unit of serum. Although antibody levels decreased around 2 weeks after symptom onset, the neutralization efficacy per unit antibody remained steady and even continued to increase over time. The antibody response in patients with rapid virus clearance was weak, but the neutralization efficacy per unit antibody in these patients was comparable to those with persistent presence of virus. The deceased were with higher viral load, higher level of antibody, and higher neutralization titers in the serum, but the neutralization capacity per unit antibody is relatively low. Conclusions and Relevance: Strong antibody response depends on the relative persistence of the virus, instead of the absolute virus amount. The antibody response is still weak if large amount of virus is cleared quickly. The neutralization efficacy per unit antibody is comparable between high and low antibody patterns. Strong antibody response contains more inefficient and maybe even harmful antibodies. Low antibody response is also equipped with a capable B cell pool of efficient antibodies, which may expand with next virus encounter and confer protection.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chung-Guei Huang","author_inst":"1.Dept. of Laboratory Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan. 2.Dept. of Med.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that a machine learning approach incorporating hidden nonlinear interactions can improve prediction for Intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Methods: Consecutive patients admitted to public hospitals between 1st January and 24th May 2020 in Hong Kong with COVID-19 diagnosed by RT-PCR were included. The primary endpoint was ICU admission. Results: This study included 1043 patients (median age 35 (IQR: 32-37; 54% male). Nineteen patients were admitted to ICU (median hospital length of stay (LOS): 30 days, median ICU LOS: 16 days). ICU patients were more likely to be prescribed angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors\/angiotensin receptor blockers, anti-retroviral drugs lopinavir\/ritonavir and remdesivir, ribavirin, steroids, interferon-beta and hydroxychloroquine. Significant predictors of ICU admission were older age, male sex, prior coronary artery disease, respiratory diseases, diabetes, hypertension and chronic kidney disease, and activated partial thromboplastin time, red cell count, white cell count, albumin and serum sodium. A tree-based machine learning model identified most informative characteristics and hidden interactions that can predict ICU admission. These were: low red cells with 1) male, 2) older age, 3) low albumin, 4) low sodium or 5) prolonged APTT. A five-fold cross validation confirms superior performance of this model over baseline models including XGBoost, LightGBM, random forests, and multivariate logistic regression. Conclusions: A machine learning model including baseline risk factors and their hidden interactions can accurately predict ICU admission in COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jiandong Zhou","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Gary Tse","author_inst":"Tianjin Medical University"},{"author_name":"Sharen Lee","author_inst":"Laboratory of Cardiovascular Physiology"},{"author_name":"Tong Liu","author_inst":"Tianjin Medical University"},{"author_name":"William KK Wu","author_inst":"LKS Institute of Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"zhidong cao","author_inst":"Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Dajun Zeng","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ian CK Wong","author_inst":"HKU"},{"author_name":"Qingpeng Zhang","author_inst":"City University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Bernard MY Cheung","author_inst":"HKU"},{"author_name":"nasreen Moini","author_inst":"Austin Health"},{"author_name":"Sam R Stanley","author_inst":"Austin Health"},{"author_name":"Michael T Birrell","author_inst":"Austin Health"},{"author_name":"Morgan T Rose","author_inst":"Austin Health"},{"author_name":"Claire L Gordon","author_inst":"Austin Health"},{"author_name":"Jason C Kwong","author_inst":"Austin Health"},{"author_name":"Natasha E Holmes","author_inst":"Austin Health"},{"author_name":"ELENA LIO","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"GIADA PROCOPIO","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"FRANCESCO SAVERIO COSTANZO","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"DANIELA FOTI","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"GIOVANNI MATERA","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"CARLO TORTI","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.01.20144030","rel_title":"Broad phenotypic alterations and potential dysfunctions of lymphocytes in COVID-19 recovered individuals","rel_date":"2020-07-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.01.20144030","rel_abs":"Background Lymphopenia is a typical symptom in the COVID-19 patients. While millions of patients are clinical recovered, little is known about the immune status of lymphocytes in these individuals. Methods A clinical recovered cohort (CR) of 55 COVID-19 individuals (discharged from hospital 4 to 11 weeks), and 55 age and sex matched healthy donors cohort (HD) were recruited. Detailed analysis on phenotype of the lymphocytes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was performed by flow cytometry. Findings Compared with cohort HD, the CD8+ T cells in cohort CR had higher Teff and Tem, but lower Tc1 (IFN-{gamma}+), Tc2 (IL-4+) and Tc17 (IL-17A+) frequencies. The CD4+ T cells of CR had decreased frequency, especially on the Tcm subset. Moreover, CD4+ T cells of CR expressed lower PD-1 and had lower frequencies of Th1 (IFN-{gamma}+), Th2 (IL-4+), Th17 (IL-17A+) as well as circulating Tfh (CXCR5+PD-1+). Accordingly, isotype-switched memory B cell (IgM-CD20hi) in CR had significantly lower proportion in B cells, though level of activation marker CD71 elevated. For CD3-HLA-DRlo lymphocytes of CR, besides levels of IFN-{gamma}, Granzyme B and T-bet were lower, the correlation between T-bet and IFN-{gamma} became irrelevant. In addition, taken into account of discharged days, all the lowered function associated phenotypes showed no recovery tendency within whole observation period. Interpretation The CR COVID-19 individuals still showed remarkable phenotypic alterations in lymphocytes after clinical recovery 4 to 11 weeks. This suggests SARS-CoV-2 infection imprints profoundly on lymphocytes and results in long-lasting potential dysfunctions.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jingyi Yang","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)"},{"author_name":"Maohua Zhong","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS),"},{"author_name":"Ejuan Zhang","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)"},{"author_name":"Ke Hong","author_inst":"Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qingyu Yang","author_inst":"Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dihan Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)"},{"author_name":"Jianbo Xia","author_inst":"Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Hubei Province"},{"author_name":"Yao-Qing Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health (Shenzhen), Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Mingbo Sun","author_inst":"Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Bali Zhao","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)"},{"author_name":"Jie Xiang","author_inst":"Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ying Liu","author_inst":"Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yang Han","author_inst":"Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xi Zhou","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)"},{"author_name":"Chaolin Huang","author_inst":"Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital"},{"author_name":"You Shang","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Huimin Yan","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)"},{"author_name":"ELENA LIO","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"GIADA PROCOPIO","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"FRANCESCO SAVERIO COSTANZO","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"DANIELA FOTI","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"GIOVANNI MATERA","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"},{"author_name":"CARLO TORTI","author_inst":"MAGNA GRAECIA UNIVERSITY, CATANZARO, ITALY"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.01.20143958","rel_title":"A genome epidemiological study of SARS-CoV-2 introduction into Japan","rel_date":"2020-07-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.01.20143958","rel_abs":"Background: After the first case of COVID-19 in Japan on 15 January 2020, multiple nationwide COVID-19 clusters were identified by the end of February. The Japanese government focused on mitigating emerging COVID-19 clusters by conducting active nationwide epidemiological surveillance. However, an increasing number of cases appeared until early April, many with unclear infection routes exhibiting no recent history of travel outside Japan. We aimed to evaluate the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genome sequences from COVID-19 cases until early April and characterise the genealogical networks to demonstrate possible routes of spread in Japan. Methods: Nasopharyngeal specimens were collected from patients and a quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed. Positive RNA samples were subjected whole genome sequencing and a haplotype network analysis was performed. Findings: Some of the primary clusters identified during January and February in Japan directly descended from Wuhan-Hu-1-related isolates in China and other distinct clusters. Clusters were almost contained until mid-March; the haplotype network analysis demonstrated that COVID-19 cases from late March through early April may have caused an additional large cluster related to the outbreak in Europe, leading to additional spread within Japan. National self-restraint during February was effective in mitigating the COVID-19 spread, but late action on stopping immigration and declaring national emergency in Japan might be involved in the later increase in cases. Interpretation: Genome surveillance suggested that at least two distinct SARS-CoV-2 introductions from China and other countries occurred.

This study analyses the outbreak and the social-distancing effectiveness timeline in the general population and the care homes. Methods: A novel distributed-compartmental, time-variant epidemiological model was designed specifically for COVID-19 transmission characteristics, featuring a\/pre\/symptomatic transmission, a non-linear hospital model, a weakly-coupled sub-model for the care-home population, and parametrized continuous social-distancing functions. The model parameters and the social-distancing timelines are determined by randomization and Monte-Carlo simulations analysing real-world data. Findings: Despite a high initial reproduction number (3.29) and the near-absence of governmental interventions, the model quantitated that the transmission rate in the general population was suppressed by 73%, and in the care homes by 79%. The measures in the care homes took effect 4.8 days delayed; and if applied 4 or 8 days earlier, the fatalities could have been reduced by 63.2% or 89.9%. The infected population is estimated to 16.2% (June 10). An expected underestimation of population immunity by antibody studies is confirmed. The infection fatality ratio extrapolates to 0.61% (peak: 1.34%). The model indicates a seasonal effect which effectively suppressed a new rise. An analysed large-scale public event had no large influence. The asymptomatic ratio was determined to 35%. Interpretation: The proposed model and methods have proven to analyse a COVID-19 outbreak and to re-construct the social-distancing behaviour with unprecedented accuracy, confirming even minor details indicated by mobility-data analysis, and are applicable to other regions and other emerging infectious diseases of similar transmission characteristics. The self-regulation of the population in Stockholm, influenced by advices by the authorities, was able to suppress a COVID-19 outbreak to a level far beyond that the stringency index of governmental interventions suggests. Proper timing of effective measures in the care homes is important to reduce fatalities.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joachim Oberhammer","author_inst":"KTH Royal Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Kentaro Itokawa","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Masanori Hashino","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Tetsuro Kawano-Sugaya","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Rina Tanaka","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Koji Yatsu","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Asami Ohnishi","author_inst":"Sapporo City Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Keiko Goto","author_inst":"Ibaraki Prefectural Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Hiroyuki Tsukagoshi","author_inst":"Gunma Prefectural Institute of Public Health and Environmental Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hayato Ehara","author_inst":"Saitama Prefectural Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Kenji Sadamasu","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Masakatsu Taira","author_inst":"Division of Virology and Medical Zoology, Chiba Prefectural Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Shinichiro Shibata","author_inst":"Microbiology Department, Nagoya City Public Health Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Ryohei Nomoto","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Kobe Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Satoshi Hiroi","author_inst":"Division of Microbiology, Osaka Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Miho Toho","author_inst":"Fukui Prefectural Institute of Public Health and Environmental Science"},{"author_name":"Tomoe Shimada","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Tamano Matsui","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Tomimasa Sunagawa","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Hajime Kamiya","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Yuichiro Yahata","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Takuya Yamagishi","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Motoi Suzuki","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Takaji Wakita","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Makoto Kuroda","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"- COVID-19 Genomic Surveillance Network in Japan","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.01.20144279","rel_title":"Using the infection fatality rate to predict the evolution of Covid-19 in Brazil","rel_date":"2020-07-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.01.20144279","rel_abs":"In this work we are going to use estimates of Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) for Covid-19 in order to predict the evolution of Covid-19 in Brazil.

A national sero-epidemiological survey suggests higher cumulative incidence of infection in older individuals than in younger individuals. However, little is known about the epidemic dynamics in different age groups, including the relative effect of the lockdown measures introduced on March 15, and strengthened on March 30 to April 14, 2020 when only essential workers continued to work. Methods: We used data from the National Epidemiological Surveillance Network (RENAVE in Spanish) on the daily number of reported COVID-19 cases (by date of symptom onset) in eleven 5-year age groups: 15-19y through 65-69y. For each age group g, we computed the proportion E(g) of individuals in age group g among all reported cases aged 15-69y during the pre-lockdown period (March 1-10, 2020) and the corresponding proportion L(g) during two lockdown periods (March 25-April 3 and April 8-17, 2020). For each lockdown period, we computed the proportion ratios PR(g)= L(g)\/E(g). For each pair of age groups g1,g2, PR(g1)>PR(g2) implies a relative increase in the incidence of detected SARS-CoV-2 infection in the age group g1 compared with g2 for the later vs. early period. Results: For the first lockdown period, the highest PR values were in age groups 50-54y (PR=1.21; 95% CI: 1.12,1.30) and 55-59y (PR=1.19; 1.11,1.27). For the second lockdown period, the highest PR values were in age groups 15-19y (PR=1.26; 0.95,1.68) and 50-54y (PR=1.20; 1.09,1.31). Conclusions: Our results suggest that different outbreak control measures led to different changes in the relative incidence by age group. During the first lockdown period, when non-essential work was allowed, individuals aged 40-64y, particularly those aged 50-59y presented with higher COVID-19 relative incidence compared to pre-lockdown period, while younger adults\/older adolescents (together with persons aged 50-59y) had increased relative incidence during the later, strengthened lockdown. The role of different age groups during the epidemic should be considered when implementing future mitigation efforts.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pablo Martinez de Salazar","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

Health professionals, as well as hospital workers, are the most vulnerable population for acquiring SARS-CoV-2 due to their greater proximity to sick patients, especially in specialized hospitals for the treatment of these patients. Study Design: We ran a questionnaire by all the employees of a Public Service Hospital specialised in COVID-19 treatment (1307 employees), in the municipality of Santos, Sao Paulo, Brazil, who presented some symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and positive results by RT-PCR, in Oropharynx Swab collection. The questionnaire collected socio-demographic information, as well as data related to the work areas where they were divided into two groups: Employees at higher risk or those who directly deal with patients (914 employees or 69.9%) and lower risk for employees in the administrative area (393 employees or 30.1%). Results: 211 (16.1%) of the Hospital's employees had to stop their work-related activities due to presenting positive RT-PCR. There were 39 (9.9%) positives in low risk areas and 172 (18.8%) positives in employees in high risk areas. Within the latter group, Nurses, Nursing Assistants and Doctors were the most frequently infected professionals. Regarding the symptoms of professionals positively diagnosed based on RT-PCR, the most frequent symptoms were body pain (83.4%); headache (80.6%); fever (57.8%) and dry cough (53.1%). Conclusion: A high proportion of workers in COVID-19 specialized hospitals was infected by the virus, despite all the protective measures adopted, showing the high transmission capacity of this virus. Stricter individual protection measures among employees must be adopted.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"MARCOS MONTANI CASEIRO","author_inst":"UNISANTA"},{"author_name":"Monica Mazzurana","author_inst":"Guilherme Alvaro Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bruno Barreiro","author_inst":"Guilherme Alvaro Hospital"},{"author_name":"Estela Capelas Barbosa","author_inst":"Bristol Medical School"},{"author_name":"Antonio Pires Barbosa","author_inst":"State Health Secretariat"},{"author_name":"Carlos Fernandez-Escobar","author_inst":"Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Marc Lipsitch","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

This report explores low-impact interventions to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 with a minimum of social and economic disruption. Methods An agent-based model simulated the population of King County, Washington, with agents that interact in homes, schools, workplaces, and other community sites. SARS-CoV-2 transmission probabilities were estimated by fitting simulated to observed hospital admissions from February-May 2020. Interventions considered were (a) encouraging telecommuting; (b) reducing contacts to seniors and nursing home residents; (c) modest reductions to contacts outside of the home; (d) encouraging self-isolation of persons with COVID-19 symptoms; (e) rapid testing and household quarantining. Results Individual interventions are not expected to have a large impact on COVID-19 hospitalizations. No intervention reduced COVID-19 hospitalizations by more than 12.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 12.0% to 13.3%). Removing all interventions would result in nearly 42,000 COVID-19 hospitalizations between June 2020 and January 2021, with peak hospital occupancy exceeding available beds 6-fold. Combining the interventions is predicted to reduce total hospitalizations by 48% (95% CI, 47-49%), with peak COVID-19 hospital occupancy of 70% of total beds. Targeted school closures can further reduce the peak occupancy. Conclusions Combining low-impact interventions may mitigate the course of the COVID-19 epidemic, keeping hospital burden within the capacity of the healthcare system. Under this approach SARS-CoV-2 can spread through the community, moving toward herd immunity, while minimizing social and economic disruption.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael L Jackson","author_inst":"Kaiser Permanente Washington"},{"author_name":"Monica Mazzurana","author_inst":"Guilherme Alvaro Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bruno Barreiro","author_inst":"Guilherme Alvaro Hospital"},{"author_name":"Estela Capelas Barbosa","author_inst":"Bristol Medical School"},{"author_name":"Antonio Pires Barbosa","author_inst":"State Health Secretariat"},{"author_name":"Carlos Fernandez-Escobar","author_inst":"Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Marc Lipsitch","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

As the disease will likely remain a threat for years to come, an understanding of the precise influences of human demographics and settlement, as well as the dynamic factors of climate, susceptible depletion, and intervention, on the spread of localized epidemics will be vital for mounting an effective response. We consider the entire set of local epidemics in the United States; a broad selection of demographic, population density, and climate factors; and local mobility data, tracking social distancing interventions, to determine the key factors driving the spread and containment of the virus. Assuming first a linear model for the rate of exponential growth (or decay) in cases\/mortality, we find that population-weighted density, humidity, and median age dominate the dynamics of growth and decline, once interventions are accounted for. A focus on distinct metropolitan areas suggests that some locales benefited from the timing of a nearly simultaneous nationwide shutdown, and\/or the regional climate conditions in mid-March; while others suffered significant outbreaks prior to intervention. Using a first-principles model of the infection spread, we then develop predictions for the impact of the relaxation of social distancing and local climate conditions. A few regions, where a significant fraction of the population was infected, show evidence that the epidemic has partially resolved via depletion of the susceptible population (i.e., \"herd immunity\"), while most regions in the United States remain overwhelmingly susceptible. These results will be important for optimal management of intervention strategies, which can be facilitated using our online dashboard.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Niayesh Afshordi","author_inst":"University of Waterloo"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Holder","author_inst":"Grand Valley State University"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Bahrami","author_inst":"Wolfram Research Inc"},{"author_name":"Daniel Lichtblau","author_inst":"Wolfram Research Inc"},{"author_name":"Antonio Pires Barbosa","author_inst":"State Health Secretariat"},{"author_name":"Carlos Fernandez-Escobar","author_inst":"Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Marc Lipsitch","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

Recent studies indicate that measures such as lockdowns may have slowed down the growth of COVID-19. However, in addition to substantial economic and social costs, these measures also limit the exposure to Ultraviolet-B radiation (UVB). Emerging observational evidence indicate the protective role of UVB and vitamin D in reducing the severity and mortality of COVID-19 deaths. In this observational study, we empirically outline the independent protective roles of lockdown and UVB exposure as measured by ultraviolet index (UVI), whilst also examining whether the severity of lockdown is associated with a reduction in the protective role. Methods. We apply a log-linear fixed-effects model to a panel dataset of 162 countries over a period of 108 days (n=6049). We use the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths as the dependent variable and isolate the mitigating influence of lockdown severity on the association between UVI and growth-rates of COVID-19 deaths from time-constant country-specific and time-varying country-specific potentially confounding factors. Findings: After controlling for time-constant and time-varying factors, we find that a unit increase in UVI and lockdown severity are independently associated with 17% [-1.8 percentage points] and 77% [-7.9 percentage points] decline in COVID-19 deaths growth rate, indicating their respective protective roles. However, the widely utilized and least severe lockdown (recommendation to not leave the house) already fully mitigates the protective role of UVI by 95% [1.8 percentage points] indicating its downside. Interpretation: We find that lockdown severity and UVI are independently associated with a slowdown in the daily growth rates of cumulative COVID-19 deaths. However, we find consistent evidence that increase in lockdown severity is associated with a significant reduction in the protective role of UVI in reducing COVID-19 deaths. Our results suggest that lockdowns in conjunction with adequate exposure to UVB radiation might have provided even more substantial health benefits, than lockdowns alone. For example, we estimate that there would be 21% fewer deaths on average with sufficient UVB exposure while people were recommended not to leave their house. Therefore, our study outlines the importance of considering UVB exposure, especially while implementing lockdowns and may support policy decision making in countries imposing such measures.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rahul Kalippurayil Moozhipurath","author_inst":"Goethe University Frankfurt am Main"},{"author_name":"Lennart Kraft","author_inst":"Goethe University Frankfurt am Main"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Bahrami","author_inst":"Wolfram Research Inc"},{"author_name":"Daniel Lichtblau","author_inst":"Wolfram Research Inc"},{"author_name":"Antonio Pires Barbosa","author_inst":"State Health Secretariat"},{"author_name":"Carlos Fernandez-Escobar","author_inst":"Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Marc Lipsitch","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

Parameter estimates from a parsimonious two-group heterogeneous SIR model strongly support the hypothesis that younger persons, having first acquired their infections through increasing social contact with their peers, then transmitted their infections to older, less socially mobile individuals.

Even so, underdiagnosis in the country is massive. Nowcasting techniques have helped to overcome the underdiagnosis. Recent advances in machine learning techniques offer opportunities to refine the nowcasting. This study aimed to analyze the underdiagnosis of COVID-19, through nowcasting with machine learning, in a South of Brazil capital. Methods: The study has an observational ecological design. It used data from 3916 notified cases of COVID-19, from April 14th to June 02nd, 2020, in Florianopolis, Santa Catarina, Brazil. We used machine-learning algorithm to classify cases which had no diagnosis yet, producing the nowcast. To analyze the underdiagnosis, we compared the difference between the data without nowcasting and the median of the nowcasted projections for the entire period and for the six days from the date of onset of symptoms to diagnosis at the moment of data extraction. Results: The number of new cases throughout the entire period, without nowcasting, was 389. With nowcasting, it was 694 (UI95 496-897,025). At the six days period, the number without nowcasting was 19 and 104 (95% UI 60-142) with. The underdiagnosis was 37.29% in the entire period and 81.73% at the six days period. Conclusions: The underdiagnosis was more critical in six days from the date of onset of symptoms to diagnosis before the data collection than in the entire period. The use of nowcasting with machine learning techniques can help to estimate the number of new cases of the disease.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Leandro Pereira Garcia","author_inst":"Public Health Department of Florianopolis"},{"author_name":"Andre Vinicius Goncalves","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina and Instituto Federal do Norte de Minas Gerais"},{"author_name":"Matheus Pacheco de Andrade","author_inst":"Public Health Department of Florianopolis"},{"author_name":"Lucas Alexandre Pedebos","author_inst":"Public Health Department of Florianopolis"},{"author_name":"Ana Cristina Vidor","author_inst":"Public Health Department of Florianopolis"},{"author_name":"Roberto Zaina","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Graziela de Luca Canto","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Gustavo Medeiros de Araujo","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Fernanda Vargas Amaral","author_inst":"Universidad de Malaga"},{"author_name":"Neel Gandhi","author_inst":"Emory University Department of Medicine; Emory University Rollins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Shamimul Khan","author_inst":"Fulton County Board of Health"},{"author_name":"Steve Williams","author_inst":"Fulton County Government"},{"author_name":"Fazle Khan","author_inst":"Fulton County Board of Health"},{"author_name":"Sarita Shah","author_inst":"Emory University Department of Medicine; Emory University Rollins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Satoshi Hiroi","author_inst":"Division of Microbiology, Osaka Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Miho Toho","author_inst":"Fukui Prefectural Institute of Public Health and Environmental Science"},{"author_name":"Tomoe Shimada","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Tamano Matsui","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Tomimasa Sunagawa","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Hajime Kamiya","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Yuichiro Yahata","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Takuya Yamagishi","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Motoi Suzuki","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Takaji Wakita","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Makoto Kuroda","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"- COVID-19 Genomic Surveillance Network in Japan","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.01.20144188","rel_title":"Differential COVID-19 case positivity in New York City neighborhoods: socioeconomic factors and mobility","rel_date":"2020-07-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.01.20144188","rel_abs":"New York City has been one of the hotspots of the COVID-19 pandemic and during the first two months of the outbreak considerable variability in case positivity was observed across the city's ZIP codes.

Our analysis indicates that the markers considered together explained 56% of the variability in case positivity through April 1 and their explanatory power decreased to 18% by April 30. Our analysis also indicates that changes in mobility during this time period are not likely to be acting as a mediator of the relationship between ZIP-level SES and case positivity. During the middle of April, increases in mobility were independently associated with decreased case positivity. Together, these findings present evidence that heterogeneity in COVID-19 case positivity in New York City is largely driven by neighborhood socioeconomic status.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matthew Raymond Lamb","author_inst":"Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Sasikiran Kandula","author_inst":"Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Shaman","author_inst":"Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Lucas Alexandre Pedebos","author_inst":"Public Health Department of Florianopolis"},{"author_name":"Ana Cristina Vidor","author_inst":"Public Health Department of Florianopolis"},{"author_name":"Roberto Zaina","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Graziela de Luca Canto","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Gustavo Medeiros de Araujo","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Fernanda Vargas Amaral","author_inst":"Universidad de Malaga"},{"author_name":"Neel Gandhi","author_inst":"Emory University Department of Medicine; Emory University Rollins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Shamimul Khan","author_inst":"Fulton County Board of Health"},{"author_name":"Steve Williams","author_inst":"Fulton County Government"},{"author_name":"Fazle Khan","author_inst":"Fulton County Board of Health"},{"author_name":"Sarita Shah","author_inst":"Emory University Department of Medicine; Emory University Rollins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Satoshi Hiroi","author_inst":"Division of Microbiology, Osaka Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Miho Toho","author_inst":"Fukui Prefectural Institute of Public Health and Environmental Science"},{"author_name":"Tomoe Shimada","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Tamano Matsui","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Tomimasa Sunagawa","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Hajime Kamiya","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Yuichiro Yahata","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Takuya Yamagishi","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Motoi Suzuki","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Takaji Wakita","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Makoto Kuroda","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"- COVID-19 Genomic Surveillance Network in Japan","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.01.20144394","rel_title":"Temporary Immunity and Multiple Waves of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-07-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.01.20144394","rel_abs":"In this work we use mathematical modeling to describe the potential phenomena which may occur if immunity to COVID-19 lasts for a finite time instead of being permanent, i.e. if a recovered COVID-19 patient may again become susceptible to the virus after a given time interval following his\/her recovery. Whether this really happens or not is unknown at the current time. If it does happen, then we find that for certain combinations of parameter values (social mobility, contact tracing, immunity threshold duration etc), the disease can keep recurring in wave after wave of outbreaks, with a periodicity approximately equal to twice the immunity threshold. Such cyclical attacks can be prevented trivially if public health interventions are strong enough to contain the disease outright. Of greater interest is the finding that should such effective interventions not prove possible, then also the second and subsequent waves can be forestalled by a consciously relaxed intervention level which finishes off the first wave before the immunity threshold is breached. Such an approach leads to higher case counts in the immediate term but significantly lower counts in the long term as well as a drastically shortened overall course of the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"B Shayak","author_inst":"Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Mohit Manoj Sharma","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medicine"},{"author_name":"Anoop Misra","author_inst":"Fortis Hospital, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Lucas Alexandre Pedebos","author_inst":"Public Health Department of Florianopolis"},{"author_name":"Ana Cristina Vidor","author_inst":"Public Health Department of Florianopolis"},{"author_name":"Roberto Zaina","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Graziela de Luca Canto","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Gustavo Medeiros de Araujo","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina"},{"author_name":"Fernanda Vargas Amaral","author_inst":"Universidad de Malaga"},{"author_name":"Neel Gandhi","author_inst":"Emory University Department of Medicine; Emory University Rollins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Shamimul Khan","author_inst":"Fulton County Board of Health"},{"author_name":"Steve Williams","author_inst":"Fulton County Government"},{"author_name":"Fazle Khan","author_inst":"Fulton County Board of Health"},{"author_name":"Sarita Shah","author_inst":"Emory University Department of Medicine; Emory University Rollins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Satoshi Hiroi","author_inst":"Division of Microbiology, Osaka Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Miho Toho","author_inst":"Fukui Prefectural Institute of Public Health and Environmental Science"},{"author_name":"Tomoe Shimada","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Tamano Matsui","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Tomimasa Sunagawa","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Hajime Kamiya","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Yuichiro Yahata","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Takuya Yamagishi","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Motoi Suzuki","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Takaji Wakita","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Makoto Kuroda","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"- COVID-19 Genomic Surveillance Network in Japan","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.30.20143859","rel_title":"Role of pharmacist during the COVID-19 pandemic: a scoping review","rel_date":"2020-07-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.30.20143859","rel_abs":"Abstract Background Since the start of the new Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in December 2019, pharmacists worldwide are playing a key role adopting innovative strategies to minimize the adverse impact of the pandemic. Objectives To identify and describe core services provided by the pharmacist during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A literature search was performed in MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and LILACS for studies published between December 1st, 2019 and May 20th, 2020 without language restriction. Studies that reported services provided by pharmacists during the COVID-19 pandemic were included. Two independent authors performed study selection and data extraction with a consensus process. The pharmacist's intervention identified in the included studies were described based on key domains in the DEPICT v.2. Results A total of 1,189 records were identified, of which 11 studies fully met the eligibility criteria. Most of them were conducted in the United States of America (n=4) and China (n=4). The most common type of publication were letters (n=4) describing the workplace of the pharmacist in hospitals (n=8). These findings showed the different roles of pharmacists during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as disease prevention and infection control, adequate storage and drug supply, patient care and support for healthcare professionals. Pharmacists' interventions were mostly conducted for healthcare professionals and patients (n=7), through one-to-one contact (n=11), telephone (n=6) or video conference (n=5). The pharmacists' main responsibility was to provide drug information for healthcare professionals (n=7) as well as patient counseling (n=8). Conclusions A reasonable number of studies that described the role of the pharmacists during the COVID-19 pandemic were found. All studies reported actions taken by pharmacists, although without providing a satisfactory description. Thus, future research with more detailed description as well as an evaluation of the impact of pharmacist intervention is needed in order to guide future actions in this and-or other pandemic.

As one of the European countries experiencing one of the worst COVID-19 epidemics, the UK government at the end of March 2020 implemented the biggest lockdown of society during peacetime in British history, aiming to contain the rapid spread of the virus. While the lockdown has been maintained for seven weeks in UK, the effectiveness of the control measures in suppressing the transmission of the disease remains incompletely understood. Here we applied a Bayesian SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infected-removed) epidemiological model to rebuild the local transmission dynamics of the spread of COVID-19 in nine regions of England. We found that the basic reproduction number (R0) in England is relatively high compared with China. Our estimation of the temporally varying effective reproduction number (Rt) suggests that the control measures, especially the forceful lockdown, were effective to reduce the transmissibility and curb the COVID-19 epidemic. Although the overall incidence rate in the UK has declined, our forecasting highlights the possibility of a second wave of the disease in several regions, which may be currently underway in one of the cities there (e.g. Leicester, East Midlands).

Knowledge of community vulnerability to the disease would facilitate interventions aimed at transmission control by the efficient deployment of available limited resources. Therefore, we assessed spatial variations and heterogeneity of disease vulnerability among the population in 753 municipal units of Nepal. We collected geospatial indicators representing the domain of socioeconomic inequalities, population dynamics, heterogeneity in the accessibility and the information related to an underlying health condition which potentially affect the severity of COVID-19 transmission. Those indicators were assembled to create three vulnerability indices using Geographic Information System (GIS); Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), Epidemiological Vulnerability Index (EVI) and a composite of the two- Social and Epidemiological Vulnerability Index (SEVI). The indicators were scaled to a common measurement scale and spatially overlaid via equally weighted arithmetic mean. The indices were classified into five level of risk and the municipal units and the population within vulnerabilities classes were quantified and visualized in the map. The index output indicated high vulnerability to epidemics in megacities like Kathmandu, Pokhara, Bharatpur, etc.; developing cities especially in the Province No 2; and, municipal units of Karnali and Sudoorpashchim provinces. Additionally, some other municipalities such as Dhulikhel, Beshishahar, Tansen etc. which have a higher prevalence of pulmonary and cardiovascular disorders are highly vulnerable. The SVI indicated that 174 municipal units and 41.5% population is highly vulnerable. The EVI identified 55 municipal units and 40.7% of the total population of the country highly vulnerable to COVID-19.

It can be a diagnostic challenge to identify COVID-19 patients without bacterial co-infection in whom antibiotics can be safely stopped. We sought to evaluate the validity of a guideline that recommends withholding antibiotics in patients with a low serum procalcitonin (PCT). Methods. We retrospectively collected 28-day outcome data on patients admitted to Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, UK, between 5 March and 15 April 2020, with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCT within 48 hours of diagnosis. PCT was considered negative if [&le;]0.25ng\/ml and positive if >0.25ng\/ml. Primary outcomes included antibiotic consumption, mortality, intensive care admission and length of hospital stay. Results. 368 patients met the inclusion criteria; 218 (59%) had a negative PCT and 150 (41%) positive. At 48 hours post-diagnosis, 73 (33%) of those with a negative PCT were receiving antimicrobials compared to 126 (84%) with a positive PCT (p<0.001), with a corresponding reduction in antimicrobial usage over 28 days (median DDD of 3.0 vs 6.8 (p<0.001); median DOT 2 vs 5 days (p<0.001) between the negative and positive PCT groups.) In the negative PCT group, there were fewer deaths (62 (28%) vs. 54 (36%), (p=0.021)) and critical care admissions (19 (9%) vs. 28 (19%), (p=0.007)) than in the positive PCT group. Median length of hospital stay was 8.7 and 9 days in the negative and positive PCT groups respectively. Conclusions. Procalcitonin is a valuable tool in the assessment of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, safely reducing the potential burden of unnecessary antibiotic usage.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emma Jane Williams","author_inst":"Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Luke Mair","author_inst":"Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Thushan I. de Silva","author_inst":"Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Dan J.

In this study, we investigated over 7,000 SARS-CoV-2 datasets to unveil both intrahost and interhost diversity. Our intrahost and interhost diversity analyses yielded three major observations. First, the mutational profile of SARS-CoV-2 highlights iSNV and SNP similarity, albeit with high variability in C>T changes. Second, iSNV and SNP patterns in SARS-CoV-2 are more similar to MERS-CoV than SARS-CoV-1. Third, a significant fraction of small indels fuel the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2. Altogether, our findings provide insight into SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity, inform the design of detection tests, and highlight the potential of iSNVs for tracking the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicolae Sapoval","author_inst":"Department of Computer Science, Rice University, Houston, TX 77005"},{"author_name":"Medhat Mahmoud","author_inst":"Baylor College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael D.

Our ability to study the SARS-COV-2 virus and its interactions with its human host in molecular terms efficiently and collaboratively becomes indispensable and mission-critical in the race to develop vaccines, drugs, and neutralizing antibodies. There is already a significant corpus of 3D structures related to SARS and MERS coronaviruses, and the rapid generation of new structures demands the use of efficient tools to expedite the sharing of structural analyses and molecular designs and convey them in their native 3D context in sync with sequence data and annotations. We developed iCn3D (pronounced \u201cI see in 3D\u201d) 1 to take full advantage of web technologies and allow scientists of different backgrounds to perform and share sequence-structure analyses over the Internet and engage in collaborations through a simple mechanism of exchanging \u201clifelong\u201d web links (URLs). This approach solves the very old problem of \u201csharing of molecular scenes\u201d in a reliable and convenient manner. iCn3D links are sharable over the Internet and make data and entire analyses findable, accessible, and reproducible, with various levels of interoperability. Links and underlying data are FAIR 2 and can be embedded in preprints and papers, bringing a 3D live and interactive dimension to a world of text and static images used in current publications, eliminating at the same time the need for arcane supplemental materials. This paper exemplifies iCn3D capabilities in visualization, analysis, and sharing of COVID-19 related structures, sequence variability, and molecular interactions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Philippe Youkharibache","author_inst":"National Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Raul Edouardo Cachau","author_inst":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research: Frederick, MD, US"},{"author_name":"Thomas Madej","author_inst":"National Institute of Health"},{"author_name":"Jiyao Wang","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Houda H.

However, there is limited published data associating the results from commercial assays with neutralizing antibodies.Methods 67 specimens from 48 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and a positive result by the Roche Elecsys SARS-CoV-2, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG, or EUROIMMUN SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays and 5 control specimens were analyzed for the presence of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Correlation, concordance, positive percent agreement (PPA), and negative percent agreement (NPA) were calculated at several cutoffs. Results were compared in patients categorized by clinical outcomes.Results The correlation between SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titer (EC50) and the Roche, Abbott, and EUROIMMUN assays was 0.29, 0.47, and 0.46 respectively. At an EC50 of 1:32, the concordance kappa with Roche was 0.49 (95% CI; 0.23-0.75), with Abbott was 0.52 (0.28-0.77), and with EUROIMMUN was 0.61 (0.4-0.82). At the same neutralizing titer, the PPA and NPA for the Roche was 100% (94-100) &amp; 56% (30-80); Abbott was 96% (88-99) &amp; 69% (44-86); and EUROIMMUN was 91% (80-96) &amp; 81% (57-93) for distinguishing neutralizing antibodies. Patients who died, were intubated, or had a cardiac injury from COVID-19 infection had significantly higher neutralizing titers relative to those with mild symptoms.Conclusion COVID-19 patients generate an antibody response to multiple viral proteins such that the calibrator ratios on the Roche, Abbott, and EUROIMMUN assays are all associated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Nevertheless, commercial serological assays have poor NPA for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, making them imperfect proxies for neutralization.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mei San Tang","author_inst":"Washington University- St. Louis, MO"},{"author_name":"James Brett Case","author_inst":"Washington University- St. Louis, MO"},{"author_name":"Caroline E Franks","author_inst":"Washington University- St. Louis, MO"},{"author_name":"Rita E Chen","author_inst":"Washington University- St. Louis, MO"},{"author_name":"Neil W Anderson","author_inst":"Washington University- St. Louis, MO"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey P Henderson","author_inst":"Washington University- St. Louis, MO"},{"author_name":"Michael S Diamond","author_inst":"Washington University- St. Louis, MO"},{"author_name":"Ann M Gronowski","author_inst":"Washington University- St. Louis, MO"},{"author_name":"Christopher W Farnsworth","author_inst":"Washington University - St. Louis, MO"},{"author_name":"Sonia Villapol","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Kyle Hernandez","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL"},{"author_name":"Irina Maljkovic Berry","author_inst":"Walter Reed Army Institute of Research"},{"author_name":"Jon Foox","author_inst":"Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York"},{"author_name":"Afshin Beheshti","author_inst":"KBR, Space Biosciences Division, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA"},{"author_name":"Krista Ternus","author_inst":"Signature Science, LLC, 8329 North Mopac Expressway, Austin TX 78759"},{"author_name":"Kjersti M.

We developed a novel vaccine platform based on a unique three-plasmid system to efficiently generate recombinant MVA vectors from chemically synthesized DNA. In response to the ongoing global pandemic caused by SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), we used this novel vaccine platform to rapidly produce fully synthetic MVA (sMVA) vectors co-expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid antigens, two immunodominant antigens implicated in protective immunity. Mice immunized with these sMVA vectors developed robust SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses, including potent neutralizing antibodies. These results demonstrate the potential of a novel vaccine platform based on synthetic DNA to efficiently generate recombinant MVA vectors and to rapidly develop a multi-antigenic poxvirus-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Flavia Chiuppesi","author_inst":"City of Hope"},{"author_name":"Marcela Salazar Werner","author_inst":"City of Hope"},{"author_name":"Heidi Contreras","author_inst":"City of Hope"},{"author_name":"Hong Vu Nguyen","author_inst":"City of Hope"},{"author_name":"Joy Martinez","author_inst":"City of Hope"},{"author_name":"Soojin Park","author_inst":"City of Hope"},{"author_name":"Jenny Nguyen","author_inst":"City of Hope"},{"author_name":"Mindy Kha","author_inst":"City of Hope"},{"author_name":"Angelina Iniguez","author_inst":"City of Hope"},{"author_name":"Qiao Zhou","author_inst":"City of Hope"},{"author_name":"Teodora Kaltcheva","author_inst":"City of Hope"},{"author_name":"Roman Levytskyy","author_inst":"City of Hope"},{"author_name":"Nancy D Ebelt","author_inst":"City of Hope"},{"author_name":"Tae Hyuk Kang","author_inst":"City of Hope"},{"author_name":"Xiwei Wu","author_inst":"City of Hope"},{"author_name":"Tom Rogers","author_inst":"University of California at San Diego and Scripps Research"},{"author_name":"Edwin R Manuel","author_inst":"City of Hope"},{"author_name":"Yuriy Shostak","author_inst":"City of Hope"},{"author_name":"Don J Diamond","author_inst":"City of Hope"},{"author_name":"Felix Wussow","author_inst":"City of Hope"},{"author_name":"Thorsten Brenner","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive CAre Medicine, Essen University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Markus A.
