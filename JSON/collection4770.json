Materials and Methods: A 39-question, web-based survey was sent to all urologist members of the Brazilian Society of Urology. We assessed socio-demographic, professional, health and behavior parameters. The primary goal was to evaluate changes in urologists ' clinical practice and income after two months of COVID-19. We also looked at geographical differences based on the incidence rates of COVID-19 in different states. Results: Among 766 urologists who completed the survey, a reduction [&ge;] 50% of patient visits, elective and emergency surgeries was reported by 83.2%, 89.6% and 54.8%, respectively. An income reduction of [&ge;] 50% was reported by 54.3%. Measures to reduce costs were implemented by most. Video consultations were performed by 38.7%. Modifications in health and lifestyle included weight gain (32.9%), reduced physical activity (60.0%), increased alcoholic intake (39.9%) and reduced sexual activity (34.9%). Finally, 13.5% of Brazilian urologists were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and about one third required hospitalization. Urologists from the highest COVID-19 incidence states were at a higher risk to have a reduction of patient visits and non-essential surgeries (OR=2.95, 95% CI 1.86 - 4.75; p < 0.0001) and of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 (OR=4.36 95% CI 1.74 - 10.54, p = 0.012). Conclusions: COVID-19 produced massive disturbances in Brazilian urologists' practice, with major reductions in patient visits and surgical procedures. Distressing consequences were also observed on physicians' income, health and personal lives. These findings are probably applicable to other medical specialties.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cristiano M Gomes","author_inst":"Division of Urology, University of Sao Paulo School of Medicine, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Luciano Favorito","author_inst":"Unidade de Pesquisa Urogenital, Rio de Janeiro State University, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Jo\u00e3o Victor T Henriques","author_inst":"Division of Urology, University of Sao Paulo School of Medicine, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Alfredo F Canalini","author_inst":"Division of Urology, Rio de Janeiro State University, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Karin M.

Constituting important correlates of protection, determination of virus-neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) is indispensable for convalescent plasma selection, vaccine candidate evaluation, and immunity certificates. In contrast to standard serology ELISAs, plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNTs) are laborious, time-consuming, expensive, and restricted to specialized laboratories. To replace microscopic counting-based SARS-CoV-2 PRNTs by a novel assay exempt from genetically modified viruses, which are inapplicable in most diagnostics departments, we established a simple, rapid, and automated SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay employing an in-cell ELISA (icELISA) approach.\n\nAfter optimization of various parameters such as virus-specific antibodies, cell lines, virus doses, and duration of infection, SARS-CoV-2-infected cells became amenable as direct antigen source for quantitative icELISA. Using commercially available nucleocapsid protein-specific antibodies, viral infection could easily be quantified in human and highly permissive Vero E6 cells by icELISA. Antiviral agents such as human sera containing NAbs or antiviral interferons dose-dependently reduced the SARS-CoV-2-specific signal. Applying increased infectious doses, the icNT was superior to PRNT in discriminating convalescent sera with high from those with intermediate neutralizing capacities.\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 icELISA test allows rapid (<48h in total, read-out in seconds) and automated quantification of virus infection in cell culture to evaluate the efficacy of NAbs as well as antiviral drugs, using reagents and equipment present in most routine diagnostics departments. We propose the icELISA and the icNT for COVID-19 research and diagnostics.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lara Schoeler","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Vu Thuy Khanh Le-Trilling","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Mareike Eilbrecht","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Denise Mennerich","author_inst":"Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Olympia E.

The Spike (S) protein of the virus forms projections on the virion surface responsible for host cell attachment and penetration. This viral glycoprotein is synthesized as a precursor in infected cells and, to be active, must be cleaved to two associated polypeptides: S1 and S2(3,4). For SARS-CoV-2 the cleavage is catalysed by furin, a host cell protease, which cleaves the S protein precursor at a specific sequence motif that generates a polybasic Arg-Arg-Ala-Arg (RRAR) C-terminal sequence on S1. This sequence motif conforms to the C-end rule (CendR), which means that the C-terminal sequence may allow the protein to associate with cell surface neuropilin-1 (NRP1) and neuropilin-2 (NRP2) receptors5. Here we demonstrate using immunoprecipitation, site-specific mutagenesis, structural modelling, and antibody blockade that, in addition to engaging the known receptor ACE2, S1 can bind to NRP1 through the canonical CendR mechanism. This interaction enhances infection by SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture. NRP1 thus serves as a host factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and provides a therapeutic target for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"James L Daly","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Boris Simonetti","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Carlos Anton Plagaro","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Maia Kavanagh Williamson","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Deborah K Shoemark","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Lorena Simon-Gracia","author_inst":"University of Tartu"},{"author_name":"Katja Klein","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Michael Bauer","author_inst":"University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Reka Hollandi","author_inst":"Biological Research Centre, Hungarian Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Urs F Greber","author_inst":"University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Peter Horvath","author_inst":"Biological Research Centre,"},{"author_name":"Richard B Sessions","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Ari Helenius","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Julian A Hiscox","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Tambet Teesalu","author_inst":"University of Tartu"},{"author_name":"David A Matthews","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Davidson","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Peter J Cullen","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Yohei Yamauchi","author_inst":"University of Bristol"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"cell biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.03.20121301","rel_title":"Class I HLA allele restricted antigenic coverage for Spike and N proteins is associated with divergent outcomes for COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-06-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.03.20121301","rel_abs":"The world is dealing with one of the worst pandemics ever. SARS-CoV-2 is the etiological agent of COVID-19 that has already spread to more than 200 countries. However, infectivity, severity, and mortality rates do not affect all countries equally. Here we consider 140 HLA alleles and extensively investigate the landscape of 3,723 potential HLA-I A and B restricted SARS-CoV-2-derived antigens and how 37 countries in the world are predicted to respond to those peptides considering their HLA-I distribution frequencies. The clustering of HLA-A and HLA-B allele frequencies partially separates most countries with the lowest number of deaths per million inhabitants from the other countries. We further correlated the patterns of in silico predicted population coverage and epidemiological data. The number of deaths per million inhabitants correlates to the predicted antigen coverage of S and N derived peptides and its module is influenced if a given set of frequent or rare HLA alleles are analyzed in a given population. Moreover, we highlighted a potential risk group carrying HLAs associated with an elevated number of deaths per million inhabitants. In addition, we identified 3 potential antigens bearing at least one amino acid of the 4-length insertion that differentiates SARS-CoV-2 from previous coronavirus strains. We believe these data can contribute to the search for peptides with the potential to be used in vaccine strategies considering the role of herd immunity to hamper the spread of the disease.

We then evaluate the effect of the hexapeptide on the aggregation process of the spike receptor protein to ACE2 in long-time enhanced MD simulations. In that set of simulations, we find that the spike receptor protein does not bind to ACE2 with the binding motif shown in experiments, but it rotates due to an electrostatic repulsion and forms a hydrophobic interface with ACE2. Surprisingly, we observe that the hexapeptide binds to the spike receptor domain, which has the effect that this protein only weakly attaches to ACE2, so that the activation of the spike protein receptor might be inhibited in this case.

The virus crossed the species barrier and established in the human population taking advantage of the spike protein high affinity for the ACE receptor to infect the lower respiratory tract. The Nucleocapsid (N) and Spike (S) are highly immunogenic structural proteins and most commercial COVID-19 diagnostic assays target these proteins. In an unpredictable epidemic, it is essential to know about their genetic variability. The objective of this study was to describe the substitution frequency of the S and N proteins of SARS-CoV-2 in South America. A total of 504 amino acid and nucleotide sequences of the S and N proteins of SARS-CoV-2 from seven South American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Peru, Uruguay, and Colombia), reported as of June 3, and corresponding to samples collected between March and April 2020, were compared through substitution matrices using the Muscle algorithm in MEGA X. Forty-three sequences from 13 Colombian departments were obtained in this study using the Oxford Nanopore and Illumina MiSeq technologies, following the amplicon-based ARTIC network protocol. The substitutions D614G in S and R203K\/G204R in N were the most frequent in South America, observed in 83% and 34% of the sequences respectively. Strikingly, genomes with the conserved position D614 were almost completely replaced by genomes with the G614 substitution between March to April, 2020. A similar replacement pattern was observed with R203K\/G204R although more marked in Chile, Argentina and Brazil, suggesting similar introduction history and\/or control strategies of SARS-CoV-2 in these countries. It is necessary to continue with the genomic surveillance of S and N proteins during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic as this information can be useful for developing vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostic tests.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carlos Franco-Munoz","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Diego Alejandro Alvarez-Diaz","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Katherine Laiton-Donato","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Magdalena Wiesner","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Patricia Escandon","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Jose A Usme-Ciro","author_inst":"Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia, Santa Marta"},{"author_name":"Nicolas David Franco-Sierra","author_inst":"Instituto de Investigacion de Recursos Biologicos Alexander von Humboldt"},{"author_name":"Astrid C Florez-Sanchez","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Sergio Gomez-Rangel","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Luz D Rodriguez Calderon","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Juliana Barbosa Ramirez","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Erika Ospitia Baez","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Diana Marcela Walteros","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Martha L Ospina Martinez","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"Marcela Mercado-Reyes","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud"},{"author_name":"David A Matthews","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Davidson","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Peter J Cullen","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Yohei Yamauchi","author_inst":"University of Bristol"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.03.132357","rel_title":"Pitfalls in SARS-CoV-2 PCR diagnostics","rel_date":"2020-06-04","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.03.132357","rel_abs":"To combat the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of PCR tests are performed worldwide.

In several purchased in-house primers\/probe sets, quantification cycle values as low as 17 were measured for negative control samples.

We hypothesize that peptide vaccines containing epitope regions optimized for concurrent B cell, CD4+ T cell, and CD8+ T cell stimulation would drive both humoral and cellular immunity with high specificity, potentially avoiding undesired effects such as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Additionally, such vaccines can be rapidly manufactured in a distributed manner. In this study, we combine computational prediction of T cell epitopes, recently published B cell epitope mapping studies, and epitope accessibility to select candidate peptide vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. We begin with an exploration of the space of possible T cell epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 with interrogation of predicted HLA-I and HLA-II ligands, overlap between predicted ligands, protein source, as well as concurrent human\/murine coverage. Beyond MHC affinity, T cell vaccine candidates were further refined by predicted immunogenicity, viral source protein abundance, sequence conservation, coverage of high frequency HLA alleles and co-localization of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes. B cell epitope regions were chosen from linear epitope mapping studies of convalescent patient serum, followed by filtering to select regions with surface accessibility, high sequence conservation, spatial localization near functional domains of the spike glycoprotein, and avoidance of glycosylation sites. From 58 initial candidates, three B cell epitope regions were identified. By combining these B cell and T cell analyses, as well as a manufacturability heuristic, we propose a set of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine peptides for use in subsequent murine studies and clinical trials.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=180 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR\/small\/135004v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (40K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fc6599org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1725a45org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@84a233org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b4c7aa_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christof C Smith","author_inst":"University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Sarah Entwistle","author_inst":"University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Caryn Willis","author_inst":"University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Steven Vensko","author_inst":"University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Wolfgang Beck","author_inst":"University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Jason Garness","author_inst":"University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Maria Sambade","author_inst":"University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Eric Routh","author_inst":"University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Kelly Olsen","author_inst":"University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Julia Kodysh","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Carsten Haber","author_inst":"PEPperPRINT GmbH"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Heiss","author_inst":"PEPperPRINT GmbH"},{"author_name":"Volker Stadler","author_inst":"PEPperPRINT GmbH"},{"author_name":"Erik Garrison","author_inst":"University of California - Santa Cruz"},{"author_name":"Oliver C Grant","author_inst":"University of Georgia - Athens"},{"author_name":"Robert Woods","author_inst":"University of Georgia - Athens"},{"author_name":"Mark Heise","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Benjamin G Vincent","author_inst":"University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Alexander Rubinsteyn","author_inst":"University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.02.131144","rel_title":"SARS-CoV2 Testing: The Limit of Detection Matters","rel_date":"2020-06-04","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.02.131144","rel_abs":"Resolving the COVID-19 pandemic requires diagnostic testing to determine which individuals are infected and which are not. The current gold standard is to perform RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal samples. Best-in-class assays demonstrate a limit of detection (LoD) of ~100 copies of viral RNA per milliliter of transport media. However, LoDs of currently approved assays vary over 10,000-fold. Assays with higher LoDs will miss more infected patients, resulting in more false negatives. However, the false-negative rate for a given LoD remains unknown. Here we address this question using over 27,500 test results for patients from across our healthcare network tested using the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 EUA. These results suggest that each 10-fold increase in LoD is expected to increase the false negative rate by 13%, missing an additional one in eight infected patients. The highest LoDs on the market will miss a majority of infected patients, with false negative rates as high as 70%. These results suggest that choice of assay has meaningful clinical and epidemiological consequences.

The overall positive percentage of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody is 3.83% (95% confidence interval: 2.76-5.16) for the entire cohort (n =1,071). The central Tokyo of 23 special wards exhibited a significantly higher prevalence compared to the other area of Tokyo (p =0.02, 4.68% [95%CI: 3.08-6.79] versus 1.83 [0.68-3.95] in central and suburban Tokyo, respectively). The seroprevalence of the cohort surveyed in this study is low for herd immunity, which suggests the need for robust disease control and prevention. A community-based approach, rather than state or prefectural levels, is of importance to figure out profiles of the SARS-COV-2 outbreak.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Morihito Takita","author_inst":"Navitas Clinic Tachikawa"},{"author_name":"Tomoko Matsumura","author_inst":"Navitas Clinic Tachikawa"},{"author_name":"Kana Yamamoto","author_inst":"Navitas Clinic Shinjuku"},{"author_name":"Erika Yamashita","author_inst":"Navitas Clinic Shinjuku"},{"author_name":"Kazutaka Hosoda","author_inst":"Navitas Clinic Tachikawa"},{"author_name":"Tamae Hamaki","author_inst":"Navitas Clinic Shinjuku"},{"author_name":"Eiji Kusumi","author_inst":"Navitas Clinic Tachikawa"},{"author_name":"Saruchi Wadhwa","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Nishu Tyagi","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Saman Fatihi","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Uma Sharma","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Priyanka Singh","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Hemlata Lall","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Meena Datta","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Poonam Gupta","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Nidhi Saini","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Aarti Tiwari","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Bibhash Nandi","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Dhirendra Kumar","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Satyabrata Bag","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Deepanshi Deepanshi","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Surabhi Rathore","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Nidhi Jatana","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Varun Jaiswal","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Hema Gogia","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Preeti Madan","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Simrita Singh","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Prateek Singh","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Debasis Dash","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Manju Bala","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Sandhya Kabra","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Sujeet K Singh","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Mitali Mukerji","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Lipi Thukral","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Faruq","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anurag Agarwal","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Partha Rakshit","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.03.20120998","rel_title":"Genetic polymorphisms mediating behavioural and immune response to pathogens may moderate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic: a pilot study","rel_date":"2020-06-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.03.20120998","rel_abs":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the entire world, but there are wide variations in prevalence and mortality across nations. Genetic variants which influence behavioural or immune responses to pathogens, selected for by pathogen pressure, may influence this variability. Two relevant polymorphisms in this context are the s allele of the serotonin transporter promoter (5-HTTLPR) and the G allele of the interleukin-6 gene (IL-6 rs1800795). Methods: The frequencies of the 5-HTTLPR s allele and IL-6 rs1800795 G allele were obtained from published data. The correlations between these allele frequencies and the prevalence and mortality rates of COVID-19 were examined across 44 nations. Results: The IL-6 rs1800795 G allele was negatively correlated with COVID-19 prevalence ({rho} = -0.466, p < 0.01) and mortality ({rho} = -0.591, p<0.001) across nations. The 5-HTTLPR s allele was negatively correlated with COVID-19 mortality rates ({rho} = -0.437, p = 0.023). Conclusions: These results suggest that a significant relationship exists between genetic variants that influence behavioural and immune responses to pathogens and indices of the impact of COVID-19 across nations. Further investigation of these variants and their correlates may permit the development of better preventive or therapeutic strategies in the management of the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ravi Philip Rajkumar","author_inst":"Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research"},{"author_name":"Tomoko Matsumura","author_inst":"Navitas Clinic Tachikawa"},{"author_name":"Kana Yamamoto","author_inst":"Navitas Clinic Shinjuku"},{"author_name":"Erika Yamashita","author_inst":"Navitas Clinic Shinjuku"},{"author_name":"Kazutaka Hosoda","author_inst":"Navitas Clinic Tachikawa"},{"author_name":"Tamae Hamaki","author_inst":"Navitas Clinic Shinjuku"},{"author_name":"Eiji Kusumi","author_inst":"Navitas Clinic Tachikawa"},{"author_name":"Saruchi Wadhwa","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Nishu Tyagi","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Saman Fatihi","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Uma Sharma","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Priyanka Singh","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Hemlata Lall","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Meena Datta","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Poonam Gupta","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Nidhi Saini","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Aarti Tiwari","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Bibhash Nandi","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Dhirendra Kumar","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Satyabrata Bag","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Deepanshi Deepanshi","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Surabhi Rathore","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Nidhi Jatana","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Varun Jaiswal","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Hema Gogia","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Preeti Madan","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Simrita Singh","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Prateek Singh","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Debasis Dash","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Manju Bala","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Sandhya Kabra","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Sujeet K Singh","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Mitali Mukerji","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Lipi Thukral","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Faruq","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anurag Agarwal","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Partha Rakshit","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.03.20120923","rel_title":"Trajectories of depression and anxiety during enforced isolation due to COVID-19: longitudinal analyses of 59,318 adults in the UK with and without diagnosed mental illness","rel_date":"2020-06-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.03.20120923","rel_abs":"Background: There is currently major concern about the impact of the global COVID-19 outbreak on mental health. A number of studies suggest that mental health deteriorated in many countries prior to and during enforced isolation (lockdown), but it remains unknown how mental health has changed week by week over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Aims: This study explored trajectories of anxiety and depression over the 20 weeks after lockdown was announced using data from England, and compared the growth trajectories by individual characteristics. Methods: Data from 36,520 adults in the UCL COVID -19 Social Study (a well-stratified panel study weighted to population proportions collecting data weekly during the COVID-19 pandemic) were analysed from 23\/03\/2020-09\/08\/2020. Latent growth models were fitted accounting for socio-demographic and health covariates. Results: 22.6% of the sample had scores indicating moderate-severe anxiety, and 25.1% indicating moderate-severe depressive symptoms. Anxiety and depression levels both declined across the first 20 weeks following the introduction of lockdown in the England. The fastest decreases were seen across the strict lockdown period, with symptoms plateauing as further lockdown easing measures were introduced. Being female or younger, having lower educational attainment, lower income or pre-existing mental health conditions, and living alone or with children were all risk factors for higher levels of anxiety and depression at the start of lockdown. Many of these inequalities in experiences were reduced as lockdown continued, but differences were still evident 20 weeks after the start of lockdown. Conclusions: As countries face potential future lockdowns, these data suggest that the highest levels of depression and anxiety are in the early stages of lockdown but decline fairly rapidly as individuals adapt to circumstances. They also suggest the importance of supporting individuals in the lead-up to lockdown measures being brought in to try and reduce distress and highlight that emotionally vulnerable groups have remained at risk throughout lockdown and its aftermath.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daisy Fancourt","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Andrew Steptoe","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Feifei Bu","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Erika Yamashita","author_inst":"Navitas Clinic Shinjuku"},{"author_name":"Kazutaka Hosoda","author_inst":"Navitas Clinic Tachikawa"},{"author_name":"Tamae Hamaki","author_inst":"Navitas Clinic Shinjuku"},{"author_name":"Eiji Kusumi","author_inst":"Navitas Clinic Tachikawa"},{"author_name":"Saruchi Wadhwa","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Nishu Tyagi","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Saman Fatihi","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Uma Sharma","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Priyanka Singh","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Hemlata Lall","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Meena Datta","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Poonam Gupta","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Nidhi Saini","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Aarti Tiwari","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Bibhash Nandi","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Dhirendra Kumar","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Satyabrata Bag","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Deepanshi Deepanshi","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Surabhi Rathore","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Nidhi Jatana","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Varun Jaiswal","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Hema Gogia","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Preeti Madan","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Simrita Singh","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Prateek Singh","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Debasis Dash","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Manju Bala","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Sandhya Kabra","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Sujeet K Singh","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Mitali Mukerji","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Lipi Thukral","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Faruq","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anurag Agarwal","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Partha Rakshit","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.02.20120790","rel_title":"Assessing capacity to social distance and neighborhood-level health disparities during the COVID-19 pandemic","rel_date":"2020-06-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.02.20120790","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 pandemic has yielded disproportionate impacts on communities of color in New York City (NYC).

Here, we investigate the role of neighborhood social disadvantage on the ability to socially distance, infections, and mortality. We combine Census Bureau and NYC open data with SARS-CoV-2 testing data using supervised dimensionality-reduction with Bayesian Weighted Quantile Sums regression. The result is a ZIP code-level index with relative weights for social factors facilitating infection risk. We find a positive association between neighborhood social disadvantage and infections, adjusting for the number of tests administered. Neighborhood infection risk is also associated with capacity to socially isolate, as measured by NYC subway data. Finally, infection risk is associated with COVID-19-related mortality. These analyses support that differences in capacity to socially isolate is a credible pathway between disadvantage and COVID-19 disparities.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel Carrion","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Elena Colicino","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Nicolo Foppa Pedretti","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Johnathan Rush","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kodi B.

The aim of the present study was to predict the COVID-19 prevalence and disease progression rate in Indian scenario in order to provide an analysis that can shed light on comprehending the trends of the outbreak and outline an impression of the epidemiological stage for each state of a diverse country like India. In addition, the forecast of COVID-19 incidence trends of these states can help take safety measures and policy design for this epidemic in the days to come. In order to achieve the same, we have utilized an approach where we test modelling choices of the spatially unambiguous kind, proposed by the wave of infections spreading from the initial slow progression to a higher curve. We have estimated the parameters of an individual state using factors like population density and mobility. The findings can also be used to strategize the testing and quarantine processes to manipulate the spread of the disease in the future. This is especially important for a country like India that has several limitations about healthcare infrastructure, diversity in socioeconomic status, high population density, housing conditions, health care coverage that can be important determinants for the overall impact of the pandemic. The results of our 5-phase model depict a projection of the state wise infections\/disease over time. The model can generate live graphs as per the change in the data values as the values are automatically being fetched from the crowd-sourced database.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samuel Bharti","author_inst":"Amity Institute of Biotechnology, Amity University, Uttar Pradesh, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Priyanka Narad","author_inst":"Amity Institute of Biotechnology, Amity University, Uttar Pradesh, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Parul Chugh","author_inst":"Amity Institute of Biotechnology, Amity University, Uttar Pradesh, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Alakto Choudhury","author_inst":"Amity Institute of Biotechnology, Amity University, Uttar Pradesh, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Seema Bhatnagar","author_inst":"Amity Institute of Biotechnology, Amity University, Uttar Pradesh, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Abhishek Sengupta","author_inst":"Amity Institute of Biotechnology, Amity University, Uttar Pradesh, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Allan C.

Methods: An online survey of 8158 Chinese adults between 22 February to 5 March 2020 was conducted. Bivariate associations between categorical variables were examined using Fisher exact test. We also explored the determinants of four NPIs as well as their association with COVID-19 infection using logistic regression. Results: Of 8158 adults included, 57 (0.73%) were infected with COVID-19. The overwhelming majority of respondents showed a positive attitude (99.2%), positive risk perception (99.9%) and high knowledge levels that were among the strongest predictors of four highly adopted NPIs (hand washing:96.8%; proper coughing: 93.1%; social distancing:87.1%; mask wearing:97.9%). There was an increased risk of COVID-19 infection for those who not washing hands (2.28% vs 0.65%; RR=3.53: 95%CI: 1.53-8.15; P<0.009); not practicing proper coughing (1.79% vs 0.73%; RR=2.44: 95%CI: 1.15-5.15;P=0.026); not practicing social distancing (1.52% vs 0.58%; RR=2.63:95%CI:1.48-4.67; P=0.002); and not wearing a mask (7.41% vs 0.6%; RR=12.38:95%CI:5.81-26.36; P<0.001). For those who did practice all other three NPIs, wearing mask was associated with significantly reduced risk of infection compared to those who did not wear a mask (0.6% vs 16.7%; p=0.035). Similarly, for those who did not practice all or part of the other three NPIs, wearing mask was also associated with significantly reduced risk of infection. In a penalised logistic regression model including all four NPIs, wearing a mask was the only significant predictor of COVID-19 infection among four NPIs (OR=7.20; 95%CI:2.24-23.11; p<0.001). Conclusions: We found high levels of risk perception, positive attitude, desirable knowledge as well as a high level of adopting four NPIs. The relevant knowledge, risk perception and attitude were strong predictors of adapting the four NPIs. Mask wearing, among four personal NPIs, was the most effective protective measure against COVID-19 infection with added preventive effect among those who practised all or part of the other three NPIs.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hong Xu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Yong Gan","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Daikun Zheng","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Medical College, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Bo Wu","author_inst":"Wanzhou District Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Xian Zhu","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Chang Xu","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Chenglu Liu","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Zhou Tao","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Yaoyue Hu","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Min Chen","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Mingjiang Li","author_inst":"School of Public Health and Management, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Zuxun Lu","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"},{"author_name":"Jack Chen","author_inst":"University of New South Wales"},{"author_name":"Meena Datta","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Poonam Gupta","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Nidhi Saini","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Aarti Tiwari","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Bibhash Nandi","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Dhirendra Kumar","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Satyabrata Bag","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Deepanshi Deepanshi","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Surabhi Rathore","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Nidhi Jatana","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Varun Jaiswal","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Hema Gogia","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Preeti Madan","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Simrita Singh","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Prateek Singh","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Debasis Dash","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Manju Bala","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Sandhya Kabra","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Sujeet K Singh","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Mitali Mukerji","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Lipi Thukral","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Faruq","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anurag Agarwal","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Partha Rakshit","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.02.20120014","rel_title":"Viral load dynamics in transmissible symptomatic patients with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-06-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.02.20120014","rel_abs":"To investigate the relationship between viral load and secondary transmission in novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we reviewed epidemiological and clinical data obtained from immunocompetent laboratory-confirmed patients with COVID-19 at Toyama University Hospital.

High nasopharyngeal viral loads around onset may contribute to secondary transmission of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hitoshi Kawasuji","author_inst":"Toyama University Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Toyama, Japan"},{"author_name":"Yusuke Takegoshi","author_inst":"Toyama University Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Toyama, Japan"},{"author_name":"Makito Kaneda","author_inst":"Toyama University Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Toyama, Japan"},{"author_name":"Akitoshi Ueno","author_inst":"Toyama University Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Toyama, Japan"},{"author_name":"Yuki Miyajima","author_inst":"Toyama University Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Toyama, Japan"},{"author_name":"Koyomi Kawago","author_inst":"Toyama University Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Toyama, Japan"},{"author_name":"Yasutaka Fukui","author_inst":"Toyama University Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Toyama, Japan"},{"author_name":"Yoshihiko Yoshida","author_inst":"Toyama University Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Toyama, Japan"},{"author_name":"Miyuki Kimura","author_inst":"Toyama University Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Toyama, Japan"},{"author_name":"Hiroshi Yamada","author_inst":"Toyama University Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Toyama, Japan"},{"author_name":"Ippei Sakamaki","author_inst":"Toyama University Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Toyama, Japan"},{"author_name":"Hideki Tani","author_inst":"Toyama University Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Toyama, Japan"},{"author_name":"Yoshitomo Morinaga","author_inst":"Toyama University Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Toyama, Japan"},{"author_name":"Yoshihiro Yamamoto","author_inst":"Toyama University Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Toyama, Japan"},{"author_name":"Poonam Gupta","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Nidhi Saini","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Aarti Tiwari","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Bibhash Nandi","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Dhirendra Kumar","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Satyabrata Bag","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Deepanshi Deepanshi","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Surabhi Rathore","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Nidhi Jatana","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Varun Jaiswal","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Hema Gogia","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Preeti Madan","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Simrita Singh","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Prateek Singh","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Debasis Dash","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Manju Bala","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Sandhya Kabra","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Sujeet K Singh","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Mitali Mukerji","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Lipi Thukral","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Faruq","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anurag Agarwal","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Partha Rakshit","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.02.20120345","rel_title":"Comparative assessment of multiple COVID-19 serological technologies supports continued evaluation of point-of-care lateral flow assays in hospital and community healthcare settings","rel_date":"2020-06-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.02.20120345","rel_abs":"There is a clear requirement for an accurate SARS-CoV-2 antibody test, both as a complement to existing diagnostic capabilities and for determining community seroprevalence.

A highly specific in-house ELISA was developed for the detection of anti-spike (S), -receptor binding domain (RBD) and -nucleocapsid (N) antibodies and used for the cross-comparison of ten commercial serological assays - a chemiluminescence-based platform, two ELISAs and seven colloidal gold lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) - on an identical panel of 110 SARS-CoV-2-positive samples and 50 pre-pandemic negatives. There was a wide variation in the performance of the different platforms, with specificity ranging from 82% to 100%, and overall sensitivity from 60.9% to 87.3%. However, the head to head comparison of multiple serodiagnostic assays on identical sample sets revealed that performance is highly dependent on the time of sampling, with sensitivities of over 95% seen in several tests when assessing samples from more than 20 days post onset of symptoms. Furthermore, these analyses identified clear outlying samples that were negative in all tests, but were later shown to be from individuals with mildest disease presentation. Rigorous comparison of antibody testing platforms will inform the deployment of point of care technologies in healthcare settings and their use in the monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infections.","rel_num_authors":31,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Suzanne Pickering","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Gilberto Betancor","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rui Pedro Galao","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Blair Merrick","author_inst":"Guy's and St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Adrian W Signell","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Harry D Wilson","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Mark Tan Kia Ik","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Seow","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Carl Graham","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Sam Acors","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Neophytos Kouphou","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Kathryn JA Steel","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Oliver Hemmings","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Amita Patel","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Gaia Nebbia","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Sam Douthwaite","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Lorcan O'Connell","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Jakub Luptak","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Laura McCoy","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Philip JM Brouwer","author_inst":"University of Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Marit J van Gils","author_inst":"University of Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Rogier W Sanders","author_inst":"University of Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Rocio Martinez Nunez","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Karen Bisnauthsing","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Geraldine O'Hara","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Eithne MacMahon","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Rahul Batra","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Michael H Malim","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Stuart JD Neil","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Katie Doores","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan D Edgeworth","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Sujeet K Singh","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Mitali Mukerji","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Lipi Thukral","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Faruq","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anurag Agarwal","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Partha Rakshit","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.02.20120634","rel_title":"Assembly of an integrated human lung cell atlas reveals that SARS-CoV-2 receptor is co-expressed with key elements of the kinin-kallikrein, renin-angiotensin and coagulation systems in alveolar cells","rel_date":"2020-06-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.02.20120634","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2, the pathogenic agent of COVID-19, employs angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) as its cell entry receptor. Clinical data reveal that in severe COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 infects the lung, leading to a frequently lethal triad of respiratory insufficiency, acute cardiovascular failure, and coagulopathy. Physiologically, ACE2 plays a role in the regulation of three systems that could potentially be involved in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19: the kinin-kallikrein system, resulting in acute lung inflammatory edema; the renin-angiotensin system, promoting cardiovascular instability; and the coagulation system, leading to thromboembolism. Here we analyzed ~130,000 human lung single-cell transcriptomes and show that key elements of the kinin-kallikrein, renin-angiotensin and coagulation systems are co-expressed with ACE2 in alveolar cells, which could explain how changes in ACE2 promoted by SARS-CoV-2 cell entry result in the development of the three most severe clinical components of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Davi Sidarta-Oliveira","author_inst":"University of Campinas, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Carlos Poblete Jara","author_inst":"University of Campinas, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Adriano J Ferruzzi","author_inst":"University of Campinas, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Munir S Skaf","author_inst":"University of Campinas, Brazil"},{"author_name":"William H Velander","author_inst":"University of Nebraska, USA"},{"author_name":"Eliana P Araujo","author_inst":"University of Campinas, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Licio A Velloso","author_inst":"University of Campinas, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey Seow","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Carl Graham","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Sam Acors","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Neophytos Kouphou","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Kathryn JA Steel","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Oliver Hemmings","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Amita Patel","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Gaia Nebbia","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Sam Douthwaite","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Lorcan O'Connell","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Jakub Luptak","author_inst":"MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Laura McCoy","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Philip JM Brouwer","author_inst":"University of Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Marit J van Gils","author_inst":"University of Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Rogier W Sanders","author_inst":"University of Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Rocio Martinez Nunez","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Karen Bisnauthsing","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Geraldine O'Hara","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Eithne MacMahon","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Rahul Batra","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Michael H Malim","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Stuart JD Neil","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Katie Doores","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan D Edgeworth","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Sujeet K Singh","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Mitali Mukerji","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Lipi Thukral","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Faruq","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anurag Agarwal","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Partha Rakshit","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.02.20120477","rel_title":"Detection of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 exposed individuals by a sensitive S-based ELISA.","rel_date":"2020-06-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.02.20120477","rel_abs":"To assess the current coronavirus pandemic, there is a pressing need to determine the exposure and seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 on a local and global level.

Severe COVID-19 disease is associated with disordered inflammatory responses. We hypothesized that reduced plasma RNLS levels could be a marker of COVID-19 disease severity. Methods: Plasma was collected from 51 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 15 uninfected non-hospitalized controls. Plasma RNLS and cytokine levels were measured and sociodemographic and clinical data were collected from chart review. Data were analyzed using nonparametric analyses and Kaplan Meir curve log rank analysis. Results: Plasma RNLs levels were negatively correlated with inflammatory markers, including IL-1b, IL-6, and TNFa (p = 0.04, p = 0.03, p = 0.01, respectively). Patients with COVID-19 disease had lower levels of RNLS than controls. Lower levels of RNLS were associated with more severe disease among COVID-19 patients. Low RNLS was also associated with worse survival among COVID-19 patients (HR = 4.54; 95% CI: 1.06-19.43; p = 0.005). Conclusion: Low plasma RNLS levels are associated with severe COVID-19 disease and may be a useful additional biomarker when identifying patients with severe COVID-19 disease. Given RNLS anti-inflammatory properties and negative correlation with inflammatory markers, these findings also suggest evidence of a potential pathophysiological mechanism for severe COVID-19 disease.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Melinda Wang","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xiaojia Guo","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hyung J Chun","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Alfred Ian Lee","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Charles Cha","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fred Gorelick","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Gary V Desir","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Leo Hanke","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Therese Thunberg","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Gerald McInerney","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Andrea Puhar","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Felipe Cava","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Gunilla B Karlsson Hedestam","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Tor Monsen","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Fredrik Elgh","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Bert Blomkvist","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Ingrid Marklund","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Clas Ahlm","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Magnus Evander","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Johan Normark","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Anders Johansson","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Anna K Overby","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Mattias Forsell","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Karen Bisnauthsing","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Geraldine O'Hara","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Eithne MacMahon","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Rahul Batra","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Michael H Malim","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Stuart JD Neil","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Katie Doores","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan D Edgeworth","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Sujeet K Singh","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Mitali Mukerji","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Lipi Thukral","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Faruq","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anurag Agarwal","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Partha Rakshit","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.03.20120881","rel_title":"A prediction model based on machine learning for diagnosing the early COVID-19 patients","rel_date":"2020-06-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.03.20120881","rel_abs":"With the dramatically fast spread of COVID-9, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test has become the gold standard method for confirmation of COVID-19 infection. However, RT-PCR tests are complicated in operation andIt usually takes 5-6 hours or even longer to get the result. Additionally, due to the low virus loads in early COVID-19 patients, RT-PCR tests display false negative results in a number of cases. Analyzing complex medical datasets based on machine learning provides health care workers excellent opportunities for developing a simple and efficient COVID-19 diagnostic system. This paper aims at extracting risk factors from clinical data of early COVID-19 infected patients and utilizing four types of traditional machine learning approaches including logistic regression(LR), support vector machine(SVM), decision tree(DT), random forest(RF) and a deep learning-based method for diagnosis of early COVID-19. The results show that the LR predictive model presents a higher specificity rate of 0.95, an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.971 and an improved sensitivity rate of 0.82, which makes it optimal for the screening of early COVID-19 infection. We also perform the verification for generality of the best model (LR predictive model) among Zhejiang population, and analyze the contribution of the factors to the predictive models. Our manuscript describes and highlights the ability of machine learning methods for improving the accuracy and timeliness of early COVID-19 infection diagnosis. The higher AUC of our LR-base predictive model makes it a more conducive method for assisting COVID-19 diagnosis. The optimal model has been encapsulated as a mobile application (APP) and implemented in some hospitals in Zhejiang Province.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sun Nan Nan","author_inst":"Hangzhou Wowjoy Information Technology Co., Ltd, Hangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Yang Ya","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Centre for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Cen"},{"author_name":"Tang Ling Ling","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, ShuLan (Hangzhou) Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang Shuren University Shulan International Medical College, Hangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Dai Yi Ning","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases,Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, Hangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Gao Hai Nv","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, ShuLan (Hangzhou) Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang Shuren University Shulan International Medical College, Hangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Pan Hong Ying","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, Hangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Ju Bin","author_inst":"Hangzhou Wowjoy Information Technology Co., Ltd, Hangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Leo Hanke","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Therese Thunberg","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Gerald McInerney","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Andrea Puhar","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Felipe Cava","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Gunilla B Karlsson Hedestam","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Tor Monsen","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Fredrik Elgh","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Bert Blomkvist","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Ingrid Marklund","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Clas Ahlm","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Magnus Evander","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Johan Normark","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Anders Johansson","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Anna K Overby","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Mattias Forsell","author_inst":"Umea University"},{"author_name":"Karen Bisnauthsing","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Geraldine O'Hara","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Eithne MacMahon","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Rahul Batra","author_inst":"Guy's and St.Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Michael H Malim","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Stuart JD Neil","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Katie Doores","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan D Edgeworth","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Sujeet K Singh","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Mitali Mukerji","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Lipi Thukral","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Faruq","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anurag Agarwal","author_inst":"IGIB, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Partha Rakshit","author_inst":"NCDC, Delhi"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.03.20121004","rel_title":"Exposure to cough aerosols and development of pulmonary COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-06-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.03.20121004","rel_abs":"Half a year after the emergence of COVID-19, research is still going on to gain insight in the importance of different SARS-CoV-2 transmission routes and their impact on the clinical picture of COVID-19.
