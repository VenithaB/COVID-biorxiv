Our study objective was to describe the characteristics, symptoms, and self-reported testing rates of respondents in three different COVID-19 symptom surveys in Canada. Methods: Data sources consisted of two distinct Canada-wide web-based surveys, and phone polling in Ontario. All three sources contained self-reported information on COVID-19 symptoms and testing. In addition to describing respondent characteristics, we examined symptom frequency and the testing rate among the symptomatic, as well as rates of symptoms and testing across respondent groups. Results: We found that 1.6% of respondents experienced a symptom on the day of their survey, 15% of Ontario households had a symptom in the previous week, and 44% of Canada-wide respondents had a symptom in the previous month over March-April 2020. Across the three surveys, SARS-CoV-2-testing was reported in 2-9% of symptomatic responses. Women, younger and middle-aged adults (versus older adults) and Indigenous\/First nations\/Inuit\/Metis were more likely to report at least one symptom, and visible minorities were more likely to report the combination of fever with cough or shortness of breath. Interpretation: The low rate of testing among those reporting symptoms suggests significant opportunity to expand testing among community-dwelling residents of Canada. Syndromic surveillance data can supplement public health reports and provide much-needed context to gauge the adequacy of current SARS-CoV-2 testing rates.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lauren Lapointe-Shaw","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Rader","author_inst":"Boston University"},{"author_name":"Christina M.

Methods: We performed a cohort analysis of consecutive COVID-19 hospital admissions at 5 Johns Hopkins hospitals in the Baltimore\/DC area between March 4 and April 24, 2020. Disease severity and outcomes were classified using the WHO COVID-19 disease severity ordinal scale. Cox proportional-hazards regressions were performed to assess relationships between demographics, clinical features and progression to severe disease or death. Results: 832 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized; 633 (76.1%) were discharged, 113 (13.6%) died, and 85 (10.2%) remained hospitalized. Among those discharged, 518 (82%) had mild\/moderate and 116 (18%) had severe illness. Mortality was statistically significantly associated with increasing age per 10 years (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.54; 95%CI 1.28-1.84), nursing home residence (aHR 2.13, 95%CI 1.41-3.23), Charlson comorbidity index (1.13; 95% CI 1.02-1.26), respiratory rate (aHR 1.13; 95%CI 1.09-1.17), D-dimer greater than 1mg\/dL (aHR 2.79; 95% 1.53-5.09), and detectable troponin (aHR 2.79; 95%CI 1.53-5.09).

The purpose of this study was to assess the knowledge, attitude and practice of community pharmacists, to snapshot their current preparedness and awareness regarding COVID-19. An online survey was conducted among a sample of 393 community pharmacists from two provinces; Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan during a period of strict lockdown (10th to 30th April 2020). A validated (Cronbach alpha= 0.077) self-administered questionnaire comprised of five sections (Demographics, source of information, knowledge, attitude, and practice) was used for data collection. Logistic regression was applied to find potential factors associated with good knowledge, attitude, and practice by using SPSS version 21. Of total 393 participants, 71.5% (n=281) had good knowledge, 44% (n=175) had positive attitude and 57.3% (n=225) had good practice regarding COVID-19. Social media (45.29%, n=178) was reported as the main source to seek information regarding COVID-19. Results revealed that the age of [&ge;]26 years, Ph.D. degree level, and good knowledge were the substantial determinants (P<0.05) of a good attitude. Similarly, community pharmacist who had an experience of >5 years, hold a Ph.D. degree, good knowledge and good attitude had higher odds of good practice compared to reference categories (P<0.05). The findings demonstrated that the majority of community pharmacists had good knowledge, but had a poor attitude and practice towards the COVID-19. This study also highlighted the disparity in some aspects of knowledge, attitude, and practice that must be addressed in future educational, awareness, and counselling programs.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Khayal Muhammad","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Comsat University, Abbottabad Campus, Abbottabad, Pakistan."},{"author_name":"Muhammad Saqlain","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Ataullah Hamdard","author_inst":"Faculty of Art and Sciences, Department of Statistics, Cukurova University, Adana, Turkey."},{"author_name":"Muhammad Naveed","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacotherapy, Faculty of Medicine, University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Farooq Umer","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Siraj Khan","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan."},{"author_name":"Muhammad Kamran","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Haroon Rashid","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan."},{"author_name":"Sohail Kamran","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan."},{"author_name":"Muhammad Ijaz Khan","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, University of Swabi, Anbar-23561, Swabi, KPK, Pakistan."},{"author_name":"Faiz Ullah Khan","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Administration and Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, Health Science Centre, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"},{"author_name":"Yaseen Hussain","author_inst":"College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou, China."},{"author_name":"Zakir Khan","author_inst":"Institute of Health Sciences, Department of Pharmacology (Pharmacovigilance), Cukurova University, Adana, Turkey\/Department of Pharmacy, Quaid-i-Azam University"},{"author_name":"Eric D Dobkin","author_inst":"Suburban Hospital, Johns Hopkins Medicine"},{"author_name":"Renee Blanding","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Abele","author_inst":"Sibley Memorial Hospital, Johns Hopkins Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bonnie Woods","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Harkness","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David R Thiemann","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mary Grace Bowring","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Aalok B.

The effective reproduction number Re(t) is a critical measure of epidemic potential. Re(t) can be calculated in near real time using an incidence time series and the generation time distribution---the time between infection events in an infector-infectee pair. In calculating Re(t), the generation time distribution is often approximated by the serial interval distribution---the time between symptom onset in an infector-infectee pair. However, while generation time must be positive by definition, serial interval can be negative if transmission can occur before symptoms, such as in COVID-19, rendering such an approximation improper in some contexts. METHODS. We developed a method to infer the generation time distribution from parametric definitions of the serial interval and incubation period distributions. We then compared estimates of Re(t) for COVID-19 in the Greater Toronto Area of Canada using: negative-permitting versus non-negative serial interval distributions, versus the inferred generation time distribution. RESULTS. We estimated the generation time of COVID-19 to be Gamma-distributed with mean 3.99 and standard deviation 2.96 days. Relative to the generation time distribution, non-negative serial interval distribution caused overestimation of Re(t) due to larger mean, while negative-permitting serial interval distribution caused underestimation of Re(t) due to larger variance. IMPLICATIONS. Approximation of the generation time distribution of COVID-19 with non-negative or negative-permitting serial interval distributions when calculating Re(t) may result in over or underestimation of transmission potential, respectively.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jesse Knight","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Sharmistha Mishra","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Huihui Wang","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xuemei Li","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Shubing Zhang","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yuanhong Xu","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wei Wei","author_inst":"Anhui Medical University"},{"author_name":"Haroon Rashid","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan."},{"author_name":"Sohail Kamran","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan."},{"author_name":"Muhammad Ijaz Khan","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, University of Swabi, Anbar-23561, Swabi, KPK, Pakistan."},{"author_name":"Faiz Ullah Khan","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Administration and Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, Health Science Centre, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"},{"author_name":"Yaseen Hussain","author_inst":"College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou, China."},{"author_name":"Zakir Khan","author_inst":"Institute of Health Sciences, Department of Pharmacology (Pharmacovigilance), Cukurova University, Adana, Turkey\/Department of Pharmacy, Quaid-i-Azam University"},{"author_name":"Eric D Dobkin","author_inst":"Suburban Hospital, Johns Hopkins Medicine"},{"author_name":"Renee Blanding","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Abele","author_inst":"Sibley Memorial Hospital, Johns Hopkins Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bonnie Woods","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Harkness","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David R Thiemann","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mary Grace Bowring","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Aalok B.

To determine the value of undertaking a systematic review on this topic; and to identify knowledge gaps to aid future research, education and guidelines. Methods This review was guided by specific methodological framework and reporting items (PRISMA-ScR). We included studies, cases and grey literature regarding prone position and CPR\/cardiac arrest. The databases searched were MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Scopus and Google Scholar. Expanded grey literature searching included internet search engine, targeted websites and social media. Results Of 453 identified studies, 24 (5%) studies met our inclusion criteria. There were four prone resuscitation-relevant studies examining: blood and tidal volumes generated by prone compressions; prone compression quality metrics on a manikin; and chest computed tomography scans for compression landmarking. Twenty case reports\/series described the resuscitation of 25 prone patients. Prone compression quality was assessed by invasive blood pressure monitoring, exhaled carbon dioxide and pulse palpation. Recommended compression location was zero-to-two vertebral segments below the scapulae. Twenty of 25 cases (80%) survived prone resuscitation, although few cases reported long term outcome. Seven cases described full neurological recovery. Conclusion This scoping review did not identify sufficient evidence to justify a systematic review or modified resuscitation guidelines. It remains reasonable to initiate resuscitation in the prone position if turning the patient supine would lead to delays or risk to providers or patients. Prone resuscitation quality can be judged using end-tidal CO2, and arterial pressure tracing, with patients turned supine if insufficient.

Some recent studies suggested an inverse correlation with BCG vaccination at population level, while others denied this hypothesis. In order to address this controversial issue, we performed a strict epidemiological study collecting data available on a global scale, considering additional variables such as cultural-political factors and adherence to other vaccination coverages. Methods: Data on 121 countries, accounting for about 99% of Covid-19 cases and deaths globally, were from John's Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, United Nations, Human Freedom Report, and BCG Atlas. Statistical models used were Ordinary Least Squares, Tobit and Fractional Probit, implemented on Stata\/MP16 software. Results: Based on our results, countries where BCG vaccination is or has been mandated in the last decades have seen a drastic reduction in Covid-19 diffusion (-80% on average) and mortality (-50% on average), even controlling for relative wealth of countries and their governmental health expenditure. A significant contribution to this reduction (respectively -50% and -13% on average) was also associated to the outbreak onset during summer, suggesting a possible influence of seasonality. Other variables turned out to be associated, though to a lesser extent. Conclusions: Relying on a very large dataset and a wide array of control variables, our study confirms a strong and robust association between Covid-19 diffusion and mortality with BCG vaccination and a set socio-economic factors, opening new perspectives for clinical speculations and public health policies.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luigi Ventura","author_inst":"Department of Economy and Law, Sapienza University of Rome,  Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Matteo Vitali","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Vincenzo Romano Spica","author_inst":"Department of Movement, Human and Health Sciences, University of Rome \u201cForo Italico\u201d, Rome Italy"},{"author_name":"Alexander R Judkins","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Xiaowu Gai","author_inst":"Children's Hospital Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Christopher Picard","author_inst":"University of Alberta Faculty of Nursing & Covenant Health"},{"author_name":"Lazar Milovanovic","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alberta"},{"author_name":"Domhnall O'Dochartaigh","author_inst":"Edmonton Zone Emergency Departments, Alberta Health Services; Shock Trauma Air Rescue Society, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada."},{"author_name":"Peter G Brindley","author_inst":"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alberta"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Ijaz Khan","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, University of Swabi, Anbar-23561, Swabi, KPK, Pakistan."},{"author_name":"Faiz Ullah Khan","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacy, Administration and Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, Health Science Centre, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"},{"author_name":"Yaseen Hussain","author_inst":"College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou, China."},{"author_name":"Zakir Khan","author_inst":"Institute of Health Sciences, Department of Pharmacology (Pharmacovigilance), Cukurova University, Adana, Turkey\/Department of Pharmacy, Quaid-i-Azam University"},{"author_name":"Eric D Dobkin","author_inst":"Suburban Hospital, Johns Hopkins Medicine"},{"author_name":"Renee Blanding","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Abele","author_inst":"Sibley Memorial Hospital, Johns Hopkins Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bonnie Woods","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kenneth Harkness","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David R Thiemann","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mary Grace Bowring","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Aalok B.

During the period from 2\/4\/2020 to 18\/5\/2020, a total of 219 blood samples were collected and analyzed for the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Collection of samples were divided in two categories; random samples from public community and samples from health care workers belong to two Governmental hospitals and one private clinic. One Step Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) IgM\/IgG Antibody Test was used. Out of the 219 samples tested, 6 (2.74%) samples were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2. All health-care workers were tested negative. All positive cases were females and 5 of them aged between 44 to 75 years and one aged 32 years. The prevalence in young females ([&le;]40 years) was 1.4% in total young females tested in the study and 1.75% in young females taken from public community. The prevalence in older females aged ( 40 years), was 11.1% in total females tested and 13.9% in females taken from public community. In conclusion, the preliminary investigation of SARS-CoV-2 revealed considerable prevalence in Alzintan City although the disease seems to be in its mild form. Active surveillance studies with high number of samples using both virological and serological tests are in urgent need.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"ABDULWAHAB M.

Methods: This study evaluated the association of underlying CVD with disease progression in patients with mild COVID-19. The primary outcome was the need to be transferred to intensive care due to disease progression. The patients were divided with and without CVD as well as stable and intensive care groups. Results: Of 332 patients with mild COVID-19, median age was 51 years (IQR, 40-59 years), and 200 (61.2%) were female. Of 48 (14.5%) patients with CVD, 23 (47.9%) progressed to severe disease status and required intensive care. Compared with patients without CVD, patients with CVD were older, and more likely to have fatigue, chest tightness, and myalgia. The rate of requiring intensive care was significantly higher among patients with CVD than in patients without CVD (47.92% vs. 12.4%; P<0.001). In subgroup analysis, rate of requiring intensive care was also higher among patients with either hypertension or coronary heart disease than in patients without hypertension or coronary heart disease. The multivariable regression model showed CVD served as an independent risk factor for intensive care (Odd ratio [OR], 2.652 [95% CI, 1.019-6.899]) after adjustment for various cofounders. Conclusions: Patients with mild COVID-19 complicating CVD in are susceptible to develop severe disease status and requirement for intensive care.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shi Tai","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Jianjun Tang","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Bilian Yu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Liang Tang","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yang Wang","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Huilin Zhang","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Weihong Zhu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Kui Xiao","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Chuan Wen","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Chongqing Tan","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Zhongbiao Jiang","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Chuanhao Jiang","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Li Zhu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Li Jiang","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Qiming Liu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xinqun Hu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Zhenfei Fang","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xuping Li","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Jiaxing Sun","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Zhaowei Zhu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Hui Yang","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Tao Tu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yichao Xiao","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Mingxian Chen","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yuhu He","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xiangping Chai","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Junmei Xu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Shenghua Zhou","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"cardiovascular medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.21.20109397","rel_title":"Investigational treatments for COVID-19 may increase ventricular arrhythmia risk through drug interactions","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.21.20109397","rel_abs":"Many drugs that have been proposed for treatment of COVID-19 are reported to cause cardiac adverse events, including ventricular arrhythmias. In order to properly weigh risks against potential benefits, particularly when decisions must be made quickly, mathematical modeling of both drug disposition and drug action can be useful for predicting patient response and making informed decisions. Here we explored the potential effects on cardiac electrophysiology of 4 drugs proposed to treat COVID-19: lopinavir, ritonavir, chloroquine, and azithromycin, as well as combination therapy involving these drugs. Our study combined simulations of pharmacokinetics (PK) with quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) modeling of ventricular myocytes to predict potential cardiac adverse events caused by these treatments. Simulation results predicted that drug combinations can lead to greater cellular action potential prolongation, analogous to QT prolongation, compared with drugs given in isolation. The combination effect can result from both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug interactions. Importantly, simulations of different patient groups predicted that females with pre-existing heart disease are especially susceptible to drug-induced arrhythmias, compared males with disease or healthy individuals of either sex. Overall, the results illustrate how PK and QSP modeling may be combined to more precisely predict cardiac risks of COVID-19 therapies.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Meera Varshneya","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Itziar Irurzun-Arana","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Chiara Campana","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Rafael Dariolli","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Amy Gutierrez","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Taylor K Pullinger","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Eric A Sobie","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kui Xiao","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Chuan Wen","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Chongqing Tan","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Zhongbiao Jiang","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Chuanhao Jiang","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Li Zhu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Li Jiang","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Qiming Liu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xinqun Hu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Zhenfei Fang","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xuping Li","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Jiaxing Sun","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Zhaowei Zhu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Hui Yang","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Tao Tu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yichao Xiao","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Mingxian Chen","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yuhu He","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xiangping Chai","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Junmei Xu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Shenghua Zhou","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"pharmacology and therapeutics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.22.20110064","rel_title":"Estimation of the Final Size of the COVID-19 Epidemic inBalochistan, Pakistan.","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.22.20110064","rel_abs":"COVID-19 is a new disease that is spreading very fast in Pakistan.

Understanding current patterns of the pandemic spread and forecasting its long-term trajectory is essential in guiding policies aimed at curtailing the pandemic. This is particularly important in regions with weak economies and fragile health care systems such as West-Africa. We formulate and use a deterministic compartmental model to (i) assess the current patterns of COVID-19 spread in West-Africa, (ii) evaluate the impact of currently implemented control measures, and (iii) predict the future course of the pandemic with and without currently implemented and additional control measures in West-Africa. An analytical expression for the threshold level of control measures (involving a reduction in the effective contact rate) required to eliminate the pandemic is computed. Considering currently applied health control measures, numerical simulations of the model using baseline parameter values estimated from West-African COVID-19 data project a 60% reduction in the daily number of cases when the epidemic attains its peak. More reduction in the number of cases will be achieved if additional public health control measures that result in a reduction in the effective contact rate are implemented. We found out that disease elimination is difficult when more asymptomatic individuals contribute in transmission or are not identified and isolated in a timely manner. However, maintaining a baseline level of asymptomatic isolation and a low transmission rate will lead to a significant reduction in the number of daily cases when the pandemic peaks. For example, at the baseline level of asymptomatic isolation, at least a 53% reduction in the transmission rate is required for disease elimination, while disease elimination is also possible if asymptomatic individuals are identified and isolated within 2 days (after the incubation period). Combining two or more measures is better for disease control, e.g., if asymptomatic humans are contact traced or identified and isolated in less than 3 days then only about a 31% reduction in the disease transmission rate is required for disease elimination. Furthermore, we showed that the currently implemented measures caused the time-dependent effective reproduction number to reduce by approximately 37% from February 28, to August 24, 2020. We conclude that COVID-19 elimination requires more control measures than what is currently being applied inWest-Africa and that mass testing and contact tracing in order to identify and isolate asymptomatic individuals early is very important in curtailing the burden of the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Beaugard Hemaho Taboe","author_inst":"Laboratoire de Biomathematiques et d'estimations Forestieres, University of Abomey-Calavi"},{"author_name":"Valere Kolawole Salako","author_inst":"Laboratoire de Biomathematiques et d'Estimations Forestieres, University of Abomey-Calavi"},{"author_name":"Calistus N Ngonghala","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"Romain GLELE KAKAI","author_inst":"Laboratoire de Biomathematiques et d'Estimations Forestieres, University of Abomey-Calavi"},{"author_name":"Amy Gutierrez","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Taylor K Pullinger","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Eric A Sobie","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kui Xiao","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Chuan Wen","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Chongqing Tan","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Zhongbiao Jiang","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Chuanhao Jiang","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Li Zhu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Li Jiang","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Qiming Liu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xinqun Hu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Zhenfei Fang","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xuping Li","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Jiaxing Sun","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Zhaowei Zhu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Hui Yang","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Tao Tu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yichao Xiao","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Mingxian Chen","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yuhu He","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xiangping Chai","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Junmei Xu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Shenghua Zhou","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.22.20109934","rel_title":"Organizing Pneumonia of COVID-19: Time-dependent Evolution and Outcome in CT Findings","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.22.20109934","rel_abs":"Objective: As a pandemic, a most-common pattern resembled organizing pneumonia (OP) has been identified by CT findings in novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

Results: 79(74.5%) patients were non-severe and 103(97.2%) were discharged at median day 25 (range, day 8-50) after symptom-onset. Of 67 patients with revisit CT at 2-4 weeks after discharge, 20(29.9%) had complete absorption of lesions at median day 38 (range, day 30-53) after symptom-onset. Significant differences between complete absorption and residuals groups were found in percentages of consolidation (1.5% vs. 13.8%, P=0.010), number of involved lobe >3 (40.0% vs. 72.5%, P=0.030), CT score >4 (20.0% vs. 65.0%, P=0.010) at day 8-14. Conclusions: Most OP cases had good prognosis. Approximately one-third of cases had complete absorption of lesions during 1-2 months after symptom-onset while those with increased frequency of consolidation, number of involved lobe>3, and CT score >4 at week 2 after symptom-onset may indicate lesion residuals on CT.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yan Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Chao Jin","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Carol C.

Recent studies suggest that the population prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, a proxy for the number of asymptomatic cases, could be an order of magnitude larger than expected from the number of reported symptomatic cases. Knowing the precise prevalence and contagiousness of asymptomatic transmission is critical to estimate the overall dimension and pandemic potential of COVID-19. However, at this stage, the effect of the asymptomatic population, its size, and its outbreak dynamics remain largely unknown. Here we use reported symptomatic case data in conjunction with antibody seroprevalence studies, a mathematical epidemiology model, and a Bayesian framework to infer the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19. Our model computes, in real time, the time-varying contact rate of the outbreak, and projects the temporal evolution and credible intervals of the effective reproduction number and the symptomatic, asymptomatic, and recovered populations. Our study quantifies the sensitivity of the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 to three parameters: the effective reproduction number, the ratio between the symptomatic and asymptomatic populations, and the infectious periods of both groups For nine distinct locations, our model estimates the fraction of the population that has been infected and recovered by Jun 15, 2020 to 24.15% (95% CI: 20.48%-28.14%) for Heinsberg (NRW, Germany), 2.40% (95% CI: 2.09%-2.76%) for Ada County (ID, USA), 46.19% (95% CI: 45.81%-46.60%) for New York City (NY, USA), 11.26% (95% CI: 7.21%-16.03%) for Santa Clara County (CA, USA), 3.09% (95% CI: 2.27%-4.03%) for Denmark, 12.35% (95% CI: 10.03%-15.18%) for Geneva Canton (Switzerland), 5.24% (95% CI: 4.84%-5.70%) for the Netherlands, 1.53% (95% CI: 0.76%-2.62%) for Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil), and 5.32% (95% CI: 4.77%-5.93%) for Belgium. Our method traces the initial outbreak date in Santa Clara County back to January 20, 2020 (95% CI: December 29, 2019 - February 13, 2020). Our results could significantly change our understanding and management of the COVID-19 pandemic: A large asymptomatic population will make isolation, containment, and tracing of individual cases challenging. Instead, managing community transmission through increasing population awareness, promoting physical distancing, and encouraging behavioral changes could become more relevant.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mathias Peirlinck","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Kevin Linka","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Francisco Sahli Costabal","author_inst":"Universidad Catolica de Chile"},{"author_name":"Eran Bendavid","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Jayanta Bhattacharya","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"John Ioannidis","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Ellen Kuhl","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Runqing Li","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Zekun Wang","author_inst":"The Eighth Hospital of Xi.an"},{"author_name":"Fen Li","author_inst":"The Eighth Hospital of Xi.an"},{"author_name":"Jie Zhou","author_inst":"Xi.an Chest Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shubao Cai","author_inst":"Xi.an Chest Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yang Liu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi.an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Hao Li","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi.an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Zhongyi Li","author_inst":"Wuhan No.9 Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yukun Liang","author_inst":"Ankang Center Hospital"},{"author_name":"Heping Zhou","author_inst":"Ankang Center Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xibin Wang","author_inst":"Hanzhong Center Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhuanqin Ren","author_inst":"Baoji Center Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jian Yang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Hui Yang","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Tao Tu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yichao Xiao","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Mingxian Chen","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yuhu He","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xiangping Chai","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Junmei Xu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Shenghua Zhou","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.25.20110890","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 entry related genes are comparably expressed in children's lung as adults","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.25.20110890","rel_abs":"To explore whether the expression levels of viral-entry associated genes might contribute to the milder symptoms in children, we analysed the expression of these genes in both children and adults' lung tissues by single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and immunohistochemistry (IHC).

The simulation considers individuals as agents moving randomly across the habitat according to predefined urban patterns. Agents carry a simple tracing device that identifies signals emitted by other agents, recording the position and time of the encounter. The information of every device is propagated daily to an epidemic observatory based on an online graph database. Infections are simulated as stochastic processes depending on the proximity among individuals. Different epidemic control strategies are tested with and without the information of the tracing device under several scenarios. We observe that the success of the strategies strongly depends on the duration of the period of infectiousness before the presence of symptoms and the fraction of asymptomatic agents. If these values are high, strategies based on the presence of symptoms or on testing campaigns can hardly contain the epidemic. Strategies using massive confinement of the agents are able to control the epidemic at the cost of sending a large fraction of the population into quarantine. In cases with moderate and low values for these parameters, the tracing devices can provide a slightly better performance but only if a large fraction of the agents carry the device. Otherwise, the impact of these devices is found to be negligible in comparison with other strategies not using them. Finally, we provide a methodology allowing to use the information of the graph database to estimate basic parameters of the disease such as the infection probability.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pablo Martinez Ruiz del Arbol","author_inst":"Instituto de Fisica de Cantabria"},{"author_name":"Lara Lloret Iglesias","author_inst":"Instituto de Fisica de Cantabria"},{"author_name":"Chen Wen","author_inst":"Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Jue Fan","author_inst":"Singleron Biotechnologies, Yaogu Avenue 11, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China"},{"author_name":"Jing Ma","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Qiao He","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Zhiguang Zhao","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, the Second Affiliated Hospital & Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, China"},{"author_name":"Xinyu Song","author_inst":"Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China"},{"author_name":"Hao Chen","author_inst":"Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Guocheng Shi","author_inst":"Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Minzhi Yin","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Nan Fang","author_inst":"Singleron Biotechnologies, Yaogu Avenue 11, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China"},{"author_name":"Hao Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Huiwen Chen","author_inst":"Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Xi Mo","author_inst":"The Laboratory of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Pediatric Translational Medicine Institute, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University S"},{"author_name":"Yukun Liang","author_inst":"Ankang Center Hospital"},{"author_name":"Heping Zhou","author_inst":"Ankang Center Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xibin Wang","author_inst":"Hanzhong Center Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhuanqin Ren","author_inst":"Baoji Center Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jian Yang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Hui Yang","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Tao Tu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yichao Xiao","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Mingxian Chen","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yuhu He","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xiangping Chai","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Junmei Xu","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"},{"author_name":"Shenghua Zhou","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.25.20111047","rel_title":"Characteristics of Ischemic Stroke in COVID-19: A Need for Early Detection and Management","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.25.20111047","rel_abs":"Objective: In the setting of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, a potential association of this disease with stroke has been suggested. We aimed to describe the characteristics of patients who were admitted with COVID-19 and had an acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Methods: This is a case series of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients with ischemic stroke admitted to an academic health system in metropolitan Atlanta (USA) between March 24th,2020, and May 5th, 2020. Demographic, clinical, and radiographic characteristics were described. Results: Of 124 ischemic stroke patients admitted during this study period, 8 (6.5%) were also diagnosed with COVID-19. The mean age of patients was 64.3 +\/- 6.5 years, 5 (62.5%) male, mean time from last-normal was 4.8 days [SD 4.8], and none received acute reperfusion therapy. All 8 patients had at least one stroke-associated co-morbidity. The predominant pattern of ischemic stroke was embolic; 3 were explained by atrial fibrillation while 5 (62.5%) were cryptogenic. In contrast, cryptogenic strokes were seen in 20 (16.1%) of 124 total stroke admissions during this time. Conclusions: In our case series, ischemic stroke affected COVID-19 patients with traditional stroke risk factors with an age of stroke presentation typically seen in non-COVID populations. We observed a predominantly embolic pattern of stroke with a higher than expected rate of cryptogenic strokes and with a prolonged median time to presentation and symptom recognition limiting the use of acute reperfusion treatments. These results highlight the need for increased community awareness, early identification, and management of AIS in COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dinesh V.

Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were extracted from medical records and compared between patients with and without COVID-19. Results: Out of 505 consecutively patients evaluated at ED with neurological symptoms, 147 (29.1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. These patients displayed at triage higher values of CRP, AST, ALT, and fibrinogen but not lymphopenia (p<0.05).

Conclusions: COVID-19 impacts on clinical presentation of neurological disorders, with higher frequency of stroke, encephalitis and delirium, and was strongly associated with increased hospitalisation, mortality and disability.","rel_num_authors":45,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrea Pilotto","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Alberto Benussi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Ilenia Libri","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Stefano Masciocchi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Loris Poli","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Enrico Premi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Antonella Alberici","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Enrico Baldelli","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Sonia Bonacina","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Laura Brambilla","author_inst":"IRCCS Neurology Institute Besta, Milan"},{"author_name":"Matteo Benini","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Salvatore Caratozzolo","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Matteo Cortinovis","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Angelo Costa","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Stefano Cotti Piccinelli","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta Cottini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Viviana Cristillo","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Ilenia Delrio","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Filosto","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Massimo Gamba","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Stefano Gazzina","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Nicola Gilberti","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Stefano Gipponi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Marcello Giunta","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Alberto Imarisio","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Paolo Liberini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Martina Locatelli","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Francesca Schiano Di Cola","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Renata Rao","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Barbara Risi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Luca Rozzini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Andrea Scalvini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Veronica Vergani","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Irene Volonghi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Nicola Zoppi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Barbara Borroni","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Mauro Magoni","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Matilde Leonardi","author_inst":"IRCCS Neurology Institute Besta, Milan"},{"author_name":"Gainluigi Zanusso","author_inst":"University of Verona"},{"author_name":"Sergio Ferrari","author_inst":"University of Verona"},{"author_name":"Sara Mariotto","author_inst":"University of Verona"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Pezzini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Roberto Gasparotti","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Ciro Paolillo","author_inst":"Emergency Department ASST Spedali Civili of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Padovani","author_inst":"University of Brescia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"neurology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.23.20111559","rel_title":"Estimating Household Transmission of SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.23.20111559","rel_abs":"**Introduction and Goals.** SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted both in the community and within households. Social distancing and lockdowns reduce community transmission but do not directly address household transmission. We provide quantitative measures of household transmission based on empirical data, and estimate the contribution of households to overall spread. We highlight policy implications from our analysis of household transmission, and more generally, of changes in contact patterns under social distancing. **Methods. ** We investigate the household secondary attack rate (SAR) for SARS-CoV-2, as well as R_h, which is the average number of within-household infections caused by a single index case. We identify previous works that estimated the SAR. We correct these estimates based on the false-negative rate of PCR testing and the failure to test asymptomatics. Results are pooled by a hierarchical Bayesian random-effects model to provide a meta-analysis estimate of the SAR. We estimate R_h using results from population testing in Vo', Italy and contact tracing data that we curate from Singapore. The code and data behind our analysis are publicly available https:\/\/github.com\/andrewilyas\/covid-household-transmission. **Results.** We identified nine studies of the household secondary attack rate. Our modeling suggests the SAR is heterogeneous across studies. The pooled central estimate of the SAR is 30% but with a posterior 95% credible interval of (0%, 67%) reflecting this heterogeneity. This corresponds to a posterior mean for the SAR of 30% (18%,43%) and a standard deviation of 15% (9%, 27%). If results are not corrected for false negatives and asymptomatics, the pooled central estimate for the SAR is 20% (0%, 43%). From the same nine studies, we estimate R_h to be 0.47 (0.13, 0.77). Using contact tracing data from Singapore, we infer an R_h value of 0.32 (0.22,0.42). Population testing data from Vo' yields an R_h estimate of 0.37 (0.34, 0.40) after correcting for false negatives and asymptomatics. **Interpretation.** Our estimates of R_h suggest that household transmission was a small fraction (5%-35%) of R before social distancing but a large fraction after (30%-55%). This suggests that household transmission may be an effective target for interventions. A remaining uncertainty is whether household infections actually contribute to further community transmission or are contained within households. This can be estimated given high-quality contact tracing data. More broadly, our study points to emerging contact patterns (i.e., increased time at home relative to the community) playing a role in transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We briefly highlight another instance of this phenomenon (differences in contact between essential workers and the rest of the population), provide coarse estimates of its effect on transmission, and discuss how future data could enable a more reliable estimate.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mihaela Curmei","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Andrew Ilyas","author_inst":"MIT"},{"author_name":"Owain Evans","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jacob Steinhardt","author_inst":"UC Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Loris Poli","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Enrico Premi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Antonella Alberici","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Enrico Baldelli","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Sonia Bonacina","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Laura Brambilla","author_inst":"IRCCS Neurology Institute Besta, Milan"},{"author_name":"Matteo Benini","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Salvatore Caratozzolo","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Matteo Cortinovis","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Angelo Costa","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Stefano Cotti Piccinelli","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta Cottini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Viviana Cristillo","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Ilenia Delrio","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Filosto","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Massimo Gamba","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Stefano Gazzina","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Nicola Gilberti","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Stefano Gipponi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Marcello Giunta","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Alberto Imarisio","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Paolo Liberini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Martina Locatelli","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Francesca Schiano Di Cola","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Renata Rao","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Barbara Risi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Luca Rozzini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Andrea Scalvini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Veronica Vergani","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Irene Volonghi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Nicola Zoppi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Barbara Borroni","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Mauro Magoni","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Matilde Leonardi","author_inst":"IRCCS Neurology Institute Besta, Milan"},{"author_name":"Gainluigi Zanusso","author_inst":"University of Verona"},{"author_name":"Sergio Ferrari","author_inst":"University of Verona"},{"author_name":"Sara Mariotto","author_inst":"University of Verona"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Pezzini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Roberto Gasparotti","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Ciro Paolillo","author_inst":"Emergency Department ASST Spedali Civili of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Padovani","author_inst":"University of Brescia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.23.20110189","rel_title":"Explainable machine learning models to understand determinants of COVID-19 mortality in the United States","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.23.20110189","rel_abs":"COVID-19 is now one of the leading causes of mortality amongst adults in the United States for the year 2020. Multiple epidemiological models have been built, often based on limited data, to understand the spread and impact of the pandemic. However, many geographic and local factors may have played an important role in higher morbidity and mortality in certain populations. The goal of this study was to develop machine learning models to understand the relative association of socioeconomic, demographic, travel, and health care characteristics of different states across the United States and COVID-19 mortality. Using multiple public data sets, 24 variables linked to COVID-19 disease were chosen to build the models. Two independent machine learning models using CatBoost regression and random forest were developed. SHAP feature importance and a Boruta algorithm were used to elucidate the relative importance of features on COVID-19 mortality in the United States. Feature importances from both the categorical models, i.e., CatBoost and random forest consistently showed that a high population density, number of nursing homes, number of nursing home beds and foreign travel were strongest predictors of COVID-19 mortality. Percentage of African American amongst the population was also found to be of high importance in prediction of COVID-19 mortality whereas racial majority (primarily, Caucasian) was not. Both models fitted the data well with a training R2 of 0.99 and 0.88 respectively. The effect of median age,median income, climate and disease mitigation measures on COVID-19 related mortality remained unclear. COVID-19 policy making will need to take population density, pre-existing medical care and state travel policies into account. Our models identified and quantified the relative importance of each of these for mortality predictions using machine learning.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Piyush Mathur","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"Tavpritesh Sethi","author_inst":"IIIT-Delhi"},{"author_name":"Anya Mathur","author_inst":"Broadview-Brecksville Middle School"},{"author_name":"Ashish Kumar Khanna","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"Kamal Maheshwari","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"Jacek B Cywinski","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"Simran Dua","author_inst":"Lambert High School"},{"author_name":"Frank Papay","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"author_name":"Sonia Bonacina","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Laura Brambilla","author_inst":"IRCCS Neurology Institute Besta, Milan"},{"author_name":"Matteo Benini","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Salvatore Caratozzolo","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Matteo Cortinovis","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Angelo Costa","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Stefano Cotti Piccinelli","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta Cottini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Viviana Cristillo","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Ilenia Delrio","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Filosto","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Massimo Gamba","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Stefano Gazzina","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Nicola Gilberti","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Stefano Gipponi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Marcello Giunta","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Alberto Imarisio","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Paolo Liberini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Martina Locatelli","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Francesca Schiano Di Cola","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Renata Rao","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Barbara Risi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Luca Rozzini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Andrea Scalvini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Veronica Vergani","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Irene Volonghi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Nicola Zoppi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Barbara Borroni","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Mauro Magoni","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Matilde Leonardi","author_inst":"IRCCS Neurology Institute Besta, Milan"},{"author_name":"Gainluigi Zanusso","author_inst":"University of Verona"},{"author_name":"Sergio Ferrari","author_inst":"University of Verona"},{"author_name":"Sara Mariotto","author_inst":"University of Verona"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Pezzini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Roberto Gasparotti","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Ciro Paolillo","author_inst":"Emergency Department ASST Spedali Civili of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Padovani","author_inst":"University of Brescia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.24.20111872","rel_title":"Predicting COVID-19 Pandemic in Saudi Arabia Using Modified Singular Spectrum Analysis","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.24.20111872","rel_abs":"This research presents a modified Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) approach for the analysis of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia.

Design, Setting, and Participants Nationwide population-based cohort of all 228.677 consecutive Danish individuals tested (positive or negative) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA from the identification of the first COVID-19 case on February 27th, 2020 until April 30th, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures We examined characteristics and predictors of inpatient hospitalization versus community-management, and death versus survival, adjusted for age-, sex- and number of comorbidities. Results We identified 9,519 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive cases of whom 78% were community-managed, 22% were hospitalized (3.2% at an intensive care unit) and 5.5% had died within 30 days. Median age varied from 45 years (interquartile range (IQR) 31-57) among community-managed cases to 82 years (IQR 75-89) among those who died. Age was a strong predictor of fatal disease (odds ratio (OR) 14 for 70-79-year old, OR 26 for 80-89-year old, and OR 82 for cases older than 90 years, when compared to 50-59-year old and adjusted for sex and number of comorbidities). Similarly, the number of comorbidities was strongly associated with fatal disease (OR 5.2, for cases with [&ge;]4 comorbidities versus no comorbidities), and 82% of fatal cases had at least 2 comorbidities. A wide range of major chronic diseases were associated with hospitalization with ORs ranging from 1.3-1.4 (e.g. stroke, ischemic heart disease) to 2.2-2.7 (e.g. heart failure, hospital-diagnosed kidney disease, chronic liver disease). Similarly, chronic diseases were associated with mortality with ORs ranging from 1.2-1.3 (e.g. ischemic heart disease, hypertension) to 2.4-2.7 (e.g. major psychiatric disorder, organ transplantation). In the absence of comorbidities, mortality was relatively low (5% or less) in persons aged up to 80 years. Conclusions and Relevance In this first nationwide population-based study, increasing age and number of comorbidities were strongly associated with hospitalization requirement and death in COVID-19. In the absence of comorbidities, the mortality was, however, lowest until the age of 80 years. These results may help in accurate identification, triage and protection of high-risk groups in general populations, i.e. when reopening societies.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mette Reilev","author_inst":"University of Southern Denmark"},{"author_name":"Kasper Bruun Kristensen","author_inst":"University of Southern Denmark"},{"author_name":"Anton Pottegaard","author_inst":"University of Southern Denmark"},{"author_name":"Lars Christian Lund","author_inst":"University of Southern Denmark"},{"author_name":"Jesper Hallas","author_inst":"University of Southern Denmark"},{"author_name":"Martin Thomsen Ernst","author_inst":"University of Southern Denmark"},{"author_name":"Christian Fynbo Christiansen","author_inst":"Aarhus University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Henrik Toft Soerensen","author_inst":"Aarhus University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nanna Borup Johansen","author_inst":"Danish Medicines Agency"},{"author_name":"Nikolai Constantin Brun","author_inst":"Danish Medicines Agency"},{"author_name":"Marianne Voldstedlund","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Henrik Stoevring","author_inst":"Aarhus University"},{"author_name":"Marianne Kragh Thomsen","author_inst":"Aarhus University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Steffen Christensen","author_inst":"Aarhus University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sophie Gubbels","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Tyra Grove Krause","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Kaare Moelbak","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Reimar Wernich Thomsen","author_inst":"Aarhus University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Filosto","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Massimo Gamba","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Stefano Gazzina","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Nicola Gilberti","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Stefano Gipponi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Marcello Giunta","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Alberto Imarisio","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Paolo Liberini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Martina Locatelli","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Francesca Schiano Di Cola","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Renata Rao","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Barbara Risi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Luca Rozzini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Andrea Scalvini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Veronica Vergani","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Irene Volonghi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Nicola Zoppi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Barbara Borroni","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Mauro Magoni","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Matilde Leonardi","author_inst":"IRCCS Neurology Institute Besta, Milan"},{"author_name":"Gainluigi Zanusso","author_inst":"University of Verona"},{"author_name":"Sergio Ferrari","author_inst":"University of Verona"},{"author_name":"Sara Mariotto","author_inst":"University of Verona"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Pezzini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Roberto Gasparotti","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Ciro Paolillo","author_inst":"Emergency Department ASST Spedali Civili of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Padovani","author_inst":"University of Brescia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.25.20110338","rel_title":"Spurious Correlation?

Including this control in a regression model, we find that vitamin D levels are not a statistically significant predictor of Covid-19 infections or mortality. Life expectancy, on the other hand, was found to be statistically significant predictor of infections and mortality at country level.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vivek Kumar","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Management Kashipur"},{"author_name":"Arpita Srivastava","author_inst":"XLRI Jamshedpur"},{"author_name":"Anton Pottegaard","author_inst":"University of Southern Denmark"},{"author_name":"Lars Christian Lund","author_inst":"University of Southern Denmark"},{"author_name":"Jesper Hallas","author_inst":"University of Southern Denmark"},{"author_name":"Martin Thomsen Ernst","author_inst":"University of Southern Denmark"},{"author_name":"Christian Fynbo Christiansen","author_inst":"Aarhus University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Henrik Toft Soerensen","author_inst":"Aarhus University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Nanna Borup Johansen","author_inst":"Danish Medicines Agency"},{"author_name":"Nikolai Constantin Brun","author_inst":"Danish Medicines Agency"},{"author_name":"Marianne Voldstedlund","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Henrik Stoevring","author_inst":"Aarhus University"},{"author_name":"Marianne Kragh Thomsen","author_inst":"Aarhus University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Steffen Christensen","author_inst":"Aarhus University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sophie Gubbels","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Tyra Grove Krause","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Kaare Moelbak","author_inst":"Statens Serum Institut"},{"author_name":"Reimar Wernich Thomsen","author_inst":"Aarhus University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Filosto","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Massimo Gamba","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Stefano Gazzina","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Nicola Gilberti","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Stefano Gipponi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Marcello Giunta","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Alberto Imarisio","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Paolo Liberini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Martina Locatelli","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Francesca Schiano Di Cola","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Renata Rao","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Barbara Risi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Luca Rozzini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Andrea Scalvini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Veronica Vergani","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Irene Volonghi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Nicola Zoppi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Barbara Borroni","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Mauro Magoni","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Matilde Leonardi","author_inst":"IRCCS Neurology Institute Besta, Milan"},{"author_name":"Gainluigi Zanusso","author_inst":"University of Verona"},{"author_name":"Sergio Ferrari","author_inst":"University of Verona"},{"author_name":"Sara Mariotto","author_inst":"University of Verona"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Pezzini","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Roberto Gasparotti","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Ciro Paolillo","author_inst":"Emergency Department ASST Spedali Civili of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Padovani","author_inst":"University of Brescia"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.24.20111807","rel_title":"1-C Nonlinear Covid-19 Epidemic Model and Application to the Epidemic Prediction in France","rel_date":"2020-05-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.24.20111807","rel_abs":"We have shown in a previous paper that the standard time-invariant SIR model was not effective to predict the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic propagation.

Spain has been one of the countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective. To create a registry of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in Spain in order to improve our knowledge of the clinical, diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic aspects of this disease. Methods. A multicentre retrospective cohort study, including consecutive patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 throughout Spain. Epidemiological and clinical data, additional tests at admission and at seven days, treatments administered, and progress at 30 days of hospitalization were collected from electronic medical records. Results. Up to April 30th 2020, 6,424 patients from 109 hospitals were included. Their median age was 69.1 years (range: 18-102 years) and 56.9% were male. Prevalences of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus were 50.2%, 39.7%, and 18.7%, respectively. The most frequent symptoms were fever (86.2%) and cough (76.5%). High values of ferritin (72.4%), lactate dehydrogenase (70.2%), and D-dimer (61.5%), as well as lymphopenia (52.6%), were frequent. The most used antiviral drugs were hydroxychloroquine (85.7%) and lopinavir\/ritonavir (62.4%). 31.5% developed respiratory distress. Overall mortality rate was 21.1%, with a marked increase with age (50-59 years: 4.2%, 60-69 years: 9.1%, 70-79 years: 21.4%, 80-89 years: 42.5%, [&ge;] 90 years: 51.1%). Conclusions. The SEMI-COVID-19 Network provides data on the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in Spain. Patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in Spain are mostly severe cases, as one in three patients developed respiratory distress and one in five patients died. These findings confirm a close relationship between advanced age and mortality.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jos\u00e9 Manuel Casas Rojo","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Infanta Cristina University Hospital, Parla (Madrid), Spain"},{"author_name":"Juan Miguel Ant\u00f3n Santos","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Infanta Cristina University Hospital, Parla (Madrid), Spain"},{"author_name":"Jes\u00fas Mill\u00e1n N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Cort\u00e9s","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n University Hospital, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Carlos Lumbreras Bermejo","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, 12 de Octubre University Hospital, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Jos\u00e9 Manuel Ramos Rinc\u00f3n","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, General University Hospital of Alicante, Alicante Institute for Health and Biomedical Research (ISABIAL), Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez de Elch"},{"author_name":"Emilia Roy-Vallejo","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, La Princesa University Hospital, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Arturo Artero Mora","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department.

Precise knowledge of population immunity could allow government bodies to make informed decisions about how and when to relax stay-at-home directives and to reopen the economy. We hypothesized that salivary antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 could serve as a non-invasive alternative to serological testing for widespread monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infection throughout the population. We developed a multiplex SARS-CoV-2 antibody immunoassay based on Luminex technology and tested 167 saliva and 324 serum samples, including 134 and 118 negative saliva and serum samples, respectively, collected before the COVID-19 pandemic, and 33 saliva and 206 serum samples from participants with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We evaluated the correlation of results obtained in saliva vs. serum and determined the sensitivity and specificity for each diagnostic media, stratified by antibody isotype, for detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on COVID-19 case designation for all specimens. Matched serum and saliva SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific IgG responses were significantly correlated. Within the 10-plex SARS-CoV-2 panel, the salivary anti-nucleocapsid (N) protein IgG response resulted in the highest sensitivity for detecting prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (100% sensitivity at [&ge;]10 days post-SARS-CoV-2 symptom onset). The salivary anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG response resulted in 100% specificity. Among individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed with RT-PCR, the temporal kinetics of IgG, IgA, and IgM in saliva were consistent with those observed in serum. SARS-CoV-2 appears to trigger a humoral immune response resulting in the almost simultaneous rise of IgG, IgM and IgA levels both in serum and in saliva, mirroring responses consistent with the stimulation of existing, cross-reactive B cells. SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing in saliva can play a critically important role in large-scale 'sero'-surveillance to address key public health priorities and guide policy and decision-making for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pranay R Randad","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Nora Pisanic","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Kate Kruczynski","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Yukari C Manabe","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David Thomas","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andrew Pekosz","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public  Health"},{"author_name":"Sabra Klein","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Michael J Betenbaugh","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"William A Clarke","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Oliver Laeyendecker","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Patrizio P Caturegli","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"H Benjamin Larman","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Barbara Detrick","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jessica K Fairley","author_inst":"Hubert Department of Global Health, Emory University Rollins School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Amy C Sherman","author_inst":"The Hope Clinic of the Emory Vaccine Center, Emory University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nadine Rouphael","author_inst":"The Hope Clinic of the Emory Vaccine Center, Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Srilatha Edupuganti","author_inst":"The Hope Clinic of the Emory Vaccine Center, Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Douglas A Granger","author_inst":"Institute for Interdisciplinary Salivary Bioscience Research, University of California Irvine"},{"author_name":"Steve W Granger","author_inst":"Salimetrics, LLC"},{"author_name":"Matthew Collins","author_inst":"The Hope Clinic of the Emory Vaccine Center, Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher D Heaney","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Elisa Rabad\u00e1n Pejenaute","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department.

This study aimed to detect risk factors for mortality in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Our cohort were all consecutive adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 at a secondary hospital in Madrid, March 3-16, 2020. Clinical and laboratory data came from electronic clinical records and were compared between survivors and non-survivors, with outcomes followed up until April 4. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods allowed us to explore risk factors associated with in-hospital death. FINDINGS: The cohort comprised 562 patients with COVID-19. Clinical records were available for evaluation for 392 patients attended at the emergency department of our hospital, of whom 199 were discharged, 85 remained hospitalized and 108 died during hospitalization. Among 311 of the hospitalized patients, 34.7% died. Of the 392 patients with records, the median age was 71.5 years (50.6-80.7); 52.6% were men. 252 (64.3%) patients had a comorbidity, hypertension being the most common: 175 (44.6%), followed by other cardiovascular disease: 102 (26.0%) and diabetes: 97 (24.7%). Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with age over 65 (odds ratio 8.32, 95% CI 3.01-22.96; p<0.001), coronary heart disease (2.76, 1.44-5.30; 0.002), and both lower lymphocyte count (0.34, 0.17-0.68; 0.002) and higher LDH (1.25, 1.05-1.50; 0.012) per 1-unit increase and per 100 units respectively. INTERPRETATION: COVID-19 was associated in our hospital at the peak of the pandemic with a crude mortality ratio of 19.2% and a mortality ratio of 34.7% in admitted patients, considerably above most of the ratios described in the Chinese series. These results leave open the question as to which factors, epidemiological or intrinsically viral, apart from age and comorbidities, can explain this difference in excess mortality.
