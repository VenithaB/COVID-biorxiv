Design Cross-sectional Setting Multicenter Participants A total of 52 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and their initial CT images were enrolled from 5 designated hospitals in Ankang, Lishui, Zhenjiang, Lanzhou, and Linxia between January 23, 2020 and February 8, 2020. As of February 20, patients remained in hospital or with non-findings in CT were excluded. Therefore, 31 patients with 72 lesion segments were included in the final analysis. Intervention CT radiomics models based on logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) were developed on features extracted from pneumonia lesions in training and inter-validation datasets. The predictive performance was further evaluated in test dataset on lung lobe- and patients-level. Main outcomes Short-term hospital stay ([&le;]10 days) and long-term hospital stay (>10 days). Results The CT radiomics models based on 6 second-order features were effective in discriminating short- and long-term hospital stay in patients with pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, with areas under the curves of 0.97 (95%CI 0.83-1.0) and 0.92 (95%CI 0.67-1.0) by LR and RF, respectively, in the test dataset. The LR model showed a sensitivity and specificity of 1.0 and 0.89, and the RF model showed similar performance with sensitivity and specificity of 0.75 and 1.0 in test dataset. Conclusions The machine learning-based CT radiomics models showed feasibility and accuracy for predicting hospital stay in patients with pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaolong Qi","author_inst":"CHESS-COVID-19 center, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Zicheng Jiang","author_inst":"CHESS-COVID-19 center, Ankang Central Hospital, Ankang, China"},{"author_name":"QIAN YU","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Molecular and Functional Imaging, Zhongda Hospital, Medical School, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"},{"author_name":"Chuxiao Shao","author_inst":"CHESS-COVID-19 center, Zhejiang University Lishui Hospital & Lishui Central Hospital, Lishui, China"},{"author_name":"Hongguang Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Critical Care Medicine, The Affiliated Third Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China"},{"author_name":"Hongmei Yue","author_inst":"CHESS-COVID-19 center, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Baoyi Ma","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, The People Hospital of LinXia Hui Prefecture, Linxia, China"},{"author_name":"Yuancheng Wang","author_inst":"3.\tDepartment of Radiology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Molecular and Functional Imaging, Zhongda Hospital, Medical School, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"},{"author_name":"Chuan Liu","author_inst":"CHESS-COVID-19 center, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Xiangpan Meng","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Molecular and Functional Imaging, Zhongda Hospital, Medical School, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"},{"author_name":"Shan Huang","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Molecular and Functional Imaging, Zhongda Hospital, Medical School, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"},{"author_name":"Jitao Wang","author_inst":"CHESS-COVID-19 center, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Dan Xu","author_inst":"CHESS-COVID-19 center, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Junqiang Lei","author_inst":"CHESS-COVID-19 center, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Guanghang Xie","author_inst":"CHESS-COVID-19 center, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Huihong Huang","author_inst":"CHESS-COVID-19 center, Ankang Central Hospital, Ankang, China"},{"author_name":"Jie Yang","author_inst":"CHESS-COVID-19 center, Zhejiang University Lishui Hospital & Lishui Central Hospital, Lishui, China"},{"author_name":"Jiansong Ji","author_inst":"CHESS-COVID-19 center, Zhejiang University Lishui Hospital & Lishui Central Hospital, Lishui, China"},{"author_name":"Hongqiu Pan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Critical Care Medicine, The Affiliated Third Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China"},{"author_name":"Shengqiang Zou","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Critical Care Medicine, The Affiliated Third Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China"},{"author_name":"Shenghong Ju","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Molecular and Functional Imaging, Zhongda Hospital, Medical School, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.29.20029520","rel_title":"Detectable serum SARS-CoV-2 viral load (RNAaemia) is closely associated with drastically elevated interleukin 6 (IL-6) level in critically ill COVID-19 patients","rel_date":"2020-03-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.29.20029520","rel_abs":"Background: Although the SARS-CoV-2 viral load detection of respiratory specimen has been widely used for novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) diagnosis, it is undeniable that serum SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid (RNAaemia) could be detected in a fraction of the COVID-19 patients. However, it is not clear that if the incidence of RNAaemia could be correlated with the occurrence of cytokine storm or with the specific class of patients. Methods: This study enrolled 48 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the General Hospital of Central Theater Command, PLA, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China. The patients were divided into three groups according to the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (version 6) published by the National Health Commission of China. The clinical and laboratory data were collected. The serum viral load detection and serum IL-6 levels were determined. Except for routine statistical analysis, Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) analysis was used to establish a patient status prediction model based on real-time RT-PCR Ct value. Findings: The Result showed that cases with RNAaemia were exclusively confirmed in critically ill patients group and appeared to reflect the illness severity. Further more, the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 levels were significantly elevated in critically ill patients, which is almost 10-folds higher than those in other patients. More importantly, the extremely high IL-6 level was closely correlated with the incidence of RNAaemia (R=0.902) and the vital signs of COVID-19 patients (R= -0.682). Interpretation: Serum SARS-CoV-2 viral load (RNAaemia) is strongly associated with cytokine storm and can be used to predict the poor prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, our results strongly suggest that cytokine IL-6 should be considered as a therapeutic target in critically ill patients with excessive inflammatory response.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaohua Chen","author_inst":"General Hospital of Central Theater Command, PLA"},{"author_name":"Binghong Zhao","author_inst":"General Hospital of Central Theater Command, PLA"},{"author_name":"Yueming Qu","author_inst":"Huazhong Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Yurou Chen","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Jie Xiong","author_inst":"Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yong Feng","author_inst":"Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Dong Men","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy  of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Qianchuan Huang","author_inst":"General Hospital of Central Theater Command, PLA"},{"author_name":"Ying Liu","author_inst":"General Hospital of Central Theater Command, PLA"},{"author_name":"Bo Yang","author_inst":"General Hospital of Central Theater Command, PLA"},{"author_name":"Jinya Ding","author_inst":"General Hospital of Central Theater Command, PLA"},{"author_name":"Feng Li","author_inst":"Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Dan Xu","author_inst":"CHESS-COVID-19 center, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Junqiang Lei","author_inst":"CHESS-COVID-19 center, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Guanghang Xie","author_inst":"CHESS-COVID-19 center, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Huihong Huang","author_inst":"CHESS-COVID-19 center, Ankang Central Hospital, Ankang, China"},{"author_name":"Jie Yang","author_inst":"CHESS-COVID-19 center, Zhejiang University Lishui Hospital & Lishui Central Hospital, Lishui, China"},{"author_name":"Jiansong Ji","author_inst":"CHESS-COVID-19 center, Zhejiang University Lishui Hospital & Lishui Central Hospital, Lishui, China"},{"author_name":"Hongqiu Pan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Critical Care Medicine, The Affiliated Third Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China"},{"author_name":"Shengqiang Zou","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Critical Care Medicine, The Affiliated Third Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China"},{"author_name":"Shenghong Ju","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Molecular and Functional Imaging, Zhongda Hospital, Medical School, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.02.20030189","rel_title":"Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in patients of novel coronavirus disease 2019","rel_date":"2020-03-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.02.20030189","rel_abs":"Summary Background The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emerging virus. The antibody response in infected patient remains largely unknown, and the clinical values of antibody testing have not been fully demonstrated. Methods A total of 173 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. Their serial plasma samples (n = 535) collected during the hospitalization period were tested for total antibodies (Ab), IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 using immunoassays. The dynamics of antibodies with the progress and severity of disease was analyzed. Findings Among 173 patients, the seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG was 93.1% (161\/173), 82.7% (143\/173) and 64.7% (112\/173), respectively. Twelve patients who had not seroconverted were those only blood samples at the early stage of illness were collected. The seroconversion sequentially appeared for Ab, IgM and then IgG, with a median time of 11, 12 and 14 days, respectively. The presence of antibodies was < 40% among patients in the first 7 days of illness, and then rapidly increased to 100.0%, 94.3% and 79.8% for Ab, IgM and IgG respectively since day 15 after onset. In contrast, the positive rate of RNA decreased from 66.7% (58\/87) in samples collected before day 7 to 45.5% (25\/55) during days 15 to 39. Combining RNA and antibody detections significantly improved the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for COVID-19 patients (p < 0.001), even in early phase of 1-week since onset (p = 0.007). Moreover, a higher titer of Ab was independently associated with a worse clinical classification (p = 0.006). Interpretation The antibody detection offers vital clinical information during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The findings provide strong empirical support for the routine application of serological testing in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Juanjuan Zhao Jr.","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Quan Yuan","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Haiyan Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital,"},{"author_name":"Wei Liu","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Xuejiao Liao","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yingying Su","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Xin Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jing Yuan","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tingdong Li","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jinxiu Li","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shen Qian","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Congming Hong","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Fuxiang Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yingxia Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhaoqin Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qing He","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhiyong Li","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Bin He","author_inst":"School of Public Health & School of Life Science, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Tianying Zhang","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Shengxiang Ge","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Zhang","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Ningshao Xia","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital,"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.29.20027698","rel_title":"Precautions are Needed for COVID-19 Patients with Coinfection of Common Respiratory Pathogens","rel_date":"2020-03-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.29.20027698","rel_abs":"Background: With the ongoing outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), infected patients within and beyond the epidemic area, Wuhan, China, showed different epidemiological and clinical characteristics. There is a paucity of data concerning coinfection with other common respiratory pathogens in COVID-19 patients outside of Wuhan. Methods: We conducted a double-centre study recruiting 68 patients with severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection confirmed by nucleic acid testing in Qingdao and Wuhan from January 17 to February 16, 2020. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed to detect the specific IgM antibody against common respiratory pathogens in collected acute phase serum. Results: Of the 68 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 30 (44.12%) were from Qingdao. The median age of Qingdao and Wuhan patients were 50 (IQR: 37-59) and 31 (IQR: 28-38) years, respectively, and the majority of patients were female in Qingdao (60.00%) and Wuhan (55.26%). Among COVID-19 patients in Qingdao, 24 (80.00%) of them had IgM antibodies against at least one respiratory pathogen, whereas only one (2.63%) of the patients in Wuhan had positive results for serum IgM antibody detection (P<0.0001). The most common respiratory pathogens detected in Qingdao COVID-19 patients were influenza virus A (60.00%) and influenza virus B (53.33%), followed by mycoplasma pneumoniae (23.33%) and legionella pneumophila (20.00%). While the pattern for coinfection in patients with community-acquired pneumonia in Qingdao was quite different, with a positive rate of only 20.90%. Interpretation: We reported a large proportion of COVID-19 patients with coinfection of seasonal respiratory pathogens in Qingdao, northeast China, which differed greatly from the patients in Wuhan, central China. Precautions are needed when dealing with COVID-19 patients beyond the epidemic centre who have coinfection with other respiratory pathogens. We highly recommend adding SARS-CoV-2 to routine diagnostic testing in capable hospitals to prevent misdetection of the virus.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Quansheng Xing","author_inst":"Qingdao Women and Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guoju Li","author_inst":"Qingdao Women and Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuhan Xing","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Ting Chen","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Wenjie Li","author_inst":"Qingdao Women and Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wei Ni","author_inst":"Qingdao Women and Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kai Deng","author_inst":"Qingdao Chest Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ruqin Gao","author_inst":"Qingdao Municipal Centre of Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Changzheng Chen","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yang Gao","author_inst":"Qingdao Women and Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qiang Li","author_inst":"Qingdao Women and Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guiling Yu","author_inst":"Qingdao Women and Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jianning Tong","author_inst":"Qingdao Women and Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wei Li","author_inst":"Qingdao Women and Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guiliang Hao","author_inst":"Qingdao Women and Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yue Sun","author_inst":"Qingdao Women and Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ai Zhang","author_inst":"Qingdao Women and Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qin Wu","author_inst":"Qingdao Women and Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zipu Li","author_inst":"Qingdao Women and Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Silin Pan","author_inst":"Qingdao Women and Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Zhang","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Ningshao Xia","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital,"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.28.20028068","rel_title":"Epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 patients with and without pneumonia in Beijing, China","rel_date":"2020-03-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.28.20028068","rel_abs":"Background:SARS-CoV-2-caused coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is posinga large casualty. The features of COVID-19patients withand without pneumonia,SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility in asymptomatic carriers, and factors predicting disease progression remain unknown. Methods: We collected information on clinical characteristics, exposure history, andlaboratory examinations of all laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to PLA General Hospital. Cox regression analysis was applied to identify prognostic factors. The last follow-up was February 18, 2020. Results:We characterized 55 consecutive COVID-19 patients. The mean incubation was 8.42(95% confidence interval [CI], 6.55-10.29) days. The mean SARS-CoV-2-positive duration from first positive test to clearance was 9.71(95%CI, 8.21-11.22) days. COVID-19 course was approximately 2 weeks. Asymptomatic carriers might transmit SARS-CoV-2. Compared with patients without pneumonia, those with pneumonia were 15 years older and had a higher rate of hypertension, higher frequencies of having a fever and cough, and higher levels of interleukin-6 (14.61 vs. 8.06pg\/mL, P=0.040), B lymphocyte proportion (13.0% vs.10.0%, P=0.024), low account (<190\/L) of CD8+ T cells (33.3% vs. 0, P=0.019). Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that circulating interleukin-6 andlactate independently predicted COVID-19 progression, with a hazard ratio (95%CI) of 1.052 (1.000-1.107) and 1.082 (1.013-1.155), respectively. During disease course,T lymphocytes were generally lower,neutrophils higher, in pneumonia patients than in pneumonia-free patients. CD8+ lymphocytes did not increase at the 20th days after illness onset. Conclusion: The epidemiological features areimportant for COVID-19 prophylaxis. Circulating interleukin-6 and lactateare independent prognostic factors. CD8+ T cell exhaustion might be critical in the development of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Penghui Yang","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yibo Ding","author_inst":"Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhe Xu","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rui Pu","author_inst":"Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ping Li","author_inst":"Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jin Yan","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jiluo Liu","author_inst":"Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fanping Meng","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Huang","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Shi","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tianjun Jiang","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Enqiang Qin","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Min Zhao","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dawei Zhang","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Peng Zhao","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lingxiang Yu","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhaohai Wang","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhixian Hong","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhaohui Xiao","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qing Xi","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dexi Zhao","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Peng Yu","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Caizhong Zhu","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhu Chen","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shaogeng Zhang","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Junsheng Ji","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guangwen Cao","author_inst":"Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fusheng Wang","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.02.20027599","rel_title":"Effects of weather-related social distancing on city-scale transmission of respiratory viruses","rel_date":"2020-03-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.02.20027599","rel_abs":"BACKGROUND: Unusually high snowfall in western Washington State in February 2019 led to widespread school and workplace closures.

Transmission models were fit to each virus, with disruption of contact rates and care-seeking informed by data on local traffic volumes and hospital admissions. RESULTS: Disruption in contact patterns reduced effective contact rates during the intervention period by 16% to 95%, and cumulative disease incidence through the remainder of the season by 3% to 9%. Incidence reductions were greatest for viruses that were peaking when the disruption occurred and least for viruses in early epidemic phase. CONCLUSION: High-intensity, short-duration social distancing measures may substantially reduce total incidence in a respiratory virus epidemic if implemented near the epidemic peak.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael L Jackson","author_inst":"Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Gregory R Hart","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling, Bellevue WA"},{"author_name":"Denise J McCulloch","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Amanda Adler","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Brandstetter","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Kairsten Fay","author_inst":"Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Peter Han","author_inst":"Brotman Baty Institute for Precision Medicine, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Lacombe","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Jover Lee","author_inst":"Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Thomas Sibley","author_inst":"Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Deborah A Nickerson","author_inst":"Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Mark Rieder","author_inst":"Brotman Baty Institute for Precision Medicine, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Lea Starita","author_inst":"Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Janet A Englund","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Trevor Bedford","author_inst":"Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Helen Chu","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Michael Famulare","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"the Seattle Flu Study Investigators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Zhaohui Xiao","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qing Xi","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dexi Zhao","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Peng Yu","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Caizhong Zhu","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhu Chen","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shaogeng Zhang","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Junsheng Ji","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guangwen Cao","author_inst":"Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fusheng Wang","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.28.20029272","rel_title":"Closed environments facilitate secondary transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)","rel_date":"2020-03-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.28.20029272","rel_abs":"Objective: To identify common features of cases with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) so as to better understand what factors promote secondary transmission including superspreading events. Methods: A total of 110 cases were examined among eleven clusters and sporadic cases, and investigated who acquired infection from whom. The clusters included four in Tokyo and one each in Aichi, Fukuoka, Hokkaido, Ishikawa, Kanagawa and Wakayama prefectures. The number of secondary cases generated by each primary case was calculated using contact tracing data. Results: Of the 110 cases examined, 27 (24.6%) were primary cases who generated secondary cases. The odds that a primary case transmitted COVID-19 in a closed environment was 18.7 times greater compared to an open-air environment (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.0, 57.9). Conclusions: It is plausible that closed environments contribute to secondary transmission of COVID-19 and promote superspreading events. Our findings are also consistent with the declining incidence of COVID-19 cases in China, as gathering in closed environments was prohibited in the wake of the rapid spread of the disease.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hiroshi Nishiura","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Hitoshi Oshitani","author_inst":"Tohoku University"},{"author_name":"Tetsuro Kobayashi","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Tomoya Saito","author_inst":"National Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Tomimasa Sunagawa","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Tamano Matsui","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Takaji Wakita","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"MHLW COVID-19 Response Team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Motoi Suzuki","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Thomas Sibley","author_inst":"Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Deborah A Nickerson","author_inst":"Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Mark Rieder","author_inst":"Brotman Baty Institute for Precision Medicine, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Lea Starita","author_inst":"Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Janet A Englund","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Trevor Bedford","author_inst":"Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Helen Chu","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Michael Famulare","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"the Seattle Flu Study Investigators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Zhaohui Xiao","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qing Xi","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dexi Zhao","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Peng Yu","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Caizhong Zhu","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhu Chen","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shaogeng Zhang","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Junsheng Ji","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guangwen Cao","author_inst":"Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fusheng Wang","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.02.20030064","rel_title":"Forecasting the Cumulative Number of COVID-19 Deaths in China: Can More Lives Be Saved?","rel_date":"2020-03-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.02.20030064","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 outbreak is on-going in China.

Shenzhen ranked the top cities outside Wuhan with reported 416 confirmed cases by February 20, 2020. Here, we analyzed the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Shenzhen and potential link to the preventive strategies for the whole city and inside hospitals. Based on the daily new cases, the epidemic of COVID-19 in Shenzhen can be classified into three phases: the slow increase phase from January 19 to January 28, the rapid increase and plateau phase from January 29 to February 5 and the decline phase since February 6. In the three phases, the number of patients from Hubei decreased, and the number of familial clustering cases increased. The newly diagnosed COVID-19 cases reached its peak around January 31, which was 7 days after the peak date of cases arrival at Shenzhen. A series of early preventive strategies were implemented since January 19, which included detection of body temperature at all entrances of main traffic and buildings, outpatients service specially for patients with fever in all main hospitals in Shenzhen. All the patients with fever were screened with nasal or throat swab PCR detection of coronavirus 2019, Chest CT and blood lymphocyte counting in order to find out early case of COVID-19. Observation wards were established in every main hospital and a designated hospital was responsible for admission and medical care of all confirmed cases. Protection procedure was established for all medical staff involved in the screening and care of suspected and confirmed cases. 14 days isolated observation of all subjects arrived at Shenzhen from Hubei was implemented in February 2. After the implementation of all these strategies and measures, the COVID-19 cases started to decline since February 6. There were almost no community transmission and nosocomial infection occurred in Shenzhen. In conclusion, in situation of major outbreak of respiratory infectious disease, such as COVID-19, in nearby province of Hubei, Shenzhen, a high population density, high proportion of external population and high mobility city, has to face the imported cases and risk of spreading the outbreak into Shenzhen city. The implementation of early preventive strategies and measures in Shenzhen were successful in early identification of COVID-19 cases and prevented major outbreak occurred in Shenzhen. Early identification of imported cases, prevention of family clustering transmission, preventive measures in the public area and very strict infection control procedure in hospital setting are crucial for the successful control of outbreak in Shenzhen.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kai Yang","author_inst":"Jinan university"},{"author_name":"Lingwei Wang","author_inst":"Jinan University"},{"author_name":"Furong Li","author_inst":"Jinan university"},{"author_name":"Dandan Chen","author_inst":"Jinan university"},{"author_name":"Xi Li","author_inst":"Jinan university"},{"author_name":"Chen Qiu","author_inst":"Jinan university"},{"author_name":"Rongchang Chen","author_inst":"Jinan University"},{"author_name":"MHLW COVID-19 Response Team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Motoi Suzuki","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Thomas Sibley","author_inst":"Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Deborah A Nickerson","author_inst":"Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Mark Rieder","author_inst":"Brotman Baty Institute for Precision Medicine, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Lea Starita","author_inst":"Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Janet A Englund","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Trevor Bedford","author_inst":"Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Helen Chu","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Michael Famulare","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"the Seattle Flu Study Investigators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Zhaohui Xiao","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qing Xi","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dexi Zhao","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Peng Yu","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Caizhong Zhu","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhu Chen","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shaogeng Zhang","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Junsheng Ji","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guangwen Cao","author_inst":"Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fusheng Wang","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.01.20029397","rel_title":"Epidemiological and clinical features of 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease cases in Chongqing municipality, China: a retrospective, descriptive, multiple-center study","rel_date":"2020-03-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.01.20029397","rel_abs":"BackgroundIn January 19, 2020, first case of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia (COVID-19) was confirmed in Chongqing municipality, China. MethodsIn this retrospective, descriptive, multiple-center study, total of 267 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by real-time RT-PCR in Chongqing from Jan 19 to Feb 16, 2020 were recruited. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, radiological characteristics, laboratory examinations, and treatment regimens were collected on admission. Clinical outcomes were followed up until Feb 16, 2020. Results267 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to 3 designated-hospitals in Chongqing provincial municipality from January 19 to February 16, 2020 were enrolled and categorized on admission. 217 (81.27%) and 50 (18.73%) patients were categorized into non-severe and severe subgroups, respectively. The median age of patients was 48.0 years (IQR, 35.0-65.0), with 129 (48.3%) of the patients were more than 50 years of age. 149 (55.8%) patients were men. Severe patients were significantly older (median age, 71.5 years [IQR, 65.8-77.0] vs 43.0 years [IQR, 32.5-57.0]) and more likely to be male (110 [50.7%] vs 39 [78.0%]) and have coexisting disorders (15 [30.0%] vs 26 [12.0%]). 41 (15.4%) patients had a recent travel to Hubei province, and 139 (52.1%) patients had a history of contact with patients from Hubei. On admission, the most common symptoms of COVID-19 were fever 225(84.3%), fatigue (208 [77.9%]), dry cough (189 [70.8%]), myalgia or arthralgia (136 [50.9%]). Severe patients were more likely to present dyspnea (17 [34.0%] vs 26 [12.0%]) and confusion (10 [20.0%] vs 15 [6.9%]). Rales (32 [12.0%]) and wheezes (20 [7.5%]) are not common noted for COVID-19 patients, especially for the non-severe (11 [5.1%], 10 [4.6%]). 118 (44.2%). Most severe patients demonstrated more laboratory abnormalities. 231 (86.5%), 61 (22.8%) patients had lymphopenia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, respectively. CD4+T cell counts decrease was observed in 77.1 % of cases, especially in the severe patients (45, 100%). 53.1% patients had decreased CD+3 T cell counts, count of CD8+T cells was lower than the normal range in part of patients (34.4%). More severe patients had lower level of CD4+ T cells and CD+3 T cells (45 [100.0%] vs 29[56.9%], 31 [68.9%] vs 20 [39.2%]). Most patients had normal level of IL-2, IL-4, TNF- and INF-{gamma}, while high level of IL-6 and IL-17A was common in COVID-19 patients (47 [70.1%], 35 [52.2%]). Level of IL-6, IL-17A and TNF- was remarkably elevated in severe patients (32 [84.2%] vs 15 [51.7%], 25 [65.8%] vs 10 [34.5%], 17 [44.7%] vs 5 [17.2%]). All patients received antiviral therapy (267, 100%). A portion of severe patients (38, 76.0%) received systemic corticosteroid therapy. Invasive mechanical ventilation in prone position, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy was adopted only in severe patients with respiratory failure (5[10.0%], 35[70.0%], 12[24.0%]). Traditional Chinese medicine was adopted to most of severe patients (43,86.0%). Conclusion:Our study firstly demonstrated the regional disparity of COVID-19 in Chongqing municipality and further thoroughly compared the differences between severe and non-severe patients. The 28-day mortality of COVID-19 patients from 3 designed hospitals of Chongqing is 1.5%, lower than that of Hubei province and mainland China including Hubei province. However, the 28-mortality of severe patients was relatively high, with much higher when complications occurred. Notably, the 28-mortality of critically severe patients complicated with severe ARDS is considerably as high as 44.4%. Therefore, early diagnosis and intensive care of critically severe COVID-19 cases, especially those combined with ARDS, will be considerably essential to reduce mortality.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Di Qi","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaofeng Yan","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China."},{"author_name":"Xumao Tang","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China."},{"author_name":"Junnan Peng","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Qian Yu","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China."},{"author_name":"Longhua Feng","author_inst":"Qianjiang Central Hospital of Chongqing, Chongqing, China."},{"author_name":"Guodan Yuan","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China."},{"author_name":"An Zhang","author_inst":"the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China."},{"author_name":"Yaokai Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Jing Yuan","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Xia Huang","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;Chonqing University Three Gorges Hospital, Chongqing, China."},{"author_name":"Xianxiang Zhang","author_inst":"Chonqing University Three Gorges Hospital, Chongqing, China; Chonqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China."},{"author_name":"Peng Hu","author_inst":"the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Yuyan Song","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China."},{"author_name":"Chunfang Qian","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China."},{"author_name":"Qiangzhong Sun","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China."},{"author_name":"Daoxin Wang","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Jin Tong","author_inst":"the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China."},{"author_name":"Jianglin Xiang","author_inst":"Chonqing University Three Gorges Hospital, Chongqing, China;Chonqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China."},{"author_name":"Qing Xi","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dexi Zhao","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Peng Yu","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Caizhong Zhu","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhu Chen","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shaogeng Zhang","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Junsheng Ji","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guangwen Cao","author_inst":"Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fusheng Wang","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.26.20027797","rel_title":"Relations of parameters for describing the epidemic of COVID-19 by the Kermack-McKendrick model","rel_date":"2020-03-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.26.20027797","rel_abs":"In order to quantitatively characterize the epidemic of COVID[-]19, useful relations among parameters describing an epidemic in general are derived based on the Kermack-McKendrick model.

Clinical data is limited up to now regarding the risk factors in favor of severe conversion of non-severe case with COVID-19. Aims: This study analyzed a hospital staff data to figure out general clinical features of COVID-19 in terms of the association of cardiovascular manifestations (CVMs) with in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 cases. Methods: Retrospective, single-center case series of 41 consecutive hospitalized health staff with confirmed COVID-19 were collected at the Central Hospital of Wuhan in Wuhan, China, from January 15 to January 24, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, treatment data and in-hospital adverse events were collected and analyzed. Final date of follow-up was March 3, 2020. A comparative study was applied between cases with CVMs and those without CVMs. Results: Of all, clinicians and clinical nurses accounted for 80.5%, while 87.8% of all had history of patient contact. The population was presented with a mean age of 39.1 +- 9.2 and less comorbidities than community population. The three most frequent symptoms of COVID-19 cases analyzed were fever (82.9%), myalgia or fatigue (80.5%) and cough (63.4%). While, the three most frequent initial symptoms were myalgia or fatigue (80.5%), fever (73.2%) and cough (41.5%). There were 95.1% cases featured as non-severe course of disease according to the official standard in China. Patients with CVMs and those without CVMs accounted for 58.5% and 41.5%, respectively. Compared with cases without CVMs, patients with CVMs were presented with lower baseline lymphocyte count (0.99 +- 0.43 and 1.55 +- 0.61, P<0.001), more who had at least once positive nucleic acid detection of throat swab during admission (50.0% and 11.8%, P=0.011), and more received oxygen support (79.2% and 23.5%, P<0.001). The rate of in-hospital adverse events was significantly higher in patients with CVMs group (75.0% and 23.5%, P=0.001). Multivariable logistic regression model indicated that, coexisting with CVMs in COVID-19 patients was not independently associated with in-hospital adverse events. Conclusions: Most of hospital staff with COVID-19 had history of patient contact, featured non-severe course of disease. Cases with CVMs suffered from more in-hospital adverse events than those without CVMs. But concomitant CVMs were not independently associated with in-hospital adverse events in COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ru Liu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary Vascular and General Medicine, Fuwai Yunnan Cardiovascular Hospital, Kunming, Yunnan Province, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyan Ming","author_inst":"Department of General Practice, the Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei Province, Chi"},{"author_name":"Ou Xu","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary Vascular and General Medicine, Fuwai Yunnan Cardiovascular Hospital, Kunming, Yunnan Province, China"},{"author_name":"Jianli Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Pulmonary Vascular and General Medicine, Fuwai Yunnan Cardiovascular Hospital, Kunming, Yunnan Province, China"},{"author_name":"Hui Peng","author_inst":"Department of Oncology, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China"},{"author_name":"Ning Xiang","author_inst":"Department of Allergy, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China"},{"author_name":"Jiaming Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Thyroid and Breast Surgery, the Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei Pro"},{"author_name":"Hong Zhu","author_inst":"Department of General Practice, the Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei Province, Chi"},{"author_name":"Yaokai Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Jing Yuan","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Xia Huang","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China;Chonqing University Three Gorges Hospital, Chongqing, China."},{"author_name":"Xianxiang Zhang","author_inst":"Chonqing University Three Gorges Hospital, Chongqing, China; Chonqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China."},{"author_name":"Peng Hu","author_inst":"the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Yuyan Song","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China."},{"author_name":"Chunfang Qian","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China."},{"author_name":"Qiangzhong Sun","author_inst":"Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China."},{"author_name":"Daoxin Wang","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China"},{"author_name":"Jin Tong","author_inst":"the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China."},{"author_name":"Jianglin Xiang","author_inst":"Chonqing University Three Gorges Hospital, Chongqing, China;Chonqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Chongqing, China."},{"author_name":"Qing Xi","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dexi Zhao","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Peng Yu","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Caizhong Zhu","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhu Chen","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shaogeng Zhang","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Junsheng Ji","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guangwen Cao","author_inst":"Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fusheng Wang","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.28.20029199","rel_title":"The Impact of the COVID-19 Outbreak on the Medical Treatment of Chinese Children with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)\uff1aA Multicenter Cross-section Study in the Context of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern","rel_date":"2020-03-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.28.20029199","rel_abs":"Objective: To investigate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the medical advice seeking of Chinese children with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Materials and Methods: An anonymous online questionnaire survey was conducted in 17 pediatric nephropathy diagnosis and treatment centers in China. The questions collected basic information on the patients and their parents and data on changes in the approach to medical treatment and their needs in the context of the outbreak etc. This is a Multicenter Cross-section Study. Results: A total of 735 valid questionnaires were collected. 555 patients (75.5%) and their parents said that the outbreak had a significant influence on their medical treatment: 264 patients (47.6%) said that it would be delayed by 2 to 4 weeks and 199 patients (35.9%) by 4 to 8 weeks. 510 patients (84.16%) hoped to get in touch with specialists through online consultation, and 528 patients (84.5%) hoped that online consultation could be implemented and that medication could be delivered to them.. A total of 458 patients (62.3%) said that their greatest concern was that the CKD would be aggravated or that they would experience a relapse; only 203 patients were infected by 2019-nCoV. A total of 313 patients (42.5%) experienced anxiety and thus required the intervention of psychologists. Conclusion: The COVID-19 outbreak has affected the medical treatment of children with CKD. Online consultation, medication delivery and psychological counselling are the greatest needs reported by patients and their families and could especially provide solutions for the management of low income children with CKD in remote rural areas in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gaofu Zhang","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Haiping Yang","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Aihua Zhang","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing. 210008, China"},{"author_name":"Qian Shen","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai 201102, China"},{"author_name":"Li Wang","author_inst":"Chengdu Women's and Children's Central Hospital,  Chengdu, 611731, China."},{"author_name":"Zhijuan Li","author_inst":"Xi'an children's Hospital, Xi'an, 710003, China"},{"author_name":"Yuhong Li","author_inst":"Guiyang children's Hospital, Guiyang, 550003, China"},{"author_name":"Lijun Zhao","author_inst":"Shanxi children's Hospital, Taiyuan, 300013, China"},{"author_name":"Yue Du","author_inst":"Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, 110004, China"},{"author_name":"Liangzhong Sun","author_inst":"Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, 510515, China"},{"author_name":"Bo Zhao","author_inst":"Kunming children's Hospital, Kunming, 650000, China"},{"author_name":"Hongtao Zhu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University, Urumqi, 830000, China"},{"author_name":"Haidong Fu","author_inst":"The Children Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310053, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyan Li","author_inst":"The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South  University, Changsha 410011, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaojie Gao","author_inst":"Shenzhen children's hospital, Shenzhen,518038, China"},{"author_name":"Sheng Hao","author_inst":"Shanghai Children's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200062, China"},{"author_name":"Juanjuan Ding","author_inst":"Wuhan Children's Hospital, Wuhan, 430016, China"},{"author_name":"Zongwen Chen","author_inst":"Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Zhiquan Xu","author_inst":"Hainan Women and Children's Medical Center,  Haikou , 570300, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaorong Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100045, China"},{"author_name":"Daoqi Wu","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Mingsi Gao","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Mo Wang","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Qiu Li","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China"},{"author_name":"Shaogeng Zhang","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Junsheng Ji","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guangwen Cao","author_inst":"Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fusheng Wang","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.01.20029074","rel_title":"Lymphopenia predicts disease severity of COVID-19: a descriptive and predictive study","rel_date":"2020-03-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.01.20029074","rel_abs":"Background: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly escalating epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. Identification of a simple and effective indicator to assess disease severity and outcome is urgently needed. Methods: This study retrospectively analyzed dynamic changes of lymphocyte percentage (LYM%) in 15 death cases, 15 severe cases as well as 40 moderate cases of COVID-19 patients. Next, prognostic role of lymphopenia in COVID-19 were verified in 92 hospitalized cases. Results: Our results from death and severe cases showed that LYM% in blood test were inversely associated with the progression and severity of COVID-19. LYM% in patients with moderate COVID-19 remained higher than 20% 10-12 days after symptom onset. In contrast, LYM% was lower than 20% in severe cases. However, LYM% in severe cases was higher than 5% 17-19 days after the onset of the disease, while it fell below 5% in death cases. Therefore, we established a reliable Time from symptom onset-LYM% model (TLM), which could be used to evaluate disease severity and predict the outcomes of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

To address these unmet medical needs, we used a South Korean MERS-CoV clinical isolate and screened 5,406 compounds, including United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs and bioactive molecules, for their activity against the isolate. The primary assay confirmed 221 hits by dose-response curve analysis and identified 54 hits with a therapeutic index (TI) greater than 6. Time-of-addition studies with 12 FDA-approved drugs demonstrated that 8 and 4 therapeutics act on the early and late stages of the viral life cycle, respectively. Among the drugs were e.g., three cardiotonic agents (ouabain, digitoxin, digoxin) with a TI greater than 100, an anti-malaria drug (atovaquone; TI >34), an inhalable corticosteroid (ciclesonide; TI >6), etc. Together, our results identify potential therapeutic options for treating MERS-CoV infections and could provide a basis for agents against a wider range of coronavirus-related illnesses, including the currently emerging Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Meehyun Ko","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur Korea"},{"author_name":"So Young Chang","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur Korea"},{"author_name":"Soo Young Byun","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur Korea"},{"author_name":"Inhee Choi","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur Korea"},{"author_name":"David Shum","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur Korea"},{"author_name":"Ji-Young Min","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur Korea"},{"author_name":"Marc P.

This study was conducted to design an effective multiepitope based vaccine (MEV) against SARS-COV-2. Seven antigenic proteins were taken as targets and different epitopes (B-cell, T-cell and IFN-{gamma} inducing) were predicted. Highly antigenic and overlapping epitopes were shortlisted. Selected epitopes indicated significant interactions with the HLA-binding alleles and 99.29% coverage of the worlds population. Finally, 505 amino acids long MEV was designed by connecting sixteen MHC class I and eleven MHC class II epitopes with suitable linkers and adjuvant. Linkers and adjuvant were added to enhance the immunogenicity response of the MEV. The antigenicity, allergenicity, physiochemical properties and structural details of MEV were analyzed in order to ensure safety and immunogenicity. MEV construct was non-allergenic, antigenic, stable and flexible. Molecular docking followed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analysis, demonstrated a stable and strong binding affinity of MEV with human pathogenic toll-like receptors (TLR), TLR3 and TLR8. Codon optimization and in silico cloning of MEV ensured increased expression in the Escherichia coli K-12 system. Designed MEV in present study could be a potential candidate for further vaccine production process against COVID-19. However, to ensure its safety and immunogenic profile, the proposed MEV needs to be experimentally validated.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Muhammad Tahir ul Qamar","author_inst":"Guangxi University, Nanning, P.

However, the mechanisms responsible for infection and molecular evolution of this virus remained unclear.\n\nMethodsWe collected and analyzed 120 genomic sequences of 2019-nCoV including 11 novel genomes from patients in China. Through comprehensive analysis of the available genome sequences of 2019-nCoV strains, we have tracked multiple inheritable SNPs and determined the evolution of 2019-nCoV relative to other coronaviruses.\n\nResultsSystematic analysis of 120 genomic sequences of 2019-nCoV revealed co-circulation of two genetic subgroups with distinct SNPs markers, which can be used to trace the 2019-nCoV spreading pathways to different regions and countries. Although 2019-nCoV, human and bat SARS-CoV share high homologous in overall genome structures, they evolved into two distinct groups with different receptor entry specificities through potential recombination in the receptor binding regions. In addition, 2019-nCoV has a unique four amino acid insertion between S1 and S2 domains of the spike protein, which created a potential furin or TMPRSS2 cleavage site.\n\nConclusionsOur studies provided comprehensive insights into the evolution and spread of the 2019-nCoV. Our results provided evidence suggesting that 2019-nCoV may increase its infectivity through the receptor binding domain recombination and a cleavage site insertion.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryNovel 2019-nCoV sequences revealed the evolution and specificity of betacoronavirus with possible mechanisms of enhanced infectivity.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aiping Wu","author_inst":"Suzhou Institute of Systems Medicine"},{"author_name":"Peihua Niu","author_inst":"China-CDC"},{"author_name":"Lulan Wang","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Hangyu Zhou","author_inst":"ISM,CAMS"},{"author_name":"Xiang Zhao","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Wenling Wang","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Jingfeng Wang","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Chengyang Ji","author_inst":"ISM,CAMS"},{"author_name":"Xiao Ding","author_inst":"ISM,CAMS"},{"author_name":"Xianyue Wang","author_inst":"ISM,CAMS"},{"author_name":"Roujian Lu","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Sarah Gold","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Saba Aliyari","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Shilei Zhang","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Ellee Vikram","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Angela Zou","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Emily Lenh","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Janet Chen","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Fei Ye","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Na Han","author_inst":"ISM,CAMS"},{"author_name":"Yousong Peng","author_inst":"Hunan University"},{"author_name":"Haitao Guo","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Guizhen Wu","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Taijiao Jiang","author_inst":"ISM,CAMS"},{"author_name":"Wenjie Tan","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Genhong Cheng","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Guangwen Cao","author_inst":"Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fusheng Wang","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.27.967588","rel_title":"TWIRLS, an automated topic-wise inference method based on massive literature, suggests a possible mechanism via ACE2 for the pathological changes in the human host after coronavirus infection","rel_date":"2020-03-02","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.27.967588","rel_abs":"Faced with the current large-scale public health emergency, collecting, sorting, and analyzing biomedical information related to the \"coronavirus\" should be done as quickly as possible to gain a global perspective, which is a basic requirement for strengthening epidemic control capacity. However, for human researchers studying the viruses and the hosts, the vast amount of information available cannot be processed effectively and in a timely manner, particularly when the scientific understanding may be limited, which can further lower the information processing efficiency. We present TWIRLS, a method that can automatically acquire, organize, and classify information. Additionally, independent functional data sources can be added to build an inference system using a machine-based approach, which can provide relevant knowledge to help human researchers quickly establish subject cognition and to make more effective decisions. TWIRLS can automatically analyze more than three million words in more than 14,000 literature articles in only 4 hours. Combining with generalized gene interaction databases creates a data interface that can help researchers to further analyze the information. Using the TWIRLS system, we found that an important regulatory factor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) may be involved in the host pathological changes on binding to the coronavirus after infection. After triggering functional changes in ACE2\/AT2R, an imbalance in the steady-state cytokine regulatory axis involving the Renin-Angiotensin System and IP-10 leads to a cytokine storm.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaoyang Ji","author_inst":"Joint Turing-Darwin Laboratory of Phil Rivers Technology Ltd. and Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Phil Rivers Te"},{"author_name":"Chunming Zhang","author_inst":"Joint Turing-Darwin Laboratory of Phil Rivers Technology Ltd. and Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Phil Rivers Te"},{"author_name":"Yubo Zhai","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Computer Architecture, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; West Institute of Computing Techn"},{"author_name":"Zhonghai Zhang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Computer Architecture, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Chunli Zhang","author_inst":"Phil Rivers Technology, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Yiqing Xue","author_inst":"Joint Turing-Darwin Laboratory of Phil Rivers Technology Ltd. and Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Phil Rivers Te"},{"author_name":"Guangming Tan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Computer Architecture, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; West Institute of Computing Techn"},{"author_name":"Gang Niu","author_inst":"Joint Turing-Darwin Laboratory of Phil Rivers Technology Ltd. and Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Phil Rivers Te"},{"author_name":"Xiao Ding","author_inst":"ISM,CAMS"},{"author_name":"Xianyue Wang","author_inst":"ISM,CAMS"},{"author_name":"Roujian Lu","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Sarah Gold","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Saba Aliyari","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Shilei Zhang","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Ellee Vikram","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Angela Zou","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Emily Lenh","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Janet Chen","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Fei Ye","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Na Han","author_inst":"ISM,CAMS"},{"author_name":"Yousong Peng","author_inst":"Hunan University"},{"author_name":"Haitao Guo","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Guizhen Wu","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Taijiao Jiang","author_inst":"ISM,CAMS"},{"author_name":"Wenjie Tan","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Genhong Cheng","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Guangwen Cao","author_inst":"Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fusheng Wang","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.27.969006","rel_title":"Comparative genomic analysis revealed specific mutation pattern between human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13","rel_date":"2020-03-02","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.27.969006","rel_abs":"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) is a member of the family coronaviridae and contains a single-stranded RNA genome with positive-polarity. To reveal the evolution mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 genome, we performed comprehensive genomic analysis with newly sequenced SARS-CoV-2 strains and 20 closely related coronavirus strains. Among 98 nucleotide mutations at 93 sites of the genome among different SARS-CoV-2 strains, 58 of them caused amino acid change, indicating a result of neutral evolution. However, the ratio of nucleotide substitutions to amino acid substitutions of spike gene (9.07) between SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 and Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13 was extensively higher than those from comparisons between other coronaviruses (range 1.29 - 4.81). The elevated synonymous mutations between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, suggesting they underwent stronger purifying selection. Moreover, their nucleotide substitutions are enriched with T:C transition, which is consistent with the mutation signature caused by deactivity of RNA 3-to-5 exoribonuclease (ExoN). The codon usage was similar between SARS-CoV-2 and other strains in beta-coronavirus lineage B, suggesting it had small impact on the mutation pattern. In comparison of SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 with Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13, the ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates (dN\/dS) was the lowest among all performed comparisons, reconfirming the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 under stringent selective pressure. Moreover, some sites of spike protein might be subjected to positive selection. Therefore, our results will help understanding the evolutionary mechanisms contribute to viral pathogenicity and its adaptation with hosts.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Longxian Lv","author_inst":"College of Medicine, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Gaolei Li","author_inst":"Zhejiang Gongshang University"},{"author_name":"Jinhui Chen","author_inst":"Jiaxing University"},{"author_name":"Xinle Liang","author_inst":"Zhejiang Gongshang University"},{"author_name":"Yudong Li","author_inst":"Zhejiang Gongshang University"},{"author_name":"Yiqing Xue","author_inst":"Joint Turing-Darwin Laboratory of Phil Rivers Technology Ltd. and Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Phil Rivers Te"},{"author_name":"Guangming Tan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Computer Architecture, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; West Institute of Computing Techn"},{"author_name":"Gang Niu","author_inst":"Joint Turing-Darwin Laboratory of Phil Rivers Technology Ltd. and Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Phil Rivers Te"},{"author_name":"Xiao Ding","author_inst":"ISM,CAMS"},{"author_name":"Xianyue Wang","author_inst":"ISM,CAMS"},{"author_name":"Roujian Lu","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Sarah Gold","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Saba Aliyari","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Shilei Zhang","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Ellee Vikram","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Angela Zou","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Emily Lenh","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Janet Chen","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Fei Ye","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Na Han","author_inst":"ISM,CAMS"},{"author_name":"Yousong Peng","author_inst":"Hunan University"},{"author_name":"Haitao Guo","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Guizhen Wu","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Taijiao Jiang","author_inst":"ISM,CAMS"},{"author_name":"Wenjie Tan","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Genhong Cheng","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Guangwen Cao","author_inst":"Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fusheng Wang","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.01.971499","rel_title":"Kallikrein 13: a new player in coronaviral infections.","rel_date":"2020-03-02","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.01.971499","rel_abs":"Human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) is associated with respiratory disease and is prevalent worldwide, but in vitro model for virus replication is lacking. Interaction between the coronaviral spike (S) protein and its receptor is the major determinant of virus tissue and host specificity, but virus entry is a complex process requiring a concerted action of multiple cellular elements. Here, we show that KLK13 is required for the infection of the human respiratory epithelium and is sufficient to mediate the entry of HCoV-HKU1 to non-permissive RD cells. We also demonstrated HCoV-HKU1 S protein cleavage by KLK13 in the S1\/S2 region, proving that KLK13 is the priming enzyme for this virus. Summarizing, we show for the first time that protease distribution and specificity predetermines the tissue and cell specificity of the virus and may also regulate interspecies transmission. It is also of importance that presented data may be relevant for the emerging coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and may help to understand the differences in their zoonotic potential.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aleksandra Milewska","author_inst":"Malopolska Centre of Biotechnology, Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland"},{"author_name":"Katherine Falkowski","author_inst":"Faculty of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Biotechnology, Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland"},{"author_name":"Magdalena Kalinska","author_inst":"Malopolska Centre of Biotechnology, Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland"},{"author_name":"Ewa Bielecka","author_inst":"Malopolska Centre of Biotechnology, Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland"},{"author_name":"Antonina Naskalska","author_inst":"Malopolska Centre of Biotechnology, Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland"},{"author_name":"Pawel Mak","author_inst":"Faculty of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Biotechnology, Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland"},{"author_name":"Adam Lesner","author_inst":"Faculty of Chemistry, University of Gdansk, Poland"},{"author_name":"Marek Ochman","author_inst":"Department of Cardiac, Vascular and Endovascular Surgery and Transplantology, Medical University of Silesia in Katowice, Silesian Centre for Heart Diseases, Zab"},{"author_name":"Maciej Urlik","author_inst":"Department of Cardiac, Vascular and Endovascular Surgery and Transplantology, Medical University of Silesia in Katowice, Silesian Centre for Heart Diseases, Zab"},{"author_name":"Jan Potempa","author_inst":"Faculty of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Biotechnology, Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland"},{"author_name":"Tomasz Kantyka","author_inst":"Malopolska Centre of Biotechnology, Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland"},{"author_name":"Krzysztof Pyrc","author_inst":"Malopolska Centre of Biotechnology, Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland"},{"author_name":"Saba Aliyari","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Shilei Zhang","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Ellee Vikram","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Angela Zou","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Emily Lenh","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Janet Chen","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Fei Ye","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Na Han","author_inst":"ISM,CAMS"},{"author_name":"Yousong Peng","author_inst":"Hunan University"},{"author_name":"Haitao Guo","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Guizhen Wu","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Taijiao Jiang","author_inst":"ISM,CAMS"},{"author_name":"Wenjie Tan","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Genhong Cheng","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Guangwen Cao","author_inst":"Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fusheng Wang","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.27.968008","rel_title":"Molecular Dynamics Simulations Indicate the COVID-19 Mpro Is Not a Viable Target for Small-Molecule Inhibitors Design","rel_date":"2020-03-02","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.27.968008","rel_abs":"The novel coronavirus whose outbreak took place in December 2019 continues to spread at a rapid rate worldwide.

Here, we report on detailed classical and mix-solvent molecular dynamics simulations of the main protease (Mpro) enriched by evolutionary and stability analysis of the protein. The results were compared with those for a highly similar SARS Mpro protein. In spite of a high level of sequence similarity, the active sites in both proteins show major differences in both shape and size indicating that repurposing SARS drugs for COVID-19 may be futile. Furthermore, analysis of the binding sites conformational changes during the simulation time indicates its flexibility and plasticity, which dashes hopes for rapid and reliable drug design. Conversely, structural stability of the protein with respect to flexible loop mutations indicates that the virus mutability will pose a further challenge to the rational design of small-molecule inhibitors. However, few residues contribute significantly to the protein stability and thus can be considered as key anchoring residues for Mpro inhibitor design.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria Bzowka","author_inst":"Tunneling Group, Biotechnology Centre, Silesian University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Karolina Mitusinska","author_inst":"Tunneling Group, Biotechnology Centre, Silesian University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Agata Raczynska","author_inst":"Tunneling Group, Biotechnology Centre, Silesian University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Aleksandra Samol","author_inst":"Tunneling Group, Biotechnology Centre, Silesian University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Jack Adam Tuszynski","author_inst":"Department of Physics, University of Alberta, Edmonton"},{"author_name":"Artur Gora","author_inst":"Tunneling Group, Biotechnology Centre, Silesian University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Adam Lesner","author_inst":"Faculty of Chemistry, University of Gdansk, Poland"},{"author_name":"Marek Ochman","author_inst":"Department of Cardiac, Vascular and Endovascular Surgery and Transplantology, Medical University of Silesia in Katowice, Silesian Centre for Heart Diseases, Zab"},{"author_name":"Maciej Urlik","author_inst":"Department of Cardiac, Vascular and Endovascular Surgery and Transplantology, Medical University of Silesia in Katowice, Silesian Centre for Heart Diseases, Zab"},{"author_name":"Jan Potempa","author_inst":"Faculty of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Biotechnology, Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland"},{"author_name":"Tomasz Kantyka","author_inst":"Malopolska Centre of Biotechnology, Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland"},{"author_name":"Krzysztof Pyrc","author_inst":"Malopolska Centre of Biotechnology, Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland"},{"author_name":"Saba Aliyari","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Shilei Zhang","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Ellee Vikram","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Angela Zou","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Emily Lenh","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Janet Chen","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Fei Ye","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Na Han","author_inst":"ISM,CAMS"},{"author_name":"Yousong Peng","author_inst":"Hunan University"},{"author_name":"Haitao Guo","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Guizhen Wu","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Taijiao Jiang","author_inst":"ISM,CAMS"},{"author_name":"Wenjie Tan","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Genhong Cheng","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Guangwen Cao","author_inst":"Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fusheng Wang","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"molecular biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.29.965418","rel_title":"The within-host viral kinetics of SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-03-02","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.29.965418","rel_abs":"In this work, we use a within-host viral dynamic model to describe the SARS-CoV-2 kinetics in host.

In our present study, an epitope-based peptide vaccine against nonstructural protein 4 of beta coronavirus, using a combination of B cell and T cell epitope predictions, followed by molecular docking methods are performed. Here, protein sequences of homologous nonstructural protein 4 of beta coronavirus are collected and conserved regions present in them are investigated via phylogenetic study to determine the most immunogenic part of protein. From the identified region of the target protein, the peptide sequence IRNTTNPSAR from the region ranging from 38-47 and the sequence PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG from the positions of 76-90 are considered as the most potential B cell and T cell epitopes respectively. Furthermore, this predicted T cell epitopes PTDTYTSVY and PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG interacted with MHC allelic proteins HLA-A*01:01 and HLA-DRB5*01:01 respectively with the low IC50 values. These epitopes are perfectly fitted into the epitope binding grooves of alpha helix of MHC I molecule and MHC II molecule with binding energy scores -725.0 Kcal\/mole and -786.0 Kcal\/mole respectively, showing stability in MHC molecules binding. This MHC restricted epitope PTDTYTSVY also showed a good conservancy of 50.16% in world population coverage. This MHC I HLA-A*01:01 allele is present among 58.87% of Chinese population also. Therefore, the epitopes IRNTTNPSAR and PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG may be considered as potential peptides for peptide-based vaccine for coronavirus after further experimental study.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anamika Basu","author_inst":"Gurudas College, India"},{"author_name":"Anasua Sarkar","author_inst":"Jadavpur University"},{"author_name":"Ujjwal Maulik","author_inst":"Jadavpur University"},{"author_name":"Aleksandra Samol","author_inst":"Tunneling Group, Biotechnology Centre, Silesian University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Jack Adam Tuszynski","author_inst":"Department of Physics, University of Alberta, Edmonton"},{"author_name":"Artur Gora","author_inst":"Tunneling Group, Biotechnology Centre, Silesian University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Adam Lesner","author_inst":"Faculty of Chemistry, University of Gdansk, Poland"},{"author_name":"Marek Ochman","author_inst":"Department of Cardiac, Vascular and Endovascular Surgery and Transplantology, Medical University of Silesia in Katowice, Silesian Centre for Heart Diseases, Zab"},{"author_name":"Maciej Urlik","author_inst":"Department of Cardiac, Vascular and Endovascular Surgery and Transplantology, Medical University of Silesia in Katowice, Silesian Centre for Heart Diseases, Zab"},{"author_name":"Jan Potempa","author_inst":"Faculty of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Biotechnology, Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland"},{"author_name":"Tomasz Kantyka","author_inst":"Malopolska Centre of Biotechnology, Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland"},{"author_name":"Krzysztof Pyrc","author_inst":"Malopolska Centre of Biotechnology, Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland"},{"author_name":"Saba Aliyari","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Shilei Zhang","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Ellee Vikram","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Angela Zou","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Emily Lenh","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Janet Chen","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Fei Ye","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Na Han","author_inst":"ISM,CAMS"},{"author_name":"Yousong Peng","author_inst":"Hunan University"},{"author_name":"Haitao Guo","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Guizhen Wu","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Taijiao Jiang","author_inst":"ISM,CAMS"},{"author_name":"Wenjie Tan","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Genhong Cheng","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Guangwen Cao","author_inst":"Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fusheng Wang","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.29.971127","rel_title":"An ultrasensitive, rapid, and portable coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 sequence detection method based on CRISPR-Cas12","rel_date":"2020-03-02","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.29.971127","rel_abs":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has received global attention due to the recent outbreak in China.

Moreover, mucosal epithelia such as that of the respiratory tract are protected by a layer of mucin polysaccharides, which are usually sulphated. Consequently, the polydisperse, natural products of heparan sulphate and the allied polysaccharide, heparin have been found to be involved and prevent infection by a range of viruses including S-associated coronavirus strain HSR1. Here we use surface plasmon resonance and circular dichroism to measure the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 protein receptor binding domain (SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD) and heparin. The data demonstrate an interaction between the recombinant surface receptor binding domain and the polysaccharide. This has implications for the rapid development of a first-line therapeutic by repurposing heparin and for next-generation, tailor-made, GAG-based antivirals.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Courtney J Mycroft-West","author_inst":"Keele University"},{"author_name":"Dunhao Su","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Stefano Elli","author_inst":"Istituto di Ricerche Chimiche e Biochimiche G.

Real- time fluorescent PCR (RT-PCR) is the clinical standard for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection. To detect SARS-CoV-2 early and control the disease spreading on time, a faster and more convenient method for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detecting, RT-LAMP method (reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification) was developed. RNA reverse transcription and nucleic acid amplification were performed in one step at 63  isothermal conditions, and the results can be obtained within 30 minutes. ORF1ab gene, E gene and N gene were detected at the same time. ORF1ab gene was very specific and N gene was very sensitivity, so they can guarantee both sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2. The sensitivity of RT-LAMP assay is similar to RT-PCR, and specificity was 99% as detecting 208 clinical specimens. The RT-LAMP assay reported here has the advantages of rapid amplification, simple operation, and easy detection, which is useful for the rapid and reliable clinical diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Weihua Yang","author_inst":"Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Xiaofei Dang","author_inst":"Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university,"},{"author_name":"Qingxi Wang","author_inst":"Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Mingjie Xu","author_inst":"Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Qianqian Zhao","author_inst":"Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Yunying Zhou","author_inst":"Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Huailong Zhao","author_inst":"Jinan center for disease control and prevention"},{"author_name":"Li Wang","author_inst":"Infectious disease hospital of Jinan"},{"author_name":"Yihui Xu","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Shuyi Han","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Min Wang","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Fengyan Pei","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Yunshan Wang","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university.Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hos"},{"author_name":"Ellee Vikram","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Angela Zou","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Emily Lenh","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Janet Chen","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Fei Ye","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Na Han","author_inst":"ISM,CAMS"},{"author_name":"Yousong Peng","author_inst":"Hunan University"},{"author_name":"Haitao Guo","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Guizhen Wu","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Taijiao Jiang","author_inst":"ISM,CAMS"},{"author_name":"Wenjie Tan","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Genhong Cheng","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Guangwen Cao","author_inst":"Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fusheng Wang","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.02.20030080","rel_title":"Estimation of local novel coronavirus (COVID-19) cases in Wuhan, China from off-site reported cases and population flow data from different sources","rel_date":"2020-03-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.02.20030080","rel_abs":"Backgrounds: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia hit Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and spread to the rest of China and overseas. The emergence of this virus coincided with the Spring Festival Travel Rush in China. It is possible to estimate total number of cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan, by 23 January 2020, given the cases reported in other cities and population flow data between cities. Methods: We built a model to estimate the total number of cases in Wuhan by 23 January 2020, based on the number of cases detected outside Wuhan city in China, with the assumption that if the same screening effort used in other cities applied in Wuhan. We employed population flow data from different sources between Wuhan and other cities\/regions by 23 January 2020. The number of total cases was determined by the maximum log likelihood estimation. Findings: From overall cities\/regions data, we predicted 1326 (95% CI: 1177, 1484), 1151 (95% CI: 1018, 1292) and 5277 (95% CI: 4732, 5859) as total cases in Wuhan by 23 January 2020, based on different source of data from Changjiang Daily newspaper, Tencent, and Baidu.

Methods: Clinical data of 36 patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia in isolation area of Kunming Third People's Hospital from January 31 to February 15, 2020 were collected, and the basic situation, clinical characteristics, laboratory examination and CT imaging characteristics were analyzed. Serum albumin (ALB), prealbumin (PAB), hypersensitive c-reactive protein (hs-crp), CD3T cells, CD4T cells, CD8T cells and normal control group were analyzed. A simple linear regression analysis of the relationship between proalbumin and T cell subpopulation counts in the blood of patients. Results: (1) The patients with new coronavirus pneumonia in Kunming were mainly of common type. (2) 50% of the patients' first symptoms were fever and cough; (3) The total number of white blood cells in peripheral blood was normal or decreased in 23 cases (79%), and the lymphocyte count decreased in 5 cases (13.89%), without anemia. Hypersensitive c-reactive protein increased in 19 (52.78%) cases, and procalcitonin increased in 1 case. Albumin decreased in 5 cases (13.89%), proalbumin decreased in 15 cases (41.67%), alanine transaminase increased slightly in 4 cases (11.11%), alanine transaminase increased slightly in 4 cases (11.11%), total bilirubin increased slightly in 11 cases (30.56%), and renal function and blood coagulation were normal. Absolute value of CD3+T cells is with a decrease in 21 cases (58.3%), CD4+T in 28 cases (77.8%), CD8+T in 17 cases (47.2%), and CD4+\/ CD8+ inverse in 6 cases (16.7%). (4) The prealbumin, CD3 T cells, CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells in the new coronavirus pneumonia group were significantly lower than those in the normal control group, and the hypersensitive c-reactive protein was higher than that in the normal control group. (5) The levels of PAB in the serum of the patients were linearly correlated with hs-crp, CD3 T cells, CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells, and the correlation coefficients were -0.474, 0.558, 0.467 and 0.613, respectively, showing statistical differences. Conclusion: The clinical characteristics of the novel coronavirus pneumonia in Kunming are different from those in Wuhan. The changes of serum proalbumin and T cell subsets are relatively obvious. Changes in serum proalbumin may contribute to the early warning of novel coronavirus pneumonia. The nutritional status of patients with common and mild pneumonia should be considered.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Haiyan Fu","author_inst":"1.Kunming Third People's Hospital Isolation Ward"},{"author_name":"Hongjuan Li","author_inst":"1.Kunming Third People's Hospital Isolation Ward"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqing Tang","author_inst":"1.Kunming Third People's Hospital Isolation Ward"},{"author_name":"Xiang Li","author_inst":"1.Kunming Third People's Hospital Isolation Ward"},{"author_name":"Jie Shen","author_inst":"1.Kunming Third People's Hospital Isolation Ward"},{"author_name":"Yujun Zhou","author_inst":"1.Kunming Third People's Hospital Isolation Ward"},{"author_name":"Bing Xu","author_inst":"1.Kunming Third People's Hospital Isolation Ward"},{"author_name":"Yu Luo","author_inst":"Kunming Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yihui Xu","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Shuyi Han","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Min Wang","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Fengyan Pei","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university"},{"author_name":"Yunshan Wang","author_inst":"Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hospital affiliated to shandong first medical university.Department of clinical laboratory,  Jinan central hos"},{"author_name":"Ellee Vikram","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Angela Zou","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Emily Lenh","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Janet Chen","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Fei Ye","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Na Han","author_inst":"ISM,CAMS"},{"author_name":"Yousong Peng","author_inst":"Hunan University"},{"author_name":"Haitao Guo","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Guizhen Wu","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Taijiao Jiang","author_inst":"ISM,CAMS"},{"author_name":"Wenjie Tan","author_inst":"China CDC"},{"author_name":"Genhong Cheng","author_inst":"University of California Los Angeles"},{"author_name":"Guangwen Cao","author_inst":"Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fusheng Wang","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"}]}
