Unfortunately, information regarding the immunological characteristics in COVID-19 patients remains limited. Here we collected the blood samples from 18 healthy donors (HD) and 38 COVID-19 patients to analyze changes in the adaptive immune cell populations and phenotypes. In comparison to HD, the lymphocyte percentage was slightly decreased, the percentages of CD4 and CD8 T cells in lymphocytes are similar, whereas B cell percentage increased in COVID-19 patients. T cells, especially CD8 T cells, showed an enhanced expression of late activation marker CD25 and exhaustion marker PD-1. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 induced an increased percentage of T follicular helpher (Tfh)- and germinal center B-like (GCB-like) cells in the blood. However, the parameters in COVD-19 patients remained unchanged across various age groups. Therefore, we demonstrated that the T and B cells can be activated normally and exhibit functional features. These data provide a clue that the adaptive immunity in most people could be primed to induce a significant immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection upon receiving standard medical care.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaofeng Yang","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Tongxin Dai","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, The 8th hospital of Xi'an, Xi'an, Shaanxi, 710061 China"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an, Shaanxi, 710061,"},{"author_name":"Hongbo Qian","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, The 8th hospital of Xi'an, Xi'an, Shaanxi, 710061 China"},{"author_name":"Rui Guo","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, The 8th hospital of Xi'an, Xi'an, Shaanxi, 710061 China"},{"author_name":"Lei Lei","author_inst":"Department of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an, Shaanxi, 710061,"},{"author_name":"Xingzhe Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an, Shaanxi, 710061,"},{"author_name":"Dan Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an, Shaanxi, 710061,"},{"author_name":"Lin Shi","author_inst":"Department of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an, Shaanxi, 710061,"},{"author_name":"Yanbin Cheng","author_inst":"Department of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an, Shaanxi, 710061,"},{"author_name":"Yaling Guo","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, The 8th hospital of Xi'an, Xi'an, Shaanxi, 710061 China"},{"author_name":"Jinsong Hu","author_inst":"Department of Cell Biology and Genetics, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an, Shaanxi, 710061, China"},{"author_name":"Baojun Zhang","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.22.20041277","rel_title":"Critical Care for Patients with Severe Covid-2019 in Sichuan Province, China: Provincial Cohort Study","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.22.20041277","rel_abs":"Background Data regarding critical care for patients with severe COVID-19 are limited. We aimed to describe the clinical course, multi-strategy management, and respiratory support usage for the severe COVID-19 at the provincial level. Methods Using data from Sichuan Provincial Department of Health and the multicentre cohort study, all microbiologically confirmed COVID-19 patients in Sichuan who met the national severe criteria were included and followed-up from the day of inclusion (D1), until discharge, death, or the end of the study. Findings Out of 539 COVID-19 patients, 81 severe cases (15.0%) were identified. The median (IQR) age was 50 (39-65) years, 37% were female, and 53.1% had chronic comorbidities. All severe cases were identified before requiring mechanical ventilation and treated in the intensive care units (ICUs), among whom 51 (63.0%) were treated in provisional ICUs and 77 patients (95.1%) were admitted by D1. On D1, 76 (93.8%) were administered by respiratory support, including 55 (67.9%) by conventional oxygen therapy (COT), 8 (9.9%) by high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and 13 (16.0%) by non-invasive ventilation (NIV). By D28, 53 (65.4%) were discharged, three (3.7%) were deceased, and 25 (30.9%) were still hospitalized. COT, administered to 95.1% of the patients, was the most commonly used respiratory support and met 62.7% of the respiratory support needed, followed by HFNC (19.3%), NIV ventilation (9.4%) and IV 8.5%. Interpretation The multi-strategy management for severe COVID-19 patients including early identification and timely critical care may contribute to the low case-fatailty. Preparation of sufficient conventional oxygen equipment should be prioritized.","rel_num_authors":38,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xuelian Liao","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Hong Chen","author_inst":"The Public Health Clinical Center of Chengdu"},{"author_name":"Bo Wang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Zhen Li","author_inst":"Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhongwei Zhang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Weimin Li","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Zongan Liang","author_inst":"West China Hospital of Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Jin Tang","author_inst":"Guang An People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"Guang An People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rui Shi","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiangde Zhen","author_inst":"Dazhou Central Hospital,"},{"author_name":"Maojuan Wang","author_inst":"People's Hospital of Deyang City"},{"author_name":"Xianying Lei","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yu Gong","author_inst":"Suining Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sheng Lv","author_inst":"Panzhihua Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chao Jia","author_inst":"Mianyang Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Li Chen","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College"},{"author_name":"Juan Shang","author_inst":"Nanchong Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Min Yang","author_inst":"People's hospital of ya'an"},{"author_name":"Hailong Wei","author_inst":"The People Hospital of Leshan"},{"author_name":"Yuanjun Zhang","author_inst":"The First People Hospital of Ziyang"},{"author_name":"Xiong Yang","author_inst":"Langzhong People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huaqiang Shen","author_inst":"Bazhong Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xianhua Xiao","author_inst":"The Second People Hospital of Neijiang"},{"author_name":"Jie Yang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Qin Wu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wen Wang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Jin Yang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wanhong Yin","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqi Xie","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yongming Tian","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Huan Liu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Bingxing Shuai","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiangrong Song","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Jin","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yan Kang","author_inst":"West China Hospital of Sichuan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.22.20040956","rel_title":"Simulation-based Estimation of the Spread of COVID-19 in Iran","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.22.20040956","rel_abs":"Background: The 2019 Coronavirus (COVID-19) has turned into a global pandemic with unprecedented challenges for the global community. Understanding the state of the disease and planning for future trajectories relies heavily on data on the spread and mortality. Yet official data coming from various countries are highly unreliable: symptoms similar to common cold in majority of cases and limited screening resources and delayed testing procedures may contribute to under-estimation of the burden of disease. Anecdotal and more limited data are available, but few have systematically combined those with official statistics into a coherent view of the epidemic. This study is a modeling-in-real-time of the emerging outbreak for understanding the state of the disease. Our focus is on the case of the spread of disease in Iran, as one of the epicenters of the disease in the first months of 2020. Method: We develop a simple dynamic model of the epidemic to provide a more reliable picture of the state of the disease based on existing data. Building on the generic SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, and Recovered) framework we incorporate two behavioral and logistical considerations. First we capture the endogenous changes in contact rate (average contact per person) as more death are reported. As a result the reproduction number changes endogenously in the model. Second we differentiate reported and true cases by including simple formulations for how only a fraction of cases might be diagnosed, and how that fraction changes in response to epidemic's progression. In estimating the model we use both the official data as well as the discovered infected travelers and unofficial medical community estimates and triangulate these sources to build a more complete picture. Calibration is completed by forming a likelihood function for observing the actual time series data conditional on model parameters, and conducting a Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations. The model is used to estimate current \"true\" cases of infection and death. We analyze the future trajectory of the disease under six conditions related to the seasonal effects and policy measures targeting social distancing. Findings: The model closely replicates the past data but also shows the true number of cases is likely far larger. We estimate about 493,000 current infected cases (90% CI: 271K-810K) as of March 20th, 2020. Our estimate for cumulative cases of infection until that date is 916,000 (90% CI: 508K, 1.5M), and for total death is 15,485 (90% CI: 8.4K, 25.8K). These numbers are significantly (more than one order of magnitude) higher than official statistics. The trajectory of the epidemic until the end of June could take various paths depending on the impact of seasonality and policies targeting social distancing. In the most optimistic scenario for seasonal effects, depending on policy measures, 1.6 million Iranians (90% CI: 0.9M-2.6M) are likely to get infected, and death toll will reach about 58,000 cases (90% CI: 32K-97K), while in the more pessimistic scenarios, death toll may exceed 103,000 cases (90% CI: 56K-172K). Implication: Our results suggest that the number of cases and deaths may be over an order of magnitude larger than official statistics in Iran. Absent extended testing capacity other countries may face a significant under-count of existing cases and thus be caught off guard about the actual toll of the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Navid Ghaffarzadegan","author_inst":"Virginia Tech"},{"author_name":"Hazhir Rahmandad","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Bo Wang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Zhen Li","author_inst":"Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhongwei Zhang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Weimin Li","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Zongan Liang","author_inst":"West China Hospital of Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Jin Tang","author_inst":"Guang An People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"Guang An People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rui Shi","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiangde Zhen","author_inst":"Dazhou Central Hospital,"},{"author_name":"Maojuan Wang","author_inst":"People's Hospital of Deyang City"},{"author_name":"Xianying Lei","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yu Gong","author_inst":"Suining Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sheng Lv","author_inst":"Panzhihua Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chao Jia","author_inst":"Mianyang Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Li Chen","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College"},{"author_name":"Juan Shang","author_inst":"Nanchong Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Min Yang","author_inst":"People's hospital of ya'an"},{"author_name":"Hailong Wei","author_inst":"The People Hospital of Leshan"},{"author_name":"Yuanjun Zhang","author_inst":"The First People Hospital of Ziyang"},{"author_name":"Xiong Yang","author_inst":"Langzhong People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huaqiang Shen","author_inst":"Bazhong Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xianhua Xiao","author_inst":"The Second People Hospital of Neijiang"},{"author_name":"Jie Yang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Qin Wu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wen Wang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Jin Yang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wanhong Yin","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqi Xie","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yongming Tian","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Huan Liu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Bingxing Shuai","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiangrong Song","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Jin","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yan Kang","author_inst":"West China Hospital of Sichuan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.22.20041111","rel_title":"Exponential damping key to successful containment of COVID-19 outbreak","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.22.20041111","rel_abs":"Due to its excessively high capacity for human-to-human transmission, the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), first reported in Wuhan in China, spread rapidly to the entire nation and beyond, and has now been declared a global public health emergency. Understanding the transmission pattern of the virus and the efficacy of transmission control measures is crucial to ensuring regional and global disease control. Here we propose a simple model based on exponential infectious growth, but with a time-varying, largely damping, transmission rate. This model provides an excellent fit to the existing data from the 102 countries and regions which have reported cases for more than 6 days, and, we think, has largely captured the transmission patterns of the COVID-19 outbreak under a variety of intervention and control measures. We found that the damping rate, defined as the rate of the exponential decline in transmission rate, ranged from -0.125 to 0.513 d-1 globally (a negative damping rate represents acceleration in spread). The estimated peak time (when the fastest spread occurs) and the final number of infections were found to be greatly affected by the damping rate. Successful control measures, such as those implemented in China and South Korea, have resulted in a clear pattern of exponential damping in the viral spread (also shown during the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, SARS). The damping rate, therefore, could be used as an indicator for the efficacy of implemented control measures. Our model suggests that the COVID-19 outbreak is currently accelerating worldwide, especially rapidly in certain countries (e.g. USA and Australia) where exponential damping is yet to emerge. Consistent with the message from the World Health Organisation (WHO), we thus strongly suggest all countries to take active measures to contain this global pandemic. Slight increments in the damping rate from additional control efforts, especially in countries showing weak or no exponential damping in COVID-19 transmission, could lead to a radically more positive outcome in the fight to contain the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Feng Zhang","author_inst":"Anhui University"},{"author_name":"Jinmei Zhang","author_inst":"Xiguan Community Health Center of Liangzhou"},{"author_name":"Menglan Cao","author_inst":"Anhui University"},{"author_name":"Yong Zhang","author_inst":"Anhui University"},{"author_name":"Cang Hui","author_inst":"Stellenbosch University"},{"author_name":"Weimin Li","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Zongan Liang","author_inst":"West China Hospital of Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Jin Tang","author_inst":"Guang An People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"Guang An People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rui Shi","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiangde Zhen","author_inst":"Dazhou Central Hospital,"},{"author_name":"Maojuan Wang","author_inst":"People's Hospital of Deyang City"},{"author_name":"Xianying Lei","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yu Gong","author_inst":"Suining Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sheng Lv","author_inst":"Panzhihua Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chao Jia","author_inst":"Mianyang Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Li Chen","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College"},{"author_name":"Juan Shang","author_inst":"Nanchong Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Min Yang","author_inst":"People's hospital of ya'an"},{"author_name":"Hailong Wei","author_inst":"The People Hospital of Leshan"},{"author_name":"Yuanjun Zhang","author_inst":"The First People Hospital of Ziyang"},{"author_name":"Xiong Yang","author_inst":"Langzhong People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huaqiang Shen","author_inst":"Bazhong Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xianhua Xiao","author_inst":"The Second People Hospital of Neijiang"},{"author_name":"Jie Yang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Qin Wu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wen Wang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Jin Yang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wanhong Yin","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqi Xie","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yongming Tian","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Huan Liu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Bingxing Shuai","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiangrong Song","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Jin","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yan Kang","author_inst":"West China Hospital of Sichuan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.23.20041517","rel_title":"Spatio-temporal propagation of COVID-19 pandemics","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.23.20041517","rel_abs":"The new coronavirus known as COVID-19 is spread world-wide since December 2019. Without any vaccination or medicine, the means of controlling it are limited to quarantine and social distancing. Here we study the spatio-temporal propagation of the first wave of the COVID-19 virus in China and compare it to other global locations. We provide a comprehensive picture of the spatial propagation from Hubei to other provinces in China in terms of distance, population size, and human mobility and their scaling relations. Since strict quarantine has been usually applied between cities, more insight about the temporal evolution of the disease can be obtained by analyzing the epidemic within cities, especially the time evolution of the infection, death, and recovery rates which affected by policies. We study and compare the infection rate in different cities in China and provinces in Italy and find that the disease spread is characterized by a two-stages process. At early times, at order of few days, the infection rate is close to a constant probably due to the lack of means to detect infected individuals before infection symptoms are observed. Then at later times it decays approximately exponentially due to quarantines. The time evolution of the death and recovery rates also distinguish between these two stages and reflect the health system situation which could be overloaded.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bnaya Gross","author_inst":"Bar Ilan University"},{"author_name":"Zhiguo Zheng","author_inst":"School of Reliability and Systems Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing 100191, China"},{"author_name":"Shiyan Liu","author_inst":"School of Reliability and Systems Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing 100191, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqi Chen","author_inst":"School of Reliability and Systems Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing 100191, China"},{"author_name":"Alon Sela","author_inst":"Department of Industrial Engineering, Ariel University, Ariel, Israel"},{"author_name":"Jianxin Li","author_inst":"Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Big Data and Brain Computing, Beihang University, Beijing 100083, China"},{"author_name":"Daqing Li","author_inst":"Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Big Data-Based Precision Medicine, Beihang University, Beijing 100191, China"},{"author_name":"Shlomo Havlin","author_inst":"Department of Physics, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan 52900, Israel"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"Guang An People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rui Shi","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiangde Zhen","author_inst":"Dazhou Central Hospital,"},{"author_name":"Maojuan Wang","author_inst":"People's Hospital of Deyang City"},{"author_name":"Xianying Lei","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yu Gong","author_inst":"Suining Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sheng Lv","author_inst":"Panzhihua Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chao Jia","author_inst":"Mianyang Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Li Chen","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College"},{"author_name":"Juan Shang","author_inst":"Nanchong Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Min Yang","author_inst":"People's hospital of ya'an"},{"author_name":"Hailong Wei","author_inst":"The People Hospital of Leshan"},{"author_name":"Yuanjun Zhang","author_inst":"The First People Hospital of Ziyang"},{"author_name":"Xiong Yang","author_inst":"Langzhong People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huaqiang Shen","author_inst":"Bazhong Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xianhua Xiao","author_inst":"The Second People Hospital of Neijiang"},{"author_name":"Jie Yang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Qin Wu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wen Wang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Jin Yang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wanhong Yin","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqi Xie","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yongming Tian","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Huan Liu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Bingxing Shuai","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiangrong Song","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Jin","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yan Kang","author_inst":"West China Hospital of Sichuan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.23.20041863","rel_title":"Modelling strategies to organize healthcare workforce during pandemics: application to COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.23.20041863","rel_abs":"Protection of healthcare workforce who are at increased risk to become infected is of paramount relevance for the care of patients in the setting of a pandemic such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

In this study, we have mathematically modelled strategies for the employment of hospital workforce with the goal to simulate health and productivity of the workers. The models were designed to determine if desynchronization of medical teams by dichotomizing the workers may protect the workforce. Our studies model workforce productivity depending on the infection rate, the presence of reinfection and the efficiency of home office and apply our theory to the case of COVID-19. The results reveal that a desynchronization strategy in which two medical teams work alternating for 7 days increases the available workforce.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel Sanchez-Taltavull","author_inst":"Department for Visceral Surgery and Medicine, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Daniel Candinas","author_inst":"Department for Visceral Surgery and Medicine, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Edgar Roldan","author_inst":"The Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Guido Beldi","author_inst":"Department for Visceral Surgery and Medicine, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Alon Sela","author_inst":"Department of Industrial Engineering, Ariel University, Ariel, Israel"},{"author_name":"Jianxin Li","author_inst":"Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Big Data and Brain Computing, Beihang University, Beijing 100083, China"},{"author_name":"Daqing Li","author_inst":"Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Big Data-Based Precision Medicine, Beihang University, Beijing 100191, China"},{"author_name":"Shlomo Havlin","author_inst":"Department of Physics, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan 52900, Israel"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"Guang An People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rui Shi","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiangde Zhen","author_inst":"Dazhou Central Hospital,"},{"author_name":"Maojuan Wang","author_inst":"People's Hospital of Deyang City"},{"author_name":"Xianying Lei","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yu Gong","author_inst":"Suining Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sheng Lv","author_inst":"Panzhihua Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chao Jia","author_inst":"Mianyang Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Li Chen","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College"},{"author_name":"Juan Shang","author_inst":"Nanchong Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Min Yang","author_inst":"People's hospital of ya'an"},{"author_name":"Hailong Wei","author_inst":"The People Hospital of Leshan"},{"author_name":"Yuanjun Zhang","author_inst":"The First People Hospital of Ziyang"},{"author_name":"Xiong Yang","author_inst":"Langzhong People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huaqiang Shen","author_inst":"Bazhong Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xianhua Xiao","author_inst":"The Second People Hospital of Neijiang"},{"author_name":"Jie Yang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Qin Wu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wen Wang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Jin Yang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wanhong Yin","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqi Xie","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yongming Tian","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Huan Liu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Bingxing Shuai","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiangrong Song","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Jin","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yan Kang","author_inst":"West China Hospital of Sichuan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.22.20041145","rel_title":"Global transmission network of SARS-CoV-2: from outbreak to pandemic","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.22.20041145","rel_abs":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is straining health systems around the world.

Following its emergence, the virus started to generate sustained transmission in neighboring countries in Asia, Western Europe, Australia, Canada and the United States, and finally in South America and Africa. As the virus continues its global spread, a clear and evidence-based understanding of properties and dynamics of the global transmission network of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to design and put in place efficient and globally coordinated interventions. Methods: We employ molecular surveillance data of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics for inference and comprehensive analysis of its global transmission network before the pandemic declaration. Our goal was to characterize the spatial-temporal transmission pathways that led to the establishment of the pandemic. We exploited a network-based approach specifically tailored to emerging outbreak settings. Specifically, it traces the accumulation of mutations in viral genomic variants via mutation trees, which are then used to infer transmission networks, revealing an up-to-date picture of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 between and within countries and geographic regions. Results and Conclusions: The analysis suggest multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the majority of world regions by means of heterogeneous transmission pathways. The transmission network is scale-free, with a few genomic variants responsible for the majority of possible transmissions. The network structure is in line with the available temporal information represented by sample collection times and suggest the expected sampling time difference of few days between potential transmission pairs. The inferred network structural properties, transmission clusters and pathways and virus introduction routes emphasize the extent of the global epidemiological linkage and demonstrate the importance of internationally coordinated public health measures.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pavel Skums","author_inst":"Georgia State University"},{"author_name":"Alexander Kirpich","author_inst":"Georgia State University"},{"author_name":"Pelin Icer Baykal","author_inst":"Georgia State University"},{"author_name":"Alex Zelikovsky","author_inst":"Georgia State University"},{"author_name":"Gerardo Chowell","author_inst":"Georgia State University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Jianxin Li","author_inst":"Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Big Data and Brain Computing, Beihang University, Beijing 100083, China"},{"author_name":"Daqing Li","author_inst":"Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Big Data-Based Precision Medicine, Beihang University, Beijing 100191, China"},{"author_name":"Shlomo Havlin","author_inst":"Department of Physics, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan 52900, Israel"},{"author_name":"Jian Wang","author_inst":"Guang An People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rui Shi","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiangde Zhen","author_inst":"Dazhou Central Hospital,"},{"author_name":"Maojuan Wang","author_inst":"People's Hospital of Deyang City"},{"author_name":"Xianying Lei","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University"},{"author_name":"Yu Gong","author_inst":"Suining Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sheng Lv","author_inst":"Panzhihua Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chao Jia","author_inst":"Mianyang Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Li Chen","author_inst":"Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College"},{"author_name":"Juan Shang","author_inst":"Nanchong Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Min Yang","author_inst":"People's hospital of ya'an"},{"author_name":"Hailong Wei","author_inst":"The People Hospital of Leshan"},{"author_name":"Yuanjun Zhang","author_inst":"The First People Hospital of Ziyang"},{"author_name":"Xiong Yang","author_inst":"Langzhong People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huaqiang Shen","author_inst":"Bazhong Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xianhua Xiao","author_inst":"The Second People Hospital of Neijiang"},{"author_name":"Jie Yang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Qin Wu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wen Wang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Jin Yang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wanhong Yin","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqi Xie","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yongming Tian","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Huan Liu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Bingxing Shuai","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiangrong Song","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Jin","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yan Kang","author_inst":"West China Hospital of Sichuan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.22.20041004","rel_title":"COVID-19 attack rate increases with city size","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.22.20041004","rel_abs":"The current outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses an unprecedented global health and economic threat to interconnected human societies.

Here, we estimate the growth rates and reproductive numbers of COVID-19 in US cities from March 14th through March 19th to reveal a power-law scaling relationship to city population size. This means that COVID-19 is spreading faster on average in larger cities with the additional implication that, in an uncontrolled outbreak, larger fractions of the population are expected to become infected in more populous urban areas. We discuss the implications of these observations for controlling the COVID-19 outbreak, emphasizing the need to implement more aggressive distancing policies in larger cities while also preserving socioeconomic activity.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew J.

Tracking case numbers over time allows us to determine speed of spread and the effectiveness of interventions. Changing case definitions during an epidemic can affect these inferences. Methods: We examined changes in the case definition for COVID-19 in mainland China during the first epidemic wave. We used simple models assuming exponential growth and then exponential decay to estimate how changes in the case definitions affected the numbers of cases reported each day. We then inferred how the epidemic curve would have appeared if the same case definition had been used throughout the epidemic. Findings: From January through to early March 2020, seven versions of the case definition for COVID-19 were issued by the National Health Commission in China. As of February 20, there were 55,508 confirmed cases reported in mainland China. We estimated that when the case definitions were changed from version 1 to 2, version 2 to 4 and version 4 to 5, the proportion of infections being detected as cases were increased by 7.1-fold (95% credible interval (CI): 4.8, 10.9), 2.8-fold (95% CI: 1.9, 4.2) and 4.2-fold (95% CI: 2.6, 7.3) respectively. If the fifth version of the case definition had been applied throughout the outbreak, we estimated that by February 20 there would have been 232,000 (95% CI: 161,000, 359,000) confirmed cases. Interpretation: The case definition was initially narrow, but was gradually broadened to allow detection of more cases as knowledge increased, particularly milder cases and those without epidemiological links to Wuhan or other known cases. This should be taken into account when making inferences on epidemic growth rates and doubling times, and therefore on the reproductive number, to avoid bias.

As the incidence of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) increases exponentially in the United States and worldwide, healthcare provider demand for these necessities is currently outpacing supply. As such, strategies to extend the lifespan of the supply of medical equipment as safely as possible are critically important. In the midst of the current pandemic, there has been a concerted effort to identify viable ways to conserve PPE, including decontamination after use. Some hospitals have already begun using UV-C light to decontaminate N95 respirators and other PPE, but many lack the space or equipment to implement existing protocols. In this study, we outline a procedure by which PPE may be decontaminated using ultraviolet (UV) radiation in biosafety cabinets (BSCs), a common element of many academic, public health, and hospital laboratories, and discuss the dose ranges needed for effective decontamination of critical PPE. We further discuss obstacles to this approach including the possibility that the UV radiation levels vary within BSCs. Effective decontamination of N95 respirator masks or surgical masks requires UV-C doses of greater than 1 Jcm-2, which would take a minimum of 4.3 hours per side when placing the N95 at the bottom of the BSCs tested in this study. Elevating the N95 mask by 48 cm (so that it lies 19 cm from the top of the BSC) would enable the delivery of germicidal doses of UV-C in 62 minutes per side. Effective decontamination of face shields likely requires a much lower UV-C dose, and may be achieved by placing the face shields at the bottom of the BSC for 20 minutes per side. Our results are intended to provide support to healthcare organizations looking for alternative methods to extend their reserves of PPE. We recognize that institutions will require robust quality control processes to guarantee the efficacy of any implemented decontamination protocol. We also recognize that in certain situations such institutional resources may not be available; while we subscribe to the general principle that some degree of decontamination is preferable to re-use without decontamination, we would strongly advise that in such cases at least some degree of on-site verification of UV dose delivery be performed","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"- Theory Division, Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Kyle J Card","author_inst":"Michigan State University"},{"author_name":"Dena Crozier","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Andrew Dhawan","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Mina Dinh","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Emily Dolson","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Nathan Farrokhian","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Vishhvaan Gopalakrishnan","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Emily Ho","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Tanush Jagdish","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Eshan S King","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Nikhil Krishnan","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Gleb Kuzmin","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jeff Maltas","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jinhan Mo","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Julia Pelesko","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jessica A Scarborough","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jacob G Scott","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Geoff Sedor","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Enze Tian","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Davis T Weaver","author_inst":"Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Xiong Yang","author_inst":"Langzhong People Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huaqiang Shen","author_inst":"Bazhong Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xianhua Xiao","author_inst":"The Second People Hospital of Neijiang"},{"author_name":"Jie Yang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Qin Wu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wen Wang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Jin Yang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wanhong Yin","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqi Xie","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yongming Tian","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Huan Liu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Bingxing Shuai","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiangrong Song","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Jin","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yan Kang","author_inst":"West China Hospital of Sichuan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"occupational and environmental health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.23.20041707","rel_title":"Serology characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection since the exposure and post symptoms onset","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.23.20041707","rel_abs":"Background Timely diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the prerequisite for treatment and preventive quarantine. The serology characteristics and complement diagnosis value of antibody test to RNA test needs to be demonstrated. Method A patient cohort study was conducted at the first affiliated hospital of Zhejiang University, China. Serial sera of COVID-19 patients were collected and total antibody (Ab), IgM and IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 were detected. The antibody dynamics during the infection were described. Results The seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG in COVID-19 patients was 98.8% (79\/80), 93.8% (75\/80) and 93.8% (75\/80), respectively. The first detectible serology marker is total antibody and followed by IgM and IgG, with a median seroconversion time of 15, 18 and 20 day post exposure (d.p.e) or 9, 10 and 12 days post onset, separately. The antibody levels increased rapidly since 6 d.p.o and accompanied with the decline of viral load. For patients in the early stage of illness (0-7d.p.o),Ab showed the highest sensitivity (64.1%) compared to the IgM and IgG (33.3% for both, p<0.001). The sensitivities of Ab, IgM and IgG detection increased to 100%, 96.7% and 93.3% two weeks later, respectively. Conclusions Typical acute antibody response is induced during the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The serology testing provides important complementation to RNA test for pathogenic specific diagnosis and helpful information to evaluate the adapted immunity status of patient. It should be strongly recommended to apply well-validated antibody tests in the clinical management and public health practice to improve the control of COVID-19 infection.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bin Lou","author_inst":"Zhejaing University"},{"author_name":"Tigndong Li","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Shufa Zheng","author_inst":"Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Yingying Su","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Zhiyong Li","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wei Liu","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Fei Yu","author_inst":"Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Shengxiang Ge","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Qianda Zou","author_inst":"Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Quan Yuan","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Sha Lin","author_inst":"Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Congming Hong","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Xiangyang Yao","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Xuejie Zhang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Dinghui Wu","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Guoliang Zhou","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wangheng Hou","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Tingting Li","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Yali Zhang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Shiyin Zhang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jian Fan","author_inst":"Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Jun Zhang","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Ningshao Xia","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Jie Yang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Qin Wu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wen Wang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Jin Yang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Chang Liu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wanhong Yin","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqi Xie","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yongming Tian","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Huan Liu","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Bingxing Shuai","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhang","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiangrong Song","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Jin","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yan Kang","author_inst":"West China Hospital of Sichuan University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.24.20042234","rel_title":"Mechanical Ventilator Milano (MVM):A Novel Mechanical Ventilator Designed for Mass Scale Production in response to the COVID-19 Pandemics","rel_date":"2020-03-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.24.20042234","rel_abs":"We present here the design of the Mechanical Ventilator Milano (MVM), a novel mechan- ical ventilator designed for mass scale production in response to the COVID-19 pandemics, to compensate for the dramatic shortage of such ventilators in many countries.

Our design is optimized to permit large sale production in short time and at a limited cost, relying on off-the-shelf components, readily available worldwide from hardware suppliers. Operation of the MVM requires only a source of compressed oxygen (or compressed medical air) and electrical power. The MVM control and monitoring unit can be connected and networked via WiFi so that no additional electrical connections are necessary other than the connection to the electrical power. At this stage the MVM is not a certified medical device. Construction of the first proto- types is starting with a team of engineers, scientists and computing experts. The purpose of this paper is to disseminate the conceptual design of the MVM broadly and to solicit feed- back from the scientific and medical community to speed the process of review, improvement and possible implementation.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Galbiati Cristiano","author_inst":"Physics Department, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08544, USA"},{"author_name":"Walter Bonivento","author_inst":"INFN Cagliari, Cagliari 09042, Italy"},{"author_name":"Mauro Caravati","author_inst":"INFN Cagliari, Cagliari 09042, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marco Razeti","author_inst":"INFN Cagliari, Cagliari 09042, Italy"},{"author_name":"Sandro DeCecco","author_inst":"Physics Department, Sapienza Universit`a di Roma, Roma 00185, Italy and INFN Sezione di Roma, Roma 00185, Italy"},{"author_name":"Giuliana Fiorillo","author_inst":"Physics Department, Universita degli Studi Federico II di Napoli, Napoli 80126, Italy and INFN Napoli, Napoli 80126, Italy"},{"author_name":"Federico Gabriele","author_inst":"INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Assergi (AQ) 67100, Italy"},{"author_name":"Roberto Tartaglia","author_inst":"INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Assergi (AQ) 67100, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Razeto","author_inst":"INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Assergi (AQ) 67100, Italy"},{"author_name":"Davide Sablone","author_inst":"INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Assergi (AQ) 67100, Italy"},{"author_name":"Eugenio Scapparone","author_inst":"INFN Bologna, Bologna 40126, Italy"},{"author_name":"Gemma Testera","author_inst":"INFN Genova, Genova 16146, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marco Rescigno","author_inst":"INFN Sezione di Roma, Roma 00185, Italy"},{"author_name":"Davide Franco","author_inst":"APC, Universite Paris Diderot, CNRS\/IN2P3, CEA\/Irfu, Obs de Paris, USPC, Paris 75205, France"},{"author_name":"Iza Kochanek","author_inst":"INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Assergi (AQ) 67100, Italy"},{"author_name":"Cary Kendziora","author_inst":"Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Batavia, IL 60510, USA"},{"author_name":"Stephen H.

The SARS-CoV-2 was found to be closely related to the SARS-CoV, based on the genomic analysis. The Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 protein (ACE2) utilized by the SARS-CoV as a receptor was found to facilitate the infection of SARS-CoV-2 as well, initiated by the binding of the spike protein to the human ACE2. Using homology modeling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation methods, we report here the detailed structure of the ACE2 in complex with the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The predicted model is highly consistent with the experimentally determined complex structures. Plausible binding modes between human ACE2 and the RBD were revealed from all-atom MD simulations. The simulation data further revealed critical residues at the complex interface and provided more details about the interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and human ACE2. Two mutants mimicking rat ACE2 were modeled to study the mutation effects on RBD binding to ACE2. The simulations showed that the N-terminal helix and the K353 of the human ACE2 alter the binding modes of the CoV2-RBD to the ACE2.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cecylia Lupala","author_inst":"Beijing Computational Science Research Center"},{"author_name":"Xuanxuan Li","author_inst":"Beijing Computational Science Research Center"},{"author_name":"Jian Lei","author_inst":"West China Hospital, Sichuan, China"},{"author_name":"Hong Chen","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Jianxun Qi","author_inst":"CAS"},{"author_name":"Haiguang Liu","author_inst":"Beijing Computational Science Research Center"},{"author_name":"Xiaodong Su","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Roberto Tartaglia","author_inst":"INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Assergi (AQ) 67100, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Razeto","author_inst":"INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Assergi (AQ) 67100, Italy"},{"author_name":"Davide Sablone","author_inst":"INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Assergi (AQ) 67100, Italy"},{"author_name":"Eugenio Scapparone","author_inst":"INFN Bologna, Bologna 40126, Italy"},{"author_name":"Gemma Testera","author_inst":"INFN Genova, Genova 16146, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marco Rescigno","author_inst":"INFN Sezione di Roma, Roma 00185, Italy"},{"author_name":"Davide Franco","author_inst":"APC, Universite Paris Diderot, CNRS\/IN2P3, CEA\/Irfu, Obs de Paris, USPC, Paris 75205, France"},{"author_name":"Iza Kochanek","author_inst":"INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Assergi (AQ) 67100, Italy"},{"author_name":"Cary Kendziora","author_inst":"Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Batavia, IL 60510, USA"},{"author_name":"Stephen H.

Traditional sequence alignment methods are not suitable and there is a need for fast alignment-free techniques for sequence analysis. Information theory and data compression algorithms provide a rich set of mathematical and computational tools to capture essential patterns in biological sequences. In 2013, our research group (Nagaraj et al., Eur. Phys. J. Special Topics 222(3-4), 2013) has proposed a novel measure known as Effort-To-Compress (ETC) based on the notion of compression-complexity to capture the information content of sequences. In this study, we propose a compression-complexity based distance measure for automatic identification of SARS coronavirus strains from a set of viruses using only short fragments of nucleotide sequences. We also demonstrate that our proposed method can correctly distinguish SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoV-1 viruses by analyzing very short segments of nucleotide sequences. This work could be extended further to enable medical practitioners in automatically identifying and characterizing SARS coronavirus strain in a fast and efficient fashion using short and\/or incomplete segments of nucleotide sequences. Potentially, the need for sequence assembly can be circumvented.\n\nNoteThe main ideas and results of this research were first presented at the International Conference on Nonlinear Systems and Dynamics (CNSD-2013) held at Indian Institute of Technology, Indore, December 12, 2013.

There are no FDA approved antivirals or vaccines for any coronavirus, including SARS-CoV-2. Current treatments for COVID-19 are limited to supportive therapies and off-label use of FDA approved drugs. Rapid development and human testing of potential antivirals is greatly needed. A quick way to test compounds with potential antiviral activity is through drug repurposing. Numerous drugs are already approved for human use and subsequently there is a good understanding of their safety profiles and potential side effects, making them easier to fast-track to clinical studies in COVID-19 patients. Here, we present data on the antiviral activity of 20 FDA approved drugs against SARS-CoV-2 that also inhibit SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We found that 17 of these inhibit SARS-CoV-2 at a range of IC50 values at non-cytotoxic concentrations. We directly follow up with seven of these to demonstrate all are capable of inhibiting infectious SARS-CoV-2 production. Moreover, we have evaluated two of these, chloroquine and chlorpromazine, in vivo using a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV model and found both drugs protect mice from clinical disease.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stuart Weston","author_inst":"University of Maryland, School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Christopher M.

To better understand the evolution of the newly emerging 2019-nCoV, in this paper, we analyze the codon usage pattern of 2019-nCoV. For this purpose, we compare the codon usage of 2019-nCoV with that of other 30 viruses belonging to the subfamily of orthocoronavirinae. We found that 2019-nCoV shows a rich composition of AT nucleotides that strongly influences its codon usage, which appears to be not optimized to human host. Then, we study the evolutionary pressures influencing the codon usage and evolutionary rates of the sequences of five conserved genes that encode the corresponding proteins (viral replicase, spike, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid) characteristic of coronaviruses. We found different patterns of both mutational bias and nature selection that affect the codon usage of these genes at different extents. Moreover, we show that the two integral membrane proteins proteins (matrix and envelope) tend to evolve slowly by accumulating nucleotide mutations on their genes. Conversely, genes encoding nucleocapsid (N), viral replicase and spike proteins are important targets for the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs, tend to evolve faster as compared to other ones. Taken together, our results suggest that the higher evolutionary rate observed for these two genes could represent a major barrier in the development of antiviral therapeutics 2019-nCoV.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maddalena Dilucca","author_inst":"La Sapienza, Roma"},{"author_name":"Athanasia Pavlopoulou","author_inst":"Izmir International Biomedicine and Genome Institute, Dokuz Eyl\u00fcl University, 35340 Balcova, Izmir, Turkey"},{"author_name":"Sergio Forcelloni","author_inst":"Sapienza University of Rome"},{"author_name":"ANDREA GIANSANTI","author_inst":"SAPIENZA UNIVERSITA DI ROMA"},{"author_name":"Alexandros G Georgakilas","author_inst":"National technical university of athens"},{"author_name":"Matthew Frieman","author_inst":"University of Maryland, School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Adam Hage","author_inst":"UTMB"},{"author_name":"Colette Pietzsch","author_inst":"UTMB"},{"author_name":"Alexander Bukreyev","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Rajsbaum","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Pei-Yong Shi","author_inst":"UTMB"},{"author_name":"Mark Bedford","author_inst":"MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Shelton Bradrick","author_inst":"UTMB"},{"author_name":"Vineet D Menachery","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Mariano A Garcia-Blanco","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Cary Kendziora","author_inst":"Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Batavia, IL 60510, USA"},{"author_name":"Stephen H.

A key question is whether SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) - the causal agent in COVID-19 - affects olfaction directly by infecting olfactory sensory neurons or their targets in the olfactory bulb, or indirectly, through perturbation of supporting cells. Here we identify cell types in the olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb that express SARS-CoV-2 cell entry molecules. Bulk sequencing revealed that mouse, non-human primate and human olfactory mucosa expresses two key genes involved in CoV-2 entry, ACE2 and TMPRSS2. However, single cell sequencing and immunostaining demonstrated ACE2 expression in support cells, stem cells, and perivascular cells; in contrast, neurons in both the olfactory epithelium and bulb did not express ACE2 message or protein. These findings suggest that CoV-2 infection of non-neuronal cell types leads to anosmia and related disturbances in odor perception in COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Brann","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School Department of Neurobiology"},{"author_name":"Tatsuya Tsukahara","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School Department of Neurobiology"},{"author_name":"Caleb Weinreb","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Koen Van den Berge","author_inst":"Department of Statistics, University of California, Berkeley; Department of Applied Mathematics, Computer Science and Statistics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgi"},{"author_name":"Boying Gong","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Chance","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California,"},{"author_name":"Iain C Macaulay","author_inst":"Earlham Institute"},{"author_name":"Hsin-jung Chou","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Russell Fletcher","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California,"},{"author_name":"Diya Das","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Kelly Street","author_inst":"Department of Data Sciences, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute; Department of Biostatistics, Harvard T.H.

To predict the inflection points, i.e., inflection time (Tmax) & maximal infection number (Imax) of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), we adopted a trial and error strategy and explored a series of approaches from simple logistic modeling (that has an asymptomatic line) to sophisticated tipping point detection techniques for detecting phase transitions but failed to obtain satisfactory results. Method: Inspired by its success in diversity-time relationship (DTR), we apply the PLEC (power law with exponential cutoff) model for detecting the inflection points of COVID-19 outbreaks. The model was previously used to extend the classic species-time relationship (STR) for general DTR (Ma 2018), and it has two secondary parameters (computed from its 3 parameters including power law scaling parameter w, taper-off parameter d to overwhelm virtually exponential growth ultimately, and a parameter c related to initial infections): one that was originally used for estimating the potential or dark biodiversity is proposed to estimate the maximal infection number (Imax) and another is proposed to determine the corresponding inflection time point (Tmax). Results: We successfully estimated the inflection points [Imax, Tmax] for most provinces ({approx} 85%) in China with error rates <5% in both Imax and Tmax. We also discussed the constraints and limitations of the proposed approach, including (i) sensitive to disruptive jumps, (ii) requiring sufficiently long datasets, and (iii) limited to unimodal outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhanshan (Sam) Ma","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Tatsuya Tsukahara","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School Department of Neurobiology"},{"author_name":"Caleb Weinreb","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Koen Van den Berge","author_inst":"Department of Statistics, University of California, Berkeley; Department of Applied Mathematics, Computer Science and Statistics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgi"},{"author_name":"Boying Gong","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Chance","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California,"},{"author_name":"Iain C Macaulay","author_inst":"Earlham Institute"},{"author_name":"Hsin-jung Chou","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Russell Fletcher","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California,"},{"author_name":"Diya Das","author_inst":"Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Kelly Street","author_inst":"Department of Data Sciences, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute; Department of Biostatistics, Harvard T.H.

Immune system dysregulation such as lymphopenia and inflammatory cytokine storm has been observed in COVID-19 patients, but it remains unclear for the change of key immune cell subsets and their states during COVID-19. Here, we applied single-cell technology to comprehensively characterize transcriptional changes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in ten patients recovered from COVID-19. Compared with healthy control, COVID-19 induced a unique signature of immune cells in humans, especially in the early recovery stage (ERS). In ERS patients, T cells were decreased remarkably, while monocytes were increased. A detailed analysis of monocytes showed that there was an increased ratio of classical CD14++ monocytes with highly inflammatory genes expression, as well as a greater abundance of CD14++IL1B+ monocytes. For nature killer (NK) cells and T cells, CD4+ T cells were significantly decreased and expressed high level of inflammatory markers, while NK cells were increased. In addition, T cells were highly expanded clone, especially in CD4+ T memory cells and CD8+ T cells. Among B cells, plasma cells were increased remarkably, and naive B cells were reduced. Our study also identified several novel B cell receptor (BCR) changes (such as IGHV1-8 and IGHV3-7), and confirmed isotypes (IGKV3-11 and IGHV3-21) previously used for virus vaccine development. The strongest pairing frequencies, IGHV3-23+IGHJ4, indicated a monoclonal state associated with SARS-CoV-2 specificity. Furthermore, integrated analysis predicated that IL-1B and M-CSF may be novel candidate target gene for inflammatory storm, and TNFSF13, IL-18 and IL-4 may be benefit for the recovery of COVID-19 patients. Our study provides the first evidence of inflammatory immune signature in early recovery stage, suggesting that the COVID-19 patients are still vulnerable after hospital discharge.

The outbreak has quickly spread to more than 100 countries reporting over 100,000 confirmed cases. Australia reported its first case of COVID-19 on 25th January 2020 and has since implemented travel restrictions to stop further introduction of the virus. Methods: We analysed daily global COVID-19 data published by the World Health Organisation to investigate the spread of the virus thus far. To assess the current risk of COVID-19 importation and local spread in Australia we predict international passenger flows into Australia during 2020. Findings: Our analysis of global data shows that Australia can expect a similar growth rate of reported cases as observed in France and the United States. We identify travel patterns of Australian citizens\/residents and foreign travellers that can inform the implementation of new and the alteration of existing travel restrictions related to COVID-19. Interpretation: Our findings identify the risk reduction potential of current travel bans, based on the proportion of returning travellers to Australia that are residents or visitors. The similarity of the exponential growth in the epidemic curve in Australia to other countries guides forecasts of COVID-19 growth in Australia, and opportunities for drawing lessons from other countries with more advanced outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jessica Liebig","author_inst":"CSIRO"},{"author_name":"Raja Jurdak","author_inst":"Queensland University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Ahmad El Shoghri","author_inst":"University of New South Wales"},{"author_name":"Dean Paini","author_inst":"CSIRO"},{"author_name":"Xiaopeng Zhang","author_inst":"Laboratory of Vaccine and Antibody Engineering, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Yingfeng Zheng","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"XiuXing Liu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Lihui Xie","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Jianmin Li","author_inst":"Laboratory of Vaccine and Antibody Engineering, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Jinguo Ye","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Xiuliang Cui","author_inst":"National Center for Liver Cancer Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Yushan Miao","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Depeng Wang","author_inst":"GrandOmics Diagnosis Co.

Furthermore, the infection curve, daily transmission replication curve, and the trend of cumulative confirmed cases were used to evaluate the effects of the public health interventions. Our results showed that the SEIRD curve model we established had a good fit and the basic reproductive number is 3.38 (95% CI, 3.25-3.48). The SEIRD curve show a small difference between the simulated number of cases and the actual number; the correlation index (H2) is 0.934, and the reproductive number (R) has been reduced from 3.38 to 0.5 under the current forty public health interventions policies of China. The actual growth curve of new cases, the virus infection curve, and the daily transmission replication curve were significantly going down under the current public health interventions.

We investigated a likely scenario of COVID-19 spreading in Brazil through the complex airport network of the country, for the 90 days after the first national occurrence of the disease. After the confirmation of the first imported cases, the lack of a proper airport entrance control resulted in the infection spreading in a manner directly proportional to the amount of flights reaching each city, following first occurrence of the virus coming from abroad. Methodology. We developed a SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model divided in a metapopulation structure, where cities with airports were demes connected by the number of flights. Subsequently, we further explored the role of Manaus airport for a rapid entrance of the pandemic into indigenous territories situated in remote places of the Amazon region. Results. The expansion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus between cities was fast, directly proportional to the airport closeness centrality within the Brazilian air transportation network. There was a clear pattern in the expansion of the pandemic, with a stiff exponential expansion of cases for all cities. The more an airport showed closeness centrality, the greater was its vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions. We discussed the weak pandemic control performance of Brazil in comparison with other tropical, developing countries, namely India and Nigeria. Finally, we proposed measures for containing virus spreading taking into consideration the scenario of high poverty.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Servio Pontes Ribeiro","author_inst":"UFOP, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Wesley Dattilo","author_inst":"Inecol, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Alcides Castro e Silva","author_inst":"Federal University of Ouro Preto"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Barbosa Reis","author_inst":"UFOP, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Aristoteles Goes-Neto","author_inst":"UFMG, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Luiz Alcantara","author_inst":"Fiocruz, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Marta Giovanetti","author_inst":"Fiocruz, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Wendel Coura-vital","author_inst":"UFOP, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Geraldo Wilson Fernandes","author_inst":"UFMG, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Vasco Ariston Azevedo","author_inst":"UFMG, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Xiuliang Cui","author_inst":"National Center for Liver Cancer Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Yushan Miao","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Depeng Wang","author_inst":"GrandOmics Diagnosis Co.

Patients who died from Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) often had comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, and chronic obstructive lung disease. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as a crucial factor that facilitates SARS-CoV2 to bind and enter host cells. To date, no study has assessed the ACE2 expression in the lungs of patients with these diseases. Here, we analyzed over 700 lung transcriptome samples of patients with comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19 and found that ACE2 was highly expressed in these patients, compared to control individuals. This finding suggests that patients with such comorbidities may have higher chances of developing severe COVID-19. We also found other genes, such as RAB1A, that can be important for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung. Correlation and network analyses revealed many potential regulators of ACE2 in the human lung, including genes related to histone modifications, such as HAT1, HDAC2, and KDM5B. In fact, epigenetic marks found in ACE2 locus were compatible to with those promoted by KDM5B. Our systems biology approach offers a possible explanation for increase of COVID-19 severity in patients with certain comorbidities.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bruna GG Pinto","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Antonio ER Oliveira","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Youvika Singh","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Leandro Jimenez","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Andre NA Goncalves","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo LT Ogava","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Rachel Creighton","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jean PS Peron","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Helder I Nakaya","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Vasco Ariston Azevedo","author_inst":"UFMG, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Xiuliang Cui","author_inst":"National Center for Liver Cancer Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Yushan Miao","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Depeng Wang","author_inst":"GrandOmics Diagnosis Co.

Nevertheless, it is a matter of current intuition that COVID-19 infected citizens are more than those detected, and sometime the infection is detected too late. Thus there are many efforts in both tracking people activities as well as diffusing low cost reliable COVID-19 tests for early detection. Starting from mortality rates of diseases caused by viruses in the same family (e.g. MERS, SARS, H1N1), we study the relations between the number of COVID-19 infections and the number of deaths, through Italian regions. We thus assess several infections being higher than the ones currently measured. We thus focus on the characterisation of the pandemic diffusion by estimating the infected number of patients versus the number of death. We use such an estimated number of infections, to foresee the effects of restriction actions adopted by governments to constrain virus diffusion. We finally think that our model can support the healthcare system to react when COVID-19 is increasing.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giuseppe Tradigo","author_inst":"University of Catanzaro"},{"author_name":"Pietro Hiram Guzzi","author_inst":"University of Catanzaro"},{"author_name":"Pierangelo Veltri","author_inst":"University of Catanzaro"},{"author_name":"Leandro Jimenez","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Andre NA Goncalves","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo LT Ogava","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Rachel Creighton","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jean PS Peron","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Helder I Nakaya","author_inst":"University of Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Vasco Ariston Azevedo","author_inst":"UFMG, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Xiuliang Cui","author_inst":"National Center for Liver Cancer Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Yushan Miao","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Depeng Wang","author_inst":"GrandOmics Diagnosis Co.
