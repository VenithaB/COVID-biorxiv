To fight against COVID-19, we carried out research for the near native SARS-CoV-2 and report here our preliminary results obtained. The pathogen of the COVID-19, the native SARS-CoV-2, was isolated, amplified and purified in a BSL-3 laboratory. The whole viral architecture of SARS-CoV-2 was examined by transmission electron microscopy (both negative staining and cryo-EM). We observed that the virion particles are roughly spherical or moderately pleiomorphic. Spikes have nail-like shape towards outside with a long body embedded in the envelope. The morphology of virion observed in our result indicates that the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is in post-fusion state, with S1 disassociated. This state revealed by cryo-EM first time could provide an important information for the identification and relevant clinical research of this new coronavirus.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chuang Liu","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen 518055, Guangdong Province, China"},{"author_name":"Yuanzhu Gao","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen 518055, Guangdong Province, China"},{"author_name":"Congcong Liu","author_inst":"Cryo-EM Centre, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen 518055, Guangdong Province, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaomin Ma","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen 518055, Guangdong Province, China"},{"author_name":"Shuman Xu","author_inst":"Cryo-EM Centre, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen 518055, Guangdong Province, China"},{"author_name":"Jing Wu","author_inst":"Cryo-EM Centre, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen 518055, Guangdong Province, China"},{"author_name":"Zheng Liu","author_inst":"Cryo-EM Centre, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen 518055, Guangdong Province, China"},{"author_name":"Peiyi Wang","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen 518055, Guangdong Province, China"},{"author_name":"Xi Xiong","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Hengyan Liu","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Jingxuan Wang","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Enfu Chen","author_inst":"Zhejiang Province Centre for Disease Control and Prevention"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.02.968818","rel_title":"Rapid metagenomic characterization of a case of imported COVID-19 in Cambodia","rel_date":"2020-03-05","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.02.968818","rel_abs":"Rapid production and publication of pathogen genome sequences during emerging disease outbreaks provide crucial public health information.

Although bats are regarded as the most likely natural hosts for HCoV-191,2, the origins of the virus remain unclear. Here, we report a novel bat-derived coronavirus, denoted RmYN02, identified from a metagenomics analysis of samples from 227 bats collected from Yunnan Province in China between May and October, 2019. RmYN02 shared 93.3% nucleotide identity with HCoV-19 at the scale of the complete virus genome and 97.2% identity in the 1ab gene in which it was the closest relative of HCoV-19. In contrast, RmYN02 showed low sequence identity (61.3%) to HCoV-19 in the receptor binding domain (RBD) and might not bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Critically, however, and in a similar manner to HCoV-19, RmYN02 was characterized by the insertion of multiple amino acids at the junction site of the S1 and S2 subunits of the Spike (S) protein. This provides strong evidence that such insertion events can occur in nature. Together, these data suggest that HCoV-19 originated from multiple naturally occurring recombination events among those viruses present in bats and other wildlife species.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hong Zhou","author_inst":"Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Xing Chen","author_inst":"Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Tao Hu","author_inst":"Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Juan Li","author_inst":"Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hao Song","author_inst":"Beijing Institutes of Life Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yanran Liu","author_inst":"Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Peihan Wang","author_inst":"Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Di Liu","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jing Yang","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Edward C.

The third extracellular domain of NTCP presents a stretch of nine aminoacids (KGIVISLVL) that is characterized by pronounced hydrophobicity and serves as receptor for a protein, preS1, showing the hydrophobic epta-peptide sequence NPLGFFP. Vitamin D-binding protein macrophage activating factor (DBP-MAF) is a multifunctional protein that is characterized by two hydrophobic regions able to bind fatty acids and vitamin D, respectively. Here we demonstrate that NTCP and DBP-MAF show significant sequence similarities as far as hydrophobic stretches of aminoacids are concerned. Alignment of the sequence of seven aminoacids preceding the 157-KGIVISLVL-165 stretch of NTCP shows four aminoacids that are identical to those of the corresponding sequence of DBP-MAF, and two that are conserved substitutions. In addition, in the sequence of DBP-MAF that is aligned with the sequence YKGIVISLVL of NTCP, there are two contiguous negatively charged aminoacids (ED) and, in the preceding epta-peptide sequence, there are three negatively charged aminoacids (D-ED), whereas in the corresponding sequence of NTCP there are only two (D--D) that are not contiguous. This concentration of negatively charged aminoacids may be involved in binding of protein inserts characterized by high density of positively charges residues. The alternating hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions described in this paper may help elucidating the biological roles of these proteins as far as protein-protein interactions are concerned.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ibne Raihan Zunaid","author_inst":"IBIO Ltd, Thailand"},{"author_name":"Stefania Pacini","author_inst":"Silver Spring Sagl"},{"author_name":"Marco Ruggiero","author_inst":"Silver Spring Sagl"},{"author_name":"Juan Li","author_inst":"Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Hao Song","author_inst":"Beijing Institutes of Life Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yanran Liu","author_inst":"Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Peihan Wang","author_inst":"Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Di Liu","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jing Yang","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Edward C.

The resulting data provide a rare opportunity to measure key metrics of disease course, transmission, and the impact of control. Methods The Shenzhen CDC identified 391 SARS-CoV-2 cases from January 14 to February 12, 2020 and 1286 close contacts. We compare cases identified through symptomatic surveillance and contact tracing, and estimate the time from symptom onset to confirmation, isolation, and hospitalization. We estimate metrics of disease transmission and analyze factors influencing transmission risk. Findings Cases were older than the general population (mean age 45) and balanced between males (187) and females (204). Ninety-one percent had mild or moderate clinical severity at initial assessment. Three have died, 225 have recovered (median time to recovery is 21 days). Cases were isolated on average 4.6 days after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 1.9 days. Household contacts and those travelling with a case where at higher risk of infection (ORs 6 and 7) than other close contacts. The household secondary attack rate was 15%, and children were as likely to be infected as adults. The observed reproductive number was 0.4, with a mean serial interval of 6.3 days. Interpretation Our data on cases as well as their infected and uninfected close contacts provide key insights into SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology. This work shows that heightened surveillance and isolation, particularly contact tracing, reduces the time cases are infectious in the community, thereby reducing R. Its overall impact, however, is uncertain and highly dependent on the number of asymptomatic cases. We further show that children are at similar risk of infection as the general population, though less likely to have severe symptoms; hence should be considered in analyses of transmission and control.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qifang Bi","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Yongsheng Wu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Shujiang Mei","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Chenfei Ye","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xuan Zou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Zhen Zhang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaojian Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Lan Wei","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Shaun A Truelove","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Tong Zhang","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Wei Gao","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Cong Cheng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xiujuan Tang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoliang Wu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Yu Wu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Binbin Sun","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Suli Huang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Yu Sun","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Juncen Zhang","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Ting Ma","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Justin Lessler","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Teijian Feng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.04.975995","rel_title":"Strong evolutionary convergence of receptor-binding protein spike between COVID-19 and SARS-related coronaviruses","rel_date":"2020-03-04","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.04.975995","rel_abs":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses (e.g., 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV) are phylogenetically distantly related, but both are capable of infecting human hosts via the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and cause similar clinical and pathological features, suggesting their phenotypic convergence. Yet, the molecular basis that underlies their phenotypic convergence remains unknown. Here, we used a recently developed molecular phyloecological approach to examine the molecular basis leading to their phenotypic convergence. Our genome-level analyses show that the spike protein, which is responsible for receptor binding, has undergone significant Darwinian selection along the branches related to 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV. Further examination shows an unusually high proportion of evolutionary convergent amino acid sites in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein between COVID-19 and SARS-related CoV clades, leading to the phylogenetic uniting of their RBD protein sequences. In addition to the spike protein, we also find the evolutionary convergence of its partner protein, ORF3a, suggesting their possible co-evolutionary convergence. Our results demonstrate a strong adaptive evolutionary convergence between COVID-19 and SARS-related CoV, possibly facilitating their adaptation to similar or identical receptors. Finally, it should be noted that many observed bat SARS-like CoVs that have an evolutionary convergent RBD sequence with 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV may be pre-adapted to human host receptor ACE2, and hence would be potential new coronavirus sources to infect humans in the future.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yonghua Wu","author_inst":"Northeast Normal University, China"},{"author_name":"Yongsheng Wu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Shujiang Mei","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Chenfei Ye","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xuan Zou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Zhen Zhang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaojian Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Lan Wei","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Shaun A Truelove","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Tong Zhang","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Wei Gao","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Cong Cheng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xiujuan Tang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoliang Wu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Yu Wu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Binbin Sun","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Suli Huang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Yu Sun","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Juncen Zhang","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Ting Ma","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Justin Lessler","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Teijian Feng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"evolutionary biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.01.20029611","rel_title":"Systematic Review of the Registered Clinical Trials of Coronavirus Diseases 2019 (COVID-19)","rel_date":"2020-03-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.01.20029611","rel_abs":"Background: Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), many researchers in China have immediately carried out clinical research scheme of the COVID-19. But, there is still a lack of systematic review of registered clinical trials. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of the clinical trials of COVID-19 to summarize the characteristics of the COVID-19 registered clinical trials. Methods: This study is based on the recommendations of the PRISMA in the Cochrane handbook. The databases from the Chinese Clinical Registration Center and the ClinicalTrials.gov were searched to collect the registered clinical trials of COVID-19. The retrieval inception date is February 9, 2020. Two researchers independently selected the literature based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, extracted data and evaluated the risk of bias. Results: A total of 75 registered clinical trials (63 interventional studies and 12 observational studies) of COVID-19 were obtained. A majority of clinical trials were sponsored by Chinese hospitals. Only 11 trials have begun to recruit patients, and none of the registered clinical trials had been completed; 34 trials were early clinical exploratory trials or in a pre-experiment stage, 15 trials belonged to phrase and 4 trials were phrase . The methods of intervention included traditional Chinese medicine involving 26 trials, Western medicine involving 30 trials, and integrated traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine involving 19 trials. The subjects were mainly non-critical adult patients ([&ge;] 18 years old). The median sample size of the trials was 100 (IQR: 60 - 200), and the median execute time of the trials was 179 d (IQR: 94 - 366 d). The main outcomes were clinical observation and examinations. Overall, both the methodology quality of interventional trials and observational studies were low. Conclusions: Disorderly and intensive clinical trials of COVID-19 using traditional Chinese medicine and western medicine are ongoing or will being carried out in China. However, based on the low methodology quality and small sample size and long studies execute time, we will not be able to obtain reliable, high-quality clinical evidence about COVID-19 treatment in the near future. Improving the quality of study design, prioritizing promising drugs, and using different designs and statistical methods are worth advocating and recommending for the clinical trials of COVID-19 in China.","rel_num_authors":0,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yonghua Wu","author_inst":"Northeast Normal University, China"},{"author_name":"Yongsheng Wu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Shujiang Mei","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Chenfei Ye","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xuan Zou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Zhen Zhang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaojian Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Lan Wei","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Shaun A Truelove","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Tong Zhang","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Wei Gao","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Cong Cheng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xiujuan Tang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoliang Wu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Yu Wu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Binbin Sun","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Suli Huang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Yu Sun","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Juncen Zhang","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Ting Ma","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Justin Lessler","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Teijian Feng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.02.20029306","rel_title":"Clinical Characteristics of Patients with Severe Pneumonia Caused by the 2019 Novel Coronavirus in Wuhan, China","rel_date":"2020-03-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.02.20029306","rel_abs":"Abstract Background: A new virus broke out in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and was later named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The clinical characteristics of severe pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV are still not clear. Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore the clinical characteristics and risk factors of the severe pneumonia caused by the 2019-nCoV in Wuhan, China. Method: The study included patients hospitalized at the central hospital of Wuhan who had been diagnosed with a pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus. Clinical features, chronic co-morbidities, demographic data, laboratory examinations, and chest computed tomography (CT) scans were reviewed through electronic medical records. SPSS was used for data analysis to explore the clinical characteristics and risk factors of the patients with the severe pneumonia. Results: A total of 110 patients diagnosed with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia were included in the study, including 38 with severe pneumonia and 72 with non-severe pneumonia. Statistical analysis showed that advanced age, an increase of D-dimer, and a decrease of lymphocytes were characteristics of the patients with severe pneumonia. Moreover, in the early stage of the disease, chest CT scans of patients with the severe pneumonia showed the illness can progress rapidly. Conclusions: Advanced age, lymphocyte decline, and D-dimer elevation are important characteristics of patients with severe pneumonia. Clinicians should focus on these characteristics to identify high-risk patients at an early stage.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yafei Wang","author_inst":"The central hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Ying Zhou","author_inst":"The central hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Zhen Yang","author_inst":"The central hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Dongping Xia","author_inst":"The central hospital of Wuhan"},{"author_name":"Shuang Geng","author_inst":"The central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhen Zhang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaojian Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Lan Wei","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Shaun A Truelove","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Tong Zhang","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Wei Gao","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Cong Cheng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xiujuan Tang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoliang Wu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Yu Wu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Binbin Sun","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Suli Huang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Yu Sun","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Juncen Zhang","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Ting Ma","author_inst":"Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China"},{"author_name":"Justin Lessler","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Teijian Feng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shenzhen, China"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.01.20029819","rel_title":"COVID-19 Epidemic Outside China: 34 Founders and Exponential Growth","rel_date":"2020-03-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.01.20029819","rel_abs":"Background: In December 2019, pneumonia infected with a novel coronavirus burst in Wuhan, China.

A large number of medical staff were dispersed for Wuhan city and Hubei province to aid COVID-19 control. Psychological stress, especially vicarious traumatization (VT) caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, should not be ignored. To address this concern, the study employed a total of 214 general public (GP) and 526 nurses to evaluate VT scores via a mobile app-based questionnaire. Results showed that the VT scores slightly increased across periods of aiding COVID-19 control, although no statistical difference was noted (P = 0.083). However, the study found lower scores for VT in nurses [median = 69; interquartile range (IQR) = 56-85] than those of the GP (median = 75.5; IQR = 62-88.3) (P = 0.017). In addition, the VT scores for front-line nurses (FLNs; median = 64; IQR = 52-75), including scores for physiological and psychological responses, were significantly lower than those of non-front-line nurses (nFLNs; median = 75.5; IQR = 63-92) (P < 0.001). Interestingly, the VT scores of the GP were significantly higher than those of the FLNs (P < 0.001). However, no statistical difference was observed compared with those of nFLNs (P > 0.05). Importantly, nFLNs are more likely to suffer from VT, which might be related to two factors, namely, gender [odds ratio (OR) = 3.1717; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 4.247-18.808; P = 0.002] and fertility [OR = 2.072; 95%CI = 0.626-24.533; P = 0.039]. Therefore, increased attention should be paid to the psychological problems of the medical staff, especially nFLNs, and GP under the situation of the spread and control of COVID-19. Early strategies that aim to prevent and treat VT in medical staff and GP are extremely necessary.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhenyu Li","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jingwu Ge","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Meiling Yang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jianping Feng","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Mei Qiao","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Riyue Jiang","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Jiangjiang Bi","author_inst":"Huangzhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Gaofeng Zhan","author_inst":"Huangzhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xiaolin Xu","author_inst":"Huangzhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Long Wang","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Qin Zhou","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Chenliang Zhou","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yinbing Pan","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Shijiang Liu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Haiwei Zhang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jianjun Yang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Bin Zhu","author_inst":"The Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University,"},{"author_name":"Yimin Hu","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Changzhou Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Kenji Hashimoto","author_inst":"Chiba University Center for Forensic Mental Health"},{"author_name":"Yan Jia","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Haofei Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Rong Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Cunming Liu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chun Yang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.29.20029413","rel_title":"The spatiotemporal estimation of the dynamic risk and the international transmission of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak: A global perspective","rel_date":"2020-03-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.29.20029413","rel_abs":"An ongoing novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia infection outbreak called COVID-19 started in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019. It both spread rapidly to all provinces in China and started spreading around the world quickly through international human movement from January 2020. Currently, the spatiotemporal epidemic transmission patterns, prediction models, and possible risk analysis for the future are insufficient for COVID-19 but we urgently need relevant information, particularly from the global perspective. We have developed a novel two-stage simulation model to simulate the spatiotemporal changes in the number of COVID-19 cases and estimate the future worldwide risk. Based on the connectivity of countries to China and the country's medical and epidemic prevention capabilities, different scenarios are generated to analyze the possible transmission throughout the world and use this information to evaluate each country's vulnerability to and the dynamic risk of COVID-19. Countries' vulnerability to the COVID-19 outbreak from China is calculated for 63 countries around the world. Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Japan are the most vulnerable areas. The relationship between each country's vulnerability and days before the first imported case occurred shows a very high exponential decrease. The cumulative number of cases in each country also has a linear relationship with vulnerability, which can compare and quantify the initial epidemic prevention capabilities to various countries' management strategies. In total, 1,000 simulation results of future cases around the world are generated for the spatiotemporal risk assessment. According to the simulation results of this study, if there is no specific medicine for it, it will likely form a global pandemic. This method can be used as a preliminary risk assessment of the spatiotemporal spread for a new global epidemic. * Note: This study was completed on February 15, 2020.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yuan-Chien Lin","author_inst":"Department of Civil Engineering, National Central University"},{"author_name":"Wan-Ju Chi","author_inst":"Department of Civil Engineering, National Central University"},{"author_name":"Yu-Ting Lin","author_inst":"Department of Civil Engineering, National Central University"},{"author_name":"Chun-Yeh Lai","author_inst":"Department of Civil Engineering, National Central University"},{"author_name":"Mei Qiao","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Riyue Jiang","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Jiangjiang Bi","author_inst":"Huangzhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Gaofeng Zhan","author_inst":"Huangzhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xiaolin Xu","author_inst":"Huangzhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Long Wang","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Qin Zhou","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Chenliang Zhou","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yinbing Pan","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Shijiang Liu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Haiwei Zhang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jianjun Yang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Bin Zhu","author_inst":"The Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University,"},{"author_name":"Yimin Hu","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Changzhou Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Kenji Hashimoto","author_inst":"Chiba University Center for Forensic Mental Health"},{"author_name":"Yan Jia","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Haofei Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Rong Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Cunming Liu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chun Yang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.02.29.20029561","rel_title":"A simple model to assess Wuhan lock-down effect and region efforts during COVID-19 epidemic in China Mainland","rel_date":"2020-03-03","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.02.29.20029561","rel_abs":"Since COVID-19 emerged in early December, 2019 in Wuhan and swept across China Mainland, a series of large-scale public health interventions, especially Wuhan lock-down combined with nationwide traffic restrictions and Stay At Home Movement, have been taken by the government to control the epidemic. Based on Baidu Migration data and the confirmed cases data, we identified two key factors affecting the later (e.g February 27, 2020) cumulative confirmed cases in non-Wuhan region (y). One is the sum travelers from Wuhan during January 20 to January 26 (x1), which had higher infected probability but lower transmission ability because the human-to-human transmission risk of COVID-19 was confirmed and announced on January 20. The other is the seed cases from Wuhan before January 19, which had higher transmission ability and could be represented with the confirmed cases before January 29 (x2) due to a mean 10-day delay between infection and detection. A simple yet effective regression model then was established as follow: y= 70.0916+0.0054*x1+2.3455*x2 (n = 44, R2 = 0.9330, P<10-7). Even the lock-down date only delay or in advance 3 days, the estimated confirmed cases by February 27 in non-Wuhan region will increase 35.21% or reduce 30.74% - 48.59%. Although the above interventions greatly reduced the human mobility, Wuhan lock-down combined with nationwide traffic restrictions and Stay At Home Movement do have a determining effect on the ongoing spread of COVID-19 across China Mainland. The strategy adopted by China has changed the fast-rising curve of newly diagnosed cases, the international community should learn from lessons of Wuhan and experience from China. Efforts of 29 Provinces and 44 prefecture-level cities against COVID-19 were also assessed preliminarily according to the interpretive model.

Here, we collected public datasets (bulk RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq) to indicate the expression and the distribution of ACE2 in pancreas (in both exocrine glands and islets). And further, clinical data including mild and severe patients with COVID-19 demonstrated there existed mild pancreatitis. In the 67 severe cases, 11 patients (16.41%) showed elevated levels of both amylase and lipase, and 5 patients (7.46%) showed imaging alterations. Only one patient (1.85%) showed elevated levels of both amylase and lipase in 54 mild cases, without imaging changes.

An in silico approach based on the available virus genome was applied to identify 19 high immunogenic B-cell epitopes and 499 human-leukocyte-antigen (HLA) restricted T-cell epitopes. Thirty multi-epitope peptide vaccines were designed by iNeo Suite, and manufactured by solid-phase synthesis. Docking analysis showed stable hydrogen bonds of epitopes with their corresponding HLA alleles. When four vaccine peptide candidates from the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were selected to immunize mice, a significantly larger amount of IgG in serum as well as an increase of CD19+ cells in ILNs was observed in peptide-immunized mice compared to the control mice. The ratio of IFN-{gamma}-secreting lymphocytes in CD4+ or CD8+ cells in the peptides-immunized mice were higher than that in the control mice. There were also a larger number of IFN-{gamma}-secreting T cells in spleen in the peptides-immunized mice. This study screened antigenic B-cell and T-cell epitopes in all encoded proteins of SARS-CoV-2, and further designed multi-epitope based peptide vaccine against viral structural proteins.

We extend the SIR model to incorporate various types of time-varying quarantine protocols, including government-level macro isolation policies and community-level micro inspection measures. We develop a calibration procedure for under-reported infected cases. This toolbox provides forecast, in both online and offline forms, of turning points of interest, including the time when daily infected proportion becomes smaller than the previous ones and the time when daily infected proportions becomes smaller than that of daily removed proportion, as well as the ending time of the epidemic.

Despite respiratory symptoms, hepatic injury has also been observed in clinical settings. This study aimed to investigate the risk factors involved with hepatic injury in the patients with COVID-19. Methods: A total of 85 hospitalized patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in Beijing Youan Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. According to liver function, they were divided into ALT normal group (n=52) and ALT elevation group (n=33). Clinical features and laboratory data were compared between the two groups. The independent risk factors for liver injury were analyzed. Results: There were 33 patients with hepatic injury in our study, accounting for 38.8% (33\/85). The patients in ALT elevation group were older than those in ALT normal group. The levels of lactic acid, CRP, myoglobin, and neutrophils were significantly higher in ALT elevation group. The lymphocytes and albumin were significantly lower in ALT elevation group. The proportion of severe and critical patients in ALT elevation group was significantly higher. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed CRP [&ge;]20 mg\/L and lymphocyte count< 1.1*10^9\/L were independently related to hepatic injury. Conclusions: Lymphopenia and CRP may serve as the risk factors related to hepatic injury in patients with COVID-19, which might be related to inflammatory cytokine storm in liver injury. Early detection and timely treatment of hepatic injury in patients with COVID-19 are necessary.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lu Li","author_inst":"Difficult & Complicated Liver Diseases and Artificial Liver Center, Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Shuang Li","author_inst":"Difficult & Complicated Liver Diseases and Artificial Liver Center, Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Manman Xu","author_inst":"Difficult & Complicated Liver Diseases and Artificial Liver Center, Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Pengfei Yu","author_inst":"Beijing Municipal Key Laboratory of Liver Failure and Artificial Liver Treatment Research, Beijing, China, 100069"},{"author_name":"Sujun Zheng","author_inst":"Difficult & Complicated Liver Diseases and Artificial Liver Center, Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhongping Duan","author_inst":"Difficult & Complicated Liver Diseases and Artificial Liver Center, Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jing Liu","author_inst":"Hemodialysis Room, Urinary Center, Beijing  Youan  Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China,100069"},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"Difficult & Complicated Liver Diseases and Artificial Liver Center, Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University"},{"author_name":"Junfeng Li","author_inst":"Institute of Infectious Diseases, Department of Infectious Diseases, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Kui Wang","author_inst":"Hangzhou Neoantigen Therapeutics Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Xinlei Zhuang","author_inst":"College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Shanshan Zhang","author_inst":"Hangzhou Neoantigen Therapeutics Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China; Zhejiang California International Nanosystems Institute, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Shuqing Chen","author_inst":"Hangzhou Neoantigen Therapeutics Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China; College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Zhejiang California Inter"},{"author_name":"Fan Mo","author_inst":"Hangzhou Neoantigen Therapeutics Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China; College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Vancouver Prostate Centre"},{"author_name":"Haiwei Zhang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jianjun Yang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University"},{"author_name":"Bin Zhu","author_inst":"The Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University,"},{"author_name":"Yimin Hu","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Changzhou Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Kenji Hashimoto","author_inst":"Chiba University Center for Forensic Mental Health"},{"author_name":"Yan Jia","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Haofei Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Rong Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Cunming Liu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chun Yang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.02.973255","rel_title":"Evidence for RNA editing in the transcriptome of 2019 Novel Coronavirus","rel_date":"2020-03-03","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.02.973255","rel_abs":"The COVID-19 outbreak has become a global health risk and understanding the response of the host to the SARS-CoV-2 virus will help to contrast the disease. Editing by host deaminases is an innate restriction process to counter viruses, and it is not yet known whether it operates against Coronaviruses. Here we analyze RNA sequences from bronchoalveolar lavage fluids derived from infected patients. We identify nucleotide changes that may be signatures of RNA editing: Adenosine-to-Inosine changes from ADAR deaminases and Cytosine-to-Uracil changes from APOBEC ones. A mutational analysis of genomes from different strains of human-hosted Coronaviridae reveals mutational patterns compatible to those observed in the transcriptomic data. Our results thus suggest that both APOBECs and ADARs are involved in Coronavirus genome editing, a process that may shape the fate of both virus and patient.\n\nFor the casual ReaderJust to make a few things clear: - RNA editing and DNA editing are PHYSIOLOGICAL processes. Organisms uses them to (a) try to fight viruses, (b) increase heterogeneity inside cells (on many levels), (c) recognise their own RNA.\n- our work suggests that: (a) cells use RNA editing in trying to deal with Coronaviruses. We don't know to what extent they succeed (and it would be nice if we could help them). (b) Whatever happens, mutations inserted by RNA editing fuel viral evolution. We don't know whether viruses actively exploit this.\n- If you (scientist or not) think our work suggests ANYTHING ELSE, contact us. It can be a first step to help fight these !@#$ coronavirus, or towards a Nobel prize - but we need to discuss it thoroughly.\n- If you think these cellular processes are fascinating, join the club and contact us.

Design Cross-sectional Setting Multicenter Participants A total of 52 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and their initial CT images were enrolled from 5 designated hospitals in Ankang, Lishui, Zhenjiang, Lanzhou, and Linxia between January 23, 2020 and February 8, 2020. As of February 20, patients remained in hospital or with non-findings in CT were excluded. Therefore, 31 patients with 72 lesion segments were included in the final analysis. Intervention CT radiomics models based on logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) were developed on features extracted from pneumonia lesions in training and inter-validation datasets. The predictive performance was further evaluated in test dataset on lung lobe- and patients-level. Main outcomes Short-term hospital stay ([&le;]10 days) and long-term hospital stay (>10 days). Results The CT radiomics models based on 6 second-order features were effective in discriminating short- and long-term hospital stay in patients with pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, with areas under the curves of 0.97 (95%CI 0.83-1.0) and 0.92 (95%CI 0.67-1.0) by LR and RF, respectively, in the test dataset. The LR model showed a sensitivity and specificity of 1.0 and 0.89, and the RF model showed similar performance with sensitivity and specificity of 0.75 and 1.0 in test dataset. Conclusions The machine learning-based CT radiomics models showed feasibility and accuracy for predicting hospital stay in patients with pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaolong Qi","author_inst":"CHESS-COVID-19 center, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Zicheng Jiang","author_inst":"CHESS-COVID-19 center, Ankang Central Hospital, Ankang, China"},{"author_name":"QIAN YU","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Molecular and Functional Imaging, Zhongda Hospital, Medical School, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"},{"author_name":"Chuxiao Shao","author_inst":"CHESS-COVID-19 center, Zhejiang University Lishui Hospital & Lishui Central Hospital, Lishui, China"},{"author_name":"Hongguang Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Critical Care Medicine, The Affiliated Third Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China"},{"author_name":"Hongmei Yue","author_inst":"CHESS-COVID-19 center, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Baoyi Ma","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, The People Hospital of LinXia Hui Prefecture, Linxia, China"},{"author_name":"Yuancheng Wang","author_inst":"3.\tDepartment of Radiology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Molecular and Functional Imaging, Zhongda Hospital, Medical School, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"},{"author_name":"Chuan Liu","author_inst":"CHESS-COVID-19 center, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Xiangpan Meng","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Molecular and Functional Imaging, Zhongda Hospital, Medical School, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"},{"author_name":"Shan Huang","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Molecular and Functional Imaging, Zhongda Hospital, Medical School, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"},{"author_name":"Jitao Wang","author_inst":"CHESS-COVID-19 center, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Dan Xu","author_inst":"CHESS-COVID-19 center, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Junqiang Lei","author_inst":"CHESS-COVID-19 center, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Guanghang Xie","author_inst":"CHESS-COVID-19 center, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Huihong Huang","author_inst":"CHESS-COVID-19 center, Ankang Central Hospital, Ankang, China"},{"author_name":"Jie Yang","author_inst":"CHESS-COVID-19 center, Zhejiang University Lishui Hospital & Lishui Central Hospital, Lishui, China"},{"author_name":"Jiansong Ji","author_inst":"CHESS-COVID-19 center, Zhejiang University Lishui Hospital & Lishui Central Hospital, Lishui, China"},{"author_name":"Hongqiu Pan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Critical Care Medicine, The Affiliated Third Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China"},{"author_name":"Shengqiang Zou","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Critical Care Medicine, The Affiliated Third Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China"},{"author_name":"Shenghong Ju","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Molecular and Functional Imaging, Zhongda Hospital, Medical School, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"},{"author_name":"Diona Scharton","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Jessica Plante","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Divya Mirchandani","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Stephen Widen","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Krishna Narayanan","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Shinji Makino","author_inst":"Texas Univ"},{"author_name":"Thomas Ksiazek","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston"},{"author_name":"Kenneth S.

Methods: This study enrolled 48 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the General Hospital of Central Theater Command, PLA, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China. The patients were divided into three groups according to the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (version 6) published by the National Health Commission of China. The clinical and laboratory data were collected. The serum viral load detection and serum IL-6 levels were determined. Except for routine statistical analysis, Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) analysis was used to establish a patient status prediction model based on real-time RT-PCR Ct value. Findings: The Result showed that cases with RNAaemia were exclusively confirmed in critically ill patients group and appeared to reflect the illness severity. Further more, the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 levels were significantly elevated in critically ill patients, which is almost 10-folds higher than those in other patients. More importantly, the extremely high IL-6 level was closely correlated with the incidence of RNAaemia (R=0.902) and the vital signs of COVID-19 patients (R= -0.682). Interpretation: Serum SARS-CoV-2 viral load (RNAaemia) is strongly associated with cytokine storm and can be used to predict the poor prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, our results strongly suggest that cytokine IL-6 should be considered as a therapeutic target in critically ill patients with excessive inflammatory response.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaohua Chen","author_inst":"General Hospital of Central Theater Command, PLA"},{"author_name":"Binghong Zhao","author_inst":"General Hospital of Central Theater Command, PLA"},{"author_name":"Yueming Qu","author_inst":"Huazhong Agricultural University"},{"author_name":"Yurou Chen","author_inst":"Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Jie Xiong","author_inst":"Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yong Feng","author_inst":"Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Dong Men","author_inst":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy  of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Qianchuan Huang","author_inst":"General Hospital of Central Theater Command, PLA"},{"author_name":"Ying Liu","author_inst":"General Hospital of Central Theater Command, PLA"},{"author_name":"Bo Yang","author_inst":"General Hospital of Central Theater Command, PLA"},{"author_name":"Jinya Ding","author_inst":"General Hospital of Central Theater Command, PLA"},{"author_name":"Feng Li","author_inst":"Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Dan Xu","author_inst":"CHESS-COVID-19 center, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Junqiang Lei","author_inst":"CHESS-COVID-19 center, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Guanghang Xie","author_inst":"CHESS-COVID-19 center, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Huihong Huang","author_inst":"CHESS-COVID-19 center, Ankang Central Hospital, Ankang, China"},{"author_name":"Jie Yang","author_inst":"CHESS-COVID-19 center, Zhejiang University Lishui Hospital & Lishui Central Hospital, Lishui, China"},{"author_name":"Jiansong Ji","author_inst":"CHESS-COVID-19 center, Zhejiang University Lishui Hospital & Lishui Central Hospital, Lishui, China"},{"author_name":"Hongqiu Pan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Critical Care Medicine, The Affiliated Third Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China"},{"author_name":"Shengqiang Zou","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases and Critical Care Medicine, The Affiliated Third Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China"},{"author_name":"Shenghong Ju","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Molecular and Functional Imaging, Zhongda Hospital, Medical School, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"},{"author_name":"Diona Scharton","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Jessica Plante","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Divya Mirchandani","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Stephen Widen","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Krishna Narayanan","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Shinji Makino","author_inst":"Texas Univ"},{"author_name":"Thomas Ksiazek","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston"},{"author_name":"Kenneth S.

The antibody response in infected patient remains largely unknown, and the clinical values of antibody testing have not been fully demonstrated. Methods A total of 173 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. Their serial plasma samples (n = 535) collected during the hospitalization period were tested for total antibodies (Ab), IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 using immunoassays. The dynamics of antibodies with the progress and severity of disease was analyzed. Findings Among 173 patients, the seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG was 93.1% (161\/173), 82.7% (143\/173) and 64.7% (112\/173), respectively. Twelve patients who had not seroconverted were those only blood samples at the early stage of illness were collected. The seroconversion sequentially appeared for Ab, IgM and then IgG, with a median time of 11, 12 and 14 days, respectively. The presence of antibodies was < 40% among patients in the first 7 days of illness, and then rapidly increased to 100.0%, 94.3% and 79.8% for Ab, IgM and IgG respectively since day 15 after onset. In contrast, the positive rate of RNA decreased from 66.7% (58\/87) in samples collected before day 7 to 45.5% (25\/55) during days 15 to 39. Combining RNA and antibody detections significantly improved the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for COVID-19 patients (p < 0.001), even in early phase of 1-week since onset (p = 0.007). Moreover, a higher titer of Ab was independently associated with a worse clinical classification (p = 0.006). Interpretation The antibody detection offers vital clinical information during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The findings provide strong empirical support for the routine application of serological testing in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Juanjuan Zhao Jr.","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Quan Yuan","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Haiyan Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital,"},{"author_name":"Wei Liu","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Xuejiao Liao","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yingying Su","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Xin Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jing Yuan","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tingdong Li","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jinxiu Li","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shen Qian","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Congming Hong","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Fuxiang Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yingxia Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhaoqin Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qing He","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhiyong Li","author_inst":"School of Public Health, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Bin He","author_inst":"School of Public Health & School of Life Science, Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Tianying Zhang","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Shengxiang Ge","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Zhang","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Ningshao Xia","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital,"},{"author_name":"Stephen Widen","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Krishna Narayanan","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Shinji Makino","author_inst":"Texas Univ"},{"author_name":"Thomas Ksiazek","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston"},{"author_name":"Kenneth S.

There is a paucity of data concerning coinfection with other common respiratory pathogens in COVID-19 patients outside of Wuhan. Methods: We conducted a double-centre study recruiting 68 patients with severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection confirmed by nucleic acid testing in Qingdao and Wuhan from January 17 to February 16, 2020. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed to detect the specific IgM antibody against common respiratory pathogens in collected acute phase serum. Results: Of the 68 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 30 (44.12%) were from Qingdao. The median age of Qingdao and Wuhan patients were 50 (IQR: 37-59) and 31 (IQR: 28-38) years, respectively, and the majority of patients were female in Qingdao (60.00%) and Wuhan (55.26%). Among COVID-19 patients in Qingdao, 24 (80.00%) of them had IgM antibodies against at least one respiratory pathogen, whereas only one (2.63%) of the patients in Wuhan had positive results for serum IgM antibody detection (P<0.0001). The most common respiratory pathogens detected in Qingdao COVID-19 patients were influenza virus A (60.00%) and influenza virus B (53.33%), followed by mycoplasma pneumoniae (23.33%) and legionella pneumophila (20.00%). While the pattern for coinfection in patients with community-acquired pneumonia in Qingdao was quite different, with a positive rate of only 20.90%. Interpretation: We reported a large proportion of COVID-19 patients with coinfection of seasonal respiratory pathogens in Qingdao, northeast China, which differed greatly from the patients in Wuhan, central China. Precautions are needed when dealing with COVID-19 patients beyond the epidemic centre who have coinfection with other respiratory pathogens. We highly recommend adding SARS-CoV-2 to routine diagnostic testing in capable hospitals to prevent misdetection of the virus.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Quansheng Xing","author_inst":"Qingdao Women and Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guoju Li","author_inst":"Qingdao Women and Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuhan Xing","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Ting Chen","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Wenjie Li","author_inst":"Qingdao Women and Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wei Ni","author_inst":"Qingdao Women and Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kai Deng","author_inst":"Qingdao Chest Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ruqin Gao","author_inst":"Qingdao Municipal Centre of Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Changzheng Chen","author_inst":"Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University"},{"author_name":"Yang Gao","author_inst":"Qingdao Women and Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qiang Li","author_inst":"Qingdao Women and Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guiling Yu","author_inst":"Qingdao Women and Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jianning Tong","author_inst":"Qingdao Women and Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wei Li","author_inst":"Qingdao Women and Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guiliang Hao","author_inst":"Qingdao Women and Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yue Sun","author_inst":"Qingdao Women and Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ai Zhang","author_inst":"Qingdao Women and Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qin Wu","author_inst":"Qingdao Women and Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zipu Li","author_inst":"Qingdao Women and Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Silin Pan","author_inst":"Qingdao Women and Childrens Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun Zhang","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Ningshao Xia","author_inst":"National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital,"},{"author_name":"Stephen Widen","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Krishna Narayanan","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Shinji Makino","author_inst":"Texas Univ"},{"author_name":"Thomas Ksiazek","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston"},{"author_name":"Kenneth S.

The features of COVID-19patients withand without pneumonia,SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility in asymptomatic carriers, and factors predicting disease progression remain unknown. Methods: We collected information on clinical characteristics, exposure history, andlaboratory examinations of all laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to PLA General Hospital. Cox regression analysis was applied to identify prognostic factors. The last follow-up was February 18, 2020. Results:We characterized 55 consecutive COVID-19 patients. The mean incubation was 8.42(95% confidence interval [CI], 6.55-10.29) days. The mean SARS-CoV-2-positive duration from first positive test to clearance was 9.71(95%CI, 8.21-11.22) days. COVID-19 course was approximately 2 weeks. Asymptomatic carriers might transmit SARS-CoV-2. Compared with patients without pneumonia, those with pneumonia were 15 years older and had a higher rate of hypertension, higher frequencies of having a fever and cough, and higher levels of interleukin-6 (14.61 vs. 8.06pg\/mL, P=0.040), B lymphocyte proportion (13.0% vs.10.0%, P=0.024), low account (<190\/L) of CD8+ T cells (33.3% vs. 0, P=0.019). Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that circulating interleukin-6 andlactate independently predicted COVID-19 progression, with a hazard ratio (95%CI) of 1.052 (1.000-1.107) and 1.082 (1.013-1.155), respectively. During disease course,T lymphocytes were generally lower,neutrophils higher, in pneumonia patients than in pneumonia-free patients. CD8+ lymphocytes did not increase at the 20th days after illness onset. Conclusion: The epidemiological features areimportant for COVID-19 prophylaxis. Circulating interleukin-6 and lactateare independent prognostic factors. CD8+ T cell exhaustion might be critical in the development of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Penghui Yang","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yibo Ding","author_inst":"Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zhe Xu","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rui Pu","author_inst":"Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ping Li","author_inst":"Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jin Yan","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jiluo Liu","author_inst":"Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fanping Meng","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Huang","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Shi","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tianjun Jiang","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Enqiang Qin","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Min Zhao","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dawei Zhang","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Peng Zhao","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lingxiang Yu","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhaohai Wang","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhixian Hong","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhaohui Xiao","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qing Xi","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dexi Zhao","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Peng Yu","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Caizhong Zhu","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhu Chen","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shaogeng Zhang","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Junsheng Ji","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guangwen Cao","author_inst":"Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fusheng Wang","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kenneth S.

Transmission models were fit to each virus, with disruption of contact rates and care-seeking informed by data on local traffic volumes and hospital admissions. RESULTS: Disruption in contact patterns reduced effective contact rates during the intervention period by 16% to 95%, and cumulative disease incidence through the remainder of the season by 3% to 9%. Incidence reductions were greatest for viruses that were peaking when the disruption occurred and least for viruses in early epidemic phase. CONCLUSION: High-intensity, short-duration social distancing measures may substantially reduce total incidence in a respiratory virus epidemic if implemented near the epidemic peak.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael L Jackson","author_inst":"Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Gregory R Hart","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling, Bellevue WA"},{"author_name":"Denise J McCulloch","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Amanda Adler","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Brandstetter","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Kairsten Fay","author_inst":"Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Peter Han","author_inst":"Brotman Baty Institute for Precision Medicine, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Lacombe","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Jover Lee","author_inst":"Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Thomas Sibley","author_inst":"Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Deborah A Nickerson","author_inst":"Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Mark Rieder","author_inst":"Brotman Baty Institute for Precision Medicine, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Lea Starita","author_inst":"Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Janet A Englund","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Trevor Bedford","author_inst":"Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Helen Chu","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Michael Famulare","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"the Seattle Flu Study Investigators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Zhaohui Xiao","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qing Xi","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dexi Zhao","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Peng Yu","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Caizhong Zhu","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhu Chen","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shaogeng Zhang","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Junsheng Ji","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guangwen Cao","author_inst":"Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fusheng Wang","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kenneth S.

The clusters included four in Tokyo and one each in Aichi, Fukuoka, Hokkaido, Ishikawa, Kanagawa and Wakayama prefectures. The number of secondary cases generated by each primary case was calculated using contact tracing data. Results: Of the 110 cases examined, 27 (24.6%) were primary cases who generated secondary cases. The odds that a primary case transmitted COVID-19 in a closed environment was 18.7 times greater compared to an open-air environment (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.0, 57.9). Conclusions: It is plausible that closed environments contribute to secondary transmission of COVID-19 and promote superspreading events.

Shenzhen ranked the top cities outside Wuhan with reported 416 confirmed cases by February 20, 2020. Here, we analyzed the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Shenzhen and potential link to the preventive strategies for the whole city and inside hospitals. Based on the daily new cases, the epidemic of COVID-19 in Shenzhen can be classified into three phases: the slow increase phase from January 19 to January 28, the rapid increase and plateau phase from January 29 to February 5 and the decline phase since February 6. In the three phases, the number of patients from Hubei decreased, and the number of familial clustering cases increased. The newly diagnosed COVID-19 cases reached its peak around January 31, which was 7 days after the peak date of cases arrival at Shenzhen. A series of early preventive strategies were implemented since January 19, which included detection of body temperature at all entrances of main traffic and buildings, outpatients service specially for patients with fever in all main hospitals in Shenzhen. All the patients with fever were screened with nasal or throat swab PCR detection of coronavirus 2019, Chest CT and blood lymphocyte counting in order to find out early case of COVID-19. Observation wards were established in every main hospital and a designated hospital was responsible for admission and medical care of all confirmed cases. Protection procedure was established for all medical staff involved in the screening and care of suspected and confirmed cases. 14 days isolated observation of all subjects arrived at Shenzhen from Hubei was implemented in February 2. After the implementation of all these strategies and measures, the COVID-19 cases started to decline since February 6. There were almost no community transmission and nosocomial infection occurred in Shenzhen. In conclusion, in situation of major outbreak of respiratory infectious disease, such as COVID-19, in nearby province of Hubei, Shenzhen, a high population density, high proportion of external population and high mobility city, has to face the imported cases and risk of spreading the outbreak into Shenzhen city. The implementation of early preventive strategies and measures in Shenzhen were successful in early identification of COVID-19 cases and prevented major outbreak occurred in Shenzhen. Early identification of imported cases, prevention of family clustering transmission, preventive measures in the public area and very strict infection control procedure in hospital setting are crucial for the successful control of outbreak in Shenzhen.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kai Yang","author_inst":"Jinan university"},{"author_name":"Lingwei Wang","author_inst":"Jinan University"},{"author_name":"Furong Li","author_inst":"Jinan university"},{"author_name":"Dandan Chen","author_inst":"Jinan university"},{"author_name":"Xi Li","author_inst":"Jinan university"},{"author_name":"Chen Qiu","author_inst":"Jinan university"},{"author_name":"Rongchang Chen","author_inst":"Jinan University"},{"author_name":"MHLW COVID-19 Response Team","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Motoi Suzuki","author_inst":"National Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Thomas Sibley","author_inst":"Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Deborah A Nickerson","author_inst":"Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Mark Rieder","author_inst":"Brotman Baty Institute for Precision Medicine, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Lea Starita","author_inst":"Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Janet A Englund","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Trevor Bedford","author_inst":"Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Helen Chu","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle WA"},{"author_name":"Michael Famulare","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"the Seattle Flu Study Investigators","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Zhaohui Xiao","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qing Xi","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dexi Zhao","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Peng Yu","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Caizhong Zhu","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhu Chen","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shaogeng Zhang","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Junsheng Ji","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guangwen Cao","author_inst":"Second Military Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fusheng Wang","author_inst":"The 5th Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kenneth S.
