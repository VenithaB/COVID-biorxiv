A few days after the first detected case in South Africa, an infection started a large hospital outbreak in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal. Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes can be used to trace the path of transmission within a hospital. It can also identify the source of the outbreak and provide lessons to improve infection prevention and control strategies. In this manuscript, we outline the obstacles we encountered in order to genotype SARS-CoV-2 in real-time during an urgent outbreak investigation. In this process, we encountered problems with the length of the original genotyping protocol, reagent stockout and sample degradation and storage. However, we managed to set up three different library preparation methods for sequencing in Illumina. We also managed to decrease the hands on library preparation time from twelve to three hours, which allowed us to complete the outbreak investigation in just a few weeks. We also fine-tuned a simple bioinformatics workflow for the assembly of high-quality genomes in real-time. In order to allow other laboratories to learn from our experience, we released all of the library preparation and bioinformatics protocols publicly and distributed them to other laboratories of the South African Network for Genomics Surveillance (SANGS) consortium.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sureshnee Pillay","author_inst":"KwaZulu-Natal Research Innovation and Sequencing Platform (KRISP), School of Laboratory Medicine & Medical Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South "},{"author_name":"Jennifer Giandhari","author_inst":"KwaZulu-Natal Research Innovation and Sequencing Platform (KRISP), School of Laboratory Medicine & Medical Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South "},{"author_name":"Houriiyah Tegally","author_inst":"KwaZulu-Natal Research Innovation and Sequencing Platform (KRISP), School of Laboratory Medicine & Medical Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South "},{"author_name":"Eduan Wilkinson","author_inst":"KwaZulu-Natal Research Innovation and Sequencing Platform (KRISP), School of Laboratory Medicine & Medical Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South "},{"author_name":"Benjamin Chimukangara","author_inst":"KwaZulu-Natal Research Innovation and Sequencing Platform (KRISP), School of Laboratory Medicine & Medical Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South "},{"author_name":"Richard Lessells","author_inst":"KwaZulu-Natal Research Innovation and Sequencing Platform (KRISP), School of Laboratory Medicine & Medical Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South "},{"author_name":"Stacey Mattison","author_inst":"KwaZulu-Natal Research Innovation and Sequencing Platform (KRISP), School of Laboratory Medicine & Medical Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South "},{"author_name":"Yunus Moosa","author_inst":"Infectious Diseases Department, Nelson R Mandela School of Medicine, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa"},{"author_name":"Inbal Gazy","author_inst":"KwaZulu-Natal Research Innovation and Sequencing Platform (KRISP), School of Laboratory Medicine & Medical Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South "},{"author_name":"Maryam Fish","author_inst":"KwaZulu-Natal Research Innovation and Sequencing Platform (KRISP), School of Laboratory Medicine & Medical Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South "},{"author_name":"Lavanya Singh","author_inst":"KwaZulu-Natal Research Innovation and Sequencing Platform (KRISP), School of Laboratory Medicine & Medical Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South "},{"author_name":"Khulekani Sedwell Khanyile","author_inst":"KwaZulu-Natal Research Innovation and Sequencing Platform (KRISP), School of Laboratory Medicine & Medical Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South "},{"author_name":"Vagner Fonseca","author_inst":"Laboratorio de Genetica Celular e Molecular, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Marta Giovanetti","author_inst":"Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz"},{"author_name":"Luiz  Carlos Junior Alcantara","author_inst":"Instituto Oswaldo Cruz"},{"author_name":"Tulio de Oliveira","author_inst":"University of KwaZulu-Natal"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.09.143438","rel_title":"Potent synthetic nanobodies against SARS-CoV-2 and molecular basis for neutralization","rel_date":"2020-06-10","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.09.143438","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2, the Covid-19 causative virus, adheres to human cells through binding of its envelope Spike protein to the receptor ACE2. The Spike receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) mediates this key event and thus is a primary target for therapeutic neutralizing antibodies to mask the ACE2-interacting interface. Here, we generated 99 synthetic nanobodies (sybodies) using ribosome and phage display. The best sybody MR3 binds the RBD with KD of 1.0 nM and neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus with IC50 of 0.40 g mL-1. Crystal structures of two sybody-RBD complexes reveal a common neutralizing mechanism through which the RBD-ACE2 interaction is competitively inhibited by sybodies. The structures allowed the rational design of a mutant with higher affinity and improved neutralization efficiency by [~]24-folds, lowering the IC50 from 12.32 to 0.50 g mL-1. Further, the structures explain the selectivity of sybodies between SARS-CoV strains. Our work presents an alternative approach to generate neutralizers against newly emerged viruses.\n\nOne sentence summaryStructural and biochemical studies revealed the molecular basis for the neutralization mechanism of in vitro-selected and rationally designed nanobody neutralizers for SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dianfan Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology"},{"author_name":"Tingting Li","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology"},{"author_name":"Hongmin Cai","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology"},{"author_name":"Hebang Yao","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology"},{"author_name":"Bingjie Zhou","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Yapei Zhao","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur of Shanghai"},{"author_name":"Wenming Qin","author_inst":"Shanghai Advanced Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Cedric A.J.

Here we developed a method for rapid and direct optical measurement of SARS-CoV-2 virus particles in one step nearly without any sample preparation using a spike protein specific nanoplasmonic resonance sensor. We demonstrate that we can detect as few as 30 virus particles in one step within 15 minutes and can quantify the virus concentration linearly in the range of 103 vp\/ml to 106 vp\/ml.

The main goal of this study is to elucidate the structural conformations of non structural protein 1(nsp1), prediction of epitope sites and identification of important residues for targeted therapy against COVID-19. In this study, molecular modelling coupled with molecular dynamics simulations were performed to analyse the conformational change of SARS-COV1, SARS-COV2 and MERS-COV at molecular level. Free energy landscape was constructed by using the first (PC1) and second (PC2) principle components. From the sequence alignment it was observed when compared to SERS-COV1 28 mutations are present in SERS-COV2 nsp1 protein. Several B-cell and T-cell epitopes were identified by immunoinformatics study. The {Delta}G values for SARS-COV1, SARS-COV2 and MERS-COV nsp1 proteins were 4.44, 5.82 and 6.15 kJ\/mol respectively. SARS-COV2 nsp1 protein binds with the interface region of the palm and finger domain of POLA1 by using hydrogen bonds and salt bridges interactions. The present study provided a comprehensive structural model of nsp1 by threading process. The MD simulation parameters indicated that all three nsp1 proteins were stable during the simulation run.

A multitude of factors likely account for this discrepancy. Gene expression represents the interaction of genetics and environment. To elucidate whether levels of expression of genes implicated in COVID-19 vary in African Americans as compared to European Americans, we re-mine The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) RNA-Seq data. Multiple genes integral to infection, inflammation and immunity are differentially regulated across the two populations. Most notably, F8A2 and F8A3, which encode the HAP40 protein that mediates early endosome movement in Huntingtons Disease, are more highly expressed by up to 24-fold in African Americans. Such differences in gene expression can establish prognostic signatures and have critical implications for precision treatment of diseases such as COVID-19. We advocate routine inclusion of information such as postal code, education level, and profession (as a proxies for socioeconomic condition) and race in the metadata about each individual sampled for sequencing studies.

Several groups have analyzed these genomes using different approaches.

Using CoVa, we define a modified sequence typing nomenclature and identify sites under positive selection. Further analysis identified some peptides and sites showing geographical patterns of selection. Specifically, we show differences in sequence type distribution between sequences from India and those from the rest of the world. We also show that several sites show signatures of positive selection uniquely in sequences from India. Preliminary evolutionary analysis, using features that will be incorporated into CoVa in the near future, show a mutation rate of 7.4 x 10-4 substitutions\/site\/year, confirm a temporal signal with a November 2019 origin of SARS-CoV-2, and a heterogeneity in the geographical distribution of Indian samples.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Farhan Ali","author_inst":"National Centre for Biological Sciences, TIFR, Bangalore"},{"author_name":"Mohak Sharda","author_inst":"National Centre for Biological Sciences, TIFR"},{"author_name":"Aswin Sai Narain Seshasayee","author_inst":"Tata Institute of Fundamental Research"},{"author_name":"Milena S Detzel","author_inst":"Pharmaceutical Biochemistry and Bioanalytics, Pharmaceutical Institute, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Benjamin F Schmalohr","author_inst":"Pharmaceutical Biochemistry and Bioanalytics, Pharmaceutical Institute, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Francel Steinbock","author_inst":"Pharmaceutical Biochemistry and Bioanalytics, Pharmaceutical Institute, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Diana Imhof","author_inst":"Pharmaceutical Biochemistry and Bioanalytics, Pharmaceutical Institute, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Martin Hofmann-Apitius","author_inst":"Fraunhofer SCAI"},{"author_name":"Wenjun Hu","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jiansong Ji","author_inst":"Lishui Central Hospital, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Hao Xu","author_inst":"Liangzhun (Shanghai) Industrial Co.

Worldwide concerted effort to identify viral genomic changes across different sub-types has identified several strong changes in the coding region. However, there have not been many studies focusing on the variations in the 5 and 3 untranslated regions and their consequences. Considering the possible importance of these regions in host mediated regulation of viral RNA genome, we wanted to explore the phenomenon.\n\nMethodsTo have an idea of the global changes in 5 and 3-UTR sequences, we downloaded 8595 complete and high-coverage SARS-CoV2 genome sequence information from human host in FASTA format from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) from 15 different geographical regions. Next, we aligned them using Clustal Omega software and investigated the UTR variants. We also looked at the putative host RNA binding protein (RBP) and microRNA binding sites in these regions by  RBPmap and  RNA22 v2 respectively. Expression status of selected RBPs and microRNAs were checked in lungs tissue.\n\nResultsWe identified 28 unique variants in SARS-CoV2 UTR region based on a minimum variant percentage cut-off of 0.5. Along with 241C>T change the important 5-UTR change identified was 187A>G, while 29734G>C, 29742G>A\/T and 29774C>T were the most familiar variants of 3UTR among most of the continents. Furthermore, we found that despite of the variations in the UTR regions, binding of host RBP to them remains mostly unaltered, which further influenced the functioning of specific miRNAs.\n\nConclusionOur results, shows for the first time in SARS-Cov2 infection, a possible cross-talk between host RBPs-miRNAs and viral UTR variants, which ultimately could explain the mechanism of escaping host RNA decay machinery by the virus. The knowledge might be helpful in developing anti-viral compounds in future.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Moumita Mukherjee","author_inst":"National Institute of Biomedical Genomics"},{"author_name":"SRIKANTA GOSWAMI","author_inst":"NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF BIOMEDICAL GENOMICS"},{"author_name":"Aswin Sai Narain Seshasayee","author_inst":"Tata Institute of Fundamental Research"},{"author_name":"Milena S Detzel","author_inst":"Pharmaceutical Biochemistry and Bioanalytics, Pharmaceutical Institute, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Benjamin F Schmalohr","author_inst":"Pharmaceutical Biochemistry and Bioanalytics, Pharmaceutical Institute, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Francel Steinbock","author_inst":"Pharmaceutical Biochemistry and Bioanalytics, Pharmaceutical Institute, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Diana Imhof","author_inst":"Pharmaceutical Biochemistry and Bioanalytics, Pharmaceutical Institute, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Martin Hofmann-Apitius","author_inst":"Fraunhofer SCAI"},{"author_name":"Wenjun Hu","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jiansong Ji","author_inst":"Lishui Central Hospital, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Hao Xu","author_inst":"Liangzhun (Shanghai) Industrial Co.

Many studies have been conducted to target the structures of RBD-ACE2 binding and to design RBD-targeting vaccines and drugs. Nevertheless, mutations distal from the SARS-CoV-2 RBD also impact its transmissibility and antibody can target non-RBD regions, suggesting the incomplete role of the RBD region in the spike protein-ACE2 binding. Here, in order to elucidate distant binding mechanisms, we analyze complexes of ACE2 with the wild type spike protein and with key mutants via large-scale all-atom explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations. We find that though distributed approximately 10 nm away from the RBD, the SARS-CoV-2 polybasic cleavage sites enhance, via electrostatic interactions and hydration, the RBD-ACE2 binding affinity. A negatively charged tetrapeptide (GluGluLeuGlu) is then designed to neutralize the positively charged arginine on the polybasic cleavage sites. We find that the tetrapeptide GluGluLeuGlu binds to one of the three polybasic cleavage sites of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein lessening by 34% the RBD-ACE2 binding strength. This significant binding energy reduction demonstrates the feasibility to neutralize RBD-ACE2 binding by targeting this specific polybasic cleavage site. Our work enhances understanding of the binding mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2, which may aid the design of therapeutics for COVID-19 infection.\n\nO_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY TOC:\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-ACE2 complex showing the polybasic cleavage sites\n\nC_FIG_DISPLAY","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Baofu Qiao","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Monica Olvera de la Cruz","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Aswin Sai Narain Seshasayee","author_inst":"Tata Institute of Fundamental Research"},{"author_name":"Milena S Detzel","author_inst":"Pharmaceutical Biochemistry and Bioanalytics, Pharmaceutical Institute, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Benjamin F Schmalohr","author_inst":"Pharmaceutical Biochemistry and Bioanalytics, Pharmaceutical Institute, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Francel Steinbock","author_inst":"Pharmaceutical Biochemistry and Bioanalytics, Pharmaceutical Institute, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Diana Imhof","author_inst":"Pharmaceutical Biochemistry and Bioanalytics, Pharmaceutical Institute, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Martin Hofmann-Apitius","author_inst":"Fraunhofer SCAI"},{"author_name":"Wenjun Hu","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jiansong Ji","author_inst":"Lishui Central Hospital, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Hao Xu","author_inst":"Liangzhun (Shanghai) Industrial Co.

Within days, Lennar had implemented a morning health check via its enterprise resource planning system , to identify associates (employees) who were sick, or not in their usual state of health. With this survey, Lennar was able to ensure that no one sick would show up to work, and instead, would self-quarantine at home. Furthermore, with thorough contact tracking, associates exposed to COVID19 patients (suspected or RT-PCR test-confirmed), were also asked to self-quarantine. This survey, in addition to other safety measures, such as an overhaul of the company with nearly 50% of the company working from home, prolific communication, and many more measures, Lennar was able to function safely for its associates and successfully as an enterprise. The data that we present here are real world data collected in the context of working throughout a dreadful pandemic, and the lessons learned could be helpful to other companies that are preparing to return to work.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"pascal j goldschmidt-clermont","author_inst":"Lennar Corporation"},{"author_name":"Monica Olvera de la Cruz","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Aswin Sai Narain Seshasayee","author_inst":"Tata Institute of Fundamental Research"},{"author_name":"Milena S Detzel","author_inst":"Pharmaceutical Biochemistry and Bioanalytics, Pharmaceutical Institute, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Benjamin F Schmalohr","author_inst":"Pharmaceutical Biochemistry and Bioanalytics, Pharmaceutical Institute, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Francel Steinbock","author_inst":"Pharmaceutical Biochemistry and Bioanalytics, Pharmaceutical Institute, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Diana Imhof","author_inst":"Pharmaceutical Biochemistry and Bioanalytics, Pharmaceutical Institute, University of Bonn"},{"author_name":"Martin Hofmann-Apitius","author_inst":"Fraunhofer SCAI"},{"author_name":"Wenjun Hu","author_inst":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jiansong Ji","author_inst":"Lishui Central Hospital, Zhejiang University"},{"author_name":"Hao Xu","author_inst":"Liangzhun (Shanghai) Industrial Co.

Here we identify a consensus peripheral blood immune signature across 63 hospital-treated Covid-19 patients who were otherwise highly heterogeneous. The core signature conspicuously blended adaptive B cell responses typical of virus infection or vaccination with discrete traits hitherto associated with sepsis, including monocyte and dendritic cell dampening, and hyperactivation and depletion of discrete T cell subsets. This blending of immuno-protective and immuno-pathogenic potentials was exemplified by near-universal CXCL10\/IP10 upregulation, as occurred in SARS1 and MERS. Moreover, specific parameters including CXCL10\/IP10 over-expression, T cell proliferation, and basophil and plasmacytoid dendritic cell depletion correlated, often prognostically, with Covid-19 progression, collectively composing a resource to inform SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology and risk-based patient stratification.","rel_num_authors":48,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adam G.

protective equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 pandemic is the N95 filtering facepiece respirator. N95 respirators are commonly used to protect healthcare workers from respiratory pathogens, including the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, and are increasingly employed by other frontline workers and the general public. Under routine circumstances, these masks are disposable, single-use items, but extended use and reuse practices have been broadly enacted to alleviate critical supply shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic. While extended-time single use presents a low risk of pathogen transfer, repeated donning and doffing of potentially contaminated masks presents increased risk of pathogen transfer. Therefore, efficient and safe decontamination methods for N95 masks are needed to reduce the risk of reuse and mitigate local supply shortages. Here we review the available literature concerning use of germicidal ultraviolet-C (UV-C) light to decontaminate N95 masks. We propose a practical method for repeated point-of-use decontamination using commercially-available UV-C crosslinker boxes from molecular biology laboratories to expose each side of the mask to 800-1200 mJ\/cm2 of UV-C. We measure the dose that penetrated to the interior of the respirators and model the potential germicidal action on SARS-CoV-2. Our experimental results, in combination with modeled data, suggest that a two-minute UV-C treatment cycle should induce a >3-log-order reduction in viral bioburden on the surface of the respirators, and a 2-log order reduction throughout the interior. The resulting exposure is 100-fold less than the dose expected to damage the masks, facilitating repeated decontamination. As such, UV-C germicidal irradiation (UVGI) is a practical strategy for small-scale point-of-use decontamination of N95s.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas Huber","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Olivia Goldman","author_inst":"Rockefeller University"},{"author_name":"Alexander E.

However, there is uncertainty in the effectiveness of such measures for specific regions with varying population demographics and different levels of adherence to social distancing. The objective of this paper is to determine the impact of social distancing measures in unique regions. Methods: We developed COVid-19 Agent-based simulation Model (COVAM), an agent-based simulation model (ABM) that represents the social network and interactions among the people in a region considering population demographics, limited testing availability, imported infections from outside of the region, asymptomatic disease transmission, and adherence to social distancing measures. We adopted COVAM to represent COVID-19-associated events in Dane County, Wisconsin, Milwaukee metropolitan area, and New York City (NYC). We used COVAM to evaluate the impact of three different aspects of social distancing: 1) Adherence to social distancing measures; 2) timing of implementing social distancing; and 3) timing of easing social distancing. Results: We found that the timing of social distancing and adherence level had a major effect on COVID-19 occurrence. For example, in NYC, implementing social distancing measures on March 5, 2020 instead of March 12, 2020 would have reduced the total number of confirmed cases from 191,984 to 43,968 as of May 30, whereas a 1-week delay in implementing such measures could have increased the number of confirmed cases to 1,299,420. Easing social distancing measures on June 1, 2020 instead of June 15, 2020 in NYC would increase the total number of confirmed cases from 275,587 to 379,858 as of July 31. Conclusion: The timing of implementing social distancing measures, adherence to the measures, and timing of their easing have major effects on the number of COVID-19

As its transmissibility and high pathogenicity seriously threaten people's lives, the accurate and fast detection of the COVID-19 infection is crucial. Although many recent studies have shown that deep learning based solutions can help detect COVID-19 based on chest CT scans, there lacks a consistent and systematic comparison and evaluation on these techniques. In this paper, we first build a clean and segmented CT dataset called Clean-CC-CCII by fixing the errors and removing some noises in a large CT scan dataset CC-CCII with three classes: novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), common pneumonia (CP), and normal controls (Normal). After cleaning, our dataset consists of a total of 340,190 slices of 3,993 scans from 2,698 patients. Then we benchmark and compare the performance of a series of state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D and 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The results show that 3D CNNs outperform 2D CNNs in general. With extensive effort of hyperparameter tuning, we find that the 3D CNN model DenseNet3D121 achieves the highest accuracy of 88.63% (F1-score is 88.14% and AUC is 0.940), and another 3D CNN model ResNet3D34 achieves the best AUC of 0.959 (accuracy is 87.83% and F1-score is 86.04%). We further demonstrate that the mixup data augmentation technique can largely improve the model performance. At last, we design an automated deep learning methodology to generate a lightweight deep learning model MNas3DNet41 that achieves an accuracy of 87.14%, F1-score of 87.25%, and AUC of 0.957, which are on par with the best models made by AI experts. The automated deep learning design is a promising methodology that can help health-care professionals develop effective deep learning models using their private data sets.

Belgium, a repetitive national serum collection was set up to monitor age-related exposure through emerging SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. First objective was to estimate the baseline seroprevalence and seroincidence using serial survey data that covered the start of a national lock-down period installed soon after the epidemic was recognized. Methods A prospective serial cross-sectional seroprevalence study, stratified by age, sex and region, started with two collections in April 2020. In residual sera taken outside hospitals and collected by diagnostic laboratories, IgG antibodies against S1 proteins of SARS-CoV-2 were measured with a semi-quantitative commercial ELISA. Seropositivity (cumulative, by age category and sex) and seroincidence over a 3 weeks period were estimated for the Belgian population. Findings In the first collection, IgG antibodies were detected in 100 out of 3910 samples, whereas in the second collection 193 out of 3391 samples were IgG positive. The weighted overall seroprevalence increased from 2.9% (95% CI 2.3 to 3.6) to 6.0% (95% CI 5.1 to 7.1), reflected in a seroincidence estimate of 3.1% (95% CI 1.9 to 4.3). Age-specific seroprevalence significantly increased in the age categories 20-30, 80-90 and [&ge;]90. No significant sex effect was observed. Interpretation During the start of epidemic mitigation by lockdown, a small but increasing fraction of the Belgian population showed serologically detectable signs of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Funding This independent researcher-initiated study acknowledges financial support from the Antwerp University Fund, the Flemish Research Fund, and European Horizon 2020.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sereina Herzog","author_inst":"University of Antwerp"},{"author_name":"Jessie De Bie","author_inst":"University of

The spread of SARS-CoV-2 led to a rapid and deadly pandemic which reached almost all countries in the world in a few months. In most countries, rigorous measures of mitigation, including national or subnational lockdowns were established. The present work aimed at quantifying the effect of national lockdown in France on hospital occupancy. Methods. A compartmental model describing patient hospital flows was developed, where the effect of lockdown was quantified on the hospitalization rate. Model parameters were estimated using nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) modelling. Results. French lockdown led to a hospitalization rate decreased by thrice from 12 days after its beginning. However, lockdown may not to have decreased either hospital occupancy or deaths in hospital, which would have been both decreased by 30% and 85% in average if lockdown was started 20 and 30 days before this date, respectively. Conclusion. The present work showed an intrinsic effect of lockdown to decrease hospital burden, but its efficacy on hospital burden may have been increased if established sooner.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Ternant","author_inst":"University of Tours"},{"author_name":"Jessie De Bie","author_inst":"University of

domestic violence (DV) hotlines across the globe suggest that there may be an increase of IPV prevalence in association with the COVID-19 outbreak; however, no study has investigated this phenomenon empirically. Objective: To evaluate the association between COVID-19 related conditions and recent use or experience of IPV (since the pandemic outbreak in the U.S). Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study analyzed data collected online from a sample of noninstitutionalized adults (age 18+) in the U.S. (N=2,045). More than half of the sample self-identified as being in an intimate relationship at the time of the study. Main Outcomes and Measures: A four-item tool was used to assess IPV perpetration and victimization since the outbreak of COVID-19. The rapid tool inquired about two forms of IPV, psychological and physical. Participants self-reported demographic data and recent health histories, including COVID-19 tests results, related symptoms and degree of personal social distancing. We hypothesized that COVID-19 related factors would increase risks of IPV. Results: In this study, self-reported COVID-19 impacted respondents had an increased risk of IPV victimization and perpetration. Among those who reported having symptoms consistent with coronavirus, but were denied access to testing, psychological IPV victimization was 3 times greater than those who did not (Exp[B] =3.15, [1.19, 2.29] p <.05). For participants who reported testing positive to COVID-19, the odds of using psychological IPV (Exp[B] =3.24, [1.18, 8.89] p <.05) and physical IPV (Exp[B]=3.02, [1.12, 8.17] p <.05) against an intimate partner increased by more than 3 times. Conclusions and Relevance: Patient education and community outreach\/health care system initiatives focused on IPV risk behaviors may help reduce the potential development of IPV. Continued surveillance is imperative to improve health and well-being along with effective intervention development and implementation.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maxine

relationship pattern between COVID 19 daily cases with weather parameters and air pollutants in mainland India. We consider mean temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, rainfall, wind speed, PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2 and CO as independent variable and daily COVID 19 cases as dependent variable for 18 states during 18th march to 30th April, 2020.After dividing the dataset for 0 to 10 day, 10 to 25 days and 0 to 44 days, the current study applied Akaike s Information Criteria (AIC) and Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to examine the kind of relationship between independent variables with COVID 19 cases. Initially GAM model result shows variables like temperature and solar radiation has positive relation (p<0.05) in 0 to 10 days study with daily cases. In 25 days dataset it significantly shows that temperature has positive relation above 23 degree centigrade, SO2 has a negative relationship and relative humidity has negative (between 30% to 45% and > 60%) and a positive relationship (45% to 60%) with COVID 19 cases (p=0.05). 44 days dataset has six parameters includes temperature as positive, relative humidity as negative (between 0 to 45%) and then positive (after >45%), NO2 as Positive (0 to 35 microgram\/m3) followed by negative trend (after > 40 microgram\/m3), SO2 and rainfall as negative relation. After sensitive analysis, it is found that weather variables like relative humidity, solar radiation and rainfall are more sensitive than temperature and wind speed. Whereas pollutants like NO2, PM2.5, PM10 and CO are more sensitive variables than SO2 in this study. In summary this study finds temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, wind speed, SO2, PM2.5, and CO may be important factors associated with COVID 19 pandemic. Keywords: Weather parameter, Air pollutants, Daily COVID 19 cases, Akaike s Information Criteria (AIC), Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and Sensitive analysis.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kousik Das","author_inst":"Vidyasagar University, Midnapore, West Bengal, India Pin: 721102"},{"author_name":"Nilanjana Das

sizes, show that stay-in-place-orders (SIPOs) are associated with a decline in new COVID-19 cases. Our estimation approach relies on county-pairs across state-borders where one state has SIPO whereas the other state does not, controls for matched county-pair fixed effects and day of observation fixed-effects. The county-pair sample from southern, mid-western, and mountain region states (from March 1, 2020 to April 25, 2020) shows that daily COVID-19 incidence case growth rate is 1.994 percentage points lower for counties in SIPO states relative to those bordering in non-SIPO states. Specifically, we find SIPO reduced daily growth rates by 1.97, 2.14, 2.03, and 2.27 percentage points after 1 to 5 days, 6 to 10 days, 11 to 15 days, and 16 to 20 days, respectively. Our effect sizes are much smaller than in the previous studies with the caveat that states in the northeast and on the west coast could not be included in the border county-pair specification. We find limited evidence of heterogeneous effects in counties with a higher population density, percentage of black or Hispanic residents, proportion of population over 65 years, and social association rates in a county. Nor do we find evidence of meaningful differences in effects of SIPO by county Gini index, unemployment, or GDP. The results of this study could further inform policymakers in making decisions on SIPO extensions or lifting of such orders.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Srikant

Methods: We included 477 adult cases that died after admission from March 1 to March 31, 2020: 281 with confirmed COVID-19, 58 probable COVID-19, and 138 who died of other causes. Results: The number of comorbidities was high in the confirmed COVID-19, and CI was common (30%: 21.1% dementia; 8.9% mild cognitive impairment). Subjects with CI were older, more lived in nursing homes and had shorter times from symptom onset to death than those without CI. COVID-19 patients with CI were rarely admitted to the ICU and fewer received non-invasive mechanical ventilation, but palliative care was provided more often. Conclusions: Dementia is a frequent comorbidity in COVID-19 deceased patients. The burden of COVID-19 in the dementia community will be high.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Paloma Martin-Jimenez","author_inst":"Department of Neurology.

These patients also develop cytokine storm syndrome, and organ dysfunctions, which is a clinical picture that resembles sepsis. Considering that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been described as an important factors of tissue damage in sepsis, we investigated whether NETs would be produced in COVID-19 patients and participate in the lung tissue damage. A cohort of 32 hospitalized patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and respective healthy controls were enrolled. NETs concentration was assessed by MPO-DNA PicoGreen assay or by confocal immunofluorescence. The cytotoxic effect of SARS-CoV-2-induced NETs was analyzed in human epithelial lung cells (A549 cells). The concentration of NETs was augmented in plasma and tracheal aspirate from COVID-19 patients and their neutrophils spontaneously released higher levels of NETs. NETs were also found in the lung tissue specimens from autopsies of COVID-19 patients. Notably, viable SARS-CoV-2 can directly induce in vitro release of NETs by healthy neutrophils in a PAD-4-dependent manner. Finally, NETs released by SARS-CoV-2-activated neutrophils promote lung epithelial cell death in vitro. These results unravel a possible detrimental role of NETs in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Therefore, the inhibition of NETs represent a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":43,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Flavio Protasio Veras","author_inst":"University of Sao

has become a major global pathogen in an astonishingly short period of time. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 also has been notable due to its impacts on individuals residing within skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) such as rehabilitation centers and nursing homes. SNF residents tend to possess several risk factors for the most severe outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including advanced age and the presence of multiple comorbidities. Indeed, residents of long-term care facilities represent approximately 40 percent of US SARS-CoV-2 deaths. To assess the prevalence and incidence of SARS-CoV-2 among SNF workers, determine the extent of asymptomatic infection by SARS-CoV-2, and provide information on the genomic epidemiology of the virus within these unique care settings, we sampled workers weekly at five SNFs in Colorado using nasopharyngeal swabs, determined the presence of viral RNA and infectious virus among these workers, and sequenced 48 nearly complete genomes. This manuscript reports results from the first five to six weeks of observation. Our data reveal a strikingly high degree of asymptomatic infection, a strong correlation between RNA detection and the presence of infectious virus in NP swabs, persistent RNA in a subset of individuals, and declining incidence over time. Our data suggests that asymptomatic individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to virus transmission within the workplace.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kendra

analyse transmission of SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), their contribution to transmission is unclear. Viral load, as measured by RT-PCR, can inform considerations regarding transmission, especially if existing knowledge of viral load in other respiratory diseases is taken into account. RT-PCR threshold cycle data from 3303 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (out of 77,996 persons tested in total, drawn from across Germany) were analysed to examine the relationship between patient age and estimated viral load. Two PCR systems were used. In data from the PCR system predominantly used for community and cluster screening during the early phase of the epidemic (Roche LightCycler 480 II), when such screening was frequent practice, viral loads do not differ significantly in three comparisons between young and old age groups (differences in log10 viral loads between young and old estimated from raw viral load data and a Bayesian mixture model of gamma distributions collectively range between -0.11 and -0.43). Data from a second type of PCR system (Roche cobas 6800\/8800), introduced into diagnostic testing on March 16, 2020 and used during the time when household and other contact testing was reduced, show a credible but small difference in the three comparisons between young and old age groups (differences, measured as above, collectively range between -0.43 and -0.83). This small difference may be due to differential patterns of PCR instrument utilization rather than to an actual difference in viral load. Considering household transmission data on influenza, which has a similar viral load kinetic to SARS-CoV-2, the viral load differences between age groups observed in this study are likely to be of limited relevance. Combined data from both PCR instruments show that viral loads of at least 250,000 copies, a threshold we previously established for the isolation of infectious virus in cell culture at more than 5% probability, were present across the study period in 29.0% of kindergarten-aged patients 0-6 years old (n=38), 37.3% of those aged 0-19 (n=150), and in 51.4% of those aged 20 and above (n=3153). The differences in these fractions may also be due to differences in test utilization. We conclude that a considerable percentage of infected people in all age groups, including those who are pre- or mild-symptomatic, carry viral loads likely to represent infectivity. Based on these results and uncertainty about the remaining incidence, we recommend caution and careful monitoring during gradual lifting of non-pharmaceutical interventions. In particular, there is little evidence from the present study to support suggestions that children may not be as infectious as adults.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Terry C

for patients with emerging infectious diseases often experience psychological distress. However, the psychological impact and behavior change of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic among HCWs are still unknown. This study aimed to investigate the worries and concerns of HCWs regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: In this cross-sectional survey, a web-based questionnaire was distributed among HCWs working in hospitals or clinics across Japanese medical facilities from April 20 to May 1, 2020. The questionnaire comprised items on demographics, worries and concerns, perceptions regarding the sufficiency of information, and behavioral changes pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: A total of 4386 HCWs completed the survey; 1648 (64.7%) were aged 30-39 years, 2379 (54.2%) were male, and 782 (18.1%) were frontline HCWs, directly caring for patients with COVID-19 on a daily basis. 3500 HCWs (79.8%) indicated that they were seriously worried about the pandemic. The most frequent concern was the consequence of becoming infected on their family, work, and society (87.4%). Additionally, the majority (55.5%) had restricted social contact and almost all HCWs endorsed a shortage in personal protective equipment (median, 8\/9 (interquartile range; 7-9) on a Likert scale). There was no significant difference in the degree of worry between frontline and non-frontline HCWs (8\/9 (7-9) vs. 8\/9 (7-9), p=0.25). Frontline HCWs, compared to non-frontline HCWs, were more likely to have the need to avoid contact with families and friends (24.8% vs. 17.8%, p<0.001) and indicated that they cannot evade their professional duty during the COVID-19 pandemic (9\/9 (7-9) vs. 8\/9 (6-9), p<0.001). Further, the extremely low proportion of frontline HCWs reported that they would take a leave of absence to avoid infection (1.2%). Conclusions: Both frontline and non-frontline HCWs expressed comparable concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. Because HCWs, especially frontline HCWs, reported that they cannot be obliged to do avoid their duty, effective mental health protection strategies should be developed and implemented for HCWs.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yuki Sahashi","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Gifu University Graduate School of Medicine; Department of Health Data Science, Graduate School of Data Science, Yokohama City Univers"},{"author_name":"Hirohisa Endo","author_inst":"Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tadafumi Sugimoto","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Mie University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Takeru Nabeta","author_inst":"Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Kitasato University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kimitaka Nishizaki","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology and Nephrology, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Atsushi Kikuchi","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Osaka General Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Shingo Matsumoto","author_inst":"Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Toho University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hiroyuki Sato","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Teine Keijinkai Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tadahiro Goto","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Health Economics, School of Public Health, The University of Tokyo; TXP Medical Co.

novel coronavirus (COVID-19) mortality show only small variation even though the number of deaths per country shows large variation. To understand the determinant for this situation, we constructed a mathematical model describing the transmission dynamics and natural history of COVID-19 and analyzed the dataset of fatal cases of COVID-19 in Italy, Spain, and Japan. We estimated the parameter which describes the age-dependency of susceptibility by fitting the model to reported data, taking into account the effect of change in contact patterns during the outbreak of COVID-19, and the fraction of symptomatic COVID-19 infections. Our modelling study revealed that if the mortality rate or the fraction of symptomatic infections among all COVID-19 cases does not depend on age, then unrealistically different age-dependencies of susceptibilities against COVID-19 infections between Italy, Japan, and Spain are required to explain the similar age distribution of mortality but different basic reproduction numbers (R0). Variation of susceptibility by age itself cannot explain the robust age distribution in mortality by COVID-19 in those three countries, however it does suggest that the age-dependencies of i) the mortality rate and ii) the fraction of symptomatic infections among all COVID-19 cases determine the age distribution of mortality by COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ryosuke Omori","author_inst":"Hokkaido University"},{"author_name":"Ryota Matsuyama","author_inst":"Hiroshima University"},{"author_name":"Yukihiko Nakata","author_inst":"Aoyama Gakuin University"},{"author_name":"Takeru Nabeta","author_inst":"Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Kitasato University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kimitaka Nishizaki","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology and Nephrology, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Atsushi Kikuchi","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Osaka General Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Shingo Matsumoto","author_inst":"Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Toho University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hiroyuki Sato","author_inst":"Department of Cardiology, Teine Keijinkai Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tadahiro Goto","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Health Economics, School of Public Health, The University of Tokyo; TXP Medical Co.
