There are comparatively scant data on race and ethnicity as determinants of infection risk. Methods We used a smartphone application (beginning March 24, 2020 in the United Kingdom [U.K.] and March 29, 2020 in the United States [U.S.]) to recruit 2,414,601 participants who reported their race\/ethnicity through May 25, 2020 and employed logistic regression to determine the adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for a positive Covid-19 test among racial and ethnic groups. Results We documented 8,858 self-reported cases of Covid-19 among 2,259,841 non-Hispanic white; 79 among 9,615 Hispanic; 186 among 18,176 Black; 598 among 63,316 Asian; and 347 among 63,653 other racial minority participants. Compared with non-Hispanic white participants, the risk for a positive Covid-19 test was increased across racial minorities (aORs ranging from 1.24 to 3.51). After adjustment for socioeconomic indices and Covid-19 exposure risk factors, the associations (aOR [95% CI]) were attenuated but remained significant for Hispanic (1.58 [1.24-2.02]) and Black participants (2.56 [1.93-3.39]) in the U.S. and South Asian (1.52 [1.38-1.67]) and Middle Eastern participants (1.56 [1.25-1.95]) in the U.K. A higher risk of Covid-19 and seeking or receiving treatment was also observed for several racial\/ethnic minority subgroups. Conclusions Our results demonstrate an increase in Covid-19 risk among racial and ethnic minorities not completely explained by other risk factors for Covid-19, comorbidities, and sociodemographic characteristics. Further research investigating these disparities are needed to inform public health measures.","rel_num_authors":30,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chun-Han Lo","author_inst":"Clinical and Translational Epidemiology Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School.

Severe dysregulated systemic inflammation is the putative mechanism. We hypothesize that early prolonged methylprednisolone (MP) treatment could accelerate disease resolution, decreasing the need for ICU and mortality. Methods We conducted a multicenter, observational study to explore the association between exposure to prolonged, low-dose, MP treatment and need for ICU referral, intubation or death within 28 days (composite primary endpoint) in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Italian respiratory high-dependency units. Secondary outcomes were invasive MV-free days and changes in C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Results Findings are reported as MP (n=83) vs. control (n=90). The composite primary endpoint was met by 19 vs. 40 [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.41; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.24-0.72]. Transfer to ICU and need for invasive MV was necessary in 15 vs. 27 (p=0.07) and 14 vs. 26 (p=0.10), respectively. By day 28, the MP group had fewer deaths (6 vs. 21, adjusted HR=0.29; 95% CI: 0.12-0.73) and more days off invasive MV (24.0 plus-or-minus sign 9.0 vs. 17.5 plus-or-minus sign 12.8; p=0.001). Study treatment was associated with rapid improvement in PaO2:FiO2 and CRP levels. The complication rate was similar for the two groups (p=0.84). Conclusion In patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, early administration of prolonged MP treatment was associated with a significantly lower hazard of death (71%) and decreased ventilator dependence. Randomized controlled studies are needed to confirm these findings.","rel_num_authors":45,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Francesco Salton","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Paola Confalonieri","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Pierachille Santus","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Sergio Harari","author_inst":"Ospedale San Giuseppe, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Raffaele Scala","author_inst":"Ospedale San Donato, Arezzo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Simone Lanini","author_inst":"Istituto Spallanzani, Rome, Italy"},{"author_name":"Valentina Vertui","author_inst":"Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Tiberio Oggionni","author_inst":"Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Antonella Caminati","author_inst":"San Giuseppe Hospital Multimedica, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Vincenzo Patruno","author_inst":"Azienda Sanitaria Universitaria Friuli Centrale, Udine, Italy"},{"author_name":"Mario Tamburrini","author_inst":"Azienda Sanitaria Friuli Occidentale, Pordenone, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Scartabellati","author_inst":"Ospedale Maggiore, Crema, Italy"},{"author_name":"Mara Parati","author_inst":"Ospedale Maggiore di Crema"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Villani","author_inst":"Ospedale Maggiore, Crema, Italy"},{"author_name":"Dejan Radovanovic","author_inst":"Ospedale Sacco, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Sara Tomassetti","author_inst":"University of Florence, Italy"},{"author_name":"Claudia Ravaglia","author_inst":"Ospedale Pierantoni, Forli, Italy"},{"author_name":"Venerino Poletti","author_inst":"Ospedale Pierantoni, Forli, Italy"},{"author_name":"Andrea Vianello","author_inst":"University of Padua, Italy"},{"author_name":"Anna Talia Gaccione","author_inst":"General Hospital, Vittorio Veneto, Italy"},{"author_name":"Luca Guidelli","author_inst":"Ospeadle San Donato, Arezzo, Italy"},{"author_name":"Rita Raccanelli","author_inst":"Ospedale San Giuseppe, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Donato Lacedonia","author_inst":"University of Foggia"},{"author_name":"Paolo Lucernoni","author_inst":"General Hospital, Vittorio Veneto, Italy"},{"author_name":"Maria Pia Foschino Barbaro","author_inst":"University of Foggia"},{"author_name":"Stefano Centanni","author_inst":"Ospedale San Paolo, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Michele Mondoni","author_inst":"Ospedale San Paolo, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Matteo Davi","author_inst":"University of Milan"},{"author_name":"Alberto Fantin","author_inst":"Azienda Sanitaria Universitaria Friuli Centrale, Udin, Italy"},{"author_name":"Xueyuan Cao","author_inst":"University of Tennessee, Memphis, USA"},{"author_name":"Lucio Torelli","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Antonella Zucchetto","author_inst":"CRO Aviano"},{"author_name":"Marcella Montico","author_inst":"CRO Aviano"},{"author_name":"Annalisa Casarin","author_inst":"University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield UK"},{"author_name":"Micaela Romagnoli","author_inst":"Hospital of Treviso"},{"author_name":"Stefano Gasparini","author_inst":"University of Ancona"},{"author_name":"Martina Bonifazi","author_inst":"University of Ancona"},{"author_name":"Pierlanfranco D'Agaro","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Marcello","author_inst":"ICGEB"},{"author_name":"Danilo Licastro","author_inst":"Area Science Park, Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Barbara Ruaro","author_inst":"University Hospital of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Maria Concetta Volpe","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Reba Umberger","author_inst":"University of Tennessee, Memphis, USA"},{"author_name":"Gianfranco Umberto Meduri","author_inst":"University of Tennessee, Memphis, USA"},{"author_name":"Marco Confalonieri","author_inst":"University of Trieste"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"respiratory medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.18.20133645","rel_title":"Clinical Outcomes of Patients with COVID-19 and Chronic Inflammatory and Autoimmune Rheumatic Diseases: A Multicentric Matched-Cohort Study","rel_date":"2020-06-20","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.18.20133645","rel_abs":"ABSTRACT Background The impact of inflammatory rheumatic diseases on COVID-19 severity is poorly known. Here we compare the outcomes of a cohort of rheumatic patients with a matched control cohort to identify potential risk factors for severe illness. Methods In this comparative cohort study, we identified hospital PCR+ COVID-19 rheumatic patients with chronic inflammatory arthritis (IA) or autoimmune\/immunomediated diseases (AI\/IMID). Non-rheumatic controls were randomly sampled 1:1, and matched by age, sex, and PCR date. The main outcome was severe COVID-19, defined as death, invasive ventilation, ICU admission, or serious complications. We assessed the association between the outcome and potential prognostic variables, adjusted by COVID treatment, using logistic regression. Results The cohorts were composed of 456 rheumatic and non-rheumatic patients, in equal numbers. Mean age was 63 [IQR 53-78] and male sex 41% in both cohorts. Rheumatic diseases were IA (60%) and AI\/IMID (40%). Most patients (74%) had been hospitalised, and the risk of severe COVID was 31.6% in the rheumatic and 28.1% in the non-rheumatic cohort. Ageing, male sex and previous comorbidity (obesity, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular, or lung disease) increased the risk in the rheumatic cohort by bivariate analysis. In logistic regression analysis, independent factors associated with severe COVID were increased age (OR 5.31; CI 3.14-8.95), male sex (2.13; CI 1.35-3.36) and having an AI\/IMID (OR 1.98; CI 1.15-3.41). Conclusion In patients with chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases aging, sex and having an AI\/IMID but not IA nor previous immunosuppressive therapies were associated with severe COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jos\u00e9 L Pablos","author_inst":"Servicio de Reumatologia, Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n Hospital 12 de Octubre (imas12), Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

Some sparse case reports have described various forms of encephalitis in COVID-19 disease, but very few data have focused on clinical presentations, clinical course, response to treatment and outcomes yet. Objective: to describe the clinical phenotype, laboratory and neuroimaging findings of encephalitis associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, their relationship with respiratory function and inflammatory parameters and their clinical course and response to treatment. Design: The ENCOVID multicentre study was carried out in 13 centres in northern Italy between February 20th and May 31st, 2020. Only patients with altered mental status and at least two supportive criteria for encephalitis with full infectious screening, CSF, EEG, MRI data and a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. Clinical presentation and laboratory markers, severity of COVID-19 disease, response to treatment and outcomes were recorded. Results: Out of 45 cases screened, twenty-five cases of encephalitis positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection with full available data were included. The most common symptoms at onset were delirium (68%), aphasia\/dysarthria (24%) and seizures (24%). CSF showed hyperproteinorrachia and\/or pleocytosis in 68% of cases whereas SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR resulted negative. Based on MRI, cases were classified as ADEM (n=3), limbic encephalitis (LE, n=2), encephalitis with normal imaging (n=13) and encephalitis with MRI alterations (n=7). ADEM and LE cases showed a delayed onset compared to the other encephalitis (p=0.001) and were associated with previous more severe COVID-19 respiratory involvement. Patients with MRI alterations exhibited worse response to treatment and final outcomes compared to other encephalitis. Conclusions and relevance: We found a wide clinical spectrum of encephalitis associated with COVID19 infection, underlying different pathophysiological mechanisms.

We aimed to develop a high throughput multiplex assay to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 to assess immunity to the virus in the general population. Methods Spike protein subunits S1 and RBD, and Nucleoprotein were coupled to distinct microspheres. Sera collected before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (N=224), and of non-SARS-CoV-2 influenza-like illness (N=184), and laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection (N=115) with various severity of COVID-19 were tested for SARS-CoV-2-specific concentrations of IgG. Results Our assay discriminated SARS-CoV-2-induced antibodies and those induced by other viruses. The assay obtained a specificity between 95.1 and 99.0% with a sensitivity ranging from 83.6-95.7%. By merging the test results for all 3 antigens a specificity of 100% was achieved with a sensitivity of at least 90%. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients developed higher IgG concentrations and the rate of IgG production increased faster compared to non-hospitalized cases. Conclusions The bead-based serological assay for quantitation of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies proved to be robust and can be conducted in many laboratories. Finally, we demonstrated that testing of antibodies against different antigens increases sensitivity and specificity compared to single antigen-specific IgG determination.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gerco den Hartog","author_inst":"National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM)"},{"author_name":"Rutger M Schepp","author_inst":"National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM)"},{"author_name":"Marjan Kuijer","author_inst":"National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM)"},{"author_name":"Corine GeurtsvanKessel","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Josine van Beek","author_inst":"National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM)"},{"author_name":"Nynke Rots","author_inst":"National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM)"},{"author_name":"Marion PG Koopmans","author_inst":"Erasmus MC"},{"author_name":"Fiona RM van der Klis","author_inst":"National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM)"},{"author_name":"Robert S van Binnendijk","author_inst":"National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM)"},{"author_name":"Michele Gennuso","author_inst":"Neurology Unit, Crema Hospital, Crema, Italy"},{"author_name":"Maria Sofia Cotelli","author_inst":"Neurology Unit, ASST Valcamonica, Esine, Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marinella Turla","author_inst":"Neurology Unit, ASST Valcamonica, Esine, Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Ubaldo Balducci","author_inst":"Neurology Unit, ASST Chiari, Chiari, Italy"},{"author_name":"Sara Mariotto","author_inst":"Neurology Unit, Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, University of Verona, Verona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Sergio Ferrari","author_inst":"Neurology Unit, Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, University of Verona, Verona, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alfonso Ciccone","author_inst":"Department of Neurology and Stroke Unit, Carlo Poma Hospital, ASST Mantova, Mantova, Italy"},{"author_name":"Fabrizio Fiacco","author_inst":"Neurology Unit, ASST Bergamo Est, Seriate, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alberto Imarisio","author_inst":"Neurology Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Barbara Risi","author_inst":"Neurology Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alberto Benussi","author_inst":"University of Brescia"},{"author_name":"Emanuele Foca'","author_inst":"University Division of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, University of Brescia and ASST Spedali Civili Hospital, Brescia, Italy"},{"author_name":"Francesca Caccuri","author_inst":"Microbiology Unit, Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University"},{"author_name":"Matilde Leonardi","author_inst":"Neurology, Public Health, Disability Unit -

Furthermore, the impact and timing of social distancing at the community level have yet to be fully explored. We investigated the relative associations between COVID-19 mortality and social distancing, sociodemographic makeup, economic vulnerabilities, and comorbidities in 24 counties surrounding 7 major metropolitan areas in the US using a flexible and robust time series modeling approach. We found that counties with poorer health and less wealth were associated with higher daily mortality rates compared to counties with fewer economic vulnerabilities and fewer pre-existing health conditions. Declines in mobility were associated with up to 15% lower mortality rates relative to pre-social distancing levels of mobility, but effects were lagged between 25-30 days.

The predominant diagnostic test is viral RNA detection by RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs specimens, however the results are not promptly obtainable in all patient care locations. Routine laboratory testing, in contrast, is readily available with a turn-around time (TAT) usually within 1-2 hours. Method: We developed a machine learning model incorporating patient demographic features (age, sex, race) with 27 routine laboratory tests to predict an individual's SARS-CoV-2 infection status. Laboratory test results obtained within two days before the release of SARS-CoV-2-RT-PCR result were used to train a gradient boosted decision tree (GBDT) model from 3,356 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tested patients (1,402 positive and 1,954 negative) evaluated at a metropolitan hospital. Results: The model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.854 (95% CI: 0.829-0.878). Application of this model to an independent patient dataset from a separate hospital resulted in a comparable AUC (0.838), validating the generalization of its use. Moreover, our model predicted initial SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positivity in 66% individuals whose RT-PCR result changed from negative to positive within two days. Conclusion: This model employing routine laboratory test results offers opportunities for early and rapid identification of high-risk SARS-CoV-2 infected patients before their RT-PCR results are available. It may play an important role in assisting the identification of SARS-COV-2 infected patients in areas where RT-PCR testing is not accessible due to financial or supply constraints.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"He Sarina Yang","author_inst":"Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA;

Design: Systematic review and network meta-analysis Data Sources: PubMed, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, medRxiv, SSRN, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to June 9th, 2020. Study Selection: Published and unpublished randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and baseline-adjusted observational studies which met our predefined eligibility criteria. Main Outcome Measures: The outcomes of interest were mortality, progression to severe disease (severe pneumonia or admission to intensive care unit (ICU)), time to viral clearance, QT prolongation, fatal cardiac complications, and non-cardiac serious adverse events. The level of evidence behind each outcome was also measured using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. Results: 49 studies with a total of 20212 confounder-adjusted patients were included for analysis. The risk of progression to severe pneumonia or ICU admission was significantly reduced with tocilizumab (GRADE low), anakinra (GRADE very low), and remdesivir (GRADE high) compared to standard care. Tocilizumab was shown to reduce mortality rate for both moderate-severe patients in the non-ICU setting at admission (Odds ratio (OR) 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.54, GRADE low) and critically ill patients in the ICU setting (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.91, GRADE low). High dose IVIG reduced death rate (GRADE low) while corticosteroids increased mortality for critically ill patients (GRADE moderate). Convalescent plasma and hydroxychloroquine were shown to promote viral clearance (OR 11.39, 95% CI 3.91 to 33.18, GRADE low and OR 6.08, 95% CI 2.74 to 13.48, GRADE moderate, respectively) while not altering mortality or progression to the severe courses. The combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin was shown to be associated with increased QT prolongation incidence (OR 1,85, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.26, GRADE low) and fatal cardiac complications in cardiac-impaired populations (OR 2.26, 95% CI 1.26 to 4.05, GRADE low). High-dose (>600mg\/day) hydroxychloroquine monotherapy was significantly associated with increased non-cardiac serious adverse events (GRADE moderate). Conclusion: Anti-inflammatory agents (tocilizumab, anakinra, and IVIG) and remdesivir may safely and effectively improve outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Widely used hydroxychloroquine provides marginal clinical benefit in improving viral clearance rates whilst posing both cardiac and non-cardiac safety risks, especially in the vulnerable population. Only 20% of current evidence on pharmacological management of COVID-19 is on moderate and high evidence certainty; remaining 80% are of low or very low certainty and warrant further studies to establish firm conclusions.

Generally, total antibody bridging assays combine good sensitivity with high selectivity. Therefore, we developed sensitive total antibody bridging assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein (NP), in addition to conventional isotype-specific assays. Antibody kinetics was assessed in PCR-confirmed hospitalized COVID-19 patients (n=41) and three populations of patients with COVID-19 symptoms not requiring hospital admission: PCR-confirmed convalescent plasmapheresis donors (n=182), PCR-confirmed hospital care workers (n=47), and a group of longitudinally sampled symptomatic individuals highly suspect of COVID-19 (n=14). In non-hospitalized patients, the antibody response to RBD is weaker but follows similar kinetics as has been observed in hospitalized patients. Across populations, the RBD bridging assay identified most patients correctly as seropositive. In 11\/14 of the COVID-19-suspect cases, seroconversion in the RBD bridging assay could be demonstrated before day 12; NP antibodies emerged less consistently. Furthermore, we demonstrated the feasibility of finger prick sampling for antibody detection against SARS-CoV-2 using these assays. In conclusion, the developed bridging assays reliably detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients, and are therefore well-suited to conduct seroprevalence studies.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Erik H Vogelzang","author_inst":"[1] Department of Rheumatology, Amsterdam Rheumatology and immunology Center | Reade, Amsterdam, the

The papain-like protease PLpro cleaves the viral polyprotein, and reverses inflammatory ubiquitin and anti-viral ubiquitin-like ISG15 protein modifications1,2. Drugs that target SARS-CoV-2 PLpro (hereafter, SARS2 PLpro) may hence be effective as treatments or prophylaxis for COVID-19, reducing viral load and reinstating innate immune responses3. We here characterise SARS2 PLpro in molecular and biochemical detail. SARS2 PLpro cleaves Lys48-linked polyubiquitin and ISG15 modifications with high activity. Structures of PLpro bound to ubiquitin and ISG15 reveal that the S1 ubiquitin binding site is responsible for high ISG15 activity, while the S2 binding site provides Lys48 chain specificity and cleavage efficiency. We further exploit two strategies to target PLpro. A repurposing approach, screening 3727 unique approved drugs and clinical compounds against SARS2 PLpro, identified no compounds that inhibited PLpro consistently or that could be validated in counterscreens. More promisingly, non-covalent small molecule SARS PLpro inhibitors were able to inhibit SARS2 PLpro with high potency and excellent antiviral activity in SARS-CoV-2 infection models.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Theresa Klemm","author_inst":"The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and Department of Medical Biology, University of

of coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)","rel_date":"2020-06-19","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.18.160671","rel_abs":"Human coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses which cause respiratory diseases ranging in severity from the seasonal common cold to SARS and COVID-19. Of the 7 human coronaviruses discovered to date, 3 emergent and severe human coronavirus strains (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) have recently jumped to humans in the last 20 years. The COVID-19 pandemic spawned by the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 has highlighted the importance for development of effective therapeutics to target emerging coronaviruses. Upon entry, the replicase genes of coronaviruses are translated and subsequently proteolytically processed by virus-encoded proteases. Of these proteases, nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5, Mpro, or 3CLpro), mediates the majority of these cleavages and remains a key drug target for therapeutic inhibitors. Efforts to develop nsp5 active-site inhibitors for human coronaviruses have thus far been unsuccessful, establishing the need for identification of other critical and conserved non-active-site regions of the protease. In this study, we describe the identification of an essential, conserved horseshoe-shaped region in the nsp5 interdomain loop (IDL) of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a common coronavirus replication model. Using site-directed mutagenesis and replication studies, we show that several residues comprising this horseshoe-shaped region either fail to tolerate mutagenesis or were associated with viral temperature-sensitivity. Structural modeling and sequence analysis of these sites in other coronaviruses, including all 7 human coronaviruses, suggests that the identified structure and sequence of this horseshoe regions is highly conserved and may represent a new, non-active-site regulatory region of the nsp5 (3CLpro) protease to target with coronavirus inhibitors.\n\nImportanceIn December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in humans and triggered a pandemic which has to date resulted in over 8 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 across more than 180 countries and territories (June 2020). SARS-CoV-2 represents the third emergent coronavirus in the past 20 years and the future emergence of new coronaviruses in humans remains certain. Critically, there remains no vaccine nor established therapeutics to treat cases of COVID-19. The coronavirus nsp5 protease is a conserved and indispensable virus-encoded enzyme which remains a key target for therapeutic design. However, past attempts to target the active site of nsp5 with inhibitors have failed stressing the need to identify new conserved non-active-site targets for therapeutic development. This study describes the discovery of a novel conserved structural region of the nsp5 protease of coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) which may provide a new target for coronavirus drug development.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Benjamin C.

December 2019 in China resulted in over 7.8 million infections and over 430,000 deaths worldwide, imposing an urgent need for rapid development of an efficient and cost-effective vaccine, suitable for mass immunization. Here, we generated a replication competent recombinant VSV-{Delta}G-spike vaccine, in which the glycoprotein of VSV was replaced by the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2. In vitro characterization of the recombinant VSV-{Delta}G-spike indicated expression and presentation of the spike protein on the viral membrane with antigenic similarity to SARS-CoV-2. A golden Syrian hamster in vivo model for COVID-19 was implemented. We show that vaccination of hamsters with recombinant VSV-{Delta}G-spike results in rapid and potent induction of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, single-dose vaccination was able to protect hamsters against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, as demonstrated by the abrogation of body weight loss of the immunized hamsters compared to unvaccinated hamsters. Furthermore, whereas lungs of infected hamsters displayed extensive tissue damage and high viral titers, immunized hamsters lungs showed only minor lung pathology, and no viral load. Taken together, we suggest recombinant VSV-{Delta}G-spike as a safe, efficacious and protective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":36,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yfat Yahalom-Ronen","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Hadas Tamir","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Sharon Melamed","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Boaz Politi","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Ohad Shifman","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Hagit Achdout","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Einat B.

Extending our studies to lung epithelial cells, we found that there are major differences in drug sensitivity and entry pathways used by SARS-CoV-2 in these cells. Entry in lung epithelial Calu-3 cells is pH-independent and requires TMPRSS2, while entry in Vero and Huh7.5 cells requires low pH and triggering by acid-dependent endosomal proteases. Moreover, we found 9 drugs are antiviral in lung cells, 7 of which have been tested in humans, and 3 are FDA approved including Cyclosporine which we found is targeting Cyclophilin rather than Calcineurin for its antiviral activity.

Among those persons with serious COVID-19 disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common and often fatal presentation. Animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection that manifest severe disease are needed to investigate the pathogenesis of COVID-19 induced ARDS and evaluate therapeutic strategies. Here we report ARDS in two aged African green monkeys (AGMs) infected with SARS-CoV-2 that demonstrated pathological lesions and disease similar to severe COVID-19 in humans. We also report a comparatively mild COVID-19 phenotype characterized by minor clinical, radiographic and histopathologic changes in the two surviving, aged AGMs and four rhesus macaques (RMs) infected with SARS-CoV-2. We found dramatic increases in circulating cytokines in three of four infected, aged AGMs but not in infected RMs. All of the AGMs showed increased levels of plasma IL-6 compared to baseline, a predictive marker and presumptive therapeutic target in humans infected with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Together, our results show that both RM and AGM are capable of modeling SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest that aged AGMs may be useful for modeling severe disease manifestations including ARDS.","rel_num_authors":25,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robert V Blair","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Monica Vaccari","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Lara A Doyle-Meyers","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Chad J Roy","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Kasi Russell-Lodrigue","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Marissa Fahlberg","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Chris J Monjure","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Brandon Beddingfield","author_inst":"Tulane University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kenneth S Plante","author_inst":"World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses, Institute for Human Infections and Immunity, University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Jessica A Plante","author_inst":"World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses, Institute for Human Infections and Immunity, University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Scott C Weaver","author_inst":"World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses, Institute for Human Infections and Immunity, University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Xuebin Qin","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Cecily C Midkiff","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Gabrielle Lehmicke","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Nadia Golden","author_inst":"Lehmicke"},{"author_name":"Breanna Threeton","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Toni Penney","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Carolina Allers","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Mary B Barnes","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Melissa Pattison","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Prasun K Datta","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J Maness","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Angela Birnbaum","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Rudolf P Bohm","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Jay Rappaport","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Ran Zichel","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Emanuelle Mamroud","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Ohad Mazor","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Haim Levy","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Orly Laskar","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Shmuel Yitzhaki","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Shmuel C.

The viral membrane of SARS-CoV-2 surrounds a helical nucleocapsid in which the viral genome is encapsulated by the nucleocapsid protein. The nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 is produced at high levels within infected cells, enhances the efficiency of viral RNA transcription and is essential for viral replication. Here we show that RNA induces cooperative liquid-liquid phase separation of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. In agreement with its ability to phase separate in vitro, we show that the protein associates in cells with stress granules, cytoplasmic RNA\/protein granules that form through liquid-liquid phase separation and are modulated by viruses to maximize replication efficiency. Liquid-liquid phase separation generates high-density protein\/RNA condensates that recruit the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex of SARS-CoV-2 providing a mechanism for efficient transcription of viral RNA. Inhibition of RNA-induced phase separation of the nucleocapsid protein by small molecules or biologics thus can interfere with a key step in the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adriana Savastano","author_inst":"German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"},{"author_name":"Alain Ibanez-de-Opakua","author_inst":"German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"},{"author_name":"Marija Rankovic","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry"},{"author_name":"Markus Zweckstetter","author_inst":"German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"},{"author_name":"Kasi Russell-Lodrigue","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Marissa Fahlberg","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Chris J Monjure","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Brandon Beddingfield","author_inst":"Tulane University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kenneth S Plante","author_inst":"World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses, Institute for Human Infections and Immunity, University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Jessica A Plante","author_inst":"World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses, Institute for Human Infections and Immunity, University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Scott C Weaver","author_inst":"World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses, Institute for Human Infections and Immunity, University of Texas Medical Branch"},{"author_name":"Xuebin Qin","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Cecily C Midkiff","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Gabrielle Lehmicke","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Nadia Golden","author_inst":"Lehmicke"},{"author_name":"Breanna Threeton","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Toni Penney","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Carolina Allers","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Mary B Barnes","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Melissa Pattison","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Prasun K Datta","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J Maness","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Angela Birnbaum","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Rudolf P Bohm","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Jay Rappaport","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Ran Zichel","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Emanuelle Mamroud","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Ohad Mazor","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Haim Levy","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Orly Laskar","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Shmuel Yitzhaki","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Shmuel C.

Alternative methodologies to PCR and immunodiagnostic that would not require specific reagents are worth to investigate not only for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, but also to detect other emergent pathogenic threats. Here, we propose the use of tandem mass spectrometry to detect SARS-CoV-2 marker peptides in nasopharyngeal swabs. We documented that the signal from the microbiota present in such samples is low and can be overlooked when interpreting shotgun proteomic data acquired on a restricted window of the peptidome landscape. Simili nasopharyngeal swabs spiked with different quantities of purified SARS-CoV-2 viral material were used to develop a nanoLC-MS\/MS acquisition method, which was then successfully applied on COVID-19 clinical samples. We argue that peptides ADETQALPQR and GFYAQGSR from the nucleocapsid protein are of utmost interest as their signal is intense and their elution can be obtained within a 3 min window in the tested conditions. These results pave the way for the development of time-efficient viral diagnostic tests based on mass spectrometry.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Duarte Gouveia","author_inst":"University Paris Saclay, CEA, INRAE"},{"author_name":"Guylaine Miotello","author_inst":"University Paris Saclay, CEA, INRAE"},{"author_name":"Fabrice Gallais","author_inst":"University Paris Saclay, CEA, INRAE"},{"author_name":"Jean-Charles Gaillard","author_inst":"University Paris-Saclay, CEA, INRAE"},{"author_name":"Stephanie Debroas","author_inst":"University Paris-Saclay, CEA, INRAE"},{"author_name":"Laurent Bellanger","author_inst":"University Paris-Saclay, CEA, INRAE"},{"author_name":"Jean-Philippe Lavigne","author_inst":"VBMI, INSERM U1047, Universite de Montpellier, Service de Microbiologie et Hygiene Hospitaliere, CHU Nimes"},{"author_name":"Albert Sotto","author_inst":"VBMI, INSERM U1047, Universite de Montpellier, Service des Maladies Infectieuses et Tropicales, CHU Nimes"},{"author_name":"Lucia Grenga","author_inst":"University Paris-Saclay, CEA, INRAE"},{"author_name":"Olivier Pible","author_inst":"University Paris-Saclay, CEA, INRAE"},{"author_name":"Jean Armengaud","author_inst":"University Paris-Saclay, CEA, INRAE"},{"author_name":"Xuebin Qin","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Cecily C Midkiff","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Gabrielle Lehmicke","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Nadia Golden","author_inst":"Lehmicke"},{"author_name":"Breanna Threeton","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Toni Penney","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Carolina Allers","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Mary B Barnes","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Melissa Pattison","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Prasun K Datta","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Nicholas J Maness","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Angela Birnbaum","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Rudolf P Bohm","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Jay Rappaport","author_inst":"Tulane National Primate Research Center"},{"author_name":"Ran Zichel","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Emanuelle Mamroud","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Ohad Mazor","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Haim Levy","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Orly Laskar","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Shmuel Yitzhaki","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Shmuel C.

Recently, ELISA binding cross-reactivity against components of human epidemic coronaviruses with currently available intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) Gamunex-C and Flebogamma DIF (5% and 10%) have been reported. In this study, the same products were tested for neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and their potential as an antiviral therapy.\n\nMethodsThe neutralization capacity of six selected lots of IVIG was assessed against SARS-CoV-2 (two different isolates), SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in cell cultures. Infectivity neutralization was measured by determining the percent reduction in plaque-forming units (PFU) and by cytopathic effects for two IVIG lots in one of the SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Neutralization was quantified using the plaque reduction neutralization test 50 (PRNT50) in the PFU assay and the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) in the cytopathic\/cytotoxic method (calculated as the minus log10 dilution which reduced the viral titer by 50%).\n\nResultsAll IVIG preparations showed neutralization of both SARS-CoV-2 isolates, ranging from 79 to 89.5% with PRNT50 titers from 4.5 to >5 for the PFU method and ranging from 47.0%-64.7% with an IC50 ~1 for the cytopathic method. All IVIG lots produced neutralization of SARS-CoV ranging from 39.5 to 55.1 % and PRNT50 values ranging from 2.0 to 3.3. No IVIG preparation showed significant neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV.\n\nConclusionIn cell culture neutralization assays, the tested IVIG products contain antibodies with significant cross-neutralization capacity against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. However, no neutralization capacity was demonstrated against MERS-CoV. These preparations are currently available and may be immediately useful for COVID-19 management.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda D\u00edez","author_inst":"Immunotherapies Unit, Bioscience Research and Development, Grifols, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Carolina Romero","author_inst":"Immunotherapies Unit, Bioscience Research and Development, Grifols, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"J\u00falia Vergara Alert","author_inst":"IRTA, Centre de Recerca en Sanitat Animal (CReSA, IRTA-UAB), Campus de la Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona (UAB), Bellaterra, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Melissa Bell\u00f3 P\u00e9rez","author_inst":"Laboratorio Coronavirus.

In an attempt to address this we used a rapidly growing genomic dataset of SARS-CoV-2 with relevant metadata information. Remarkably, by simply ordering SARS-CoV-2 genomes by their date of collection, we find a progressive increase of C-to-U substitutions resulting in 5-UCG-3 motif reduction that in turn have reduced the CpG frequency over just a few months of observation. This is consistent with APOBEC-mediated RNA editing resulting in CpG reduction, thus allowing the virus to escape ZAP-mediated RNA degradation. Our results thus link the dynamics of target sequences in the viral genome for two known host molecular defense mechanisms, mediated by the APOBEC and ZAP proteins.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mukhtar Sadykov","author_inst":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Tobias Mourier","author_inst":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Qingtian Guan","author_inst":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Arnab Pain","author_inst":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jordi Rodon","author_inst":"IRTA, Centre de Recerca en Sanitat Animal (CReSA, IRTA-UAB), Campus de la Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona (UAB), Bellaterra, Barcelona, Spain"},{"author_name":"Jos\u00e9 Manuel Honrubia","author_inst":"Laboratorio Coronavirus.

Trade in wildlife likely played a role in the origin of COVID-19, and viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 have been identified in bats and pangolins, both traded widely. To investigate the possible role of pangolins as a source of potential zoonoses, we collected throat and rectal swabs from 334 Sunda pangolins (Manis javanica) confiscated in Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah between August 2009 and March 2019. Total nucleic acid was extracted for viral molecular screening using conventional PCR protocols used to routinely identify known and novel viruses in extensive prior sampling (>50,000 mammals). No sample yielded a positive PCR result for any of the targeted viral families - Coronaviridae, Filoviridae, Flaviviridae, Orthomyxoviridae and Paramyxoviridae. In light of recent reports of coronaviruses including a SARS-CoV-2 related virus in Sunda pangolins in China, the lack of any coronavirus detection in our  upstream market chain samples suggests that these detections in  downstream animals more plausibly reflect exposure to infected humans, wildlife or other animals within the wildlife trade network. While confirmatory serologic studies are needed, it is likely that Sunda pangolins are incidental hosts of coronaviruses.

The paired CD4 conserved residues, including the matched CD4 interacting MHC-II epitopes of the structural viral protein domains, were chosen for the protein modelling using the SWISS-MODEL online server. Energy minimization and structural validation of the modelled viral protein domains, including the CD4 and MHC-II protein were achieved by CHIMERA and PROCHECK-Ramachandran Plot respectively. Protein-protein docking was performed by the HADDOCK online tool. The binding affinity score was measured using the PRODIGY online server.\n\nAs per our docking report, the Env gp120 of HIV-1 with three identical and three conserved residues of CD4 exhibited the highest binding affinity (-13.9 kcal\/mol) with MHC-II than the second-highest RBD-S1-SARS-CoV-2 (-12.5 kcal\/mol) with three identical and a single conserved residue of CD4. With a noticeable single salt bridge formation identified at the interacting residues Lys305 (of Env gp120-HIV-1) and Glu139 (of MHC-II); the Env gp120 interaction with MHC-II occupied the crucial His144 and Glu194 (salt-bridge) interacting residues of CD4 with the measured buried surface area 2554.8{+\/-}40.8 [A]2. Similarly, the RBD-S1-SARS-CoV-2-MHC-II complex showed two salt bridge formations at the residue sites: 1) Arg567 (of SARS-CoV-2)-Glu194 (of MHC-II) 2) 2) Asp568(of SARS-CoV-2)-Arg165 (of MHC-II) with the increased buried surface area of 1910.9{+\/-}97.1 [A]2 over the SARS-CoV score 1708.2{+\/-}50.8 [A]2; that camouflaged all crucial CD4 interacting residues of MHC-II.

We identify 33 distinct 8-mer\/9-mer peptides that are identical between SARS-CoV-2 and human proteomes, along similar extents of viral mimicry observed in other viruses. Interestingly, 20 novel peptides have not been observed in any previous human coronavirus (HCoV) strains. Four of the total mimicked 8-mers\/9-mers map onto HLA-B*40:01, HLA-B*40:02, and HLA-B*35:01 binding peptides from human PAM, ANXA7, PGD, and ALOX5AP proteins. This mimicry of multiple human proteins by SARS-CoV-2 is made salient by the targeted genes being focally expressed in arteries, lungs, esophagus, pancreas, and macrophages. Further, HLA-A*03 restricted 8-mer peptides are shared broadly by human and coronaviridae helicases with primary expression of the mimicked human proteins in the neurons and immune cells. This study presents the first comprehensive scan of peptide mimicry by SARS-CoV-2 of the human proteome and motivates follow-up research into its immunological consequences.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"AJ Venkatakrishnan","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Nikhil Kayal","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Praveen Anand","author_inst":"nference Labs"},{"author_name":"Andrew D Badley","author_inst":"Mayo Clinic"},{"author_name":"George M Church","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Venky Soundararajan","author_inst":"nference"},{"author_name":"Symphorosa Sipangkui","author_inst":"Sabah Wildlife Department, 5th Floor, B Block, Wisma MUIS, 88100, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia."},{"author_name":"Senthilvel K.S.S.

The presence of D614G was associated with a higher genome copy number and its prevalence expanded with time. Four strains carried a deletion in a predicted stem loop of the 3 untranslated region. The data are consistent with community spread within the local population and the larger continental U.S. No strain had mutations in the target sites used in common diagnostic assays. The data instill confidence in the sensitivity of current tests and validate \"testing by sequencing\" as a new option to uncover cases, particularly those not conforming to the standard clinical presentation of COVID-19.

The success of future containment measures concernig new introductions will be highly challenging for country due to the significant proportion of BH population living abroad.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Teufik Goletic","author_inst":"Veterinary faculty of University of Sarajevo, Zmaja od Bosne 90, 71000 Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"author_name":"Rijad Konjhodzic","author_inst":"ALEA Genetic Center, Olovska 67, 71000 Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"author_name":"Nihad Fejzic","author_inst":"Veterinary faculty of University of Sarajevo, Zmaja od Bosne 90, 71000 Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"author_name":"Sejla Goletic","author_inst":"Veterinary faculty of University of Sarajevo, Zmaja od Bosne 90, 71000 Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"author_name":"Toni Eterovic","author_inst":"Veterinary faculty of University of Sarajevo, Zmaja od Bosne 90, 71000 Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"author_name":"Adis Softic","author_inst":"Veterinary faculty of University of Sarajevo, Zmaja od Bosne 90, 71000 Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"author_name":"Aida Kustura","author_inst":"Veterinary faculty of University of Sarajevo, Zmaja od Bosne 90, 71000 Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"author_name":"Lana Salihefendic","author_inst":"ALEA Genetic Center, Olovska 67, 71000 Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"author_name":"Maja Ostojic","author_inst":"University Clinical Hospital of Mostar, Bijeli Brijeg b.b., 88000 Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"author_name":"Maja Travar","author_inst":"University Clinical Centre of the Republic of Srpska, Dvanaest beba bb, 78000 Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"author_name":"Visnja Mrdjen","author_inst":"University Clinical Centre of the Republic of Srpska, Dvanaest beba bb, 78000 Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"author_name":"Nijaz Tihic","author_inst":"University Clinical Center Tuzla, Ulica Profesora doktora Ibre Pasica, 75000 Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"author_name":"Sead Jazic","author_inst":"General Hospital \"Abdulah Nakas\", Kranjceviceva 12, 71000 Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"author_name":"Sanjin Musa","author_inst":"Institute for Public Health of Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Marsala Tita 9, 71000 Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"author_name":"Damir Marjanovic","author_inst":"Center for Applied Bioanthropology, Institute for Anthropological Researches, Gajeva ulica 32, 10 000 Zagreb, Croatia"},{"author_name":"Mirsada Hukic","author_inst":"The Academy of Science and Arts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bistrik 7, 71000 Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"author_name":"James O Meyo","author_inst":"The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Tiphaine Calabre","author_inst":"Ecole superieure de Chimie Physique Electronique (CPE) Lyon"},{"author_name":"Grant Broussard","author_inst":"The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Ricardo Rivera-Soto","author_inst":"The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Danielle L Chappell","author_inst":"The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Ralph S Baric","author_inst":"The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Blossom Damania","author_inst":"The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Melissa B Miller","author_inst":"The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Dirk Dittmer","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Ran Zichel","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Emanuelle Mamroud","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Ohad Mazor","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Haim Levy","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Orly Laskar","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Shmuel Yitzhaki","author_inst":"IIBR"},{"author_name":"Shmuel C.

With no specific therapeutic and prophylactic options available, the virus was able to infect millions of people. To date, close to half a million patients succumbed to the viral disease, COVID-19. The high need for treatment options, together with the lack of small animal models of infection has led to clinical trials with repurposed drugs before any preclinical in vivo evidence attesting their efficacy was available. We used Syrian hamsters to establish a model to evaluate antiviral activity of small molecules in both an infection and a transmission setting. Upon intranasal infection, the animals developed high titers of SARS-CoV-2 in the lungs and pathology similar to that observed in mild COVID-19 patients. Treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters with favipiravir or hydroxychloroquine (with and without azithromycin) resulted in respectively a mild or no reduction in viral RNA and infectious virus. Micro-CT scan analysis of the lungs showed no improvement compared to non-treated animals, which was confirmed by histopathology. In addition, both compounds did not prevent virus transmission through direct contact and thus failed as prophylactic treatments. By modelling the PK profile of hydroxychloroquine based on the trough plasma concentrations, we show that the total lung exposure to the drug was not the limiting factor. In conclusion, we here characterized a hamster infection and transmission model to be a robust model for studying in vivo efficacy of antiviral compounds. The information acquired using hydroxychloroquine and favipiravir in this model is of critical value to those designing (current and) future clinical trials. At this point, the data here presented on hydroxychloroquine either alone or combined with azithromycin (together with previously reported in vivo data in macaques and ferrets) provide no scientific basis for further use of the drug in humans.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Suzanne JF Kaptein","author_inst":"KU Leuven Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Laboratory of Virology and Chemotherapy, B-3000 Leuve"},{"author_name":"Sofie Jacobs","author_inst":"KU Leuven Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Laboratory of Virology and Chemotherapy, B-3000 Leuve"},{"author_name":"Lana Langendries","author_inst":"KU Leuven Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Laboratory of Virology and Chemotherapy, B-3000 Leuve"},{"author_name":"Laura Seldeslachts","author_inst":"KU Leuven Department of Imaging and Pathology, Molecular Small Animal Imaging Centre (MoSAIC), B-3000 Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Sebastiaan ter Horst","author_inst":"KU Leuven Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Laboratory of Virology and Chemotherapy, B-3000 Leuve"},{"author_name":"Laurens Liesenborghs","author_inst":"KU Leuven Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Laboratory of Virology and Chemotherapy, B-3000 Leuve"},{"author_name":"Bart Hens","author_inst":"KU Leuven, Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, Drug Delivery & Disposition, Box 921, 3000 Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Valentijn Vergote","author_inst":"KU Leuven Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Laboratory of Virology and Chemotherapy, B-3000 Leuve"},{"author_name":"Elisabeth Heylen","author_inst":"KU Leuven Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Laboratory of Virology and Chemotherapy, B-3000 Leuve"},{"author_name":"Elke Maas","author_inst":"KU Leuven Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Laboratory of Virology and Chemotherapy, B-3000 Leuve"},{"author_name":"Carolien De Keyzer","author_inst":"KU Leuven Department of Microbiology ,Immunology and Transplantation, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Laboratory of Virology and Chemotherapy, B-3000 Leuve"},{"author_name":"Lindsey Bervoets","author_inst":"KU Leuven Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Laboratory of Virology and Chemotherapy, B-3000 Leuve"},{"author_name":"Jasper Rymenants","author_inst":"KU Leuven Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Laboratory of Virology and Chemotherapy, B-3000 Leuve"},{"author_name":"Tina Van Buyten","author_inst":"KU Leuven Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Laboratory of Virology and Chemotherapy, B-3000 Leuve"},{"author_name":"Hendrik Jan Thibaut","author_inst":"KU Leuven Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Laboratory of Virology and Chemotherapy, B-3000 Leuve"},{"author_name":"Kai Dallmeier","author_inst":"KU Leuven Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Laboratory of Virology and Chemotherapy, B-3000 Leuve"},{"author_name":"Robbert Boudewijns","author_inst":"KU Leuven Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Laboratory of Virology and Chemotherapy, B-3000 Leuve"},{"author_name":"Jens Wouters","author_inst":"KU Leuven Department of Imaging and Pathology, Molecular Small Animal Imaging Centre (MoSAIC), B-3000 Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Patrick Augustijns","author_inst":"KU Leuven, Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, Drug Delivery & Disposition, Box 921, 3000 Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Nick Verougstraete","author_inst":"Department of Laboratory Medicine, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Christopher Cawthorne","author_inst":"KU Leuven, Department of Imaging and Pathology, Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Birgit Weynand","author_inst":"KU Leuven Department of Imaging and Pathology, Translational Cell and Tissue Research, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium;

Early identification of infected people and their contacts is the key to being able to isolate them and prevent the dissemination of the pathogen; unfortunately, most countries are unable to do this due to the lack of diagnostic tools. Dogs can identify, with a high rate of precision, unique odors of volatile organic compounds generated during an infection; as a result, dogs can diagnose infectious agents by smelling specimens and, sometimes, the body of an infected individual. We trained six dogs of three different breeds to detect SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory secretions of infected patients and evaluated their performance experimentally, comparing it against the gold standard (rRT-PCR). Here we show that viral detection takes one second per specimen. After scent-interrogating 9,200 samples, our six dogs achieved independently and as a group very high sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, accuracy, and likelihood ratio, with very narrow confidence intervals. The highest metric was the negative predictive value, indicating that with a disease prevalence of 7.6%, 99.9% of the specimens indicated as negative by the dogs did not carry the virus. These findings demonstrate that dogs could be useful to track viral infection in humans, allowing COVID-19 free people to return to work safely.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Omar Vesga","author_inst":"Universidad de Antioquia"},{"author_name":"Andres Felipe Valencia","author_inst":"GRIPE, Universidad de Antioquia, Colombia; Colina K-9, La Ceja, Antioquia, Colombia."},{"author_name":"Alejandro Mira","author_inst":"GRIPE, Universidad de Antioquia, Medellin, Colombia; Colina K-9, La Ceja, Antioquia, Colombia"},{"author_name":"Felipe Ossa","author_inst":"GRIPE, Universidad de Antioquia, Medellin, Colombia; Colina K-9, La Ceja, Antioquia, Colombia"},{"author_name":"Esteban Ocampo","author_inst":"Colina K-9, La Ceja, Antioquia, Colombia"},{"author_name":"Maria Agudelo Perez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario San Vicente Fundacion, Medellin, Colombia; GRIPE, Universidad de Antioquia, Medellin, Colombia."},{"author_name":"karl Ciouderis","author_inst":"Colombia\/Wisconsin One-Health Consortium, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Sede Medellin."},{"author_name":"Laura Perez","author_inst":"Colombia\/Wisconsin One-Health Consortium, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Sede Medellin."},{"author_name":"Andres Cardona","author_inst":"Colombia\/Wisconsin One-Health Consortium, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Sede Medellin."},{"author_name":"Yudy Aguilar Perez","author_inst":"GRIPE, Universidad de Antioquia, Medellin, Colombia."},{"author_name":"Javier Mauricio Gonzalez","author_inst":"GRIPE, Universidad de Antioquia, Medellin, Colombia"},{"author_name":"Juan Carlos Catano Correa","author_inst":"GRIPE, Universidad de Antioquia, Medellin, Colombia"},{"author_name":"Yuli Agudelo Berruecos","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario San Vicente Fundacion, Medellin, Colombia."},{"author_name":"Juan P.
