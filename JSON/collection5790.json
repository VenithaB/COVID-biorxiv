The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 is rapidly increasing day by day. Machine Learning (ML) and Cloud Computing can be deployed very effectively to track the disease, predict growth of the epidemic and design strategies and policy to manage its spread. This study applies an improved mathematical model to analyse and predict the growth of the epidemic. An ML-based improved model has been applied to predict the potential threat of COVID-19 in countries worldwide. We show that using iterative weighting for fitting Generalized Inverse Weibull distribution, a better fit can be obtained to develop a prediction framework. This can be deployed on a cloud computing platform for more accurate and real-time prediction of the growth behavior of the epidemic. A data driven approach with higher accuracy as here can be very useful for a proactive response from the government and citizens. Finally, we propose a set of research opportunities and setup grounds for further practical applications.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shreshth Tuli","author_inst":"IIT Delhi"},{"author_name":"Shikhar Tuli","author_inst":"IIT Delhi"},{"author_name":"Rakesh Tuli","author_inst":"UIET, Panjab University"},{"author_name":"Sukhpal Singh Gill","author_inst":"Queen Mary University London"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.06.20093377","rel_title":"The RBD Of The Spike Protein Of SARS-Group Coronaviruses Is A Highly Specific Target Of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies But Not Other Pathogenic Human and Animal Coronavirus Antibodies","rel_date":"2020-05-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.06.20093377","rel_abs":"A new Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus variant (SARS-CoV-2) that first emerged in late 2019 is responsible for a pandemic of severe respiratory illness. People infected with this highly contagious virus present with clinically inapparent, mild or severe disease. Currently, the presence of the virus in individual patients and at the population level is being monitored by testing symptomatic cases by PCR for the presence of viral RNA. There is an urgent need for SARS-CoV-2 serologic tests to identify all infected individuals, irrespective of clinical symptoms, to conduct surveillance and implement strategies to contain spread. As the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike (S) protein is poorly conserved between SARS-CoVs and other pathogenic human coronaviruses, the RBD represents a promising antigen for detecting CoV specific antibodies in people. Here we use a large panel of human sera (70 SARS-CoV-2 patients and 71 control subjects) and hyperimmune sera from animals exposed to zoonotic CoVs to evaluate the performance of the RBD as an antigen for accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. By day 9 after the onset of symptoms, the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD antigen was highly sensitive (98%) and specific (100%) to antibodies induced by SARS-CoVs. We observed a robust correlation between levels of RBD binding antibodies and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in patients. Our results, which reveal the early kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses, strongly support the use of RBD-based antibody assays for population-level surveillance and as a correlate of neutralizing antibody levels in people who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infections.","rel_num_authors":24,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lakshmanane Premkumar","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill NC 27599, USA"},{"author_name":"Bruno Segovia-Chumbez","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill NC 27599, USA"},{"author_name":"Ramesh Jadi","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill NC 27599, USA"},{"author_name":"David R.

A common question is if and when a country or region will reach herd immunity h. The classical herd immunity level hC is defined as hC=1-1\/R0, where R0 is the basic reproduction number, for covid-19 estimated to lie somewhere in the range 2.2-3.5 depending on country and region. It is shown here that the disease-induced herd immunity level hD, after an outbreak has taken place in a country\/region with a set of preventive measures put in place, is actually substantially smaller than hC. As an illustration we show that if R0=2.5 in an age-structured community with mixing rates fitted to social activity studies, and also categorizing individuals into three categories: low active, average active and high active, and where preventive measures affect all mixing rates proportionally, then the disease-induced herd immunity level is hD=43% rather than hC=1-1\/2.5=60%. Consequently, a lower fraction infected is required for herd immunity to appear. The underlying reason is that when immunity is induced by disease spreading, the proportion infected in groups with high contact rates is greater than that in groups with low contact rates. Consequently, disease-induced immunity is stronger than when immunity is uniformly distributed in the community as in the classical herd immunity level.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tom Britton","author_inst":"Stockholm University"},{"author_name":"Pieter Trapman","author_inst":"Stockholm University"},{"author_name":"Frank G Ball","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"David R.

To exemplify with a limiting case, splitting a population into m (say, 5 or 10) noninteracting groups while keeping intra-group interaction unchanged yields a stretched epidemiologic curve having the maximum number of daily infections reduced and postponed in time by the same factor m (5 or 10). More generally, our study suggests a practical approach to fight against SARS-CoV-2 virus spread based on population splitting into groups and minimizing intermingling between them. This strategy can be pursued by large-scale infrastructure reorganization of activity at different levels in big logistic units (e.g., large productive networks, factories, enterprises, warehouses, schools, (seasonal) harvest work). Importantly, unlike total lockdwon strategy, the proposed approach prevents economic ruin and keeps social life at a more bearable level than distancing everyone from anyone.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ioan Baldea","author_inst":"Heidelberg University"},{"author_name":"Ioan Baldea","author_inst":"Heidelberg University"},{"author_name":"Olivier Dadoun","author_inst":"Laboratoire de Physique Nucleaire et des Hautes Energies, CNRS UMR 7585, Sorbonne Universite, Universite de Paris"},{"author_name":"David R.

This pandemic has affected most of the countries in the world because the high global movement of individuals and excessive cost in interventions. Objective: Using demographic data from city of Cali, disease epidemiological information from affected countries and mathematical models, we estimated the rate of initial exponential growth of new cases and the basic reproductive rate for a potential outbreak in city of Cali in Colombia. Materials and methods: We used dynamical models with different modeling assumptions such as use of various types of interventions and\/or epidemiological characteristics to compare and contrast the differences between Colombian cities and between Latin American countries. Results: Under the assumption of homogeneously mixing population and limited resources, we predicted expected number of infected, hospitalized, in Intensive Care Units (ICU) and deaths during this potential COVID-19 outbreak. Our results suggest that on a given day in Cali there may be up to around 73000 cases who might need hospitalization under no intervention. However, this number drastically reduces if we carry out only-isolation intervention (with 16 days of symptomatic infection; [~]13,000 cases) versus both quarantining for 6 days and isolation within 16 days ([~]3500 cases). The peak in Cali will reach in 2-3 months. Conclusions: The estimates from these studies provides different scenarios of outbreaks and can help Cali to be better prepared during the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jorge Humberto Rojas","author_inst":"Secretaria de Salud Publica Alcaldia de Santiago de Cali"},{"author_name":"Marlio Paredes","author_inst":"Universidad del Valle, Cali, Colombia"},{"author_name":"Malay Banerjee","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India"},{"author_name":"Olcay Akman","author_inst":"Illinois State University"},{"author_name":"Anuj Mubayi","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Alena Markmann","author_inst":"Departments of Medicine, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill NC 27599, USA"},{"author_name":"Caleb Cornaby","author_inst":"Immunology\/Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics Laboratories, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill NC 27599, USA"},{"author_name":"Luther Bartelt","author_inst":"Departments of Medicine, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill NC 27599, USA"},{"author_name":"Susan Weiss","author_inst":"Departments of Medicine, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill NC 27599, USA"},{"author_name":"Yara Park","author_inst":"Departments of Medicine, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill NC 27599, USA"},{"author_name":"Caitlin E.

In order to understand this spreading, we investigate a stochastic epidemic model using a metapopulation approach. Simulations are supplied with real data for mobility, demography, and confirmed cases of COVID-19 extracted from public sources. Contagion follows a compartmental epidemic model for each municipality; the latter, in turn, interact with each other through recurrent mobility. Considering the number of municipalities with confirmed COVID-19 cases, simulations can infer the level of mitigation (strong, moderate, or none) that each state is effectively adopting. Properties of the epidemic curves such as time and value of epidemic peak and outbreak duration have very broad distributions across different geographical locations. This outbreak variability is observed on several scales from state, passing through intermediate, immediate down to municipality levels. The epidemic waves start from several foci concentrated in highly populated regions and propagate towards the countryside. Correlations between delay of the epidemic outbreak and distance from the respective capital cities are strong in several states, showing propagation towards the countryside, and weak in others, signaling strong influences of multiple centers, not necessarily within the same state. Our take home message is that the responses of different regions to the same mitigation protocol can vary enormously such that the policies of combating COVID-19, such as quarantine or lockdown, must be engineered according to the region specificity but integrated with the overall situation. Even though we restricted our study to Brazil, we believe that these ideas can be generalized to other countries with continental scales and heterogeneous demographic distributions.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guilherme S Costa","author_inst":"Departamento de Fisica, Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Vicosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Wesley Cota","author_inst":"Departamento de Fisica, Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Vicosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Silvio C Ferreira","author_inst":"Departamento de Fisica, Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Vicosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil and National Institute of Science and Technology for Complex Systems, Rio d"},{"author_name":"Alun L Lloyd","author_inst":"North Carolina State University"},{"author_name":"Kevin M Esvelt","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Alena Markmann","author_inst":"Departments of Medicine, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill NC 27599, USA"},{"author_name":"Caleb Cornaby","author_inst":"Immunology\/Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics Laboratories, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill NC 27599, USA"},{"author_name":"Luther Bartelt","author_inst":"Departments of Medicine, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill NC 27599, USA"},{"author_name":"Susan Weiss","author_inst":"Departments of Medicine, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill NC 27599, USA"},{"author_name":"Yara Park","author_inst":"Departments of Medicine, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill NC 27599, USA"},{"author_name":"Caitlin E.

Objective: To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of a rapid diagnostic test for COVID-19 compared to quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Methods: We evaluated the sensitivity using a panel of finger prick blood samples from participants >18 years of age that had been tested for COVID-19 by qRT-PCR. For assessing specificity, we used serum samples from the 1982 Pelotas (Brazil) Birth Cohort participants collected in 2012 with no exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Results: The sensitivity of the test was 77.1% (95% CI 66.6 - 85.6), based upon 83 subjects who had tested positive for qRT-PCR at least 10 days before the rapid diagnostic test (RDT). Based upon 100 sera samples, specificity was 98.0% (95% CI 92.9 - 99.8). There was substantial agreement (Kappa score 0.76) between the qRT-PCR results and the RDT. Interpretation. The validation results are well in line with previous assessments of the test, and confirm that it is sufficiently precise for epidemiological studies aimed at monitoring levels and trends of the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lucia C Pellanda","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Ciencias da Saude de Porto Alegre"},{"author_name":"Eliana M Wendland","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Ciencias da Saude de Porto Alegre"},{"author_name":"Alan JA McBride","author_inst":"Biotechnology Department, Centre for Technological Development, Federal University of Pelotas, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Luciana Tovo-Rodrigues","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Marcos RA Ferreira","author_inst":"Biotechnology Department, Centre for Technological Development, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Odir A Dellagostin","author_inst":"Biotechnology Department, Centre for Technological Development, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Mariangela F Silveira","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Aluisio JD Barros","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Pedro C Hallal","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Cesar G Victora","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Caitlin E.

Design: 2 by 3 experimental design. Setting: Online with data collected between 28th April and 1st May 2020. Participants: 1,204 adults registered with a UK research panel. Intervention: Participants were randomised to receive one of six descriptions of an antibody test and results showing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, differing in the terms used to describe the type of test (Immunity vs Antibody) and the test result (Passport vs Certificate vs Test). Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was the proportion of participants perceiving no risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 given an antibody positive test result. Other outcomes include intended changes to frequency of hand washing and physical distancing. Results: When using the term Immunity (vs Antibody), 19.1% of participants [95% CI: 16.1 to 22.5] (vs 9.8% [95% CI: 7.5 to 12.4]) perceived no risk of catching coronavirus at some point in the future given an antibody-positive test result (AOR: 2.91 [95% CI: 1.52 to 5.55]). Using the terms Passport or Certificate, as opposed to Test, had no significant effect (AOR: 1.24 [95% CI: 0.62 to 2.48] and AOR: 0.96 [95% CI: 0.47 to 1.99] respectively). There was no significant interaction between the effects of the test and result terminology. Across groups, perceiving no risk of infection was associated with an intention to wash hands less frequently (AOR: 2.32 [95% CI: 1.25 to 4.28]) but there was no significant association with intended avoidance of physical contact with others outside of the home (AOR: 1.37 [95% CI: 0.93 to 2.03]). Conclusions: Using the term Immunity (vs Antibody) to describe antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 increases the proportion of people believing that an antibody-positive result means they have no risk of catching coronavirus in the future, a perception that may be associated with less frequent hand washing. The way antibody testing is described may have implications for the likely impact of testing on transmission rates.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jo Waller","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"G James Rubin","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"Henry W W Potts","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Abigail Mottershaw","author_inst":"Behavioural Insights Team, London"},{"author_name":"Theresa M Marteau","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Odir A Dellagostin","author_inst":"Biotechnology Department, Centre for Technological Development, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Mariangela F Silveira","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Aluisio JD Barros","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Pedro C Hallal","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Cesar G Victora","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Caitlin E.

The proposed system makes it possible to accurately identify the target population for serological IgG antibody tests in the work field, as well as those affected by special income replacement measures due to lockdown being maintained over a longer period.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luis Angel Hierro","author_inst":"University of Seville"},{"author_name":"David Cantarero","author_inst":"University of Cantabria-IDIVAL"},{"author_name":"David Patino","author_inst":"University of Seville"},{"author_name":"Daniel Rodriguez-Perez","author_inst":"University of Seville"},{"author_name":"Theresa M Marteau","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Odir A Dellagostin","author_inst":"Biotechnology Department, Centre for Technological Development, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Mariangela F Silveira","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Aluisio JD Barros","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Pedro C Hallal","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Cesar G Victora","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Caitlin E.

COVID19 driven pandemic causes panic, fear and stress among all strata of society. Like all other medical professions, dentists, particularly endodontists, who are highly exposed to aerosols would be exposed to stress. The aim of this study was to assess the (dis)stress among Indian endodontists and the factors that could influence the (dis)stress. Methods: From 8th April to 16th April 2020, we conducted an online survey in closed endodontic social media using snowball sampling technique, collecting basic demographic data, practice setting and relevant data. Psychological stress and perceived distress were collected through COVID-19 Peri-traumatic Distress Index (CPDI) and Perceived stress scale (PSS). Multinomial regression analysis was performed to estimate relative risk rate and P[&le;]0.05 was considered significant. Results: This study had 586 Indian endodontists completing this survey across India. Of these, 311(53.07%) were males, 325(55%) in the age group of 25-35 years, 64%in urban areas, 13.14% in solo-practice and a fourth of them were residents. Female endodontists had high perceived stress (RRR=2.46,P=0.01) as compared to males, as measured by PSS. Younger endodontists<25 years(RRR=9.75;P=0.002) and 25-35years (RRR=4.60;P=0.004) as compared with >45 years age-group had more distress. Exclusive consultants had RRR= 2.90, P=0.02, for mild-to-moderate distress as compared to normal. Factors driving this phenomenon are considered. Conclusions: During the lock down due to COVID-19, 1-in-2 Indian endodontists had distress, as measured by CPDI and 4-in-5 of them had perceived stress, as indicated by PSS. Our model identified certain factors driving the (dis)stress, which would help policy framers to initiate appropriate response.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anil Kumar Ramachandran Nair","author_inst":"Ragas Dental College & Hospital, (Affiliated to The Tamil Nadu Dr MGR Medical University), Chennai"},{"author_name":"Karumaran Savarimalai Chellaswamy","author_inst":"Ragas Dental College & Hospital (Affiliated to The Tamil Nadu Dr MGR Medical University), Chennai"},{"author_name":"Deepthi Kattula","author_inst":"Ragas Dental College and Hospital (Affiliated to The Tamil Nadu Dr MGR Medical University), Chennai"},{"author_name":"Rooban Thavarajah","author_inst":"Marundeeshwara Oral Pathology Services and Analytics, Chennai"},{"author_name":"Anusa Arunachalam Mohandoss","author_inst":"Shri Satya Sai Medical College and Research institute (Affiliated to Shri  Balaji Vidyapeeth)"},{"author_name":"Odir A Dellagostin","author_inst":"Biotechnology Department, Centre for Technological Development, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Mariangela F Silveira","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Aluisio JD Barros","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Pedro C Hallal","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Cesar G Victora","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Caitlin E.

Reduced form regression estimates that flexibly control for time trends suggest that a 10 percentage point reduction in mobility is associated with a 0.04-0.07 reduction in the value of the effective reproduction number, R(t) , depending on geographical region and modelling choice. According to these estimates, to avoid the critical value of R = 1, easing mobility restrictions may have to be limited or delayed until other non-mobility related preventative measures reduce R to a level of approximately 0.7 in Europe, 0.75 in Asia, and 0.8 in the United States.

Microarray binding experiments using an extensive heparan sulfate (HS) oligosaccharide library showed the spike of SARS-CoV-2 can bind HS in a length- and sequence-dependent manner. Hexa- and octasaccharides composed of IdoA2S-GlcNS6S repeating units were identified as optimal ligands. Surface plasma resonance (SPR) showed the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds with higher affinity to heparin (KD 55 nM) compared to the receptor binding domain (RBD, KD 1 {micro}M) alone. An octasaccharide composed of IdoA2S-GlcNS6S could inhibit spike-heparin interaction with an IC50 of 38 nM. Our data supports a model in which the RBD of the spike of SARS-CoV-2 confers sequence specificity for HS expressed by target cells whereas an additional HS binding site in the S1\/S2 proteolytic cleavage site enhances the avidity of binding. Collectively, our results highlight the potential of using HS oligosaccharides as a therapeutic agent by inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 binding to target cells.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lin Liu","author_inst":"University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Pradeep Chopra","author_inst":"University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Xiuru Li","author_inst":"University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Margreet A Wolfert","author_inst":"University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Stephen Mark Tompkins","author_inst":"University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Geert-Jan Boons","author_inst":"University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Maria Mattioli","author_inst":"University Hospital of Parma"},{"author_name":"Aluisio JD Barros","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Pedro C Hallal","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Cesar G Victora","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Caitlin E.

Here, we profiled the presence of SARS-CoV-2 receptors and receptor-associated enzymes at single-cell resolution of thirty-three human ocular cell types. We identified unique populations of corneal cells with high ACE2 expression, among which the conjunctival cells co-expressed both ACE2 and TMPRSS2, suggesting that they could serve as the entry points for the virus. Integrative analysis further models the signaling and transcription regulon networks involved in the infection of distinct corneal cells.

The disease is notably severe in elderly and those with underlying chronic conditions. A molecular mechanism that explains why the elderly are vulnerable and why children are resistant is largely unknown. Here we show loading cells with cholesterol from blood serum using the cholesterol transport protein apolipoprotein E (apoE) enhances the entry of pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 and the infectivity of the virion. Super resolution imaging of the SARS-CoV-2 entry point with high cholesterol shows almost twice the total number of endocytic entry points. Cholesterol concomitantly traffics angiotensinogen converting enzyme (ACE2) to the endocytic entry site where SARS-CoV-2 presumably docks to efficiently exploit entry into the cell. Furthermore, in cells producing virus, cholesterol optimally positions furin for priming SARS-CoV-2, producing a more infectious virion with improved binding to the ACE2 receptor. In vivo, age and high fat diet induces cholesterol loading by up to 40% and trafficking of ACE2 to endocytic entry sites in lung tissue from mice. We propose a component of COVID19 severity based on tissue cholesterol level and the sensitivity of ACE2 and furin to cholesterol. Molecules that reduce cholesterol or disrupt ACE2 localization with viral entry points or furin localization in the producer cells, may reduce the severity of COVID19 in obese patients.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hao Wang","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Zixuan Yuan","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Mahmud Arif Pavel","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Robert Hobson","author_inst":"Bruker"},{"author_name":"Scott Hansen","author_inst":"The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Hu Li","author_inst":"Center for Individualized Medicine, Department of Molecular Pharmacology & Experimental Therapeutics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA"},{"author_name":"Yuin Han Loh","author_inst":"Epigenetics and Cell Fates Laboratory, Programme in Stem Cell, Regenerative Medicine and Aging, A*STAR Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Singapore 138673"},{"author_name":"Aluisio JD Barros","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Pedro C Hallal","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Cesar G Victora","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Caitlin E.

South America is among the last regions hit by COVID-19 pandemic. In Uruguay, first cases were detected on March 13 th 2020 presumably imported by travelers returning from Europe.\n\nMethodsWe performed whole-genome sequencing of 10 SARS-CoV-2 from patients diagnosed during the first week (March 16th to 19th) of COVID-19 outbreak in Uruguay. Then, we applied genomic epidemiology using a global dataset to reconstruct the local spatio-temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nResultsOur phylogeographic analysis showed three independent introductions of SARS-CoV-2 from different continents. Also, we evidenced regional circulation of viral strains originally detected in Spain. Introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in Uruguay could date back as early as Feb 20th. Identification of specific mutations showed rapid local genetic differentiation.\n\nConclusionsWe evidenced early independent introductions of SARS-CoV-2 that likely occurred before first cases were detected. Our analysis set the bases for future genomic epidemiology studies to understand the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in Uruguay and the Latin America and the Caribbean region.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cecilia Salazar","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Florencia Diaz-Viraque","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Marianoel Pereira-Gomez","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Ignacio Ferres","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Pilar Moreno","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Gonzalo Moratorio","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Gregorio Iraola","author_inst":"Institut Pasteur Montevideo"},{"author_name":"Aluisio JD Barros","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Pedro C Hallal","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Cesar G Victora","author_inst":"Post-graduate Program in Epidemiology, Federal University of Pelotas"},{"author_name":"Caitlin E.

Interaction between spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 receptor on the cells is a potential factor in the infectivity of a host. The interaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain with its receptor - ACE2, in different hosts was evaluated to understand and predict viral entry. The protein and nucleotide sequences of ACE2 were initially compared across different species to identify key differences among them. The ACE2 receptor of various species was homology modeled (6LZG as a reference) and its binding ability to the spike receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 was assessed. Initially, the spike binding properties of ACE2 of known infected and uninfected species was compared with each Order (of animals) as a group. Finally, a logistic regression model vis-a-vis the spike binding properties of ACE2 (Interaction energy, entropy sidechain and entropy mainchain) was constructed to predict the probability of viral entry in different hosts.\n\nResultsPhylogeny and alignment comparison did not lead to any meaningful conclusion on viral entry in different hosts. Out of several spike binding properties of ACE2, a significant difference between the known infected and uninfected species was observed for five spike binding properties of ACE2. However, these parameters did not specifically categorize the animals into infected or uninfected, for all the Orders (of animals). The logistic regression model constructed revealed that in the mammalian class, most of the species of Carnivores, Artiodactyls, Perissodactyls, Pholidota, and Primates had high probability of viral entry. However, among the primates, baboons have very low probability of viral entry. Among rodents, hamsters were highly probable for viral entry with rats and mice having a very low probability. Rabbits have a medium probability of viral entry. In Birds, ducks have a very low probability, while chickens seemed to have medium probability and turkey showed the highest probability of viral entry.\n\nConclusionsMost of the species considered in this study showed high probability of viral entry. This study would prompt us to closely follow certain species of animals for determining pathogenic insult by SARS-CoV-2 and for determining their ability to act as a carrier and\/or disseminator.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Manas Ranjan Praharaj","author_inst":"National Institute of Animal Biotechnology, Hyderabad, Telangana, India"},{"author_name":"Priyanka Garg","author_inst":"National Institute of Animal Biotechnology, Hyderabad, Telangana, India"},{"author_name":"Raja Ishaq Nabi Khan","author_inst":"ICAR-Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar, UP, India"},{"author_name":"Shailesh Sharma","author_inst":"National Institute of Animal Biotechnology, Hyderabad, Telangana, India"},{"author_name":"Manjit Panigrahi","author_inst":"ICAR-Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar, UP, India"},{"author_name":"B P Mishra","author_inst":"ICAR-Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar, UP, India"},{"author_name":"Bina Mishra","author_inst":"ICAR-Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar, UP, India"},{"author_name":"G Sai Kumar","author_inst":"ICAR-Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar, UP, India"},{"author_name":"Ravi Kumar Gandham","author_inst":"National Institute of Animal Biotechnology, Hyderabad, Telangana, India"},{"author_name":"Raj Kumar Singh","author_inst":"ICAR-Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar, UP, India"},{"author_name":"Subeer Majumdar","author_inst":"National Institute of Animal Biotechnology, Hyderabad, Telangana, India"},{"author_name":"Trilochan Mohapatra","author_inst":"Indian Council of Agricultural Research, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Erin M.

We tested follow up serum\/plasma samples of individuals PCR-diagnosed with COVID-19. Most of the SARS-CoV-2 samples were from individuals with moderate to severe clinical course, who required an in-patient hospital stay.\n\nFor all examined assays, the sensitivity ranged from 58.8 to 76.5% for the early phase of infection (days 5-9) and from 93.8 to 100% for the later period (days 10-18) after PCR-diagnosed with COVID-19. With exception of one sample, all positive tested samples in the analysed cohort, using the commercially available assays examined (including the in-house developed IFA), demonstrated neutralizing (protective) properties in the PRNT, indicating a potential protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Regarding specificity, there was evidence that samples of endemic coronavirus (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E) and Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infected individuals cross-reacted in the ELISA assays and IFA, in one case generating a false positive result (may giving a false sense of security).

Methods: Single-center cohort performed from March 3, 2020, to April 14, 2020 in 4 intensive care units in Bordeaux University Hospital, France. All patients with COVID19 and pulmonary severity criteria were included. AKI was defined using KDIGO criteria. A systematic urinary analysis was performed. The incidence, severity, clinical presentation, biological characterisation (transient vs. persistent acute kidney injury; proteinuria, hematuria and glycosuria), and short-term outcomes was evaluated. Results: 71 patients were included, with basal serum creatinine of 69 +\/- 21 micromol\/L. At admission, AKI was present in 8\/71 (11%) patients. Median follow-up was 17 [12-23] days. AKI developed in a total of 57\/71 (80%) patients with 35% Stage 1, 35% Stage 2, and 30% Stage 3 acute kidney injury; 10\/57 (18%) required renal replacement therapy.

An overlooked angle is the potential psychosocial impact on PCPs as they place themselves at increased risk of infection. This study examines PCPs' concerns, impact on personal lives and work, and level of pandemic preparedness in the context of COVID-19 in Singapore. We also examine factors and coping strategies that PCPs have used to manage stress during the outbreak. METHODS 216 PCPs actively practicing in either a public or private clinic were convenience sampled from three primary care organizations in Singapore. Participants completed an online questionnaire consisting of items on work- and non-work-related concerns, impact on personal and work life, perceived pandemic preparedness, stress-reduction factors, and personal coping strategies related to COVID-19. RESULTS A total of 158 questionnaires were usable for analyses. PCPs perceived themselves to be at high risk of COVID-19 infection, and a source of risk and concern to loved ones. PCPs reported acceptance of these risks and the need to care for COVID-19 patients. Overall perceived pandemic preparedness was extremely high. PCPs prioritized availability of personal protective equipment, strict infection prevention guidelines, accessible information about COVID-19, and well-being of their colleagues and family as the most effective stress management factors. CONCLUSIONS Primary care will continue to be crucial in outbreak management efforts. Healthcare organizations should continue to support PCPs by managing their psychosocial and professional needs.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jerrald Lau","author_inst":"National University of Singapore, Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"David Hsien-Yung Tan","author_inst":"National University Polyclinics"},{"author_name":"Gretel Jianlin Wong","author_inst":"National University of Singapore, Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Yii-Jen Lew","author_inst":"National University Polyclinics"},{"author_name":"Ying-Xian Chua","author_inst":"National University Polyclinics"},{"author_name":"Lian-Leng Low","author_inst":"Singapore General Hospital, Family and Continuing Care"},{"author_name":"Han-Kwee Ho","author_inst":"National University Health System, Regional Health System Office"},{"author_name":"Thiam-Soo Kwek","author_inst":"National University Health System, Primary Care Network"},{"author_name":"Sue-Anne Ee-Shiow Toh","author_inst":"National University of Singapore, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ker-Kan Tan","author_inst":"National University of Singapore, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Antoine Dewitte","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Olivier Joannes-boyau","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Catherine Fleureau","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Hadrien Roze","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Cedric Carrie","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Laurent Petit","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Clouzeau","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Charline Sazio","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Hoang-Nam Bui","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Odile Pillet","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Claire Rigothier","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Frederic Vargas","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Christian Combe","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Didier Gruson","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Boyer","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"primary care research"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.06.20093005","rel_title":"Willingness to seek laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2 with home, drive-through, and clinic-based specimen collection locations","rel_date":"2020-05-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.06.20093005","rel_abs":"Background: SARS-CoV-2 virus testing for persons with COVID-19 symptoms, and contact tracing for those testing positive, will be critical to successful epidemic control. Willingness of persons experiencing symptoms to seek testing may determine the success of this strategy. Methods: A cross-sectional, online survey in the United States measured willingness to seek testing if feeling ill under different specimen collection scenarios: home-based saliva, home-based swab, drive-through facility swab, and clinic-based swab. Instructions clarified that home-collected specimens would be mailed to a laboratory for testing. We presented similar willingness questions regarding testing during follow-up care. Results: Of 1435 participants, comprising a broad range of sociodemographic groups, 92% were willing to test with a home saliva specimen, 88% with home swab, 71% with drive-through swab, and 60% with clinic collected swab. Moreover, 68% indicated they would be more likely to get tested if there was a home testing option. There were no significant differences in willingness items across sociodemographic variables or for those currently experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. Results were nearly identical for willingness to receive testing for follow-up COVID-19 care. Conclusions: We observed a hierarchy of willingness to test for SARS-CoV-2, ordered by the degree of contact required. Home specimen collection options could result in up to one-third more symptomatic persons seeking testing, facilitating contact tracing and optimal clinical care. Remote specimen collection options may ease supply chain challenges and decrease the likelihood of nosocomial transmission. As home specimen collection options receive regulatory approval, they should be scaled rapidly by health systems.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aaron J Siegler","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Eric Hall","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Nicole Luisi","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Maria Zlotorzynska","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Gretchen Wilde","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Travis Sanchez","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Heather Bradley","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Patrick S Sullivan","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Sue-Anne Ee-Shiow Toh","author_inst":"National University of Singapore, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ker-Kan Tan","author_inst":"National University of Singapore, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Antoine Dewitte","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Olivier Joannes-boyau","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Catherine Fleureau","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Hadrien Roze","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Cedric Carrie","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Laurent Petit","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Clouzeau","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Charline Sazio","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Hoang-Nam Bui","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Odile Pillet","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Claire Rigothier","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Frederic Vargas","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Christian Combe","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Didier Gruson","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Boyer","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.06.20093534","rel_title":"Rapidly Measuring Spatial Accessibility of COVID-19 Healthcare Resources: A Case Study of Illinois, USA","rel_date":"2020-05-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.06.20093534","rel_abs":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has infected millions of people and caused hundreds of thousands of deaths. While COVID-19 has overwhelmed healthcare resources (e.g., healthcare personnel, testing resources, hospital beds, and ventilators) in a number of countries, limited research has been conducted to understand spatial accessibility of such resources. This study fills this gap by rapidly measuring the spatial accessibility of COVID-19 healthcare resources with a particular focus on Illinois, USA. Specifically, the rapid measurement is achieved by resolving computational intensity of an enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method through a parallel computing strategy based on cyberGIS (cyber geographic information science and systems). The study compared the spatial accessibility measures for COVID-19 patients to those of general population, identifying which geographic areas need additional healthcare resources to improve access. The results also help delineate the areas that may face a COVID-19-induced shortage of healthcare resources caused by COVID-19. The Chicagoland, particularly the southern Chicago, shows an additional need for resources. Our findings are relevant for policymakers and public health practitioners to allocate existing healthcare resources or distribute new resources for maximum access to health services.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jeon-Young Kang","author_inst":"CyberGIS Center for Advanced Digital and Spatial Studies and Department of Geography and Geographic Information Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champa"},{"author_name":"Alexander C Michels","author_inst":"Illinois Informatics Institute, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"},{"author_name":"Fangzheng Lyu","author_inst":"CyberGIS Center for Advanced Digital and Spatial Studies and Department of Geography and Geographic Information Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champa"},{"author_name":"Shaohua Wang","author_inst":"CyberGIS Center for Advanced Digital and Spatial Studies and Department of Geography and Geographic Information Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champa"},{"author_name":"Nelson Agbodo","author_inst":"Division of Health Data and Policy, Illinois Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Vincent L Freeman","author_inst":"Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Illinois at Chicago"},{"author_name":"Shaowen Wang","author_inst":"CyberGIS Center for Advanced Digital and Spatial Studies; Department of Geography and Geographic Information Science; Illinois Informatics Institute, University"},{"author_name":"Patrick S Sullivan","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Sue-Anne Ee-Shiow Toh","author_inst":"National University of Singapore, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ker-Kan Tan","author_inst":"National University of Singapore, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Antoine Dewitte","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Olivier Joannes-boyau","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Catherine Fleureau","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Hadrien Roze","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Cedric Carrie","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Laurent Petit","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Clouzeau","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Charline Sazio","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Hoang-Nam Bui","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Odile Pillet","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Claire Rigothier","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Frederic Vargas","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Christian Combe","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Didier Gruson","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Boyer","author_inst":"CHU de Bordeaux"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.06.20088682","rel_title":"Associations between ambient air pollutants exposure and case fatality rate of COVID-19: a multi-city ecological study in China.","rel_date":"2020-05-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.06.20088682","rel_abs":"Background: Environmental factors, including air pollution, can strongly impact on spatio-temporal patterns of infectious diseases outbreak.

Patients who have recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) could profoundly impact the health care system if a subset were to be PCR-positive again with reactivated SARS-CoV-2. OBJECTIVE To characterize a single center COVID-19 cohort with and without recurrence of PCR positivity, and develop an algorithm to identify patients at high risk of retest positivity after discharge to inform health care policy and case management decision-making. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A cohort of 414 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, at The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China from January 11 to April 23, 2020. EXPOSURES Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and IgM-IgG antibody confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Univariable and multivariable statistical analysis of the clinical, laboratory, radiologic image, medical treatment, and clinical course of admission\/quarantine\/readmission data to develop an algorithm to predict patients at risk of recurrence of PCR positivity. RESULTS 16.7% (95CI: 13.0%-20.3%) patients retest PCR positive 1 to 3 times after discharge, despite being in strict quarantine. The driving factors in the recurrence prediction model included: age, BMI; lowest levels of the blood laboratory tests during hospitalization for cholinesterase, fibrinogen, albumin, prealbumin, calcium, eGFR, creatinine; highest levels of the blood laboratory tests during hospitalization for total bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase; the first test results during hospitalization for partial pressure of oxygen, white blood cell and lymphocyte counts, blood procalcitonin; and the first test episodic Ct value and the lowest Ct value of the nasopharyngeal swab RT PCR results. Area under the ROC curve is 0.786. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This case series provides clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with recurrent PCR positivity, despite strict quarantine, at a 16.7% rate. Use of a recurrence prediction algorithm may identify patients at high risk of PCR retest positivity of SARS-CoV-2 and help modify COVID-19 case management and health policy approaches.","rel_num_authors":42,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jia Huang","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Le

and people with underlying comorbidities are at increased risk of severe disease and death following hospitalisation with COVID-19. As comorbidity increases with age, it is necessary to understand the age-adjusted relationship between comorbidity and COVID-19 outcomes, in order to enhance planning capabilities and our understanding of COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a rapid, comprehensive review of the literature up to 10 April 2020, to assess the international empirical evidence on the association between comorbidities and severe or critical care outcomes of COVID-19, after accounting for age, among hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Results: After screening 579 studies, we identified seven studies eligible for inclusion and these were synthesised narratively. All were from China. The emerging evidence base mostly indicates that after adjustment for age (and in some cases other potential confounders), obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive airways disease (COPD), and cancer are all associated with worse outcomes. The largest study, using a large nationwide sample of COVID-19 patients in China, found that those with multiple comorbidities had more than twice the risk of a severe outcome or death compared with patients with no comorbidities, after adjusting for age and smoking (HR=2.59, 95% CI 1.61, 4.17). Conclusions: This review summarises for clinicians, policymakers, and academics the most robust evidence to date on this topic, to inform the management of patients and control measures for tackling the pandemic. Given the intersection of comorbidity with ethnicity and social disadvantage, these findings also have important implications for health inequalities. As the pandemic develops, further research should confirm these trends in other settings outside China and explore mechanisms by which various underlying health conditions increase risk of severe COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kate E Mason","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Philip McHale","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Andy Pennington","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Gillian Maudsley","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Day","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Ben Barr","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Xiaoming Yao","author_inst":"West China Hospital of Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Jiayu Liao","author_inst":"University of California at Riverside"},{"author_name":"Song Wang","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Manfei Zeng","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Liping Qiu","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Fanlan Cen","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yajing Huang","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Tengfei Zhu","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zehui Xu","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Manhua Ye","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yang Yang","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Guowei Wang","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jinxiu Li","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Lifei Wang","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jiuxin Qu","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jing Yuan","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Wei Zheng","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Chunyang Li","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"John C Whitin","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lu Tian","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Henry Chubb","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"KuoYuan Hwa","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Hayley A Gans","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Scott R Ceresnak","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Wei Zhang","author_inst":"West China Hospital of Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Ying Lu","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yvonne A Maldonado","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Harvey J Cohen","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Doff B McElhinney","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Karl G Sylvester","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Qing He","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhaoqin Wang","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yingxia Liu","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Xuefeng B Ling","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"}]}
