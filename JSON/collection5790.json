The structure of this genetic diversity, and whether it reveals epidemiological insights, are fundamental questions for understanding the evolutionary trajectory of this virus. Here we use a recently developed phylodynamic approach to uncover phylogenetic structures underlying the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We find support for three SARS-CoV-2 lineages co-circulating, each with significantly different demographic dynamics concordant with known epidemiological factors. For example, Lineage C emerged in Europe with a high growth rate in late February, just prior to the exponential increase in cases in several European countries. Mutations that characterize Lineage C in particular are non-synonymous and occur in functionally important gene regions responsible for viral replication and cell entry. Even though Lineages A and B had distinct demographic patterns, they were much more difficult to distinguish. Continuous application of phylogenetic approaches to track the evolutionary epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 lineages will be increasingly important to validate the efficacy of control efforts and monitor significant evolutionary events in the future.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicholas M Fountain-Jones","author_inst":"University of Tasmania"},{"author_name":"Raima Carol Appaw","author_inst":"University of Tasmania"},{"author_name":"Scott Carver","author_inst":"University of Tasmania"},{"author_name":"Xavier Didelot","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Erik M Volz","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Michael Charleston","author_inst":"University of Tasmania"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"genetics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.19.097410","rel_title":"The impact of super-spreaders in COVID-19: mapping genome variation worldwide","rel_date":"2020-05-19","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.19.097410","rel_abs":"The human pathogen severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the major pandemic of the 21st century.

Broad spectrum antiviral drugs have a particular advantage when dealing with rapid disease outbreaks, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. Since viruses are completely dependent on internal cell mechanisms, they must cross cell membranes during their lifecycle, creating a dependence on processes involving membrane dynamics. Thus, in this study we examined whether the synthesis of glycosphingolipids, biologically active components of cell membranes, can serve as an antiviral therapeutic target. We examined the antiviral effect of two specific inhibitors of GlucosylCeramide synthase (GCS); (i) Genz-123346, an analogue of the FDA-approved drug Cerdelga(R), (ii) GENZ-667161, an analogue of venglustat which is currently under phase III clinical trials. We found that both GCS inhibitors inhibit the replication of four different enveloped RNA viruses of different genus, organ-target and transmission route: (i) Neuroinvasive Sindbis virus (SVNI), (ii) West Nile virus (WNV), (iii) Influenza A virus, and (iv) SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, GCS inhibitors significantly increase the survival rate of SVNI-infected mice. Our data suggest that GCS inhibitors can potentially serve as a broad-spectrum antiviral therapy and should be further examined in preclinical and clinical trial. Analogues of the specific compounds tested have already been studied clinically, implying they can be fast-tracked for public use. With the current COVID-19 pandemic, this may be particularly relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryAn analogue of Cerdelga(R), an FDA-approved drug, is effective against a broad range of RNA-viruses including the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Einat B.

We purified more than one thousand memory B cells specific to SARS-CoV-2 S1 or RBD (receptor binding domain) antigens from 11 convalescent COVID-19 patients, and a total of 729 naturally paired heavy and light chain fragments were obtained by single B cell cloning technology. Among these, 178 recombinant monoclonal antibodies were tested positive for antigen binding, and the top 13 binders with Kd below 0.5 nM are all RBD binders. Importantly, all these 13 antibodies could block pseudoviral entry into HEK293T cells overexpressing ACE2, with the best ones showing IC50s around 2-3 nM. We further identified 8 neutralizing antibodies against authentic virus with IC50s within 10 nM. Among these, 414-1 blocked authentic viral entry at IC50 of 1.75 nM and in combination with 105-38 could achieve IC50 as low as 0.45 nM. Meanwhile, we also found that 3 antibodies could cross-react with the SARS-CoV spike protein.

Design: Observational study and dynamic modelling using a sigmoidal mixed effects model. Setting: All hospitals where patients were admitted for COVID-19. Participants: All admitted patients from March 18, 2020 to April 17, 2020. Main outcome measures: Abstention and admission rate for COVID-19. Results: Mean abstention rate in 2020 among departments was 52.5%+\/-6.4 and had increased by a mean of 18.8% as compared with the 2014 election. There was a high degree of similarity of abstention between the two elections among the departments (p<0.001). Among departments with a high outbreak intensity before the election, those with a higher participation were not affected by a significantly higher number of COVID-19 admissions after the elections. The sigmoidal model fitted the data from the different departments with a high degree of consistency. The covariate analysis showed that a significant association between participation and number of admitted patients was observed for both elections (2020: B=-5.36, p<1e-9 and 2014: B=-3.15, p<1e-6) contradicting a direct specific causation of the 2020 election. Participation was not associated with the position of the inflexion point suggesting no effect in the speed of spread. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the surrounding intensity of the COVID-19 epidemic in France did not have any local impact on citizens participation to a national election. The level of participation to the 2020 election had no impact on the spread of the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jean-David Zeitoun","author_inst":"Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Matthieu Faron","author_inst":"Departments of Surgical Oncology and Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus Grand Paris, Villejuif, France"},{"author_name":"sylvain Manternach","author_inst":"Paris"},{"author_name":"Jerome Fourquet","author_inst":"IFOP, Paris, France"},{"author_name":"Marc Lavielle","author_inst":"Inria"},{"author_name":"jeremie lefevre","author_inst":"sorbonne universite"},{"author_name":"Siqing Wang","author_inst":"Shanghai Key Laboratory of Medical Epigenetics, Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, and Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Cancer Invasion, L"},{"author_name":"Kun Chen","author_inst":"Shanghai Key Laboratory of Medical Epigenetics, Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, and Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Cancer Invasion, L"},{"author_name":"Chenxi He","author_inst":"Shanghai Key Laboratory of Medical Epigenetics, Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, and Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Cancer Invasion, L"},{"author_name":"Songhua Yuan","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai 201508, China"},{"author_name":"Chengli Qiu","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai 201508, China"},{"author_name":"Chen Zhao","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai 201508, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoyan Zhang","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, 201508, China"},{"author_name":"Xiangxi Wang","author_inst":"National Laboratory of Macromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China"},{"author_name":"Yanan Lu","author_inst":"Active Motif China Inc., Shanghai, 201315, China"},{"author_name":"Jianqing Xu","author_inst":"Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, 201508, China"},{"author_name":"Fei Lan","author_inst":"Shanghai Key Laboratory of Medical Epigenetics, Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, and Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Cancer Invasion, L"},{"author_name":"Prabuddha K Kundu","author_inst":"Premas Biotech Private Limited"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.16.20098657","rel_title":"Empirical Assessment of COVID-19 Crisis Standards of Care Guidelines","rel_date":"2020-05-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.16.20098657","rel_abs":"Background: Several states have released Crisis Standards of Care (CSC) guidelines for the allocation of scarce critical care resources. Most guidelines rely on Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores to maximize lives saved, but states have adopted different stances on whether to maximize long-term outcomes (life-years saved) by accounting for patient comorbidities. Methods: We compared 4 representative state guidelines with varying approaches to comorbidities and analyzed how CSC prioritization correlates with clinical outcomes. We included 27 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to ICUs at Brigham and Women's Hospital from March 12 to April 3, 2020. We compared prioritization algorithms from New York, which assigns priority based on SOFA alone; Maryland, which uses SOFA plus severe comorbidities; Pennsylvania, which uses SOFA plus major and severe comorbidities; and Colorado, which uses SOFA plus a modified Charlson comorbidity index. Results: In pairwise comparisons across all possible pairs, we found that state guidelines frequently resulted in tie-breakers based on age or lottery: New York 100% of the time (100% resolved by lottery), Pennsylvania 86% of the time (18% by lottery), Maryland 93% of the time (35% by lottery), and Colorado: 32% of the time (10% by lottery). The prioritization algorithm with the strongest correlation with 14-day outcomes was Colorado (rs = -0.483. p = 0.011) followed by Maryland (rs = -0.394, p =0.042), Pennsylvania (rs = -0.382, p = 0.049), and New York (rs = 0). An alternative model using raw SOFA scores alone was moderately correlated with outcomes (rs = -0.448, p = 0.019). Conclusions: State guidelines for scarce resource allocation frequently resulted in identical priority scores, requiring tie-breakers based on age or lottery. These findings suggest that state CSC guidelines should be further assessed empirically to understand whether they meet their goals.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julia L.

Interferon beta1 has shown in vitro studies a potent inhibition of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. In an in vitro study, SARS-CoV-2 had more sensitivity to IFN-I pretreatment that SARS-CoV. A combination of IFN beta1b administered subcutaneously with other antiviral treatments has been recommended in several guidelines. However, clinical trial results for the treatment of COVID-19 are pending. We aimed to assess the efficiency of IFN beta1b in COVID19 comparing the in-hospital mortality between patients who received IFN beta1b and patients did not receive. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, we included hospitalized adults with COVID-19 between February 23th and April 4th, 2020, at the Central Defense Hospital (Madrid, Spain). Subcutaneous interferon beta-1b was recommended in moderate-severe pneumonia. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to identify variables associated with in-hospital mortality. Findings We analyzed 256 patients (106 patients in interferon group and 150 patients in control group). At admission, patients who did not receive interferon beta1b presented a greater number of comorbidities. The overall mortality rate was 24.6% (63\/256). Twenty-two patients (20.8%) in the interferon group died and 41 (27.3%) in the control group (p=0.229). In the multivariate analysis, the predictors of in-hospital mortality were age, severity of clinical picture at admission and hydroxychloroquine treatment. Interpretation In hospitalized patients with COVID-19, interferon beta1b treatment was not associated to decrease in-hospital mortality. Further assessment of the earlier administration of this drug in randomized trials is recommended.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Miriam Estebanez","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"German Ramirez-Olivencia","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tatiana Mata","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"David Marti","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Carlos Gutierrez","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Begona De  Dios","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maria Dolores Herrero","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ana Roel","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yolanda Martinez","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alejandro Aguirre","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Francisco Alcantara Nicolas","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Pablo Fernandez Gonzalez","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Elena Lopez","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lucia E Ballester","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maria Mateo-Maestre","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sergio Campos","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maria J Sanchez-Carrillo","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Antonio Fe","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Francisco J Membrillo de Novales","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michelle Tan","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Stephanie A Christenson","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Amy Kistler","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Charles Langelier","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.17.20105049","rel_title":"Risk interactions of coronavirus infection across age groups after the peak of COVID-19 epidemic","rel_date":"2020-05-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.17.20105049","rel_abs":"Background: the COVID-19 pandemic has incurred significant disease burden worldwide, particularly on elderly population.

Meanwhile, an increase in virus infection among elderly people was also significantly associated with risks of infection among other age groups. The risks of infection among younger people were relatively unaffected by that of other age groups. Conclusions: Protecting elderly people from coronavirus infection could not only reduce the risk of infection among themselves but also ameliorate the risks of virus infection among other age groups. Such interventions should be effective and for long term.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xinhua Yu","author_inst":"University of Memphis"},{"author_name":"German Ramirez-Olivencia","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tatiana Mata","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"David Marti","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Carlos Gutierrez","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Begona De  Dios","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maria Dolores Herrero","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ana Roel","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yolanda Martinez","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alejandro Aguirre","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Francisco Alcantara Nicolas","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Pablo Fernandez Gonzalez","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Elena Lopez","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lucia E Ballester","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maria Mateo-Maestre","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sergio Campos","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maria J Sanchez-Carrillo","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Antonio Fe","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Francisco J Membrillo de Novales","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michelle Tan","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Stephanie A Christenson","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Amy Kistler","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Charles Langelier","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.18.101485","rel_title":"Does the human placenta express the canonical cell entry mediators for SARS-CoV-2?","rel_date":"2020-05-18","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.18.101485","rel_abs":"The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected over 3.8 million people, including pregnant women. To date, no consistent evidence of vertical transmission for SARS-CoV-2 exists. This new coronavirus canonically utilizes the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for cell entry. Herein, building upon our previous single cell study of the placenta (Pique-Regi, 2019), another study, and new single-cell\/nuclei RNA-sequencing data, we investigated the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 throughout pregnancy as well as in third-trimester chorioamniotic membranes. We report that co-transcription of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 is negligible, thus not a likely path of vertical transmission for SARS-CoV-2 at any stage of pregnancy. In contrast, receptors for Zika virus and cytomegalovirus which cause congenital infections are highly expressed by placental cell types. These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to infect the human placenta through the canonical cell entry mediators; yet, other interacting proteins could still play a role in the viral infection.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Roger Pique-Regi","author_inst":"Wayne State University"},{"author_name":"Roberto Romero","author_inst":"Wayne State University"},{"author_name":"Adi L Tarca","author_inst":"Wayne State University"},{"author_name":"Francesca Luca","author_inst":"Wayne State University"},{"author_name":"Yi Xu","author_inst":"Wayne State University"},{"author_name":"Yaozhu Leng","author_inst":"Wayne State University"},{"author_name":"Chaur-Dong Hsu","author_inst":"Wayne State University"},{"author_name":"Nardhy Gomez-Lopez","author_inst":"Wayne State University"},{"author_name":"Yolanda Martinez","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alejandro Aguirre","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Francisco Alcantara Nicolas","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Pablo Fernandez Gonzalez","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Elena Lopez","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lucia E Ballester","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maria Mateo-Maestre","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sergio Campos","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maria J Sanchez-Carrillo","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Antonio Fe","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Francisco J Membrillo de Novales","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michelle Tan","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Stephanie A Christenson","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Amy Kistler","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Charles Langelier","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.18.100545","rel_title":"Longitudinal high-throughput TCR repertoire profiling reveals the dynamics of T cell memory formation after mild COVID-19 infection","rel_date":"2020-05-18","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.18.100545","rel_abs":"COVID-19 is a global pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.

In this study we use longitudinal high-throughput T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing to track changes in the T cell repertoire following two mild cases of COVID-19. In both donors we identified CD4+ and CD8+ T cell clones with transient clonal expansion after infection. The antigen specificity of CD8+ TCR sequences to SARS-CoV-2 epitopes was confirmed by both MHC tetramer binding and presence in large database of SARS-CoV-2 epitope-specific TCRs. We describe characteristic motifs in TCR sequences of COVID-19-reactive clones and show preferential occurence of these motifs in publicly available large dataset of repertoires from COVID-19 patients. We show that in both donors the majority of infection-reactive clonotypes acquire memory phenotypes. Certain T cell clones were detected in the memory fraction at the pre-infection timepoint, suggesting participation of pre-existing cross-reactive memory T cells in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anastasia A Minervina","author_inst":"Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry"},{"author_name":"Ekaterina A Komech","author_inst":"Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry"},{"author_name":"Aleksei Titov","author_inst":"National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow"},{"author_name":"Meriem Bensouda Koraichi","author_inst":"Ecole normale superieure"},{"author_name":"Elisa Rosati","author_inst":"Kiel University"},{"author_name":"Ilgar Z Mamedov","author_inst":"Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry"},{"author_name":"Andre Franke","author_inst":"Kiel University"},{"author_name":"Grigory A Efimov","author_inst":"National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow"},{"author_name":"Dmitriy M Chudakov","author_inst":"Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry"},{"author_name":"Thierry Mora","author_inst":"Ecole normale superieure"},{"author_name":"Aleksandra M Walczak","author_inst":"Ecole normale superieure"},{"author_name":"Yuri B Lebedev","author_inst":"Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry"},{"author_name":"Mikhail V Pogorelyy","author_inst":"Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry"},{"author_name":"Lucia E Ballester","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maria Mateo-Maestre","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sergio Campos","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maria J Sanchez-Carrillo","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Antonio Fe","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Francisco J Membrillo de Novales","author_inst":"Gomez Ulla Hospital"},{"author_name":"Michelle Tan","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Stephanie A Christenson","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Amy Kistler","author_inst":"Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"},{"author_name":"Charles Langelier","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco; Chan Zuckerberg Biohub"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.18.102087","rel_title":"Controlling the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein Conformation","rel_date":"2020-05-18","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.18.102087","rel_abs":"The coronavirus (CoV) viral host cell fusion spike (S) protein is the primary immunogenic target for virus neutralization and the current focus of many vaccine design efforts.

We found that despite overall similarity in domain organization, different {beta}-CoV strains display distinct S-protein configurations. Based on this analysis, we developed two soluble ectodomain constructs in which the highly immunogenic and mobile receptor binding domain (RBD) is locked in either the all-RBDs  down position or is induced to display a previously unobserved in SARS-CoV-2 2-RBDs  up configuration. These results demonstrate that the conformation of the S-protein can be controlled via rational design and provide a framework for the development of engineered coronavirus spike proteins for vaccine applications.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rory Henderson","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Robert J Edwards","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Katayoun Mansouri","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Katarzyna Janowska","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Victoria Stalls","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Sophie Gobeil","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Megan Kopp","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Allen L Hsu","author_inst":"NIH\/NIEHS"},{"author_name":"Mario J.

Using an infectious molecular clone of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) that expresses eGFP as a marker of infection, we replaced the glycoprotein gene (G) with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2) and developed a high-throughput imaging-based neutralization assay at biosafety level 2. We also developed a focus reduction neutralization test with a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 at biosafety level 3. We compared the neutralizing activities of monoclonal and polyclonal antibody preparations, as well as ACE2-Fc soluble decoy protein in both assays and find an exceptionally high degree of concordance. The two assays will help define correlates of protection for antibody-based countermeasures including therapeutic antibodies, immune {gamma}-globulin or plasma preparations, and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.

Reinfections occurred frequently at 12 months post-infection and there was for each virus a substantial reduction in antibody levels as soon as 6 months post-infection.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arthur WD Edridge","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC, Laboratory of Experimental Virology"},{"author_name":"Joanna M Kaczorowska","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC, Laboratory of Experimental Virology"},{"author_name":"Alexis CR Hoste","author_inst":"INGENASA, Inmunologia y Genetica Aplicada"},{"author_name":"Margreet Bakker","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC, Laboratory of Experimental Virology"},{"author_name":"Michelle Klein","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC, Laboratory of Experimental Virology"},{"author_name":"Maarten F Jebbink","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC, Laboratory of Experimental Virology"},{"author_name":"Amy Matser","author_inst":"Public Health Service of Amsterdam, Department of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Cormac Kinsella","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC, Laboratory of Experimental Virology"},{"author_name":"Paloma Rueda","author_inst":"INGENASA, Inmunologia y Genetica Aplicada"},{"author_name":"Maria Prins","author_inst":"Public Health Service of Amsterdam, Department of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Patricia Sastre","author_inst":"INGENASA, Inmunologia y Genetica Aplicada"},{"author_name":"Martin Deijs","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC, Laboratory of Experimental Virology"},{"author_name":"Lia van der Hoek","author_inst":"Amsterdam UMC, Laboratory of Experimental Virology"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey P Henderson","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA."},{"author_name":"Shane Miersch","author_inst":"The Donnelly Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada."},{"author_name":"Mart Ustav","author_inst":"The Donnelly Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada."},{"author_name":"Sachdev Sidhu","author_inst":"The Donnelly Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada."},{"author_name":"Herbert W Virgin","author_inst":"Vir Biotechnology, San Francisco, CA, USA."},{"author_name":"David Wang","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Siyuan Ding","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Davide Corti","author_inst":"Humabs Biomed SA, subsidiary of Vir Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Elitza S Theel","author_inst":"Division of Clinical Microbiology, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA."},{"author_name":"Daved H Fremont","author_inst":"Departments of Molecular Microbiology, Pathology & Immunology, Biochemistry & Molecular Biophysics, and The Andrew M. and Jane M.

From the beginning of April 2020, the nationwide lockdown started to show early effects by reducing the total cumulative incidence reached by the epidemic wave. This allows the government to program the measures to loosen lockdown restrictions for the so called \"Phase 2\". Here we provided the reproduction number estimation both in space and in time from February 24th to April 24th, 2020 across two months into the epidemic. Our estimates suggest basic reproduction number averaged over all the regions of 3.29, confirming that epidemiological figures of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Italy are higher than those observed at the early stage of Wuhan (China) outbreak. Based on the SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics reported here, we gave a quantitative evaluation of the efficiency of the government measures to low the reproduction number under the unity (control regime). We estimated that among the worst hit regions in Italy, Lombardy reached the control regime on March 22nd followed by Emilia-Romagna (March 23th), Veneto (March 25th) and Piemonte (March 26th). Overall, we found that the mean value of time to reach the control regime in all the country is about 31 days from the February 24th and about 14 days from the first day of nationwide lockdown (March 12th). Finally, we highlighted the interplay between the reproduction number and two demographic indices in order to probe the \"state of activity\" of the epidemic for each Italian region in the control regime. We believe that this approach can provide a tool in the management of \"Phase 2\", potentially helping in challenging decision to continue, ease or tighten up restrictions.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mattia Allieta","author_inst":"independent researcher"},{"author_name":"Andrea Allieta","author_inst":"Universita del Piemonte Orientale A.

The admission of large numbers of patients with suspected COVID-19 disease risks overwhelming the capacity to protect other patients from exposure. The delay between clinical suspicion and confirmatory testing adds to the complexity of the problem. Methods We implemented a triage tool aimed at minimising hospital acquired COVID-19 particularly to patients at risk of severe disease. Patients were allocated to triage categories defined by likelihood of COVID-19 and risk of a poor outcome. Category A (low-likelihood; high-risk), B (high-likelihood; high-risk), C (high-likelihood; low-risk) and D (low-likelihood; low-risk). This determined the order of priority for isolation in single-occupancy rooms with Category A the highest. Patients in other groups were cohorted when isolation capacity was limited with additional interventions to reduce transmission. Results 93 patients were evaluated with 79 (85%) receiving a COVID-19 diagnosis during their admission. Of those without a COVID-19 diagnosis: 10 were initially triaged to Category A; 0 to B; 1 to C and 4 to D. All high risk patients requiring isolation were, therefore, admitted to single-occupancy rooms and protected from exposure. 28 (30%) suspected COVID-19 patients were evaluated to be low risk (groups C & D) and eligible for cohorting. No symptomatic hospital acquired infections were detected in the cohorted patients. Discussion Application of a clinical triage tool to guide isolation and cohorting decisions may reduce the risk of hospital acquired transmission of COVID-19 especially to individuals at the greatest of risk of severe disease.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Benjamin Patterson","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, University College London"},{"author_name":"Michael Marks","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Gemma Martinez-Garcia","author_inst":"Division of Infection, University College London"},{"author_name":"Gabriella Bidwell","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases, University College London"},{"author_name":"Akish Luintel","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases, University College London"},{"author_name":"Dalia Ludwig","author_inst":"Department of Acute Medicine, University College London"},{"author_name":"Tom Parks","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases, University College London"},{"author_name":"Philip Gothard","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases, University College London"},{"author_name":"Rik Thomas","author_inst":"Intensive Care, University College London"},{"author_name":"Sarah Logan","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases, University College London"},{"author_name":"Karen Shaw","author_inst":"Division of Infection, University College London"},{"author_name":"Neil Stone","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases, University College London"},{"author_name":"Mike Brown","author_inst":"Hospital for Tropical Diseases, University College London"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey P Henderson","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA."},{"author_name":"Shane Miersch","author_inst":"The Donnelly Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada."},{"author_name":"Mart Ustav","author_inst":"The Donnelly Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada."},{"author_name":"Sachdev Sidhu","author_inst":"The Donnelly Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada."},{"author_name":"Herbert W Virgin","author_inst":"Vir Biotechnology, San Francisco, CA, USA."},{"author_name":"David Wang","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Siyuan Ding","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Davide Corti","author_inst":"Humabs Biomed SA, subsidiary of Vir Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Elitza S Theel","author_inst":"Division of Clinical Microbiology, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA."},{"author_name":"Daved H Fremont","author_inst":"Departments of Molecular Microbiology, Pathology & Immunology, Biochemistry & Molecular Biophysics, and The Andrew M. and Jane M.

Using a semi-Bayesian probabilistic bias analysis to account for incomplete testing and imperfect diagnostic accuracy, we estimated 6,275,072 cumulative infections compared to 721,245 confirmed cases (1.9% vs. 0.2% of the population) as of April 18, 2020. Accounting for uncertainty, the number of infections was 3 to 20 times higher than the number of confirmed cases. 86% (simulation interval: 64-99%) of this difference was due to incomplete testing, while 14% (0.3-36%) was due to imperfect test accuracy.

While these measures have been proven effective in abating the epidemic in several countries, it is important to estimate the effectiveness of testing and tracing strategies to avoid a potential second wave of the COVID-19 epidemic. We integrate highly detailed (anonymized, privacy-enhanced) mobility data from mobile devices, with census and demographic data to build a detailed agent-based model to describe the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the Boston metropolitan area. We find that enforcing strict social distancing followed by a policy based on a robust level of testing, contact-tracing and household quarantine, could keep the disease at a level that does not exceed the capacity of the health care system. Assuming the identification of 50% of the symptomatic infections, and the tracing of 40% of their contacts and households, which corresponds to about 9% of individuals quarantined, the ensuing reduction in transmission allows the reopening of economic activities while attaining a manageable impact on the health care system. Our results show that a response system based on enhanced testing and contact tracing can play a major role in relaxing social distancing interventions in the absence of herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alberto Aleta","author_inst":"ISI Foundation"},{"author_name":"David Martin-Corral","author_inst":"Universidad Carlos III de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Ana Pastore y Piontti","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"FBK"},{"author_name":"Maria Litvinova","author_inst":"ISI Foundation"},{"author_name":"Matteo Chinazzi","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Natalie E Dean","author_inst":"University of Florida"},{"author_name":"M.

This is due to the demand for medical resources in other areas as well as concern for the risk of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 exposure. The interruption of routine care is especially problematic for patients with chronic conditions requiring regular follow-up, such as lung transplant recipients. New methods like telemedicine are needed to provide care to these patients. Methods: A retrospective analysis of video consultations (VC) in comparison to on-site visits (OSV) was performed during a six-week period in a lung transplant center in Germany. VC included a structured work-up questionnaire and vital sign documentation. Results: During the 6-week study period, 75 VC were performed for 53 patients and 75 OSV by 51 patients occurred. By the end of our study period, 77% of physician-patient contacts occurred via VC. Overall, physician-patient consultations were reduced by 47% in comparison to an equivalent time frame in 2019. In 62% of cases, VC resulted in a concrete clinical decision. For two VC patients, the indication for inpatient admission was established during the consultation. One COVID-19 patient in home quarantine was admitted due to respiratory failure detected by VC. Patient satisfaction with VC was high. Conclusions: By transitioning to VC, OSV for lung transplant patients during the COVID-19 pandemic was reduced. VC was well received by the majority of patients. This technology can be adopted to provide care for a wide range of chronic illnesses.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Moritz Z.

Objective: To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19, hospitalized in a tertiary care teaching hospital in southwestern United states serving Underserved population. Methods: Case series of first 50 adults admitted at the University of New Mexico (UNM) Health Science center, the only tertiary care teaching hospital in the state of New Mexico between Jan 19th to April 24th 2020 via retrospective and prospective chart review. Main outcomes and measures: Clinical outcomes during hospitalization, such as invasive mechanical ventilation, kidney replacement therapy and death. Demographics, baseline comorbidities, presenting vital signs, and test results were also collected. Results: A total of 50 patients were included (median age, 55.5; 20-85-year-old, 54% were female). Obesity was the most common comorbidity in 20\/39 (51%), followed by diabetes in 18\/50 (36%) and hypertension 17\/50(34%). Mean onset of symptoms duration before admission 7.39 days (range 1-21days). Most common symptoms on presentation included subjective fevers 40\/42 (95.2%), cough 43\/46 (93%) 43\/46 and shortness of breath 40\/46(87%). At triage only 24% were febrile and 46% patient did not have a single febrile episode throughout hospitalization, 56% had respiratory rate > 20 and 66% had a heart rate > 90. 80% patients required oxygen and 20%required intubation on presentation. On differential analysis 46% had elevated neutrophil counts, and 48% had low lymphocytes counts. Median D dimer, Ferritin, CRP, LDH were all elevated at presentation. 10% of patients had a negative initial chest x ray. 19.3% patients have coinfection with another respiratory viral pathogen. 34 (68%) patient required ICU level of care at some point during hospitalization. More than 70% of patients were treated with antibiotics mainly directed towards community acquired pneumonia but 97.5% patient has negative blood culture and 93.3% has negative sputum cultures. Of admitted patients, 34% (17\/50) were directly admitted to ICU and. Of these ICU patients 82.4% (28\/34) required invasive mechanical ventilation. Patients spent a median of 2 days on the floor prior to ICU transfer, median length of stay in the ICU was 7 days. On comparing characteristics of patients, patients with diabetes, and higher lactate dehydrogenase on admission were more likely to require ICU level of care. No patient deaths were reported on the floor. Of 34 patients in the ICU 13 died while 6 are still receiving care in the hospital, with an overall mortality of 30.2% (13\/43). Out of 13 patients who died, 2 were on HD, 11\/13(84%) patients had acute kidney injury and required CRRT or HD. The median length of stay is 7 days (Range 1-31days), for floor patients 4 days and ICU patients 13 days. Out of 43 patients who completed their clinical course 24\/43(58.1%) were discharged home, 5\/43(11.6%) went to rehabilitation facilities and 30.2% died. 16\/30(53.3%) required oxygen on discharge. Conclusion: This case series provides characteristics and early experience in treating patient admitted to tertiary care teaching hospital in state of NEW Mexico.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rahul Shekhar","author_inst":"UNM"},{"author_name":"Shubhra Upadhyay","author_inst":"UNM"},{"author_name":"Abubaker Sheikh","author_inst":"UNM"},{"author_name":"Jeanette Atencio","author_inst":"UNM"},{"author_name":"Devika Kapuria","author_inst":"UNM"},{"author_name":"Jens Gottlieb","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany; Biomedical Research in Endstage and Obstructive Lung Disease Hannover (BREATH), "},{"author_name":"Bin Cao","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xiaoliang Wu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Yan Lu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jin Zhao","author_inst":"zhaoj@szcdc.net"},{"author_name":"Xuan Zou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Tiejian Feng","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Benjamin J Cowling","author_inst":"The University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Shujiang Mei","author_inst":"Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Shane Miersch","author_inst":"The Donnelly Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada."},{"author_name":"Mart Ustav","author_inst":"The Donnelly Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada."},{"author_name":"Sachdev Sidhu","author_inst":"The Donnelly Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada."},{"author_name":"Herbert W Virgin","author_inst":"Vir Biotechnology, San Francisco, CA, USA."},{"author_name":"David Wang","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Siyuan Ding","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Davide Corti","author_inst":"Humabs Biomed SA, subsidiary of Vir Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Elitza S Theel","author_inst":"Division of Clinical Microbiology, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA."},{"author_name":"Daved H Fremont","author_inst":"Departments of Molecular Microbiology, Pathology & Immunology, Biochemistry & Molecular Biophysics, and The Andrew M. and Jane M.

Methods 904 axial lung window CT slices from 338 patients in 17 countries were collected and labeled. The data included 606 images from COVID-19 positive patients (confirmed via RT-PCR), 224 images of a variety of other pulmonary diseases including viral pneumonias, and 74 images of normal patients. We developed, trained, validated, and tested an object detection model which detects features in three categories: ground-glass opacities (GGOs) for COVID-19, GGOs for non-COVID-19 diseases, and features that are inconsistent with a COVID-19 diagnosis. These collected features are passed into an interpretable decision tree model to make a suggested diagnosis. Results On an independent test of 219 images from COVID-19 positive, a variety of pneumonia, and healthy patients, the model predicted COVID-19 diagnoses with an accuracy of 96.80 % (95% confidence interval [CI], 96.75 to 96.86) , AUC-ROC of 0.9664 (95% CI, 0.9659 to 0.9671) , sensitivity of 98.33% (95% CI, 98.29 to 98.40) , precision of 95.93% (95% CI, 95.83 to 95.99), and specificity of 94.95% (95% CI, 94.84 to 95.05). On an independent test of 34 images from asymptomatic COVID-19 positive patients, our model achieved an accuracy of 97.06% (95% CI, 96.81 to 97.06) and a sensitivity of 96.97% (95% CI, 96.71 to 96.97). Similarly high performance was also obtained for out-of-sample countries, and no significant performance difference was obtained between genders. Conclusion We present an interpretable artificial intelligence CT analysis tool to diagnose COVID-19 in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Further, our model is able to differentiate COVID-19 GGOs from similar pathologies suggesting that GGOs can be disease-specific.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anmol Warman","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Pranav Warman","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Ayushman Sharma","author_inst":"Morsani College of Medicine, James A.

The Department of Health Services, Government of Kerala, initially released daily updates through daily textual bulletins for public awareness to control the spread of the disease. However, this unstructured data limits upstream applications, such as visualization, and analysis, thus demanding refinement to generate open and reusable datasets. Materials and Methods: Through a citizen science initiative, we leveraged publicly available and crowd-verified data on COVID-19 outbreak in Kerala from the government bulletins and media outlets to generate reusable datasets. This was further visualized as a dashboard through a frontend web application and a JSON repository, which serves as an API for the frontend. Results: From the sourced data, we provided real-time analysis, and daily updates of COVID-19 cases in Kerala, through a user-friendly bilingual dashboard (https:\/\/covid19kerala.info\/) for non-specialists. To ensure longevity and reusability, the dataset was deposited in an open-access public repository for future analysis. Finally, we provide outbreak trends and demographic characteristics of the individuals affected with COVID-19 in Kerala during the first 138 days of the outbreak. Discussion: We anticipate that our dataset can form the basis for future studies, supplemented with clinical and epidemiological data from the individuals affected with COVID-19 in Kerala.

Design A prospective observational study using data on the daily number of infected patients and deaths from the New York Times daily database. Setting 50 States and the District of Columbia Participants All individuals judged to be positive for the coronavirus or to have died from COVID19. Main outcome measures Number of people diagnosed with or died from COVID19. Results We found that the decision to issue the state-at-home order reflects the Weber-Fechner law of psychophysics. Both the number of infections (p=<0.0001; R2=0.79) and deaths (p<0.0001; R2=0.63) were highly statistically significantly associated with the decision to issue the stay-at-home orders. The results indicate that for each doubling of infections or deaths within their state, an additional four to six governors will issue the stay-at-home order. We also observed a clear dose-response relationship in the Cox model: the larger the number of cases, or deaths, the higher the probability that the stay-at-home order will be made. When the number of deaths reached 256 or the number of infected people was greater than 16,384, the probability of issuing a stay-at-home order was close to 100%. Conclusions When there are not clearly articulated rules to follow, decision-makers in times of crisis such as COVID19 resort to use of simple heuristics consistent with the Weber-Fechner law of psychophysics. The findings are important for the public to understand how their elected officials make important public health decisions.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Benjamin Djulbegovic","author_inst":"City of Hope"},{"author_name":"David J Weiss","author_inst":"California State University, Los Angeles, CA"},{"author_name":"Iztok Hozo","author_inst":"Indiana University, IN"},{"author_name":"Prem Prabhakaran","author_inst":"Department of Advanced Materials and Chemical Engineering, Hannam University, Daejeon, South Korea."},{"author_name":"Sreekanth Chaliyeduth","author_inst":"Centre for Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India"},{"author_name":"Sooraj P Suresh","author_inst":"Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, National Institute of Technology Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India"},{"author_name":"Musfir Mohammed","author_inst":"Embedded Analytics, Machine Learning and Data Sciences, Experion Technologies, TechnoPark, Thiruvananthapuram, India."},{"author_name":"Rajeevan E","author_inst":"Department of Philosophy, Government Brennen College, Kannur University, Kerala, India"},{"author_name":"Sindhu Joseph","author_inst":"Department of Travel and Tourism Management, Govinda Pai Memorial  Government College, Kannur University, Kerala, India"},{"author_name":"Akhil Balakrishnan","author_inst":"Crowcon - A Halma Company, ITPB, Whitefield, Bangalore"},{"author_name":"Jeevan Uthaman","author_inst":"Department of Marine Geophysics, Cochin University of Science and Technology, Kochi, Kerala, India"},{"author_name":"Manoj Karingamadathil","author_inst":"Swathanthra Malayalam Computing, Thrissur, Kerala, India"},{"author_name":"Sunil Thonikkuzhiyil Thomas","author_inst":"Department of Electronics, College of Engineering Attingal, APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India"},{"author_name":"Unnikrishnan Sureshkumar","author_inst":"Astronomical Observatory of the Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Malopolska, Poland"},{"author_name":"Shabeesh Balan","author_inst":"Laboratory for Molecular Psychiatry, RIKEN Center for Brain Science, Wakoshi, Saitama, Japan"},{"author_name":"Neetha Nanoth Vellichirammal","author_inst":"Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Anatomy, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA"},{"author_name":"Sachdev Sidhu","author_inst":"The Donnelly Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada."},{"author_name":"Herbert W Virgin","author_inst":"Vir Biotechnology, San Francisco, CA, USA."},{"author_name":"David Wang","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Siyuan Ding","author_inst":"Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Davide Corti","author_inst":"Humabs Biomed SA, subsidiary of Vir Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Elitza S Theel","author_inst":"Division of Clinical Microbiology, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA."},{"author_name":"Daved H Fremont","author_inst":"Departments of Molecular Microbiology, Pathology & Immunology, Biochemistry & Molecular Biophysics, and The Andrew M. and Jane M.
