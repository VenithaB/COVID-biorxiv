The specimens were tested by RT-PCR testing. The information collected for COVID-19 cases included basic demographic, clinical severity, onset of symptoms, radiological testing, laboratory testing and hospital admission. A total of 641 environmental surfaces and air specimens were collected among 39 COVID-19 cases before disinfection. Among them, 20 specimens (20\/641, 3.1%) were tested positive from 9 COVID-19 cases (9\/39, 23.1%), with 5 (5\/101, 5.0%) positive specimens from 3 asymptomatic cases, 5 (5\/220, 2.3%) from 3 mild cases, and 10 (10\/374, 2.7%) from 3 moderate cases. All positive specimens were collected within 3 days after diagnosis, and 10 (10\/42, 23.8%) were found in toilet (5 on toilet bowl, 4 on sink\/faucet\/shower, 1 on floor drain), 4 (4\/21, 19.0%) in anteroom (2 on water dispenser\/cup\/bottle, 1 on chair\/table, 1 on TV remote), 1 (1\/8, 12.5%) in kitchen (1 on dining-table), 1 (1\/18, 5.6%) in bedroom (1 on bed\/sheet pillow\/bedside table), 1 (1\/5, 20.0%) in car (1 on steering wheel\/seat\/handlebar) and 3 (3\/20, 21.4%) on door knobs. Air specimens in room (0\/10, 0.0%) and car (0\/1, 0.0%) were all negative.\n\nConclusionsSARS-CoV-2 was found on environmental surfaces especially in toilet, and could survive for several days. We provided evidence of potential for SARS-CoV-2 transmission through contamination of environmental surfaces.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lei Luo","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Dan Liu","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Hao Zhang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Zhihao Li","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Ruonan Zhen","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xiru Zhang","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Huaping Xie","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Weiqi Song","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jie Liu","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Qingmei Huang","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jingwen Chen","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Xingfen Yang","author_inst":"Southern Medical University"},{"author_name":"Zongqiu Chen","author_inst":"Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Chen Mao","author_inst":"School of public health, southern Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"developmental biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.09.195040","rel_title":"Screening and testing for a suitable untransfected cell line for SARS-CoV-2 studies","rel_date":"2020-07-09","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.09.195040","rel_abs":"At present, the novel pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a major global threat to human health and hence demands united research activities at different levels. Finding appropriate cell systems for drug screening and testing molecular interactions of the virus with the host cell is mandatory for drug development and understanding the mechanisms of viral entry and replication. For this, we selected human cell lines represented in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) based on RNA-seq data determined transcript levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, two membrane proteins that have been identified to aid SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cell. mRNA and protein expression of these host factors were verified via RQ-PCR and western blot. We then tested permissiveness of these cell lines towards SARS-CoV-2 infection, cytopathic effect, and viral replication finding limited correlation between receptor expression and infectability. One of the candidate cancer cell lines, the human colon cancer cell line CL-14, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data argue that SARS-CoV-2 in vitro infection models need careful selection and validation since ACE2\/TMPRSS2 receptor expression on its own does not guarantee permissiveness to the virus.\n\nAuthor summaryIn the midst of the pandemic outbreak of corona-virus SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics for disease treatment are still to be tested and the virus-host-interactions are to be elucidated. Drug testing and viral studies are commonly conducted with genetically manipulated cells. In order to find a cell model system without genetic modification we screened human cell lines for two proteins known to facilitate entry of SARS-CoV-2. We confirmed and quantified permissiveness of current cell line infection models, but dismissed a number of receptor-positive cell lines that did not support viral replication. Importantly, ACE2\/TMPRSS2 co-expression seems to be necessary for viral entry but is not sufficient to predict permissiveness of various cancer cell lines. Moreover, the expression of specific splice variants and the absence of missense mutations of the host factors might hint on successful infection and virus replication of the cell lines.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Claudia Pommerenke","author_inst":"Leibniz Institut - Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH"},{"author_name":"Ulfert Rand","author_inst":"Helmholtz-Zentrum fur Infektionsforschung GmbH"},{"author_name":"Stefan Nagel","author_inst":"Leibniz Institut - Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH"},{"author_name":"Margarete Zaborski","author_inst":"Leibniz Institut - Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH"},{"author_name":"Vivien Hauer","author_inst":"Leibniz Institut - Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH"},{"author_name":"Maren Kaufmann","author_inst":"Leibniz Institut - Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH"},{"author_name":"Corinna Meyer","author_inst":"Leibniz Institut - Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH"},{"author_name":"Sabine  A.

Both the ACE2 receptor and the spike protein are heavily glycosylated, including at sites near their binding interface. We built fully glycosylated models of the ACE2 receptor bound to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Using atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we found that the glycosylation of the human ACE2 receptor contributes substantially to the binding of the virus. Interestingly, the glycans at two glycosylation sites, N90 and N322, have opposite effects on spike protein binding. The glycan at the N90 site partly covers the binding interface of the spike RBD. Therefore, this glycan can interfere with the binding of the spike protein and protect against docking of the virus to the cell. By contrast, the glycan at the N322 site interacts tightly with the RBD of the ACE2-bound spike protein and strengthens the complex. Remarkably, the N322 glycan binds into a conserved region of the spike protein identified previously as a cryptic epitope for a neutralizing antibody. By mapping the glycan binding sites, our MD simulations aid in the targeted development of neutralizing antibodies and SARS-CoV-2 fusion inhibitors.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gerhard Hummer","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute of Biophysics"},{"author_name":"Ahmad Reza Mehdipour","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute of Biophysics"},{"author_name":"Gerhard Hummer","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute of Biophysics"},{"author_name":"Margarete Zaborski","author_inst":"Leibniz Institut - Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH"},{"author_name":"Vivien Hauer","author_inst":"Leibniz Institut - Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH"},{"author_name":"Maren Kaufmann","author_inst":"Leibniz Institut - Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH"},{"author_name":"Corinna Meyer","author_inst":"Leibniz Institut - Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH"},{"author_name":"Sabine  A.

Despite recent advances in the structural elucidation of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and the complexes of the spike (S) proteins with the cellular receptor ACE2 or neutralizing antibodies, detailed architecture of the intact virus remains to be unveiled. Here we report the molecular assembly of the authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus using cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) and subtomogram averaging (STA). Native structures of the S proteins in both pre- and postfusion conformations were determined to average resolutions of 8.7-11 [A]. Compositions of the N-linked glycans from the native spikes were analyzed by mass-spectrometry, which revealed highly similar overall processing states of the native glycans to that of the recombinant glycoprotein glycans. The native conformation of the ribonucleoproteins (RNP) and its higher-order assemblies were revealed. Overall, these characterizations have revealed the architecture of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in unprecedented detail, and shed lights on how the virus packs its [~]30 kb long single-segmented RNA in the [~]80 nm diameter lumen.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hangping Yao","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases and National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, First Affiliated Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yutong Song","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Yong Chen","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Nanping Wu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases and National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, First Affiliated Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jialu Xu","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Chujie Sun","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Jiaxing Zhang","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Tianhao Weng","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases and National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, First Affiliated Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zheyuan Zhang","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Zhigang Wu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases and National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, First Affiliated Hospital"},{"author_name":"Linfang Cheng","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases and National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, First Affiliated Hospital"},{"author_name":"Danrong Shi","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases and National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, First Affiliated Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiangyun Lu","author_inst":"Zhejiang University School of Medicine First Affiliated Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jianlin Lei","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Structural Biology & Frontier Research Center for Biological Structure and "},{"author_name":"Max Crispin","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Yigong Shi","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Structural Biology & Frontier Research Center for Biological Structure and "},{"author_name":"Lanjuan Li","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases and National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, First Affiliated Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sai Li","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.08.193045","rel_title":"A single-dose live-attenuated YF17D-vectored SARS-CoV2 vaccine candidate","rel_date":"2020-07-09","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.08.193045","rel_abs":"The explosively expanding COVID-19 pandemic urges the development of safe, efficacious and fast-acting vaccines to quench the unrestrained spread of SARS-CoV-2.

Small animal models mirroring SARS-CoV-2 human disease are essential for medical countermeasure (MCM) development. Mice are refractory to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to low affinity binding to the murine angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein. Here we evaluated the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in male and female mice expressing the human ACE2 gene under the control of the keratin 18 promotor. In contrast to non-transgenic mice, intranasal exposure of K18-hACE2 animals to two different doses of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in acute disease including weight loss, lung injury, brain infection and lethality. Vasculitis was the most prominent finding in the lungs of infected mice. Transcriptomic analysis from lungs of infected animals revealed increases in transcripts involved in lung injury and inflammatory cytokines. In the lower dose challenge groups, there was a survival advantage in the female mice with 60% surviving infection whereas all male mice succumbed to disease. Male mice that succumbed to disease had higher levels of inflammatory transcripts compared to female mice. This is the first highly lethal murine infection model for SARS-CoV-2. The K18-hACE2 murine model will be valuable for the study of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and the assessment of MCMs.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joseph Golden","author_inst":"United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases"},{"author_name":"Curtis Cline","author_inst":"USAMRIID"},{"author_name":"Xiankun Zeng","author_inst":"Fort Detrick"},{"author_name":"Aura Garrison","author_inst":"USAMRIID"},{"author_name":"Brian Carey","author_inst":"USAMRIID"},{"author_name":"Eric Mucker","author_inst":"USAMRIID"},{"author_name":"Lauren White","author_inst":"USAMRIID"},{"author_name":"Joshua Shamblin","author_inst":"USAMRIID"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Brocato","author_inst":"USAMRIID"},{"author_name":"Jun Liu","author_inst":"USAMRIID"},{"author_name":"April Babka","author_inst":"USAMRIID"},{"author_name":"Hypaitia Rauch","author_inst":"USAMRIID"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey M Smith","author_inst":"USAMRIID"},{"author_name":"Bradley Hollidge","author_inst":"USAMRIID"},{"author_name":"Collin Fitzpatrick","author_inst":"USAMRIID"},{"author_name":"Catherine Badger","author_inst":"USAMRIID"},{"author_name":"Jay Hooper","author_inst":"USAMRIID"},{"author_name":"Osbourne Quaye","author_inst":"University of Ghana"},{"author_name":"Li-Hsin Li","author_inst":"KU Leuven - Rega Institute"},{"author_name":"Xin Zhang","author_inst":"KU Leuven - Rega Institute"},{"author_name":"Sebastiaan ter Horst","author_inst":"KU Leuven - Rega Institute"},{"author_name":"Niraj Mishra","author_inst":"KU Leuven - Rega Institute"},{"author_name":"Lotte Coelmont","author_inst":"KU Leuven - Rega Institute"},{"author_name":"Christopher Cawthorne","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Koen Van Laere","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Ghislain Opdenakker","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Greetje Van de Velde","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Birgit Weynand","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Dirk E.

Accordingly, this rapid systematic review will synthesise and analyse evaluative policy literature to develop a roadmap of policy changes that have occurred after each pandemic event, throughout both the 20th and 21st Century, in order to better inform future policy development. Methods and Analysis A rapid systematic review will be conducted to assimilate and synthesise both peer-reviewed articles and grey literature that document the then current pandemic preparedness policy, and the subsequent changes to that policy, across high-, middle- and low-income countries. The rapid review will follow the PRISMA guidelines, and the literature search will be performed across five relevant databases, as well as various government websites to scan for grey literature. Articles will be screen against pre-agreed inclusion\/ exclusion criteria, and data will be extracted using a pre-defined charting table.

Simple mathematical modelling is used in the context of a single, relatively closed workplace such as a factory or back-office where, in normal operation, each worker has lengthy interactions with a fixed set of colleagues. A discrete-time SEIR model on a fixed interaction graph is simulated with parameters that are motivated by the recent COVID-19 pandemic in the UK during a post-peak phase, including a small risk of viral infection from outside the working environment. Two kinds of worker are assumed, transparents who regularly test, share their results with colleagues and isolate as soon as a contact tests positive for the disease, and opaques who do none of these. Moreover, the simulations are constructed as a \"playable model\" in which the transparency level, disease parameters and mean interaction degree can be varied by the user. The model is analysed in the continuum limit. All simulations point to the double benefit of transparency in maximising productivity and minimising overall infection rates. Based on these findings, public policy implications are discussed on how to incentivise this mutually beneficial behaviour in different kinds of workplace, and simple recommendations are made.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arkady Wey","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Alan R Champneys","author_inst":"University of Bristol"},{"author_name":"Rosemary J Dyson","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Nisreen A Alwan","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Mary Barker","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Eric Mucker","author_inst":"USAMRIID"},{"author_name":"Lauren White","author_inst":"USAMRIID"},{"author_name":"Joshua Shamblin","author_inst":"USAMRIID"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Brocato","author_inst":"USAMRIID"},{"author_name":"Jun Liu","author_inst":"USAMRIID"},{"author_name":"April Babka","author_inst":"USAMRIID"},{"author_name":"Hypaitia Rauch","author_inst":"USAMRIID"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey M Smith","author_inst":"USAMRIID"},{"author_name":"Bradley Hollidge","author_inst":"USAMRIID"},{"author_name":"Collin Fitzpatrick","author_inst":"USAMRIID"},{"author_name":"Catherine Badger","author_inst":"USAMRIID"},{"author_name":"Jay Hooper","author_inst":"USAMRIID"},{"author_name":"Osbourne Quaye","author_inst":"University of Ghana"},{"author_name":"Li-Hsin Li","author_inst":"KU Leuven - Rega Institute"},{"author_name":"Xin Zhang","author_inst":"KU Leuven - Rega Institute"},{"author_name":"Sebastiaan ter Horst","author_inst":"KU Leuven - Rega Institute"},{"author_name":"Niraj Mishra","author_inst":"KU Leuven - Rega Institute"},{"author_name":"Lotte Coelmont","author_inst":"KU Leuven - Rega Institute"},{"author_name":"Christopher Cawthorne","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Koen Van Laere","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Ghislain Opdenakker","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Greetje Van de Velde","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Birgit Weynand","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Dirk E.

Because infected children often have few or no symptoms and may not be tested, the extent of infection in children is poorly understood. METHODS During the March 18th-May 15th 2020 Louisiana Stay At Home Order, 1690 blood samples from 812 individuals from a Childrens Hospital were tested for antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein. Demographics, COVID-19 testing, and clinical presentation abstracted from medical records were compared with local COVID-19 cases. RESULTS In total, 62 subjects (7.6%) were found to be seropositive. The median age was 11 years with 50.4% female. The presenting complaint of seropositive patients was chronic illness (43.5%). Only 18.2% had a previous positive COVID-19 PCR or antibody test. Seropositivity was significantly associated with parish (counties), race, and residence in a low-income area. Importantly, seropositivity was linearly correlated with cumulative COVID-19 case number for all ages by parish. CONCLUSION In a large retrospective study, the seropositivity prevalence for SARS-CoV-2 in children in Louisiana during the mandated Stay At Home Order was 7.6%. Residence location, race, and lower socioeconomic factors were linked to more frequent seropositivity in children and correlated to regional COVID-19 case rates. Thus, a significant number of children in Louisiana had SARS-CoV-2 infections that went undetected and unreported and may have contributed to virus transmission.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Monika L Dietrich","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA, USA"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth B Norton","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA, USA"},{"author_name":"Debra Elliott","author_inst":"Tulane University"},{"author_name":"Ashley R Smira","author_inst":"Tulane University"},{"author_name":"Julie A Rouelle","author_inst":"Tulane University"},{"author_name":"Nell G Bond","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA, USA"},{"author_name":"Karen Aime-Marcelin","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA, USA"},{"author_name":"Alisha Prystowsky","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA, USA"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Kemnitz","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA, USA"},{"author_name":"Arunava Sarma","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA, USA"},{"author_name":"Sarah Talia Himmelfarb","author_inst":"Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA USA"},{"author_name":"Neha Sharma","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA, USA"},{"author_name":"Addison E Stone","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA, USA"},{"author_name":"Randall Craver","author_inst":"Childrens Hospital of New Orleans, New Orleans, LA USA"},{"author_name":"Alyssa R Lindrose","author_inst":"Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Tulane University, LA USA"},{"author_name":"Leslie A Smitley","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA, USA"},{"author_name":"Robert B Uddo","author_inst":"Childrens Hospital of New Orleans, New Orleans, LA USA"},{"author_name":"Leann Myers","author_inst":"Department of Biostatistics & Data Science, School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA, USA"},{"author_name":"Stacy S Drury","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA, USA, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Tulane University, LA USA"},{"author_name":"John S Schieffelin","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA, USA"},{"author_name":"James E Robinson","author_inst":"Department of Pediatrics, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA, USA"},{"author_name":"Kevin J Zwezdaryk","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA, USA"},{"author_name":"Lotte Coelmont","author_inst":"KU Leuven - Rega Institute"},{"author_name":"Christopher Cawthorne","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Koen Van Laere","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Ghislain Opdenakker","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Greetje Van de Velde","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Birgit Weynand","author_inst":"KU Leuven"},{"author_name":"Dirk E.

Non -availability of an effective antiviral treatment makes supportive care for acute hypoxic respiratory failure is the most crucial intervention. Highly contagious nature of Covid-19 had created stress and confusion among front line Health Care Workers (HCWs) regarding infectious risk of supportive interventions and best preventive strategies. Purpose: To analyze and summarize key evidence from published literature exploring the risk of transmission of Covid-19 related to common supportive care interventions in hospitalized patients and effectiveness of currently used preventive measures in hospital setting. Data Sources: Curated Covid-19 literature from NCBI Computational Biology Branch ,Embase and Ovid till May 20,2020.Longitudinal and reference search till June 28,2020 Study Selection: Studies pertaining to risk of infection to HCWs providing standard supportive care of hospitalized Covid-19 mainly focusing on respiratory support interventions.Indirect studies from SARS,MERS or other ARDS pathology caused by infectious agents based on reference tracking and snow ball search . Clinical, Healthy volunteer and mechanistic studies were included. Two authors independently screened studies for traditional respiratory supportive-care (Hypoxia management, ventilatory support and pulmonary toileting) related transmission of viral or bacterial pneumonia to HCWs. Data Extraction: Two authors (TK and SP) independently screened articles and verified for consensus. Quality of studies and level of evidence was assessed using Oxford Center for Evidence Based Medicine (OCEBM) , Newcastle - Ottawa quality assessment Scale for observational studies and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system for grading evidence. Data Synthesis: 21 studies were eligible for inclusion. In 11 mechanistic studies, 7 were manikin based,1 was in the setting of GNB pneumonia ,2 were healthy volunteer study and 1 was heterogenous setting.Out of 10 clinical studies ,5 were case controlled and 6 were cohort studies. Risk of corona virus transmission was significantly high in HCWs performing or assisting endotracheal intubation or contact with respiratory secretion.(Moderate certainty evidence, GRADE B) Safety of nebulization treatment in corona virus pneumonia patients are questionable(Low certainty evidence, GRADE C).Very low certainty evidence exist for risk of transmission with conventional HFNC (GRADE D) and NIV (GRADE D),CPR (GRADE D),Bag and mask ventilation(GRADE D).Moderate certainty evidence exist for protective effect of wearing a multilayered mask, gown , eye protection and formal training for PPE use (GRADE B).Low certainty evidence exist for transmission risk with bag and mask ventilation, suctioning before and after intubation and prolonged exposure (GRADE C).Certainty of evidence for wearing gloves,post exposure hand washing and wearing N 95 mask is low(GRADE C). Limitations: This study was limited to articles with English abstract. Highly dynamic nature of body of literature related to Covid-19, frequent updates were necessary even during preparation of manuscript and longitudinal search was continued even after finalizing initial search. Due to the heterogeneity and broad nature of the search protocol, quantitative comparisons regarding the effectiveness of included management strategies could not be performed. Direct evidence was limited due to poor quality and non-comparative nature of available Covid-19 reporting. Conclusions: Major risk factors for transmission of corona virus infection were, performing or assisting endotracheal intubation and contact with respiratory secretion. Risk of transmission with HFNC or NIV can be significantly decreased by helmet interface, modified exhalation circuit or placing a properly fitting face mask over patient interface of HFNC. Evidence for risk of transmission with CPR, suctioning before or after intubation or bag and mask ventilation of very low certainty. Significant protective factors are Formal training for PPE use, consistently wearing mask, gown and eye protection.

Setting: Dutch hospitals Patients: Patients admitted to the hospital for treatment of COVID-19. Interventions: Pharmacokinetic sampling Measurements: The plasma concentrations of chloroquine and desethylchloroquine and QTc time. Main Results: A total of 83 patients were included. The median (IQR) plasma concentration chloroquine during treatment was 1.05 mol\/L (0.63 - 1.55 mol\/L). None of the patients reached exposure exceeding the concentration to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication by 90% (IC90) of 6.9 M. Furthermore, {Delta}QTc >60 milliseconds occurred after initiation of chloroquine treatment in 34% patients and during treatment QTc [&ge;]500 milliseconds was observed in 46% of patients. Conclusions: Recommended dose chloroquine treatment results in plasma concentrations that are unlikely to inhibit viral replication. Furthermore, the incidence of QTc prolongation was high. The preclinical promise of chloroquine as antiviral treatment in patients with COVID-19 is overshadowed by its cardiac toxicity and lack of effective exposure. It is unlikely that a positive clinical effect will be found with chloroquine for treatment of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Roger J.M.

We evaluated the analytical performance of two rapid nucleic acid tests, Cepheid Xpert(R) Xpress SARS-CoV-2 and Mobidiag Novodiag(R) Covid-19, in comparison to a combination reference of three large-scale PCR tests. Moreover, utility of the Novodiag(R) test in tertiary care emergency departments was assessed. In the preliminary evaluation, analysis of 90 respiratory samples resulted in 100% specificity and sensitivity for Xpert(R), whereas analysis of 107 samples resulted in 93.4% sensitivity and 100% specificity for Novodiag(R). Rapid SARS-CoV-2 testing with Novodiag(R) was made available for four tertiary care emergency departments in Helsinki, Finland between 18 and 31 May, coinciding with a rapidly declining epidemic phase. Altogether 361 respiratory specimens, together with relevant clinical data, were analyzed with Novodiag(R) and reference tests: 355\/361 of the specimens were negative with both methods, and 1\/361 was positive in Novodiag(R) and negative by the reference method. Of the 5 remaining specimens, two were negative with Novodiag(R), but positive with the reference method with late Ct values. On average, a test result using Novodiag(R) was available nearly 8 hours earlier than that obtained with the large-scale PCR tests. While the performance of novel sample-to-answer PCR tests need to be carefully evaluated, they may provide timely and reliable results in detection of SARS-CoV-2 and thus facilitate patient management including effective cohorting.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pia Jokela","author_inst":"HUSLAB"},{"author_name":"Anu Elina J\u00e4\u00e4skel\u00e4inen","author_inst":"HUSLAB"},{"author_name":"Hanna Jarva","author_inst":"University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tanja Holma","author_inst":"HUSLAB"},{"author_name":"Maarit Ahava","author_inst":"University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Laura Mannonen","author_inst":"HUSLAB"},{"author_name":"Maija Lappalainen","author_inst":"Virology and Immunology, Laboratory Services (HUSLAB), Helsinki University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Satu Kurkela","author_inst":"University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Raisa Loginov","author_inst":"Department of Virology, Helsinki University Central Hospital and University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Jannette Rahamat-Langedoen","author_inst":"Radboudumc, Nijmegen, The Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Thijs C.D.

Countries have adopted Non-pharmaceutical Interventions (NPI) to slow down the spread. This study proposes an Agent Based Model that simulates the spread of COVID-19 among the inhabitants of a city. The Agent Based Model can be accommodated for any location by integrating parameters specific to the city. The simulation gives the number of daily confirmed cases. Considering each person as an agent susceptible to COVID-19, the model causes infected individuals to transmit the disease via various actions performed every hour. The model is validated by comparing the simulation to the real data of Ford county, Kansas, USA. Different interventions including contact tracing are applied on a scaled down version of New York city, USA and the parameters that lead to a controlled epidemic are determined. Our experiments suggest that contact tracing via smartphones with more than 60% of the population owning a smartphone combined with a city-wide lock-down results in the effective reproduction number (Rt) to fall below 1 within three weeks of intervention. In the case of 75% or more smartphone users, new infections are eliminated and the spread is contained within three months of intervention. Contact tracing accompanied with early lock-down can suppress the epidemic growth of COVID-19 completely with sufficient smartphone owners. In places where it is difficult to ensure a high percentage of smartphone ownership, tracing only emergency service providers during a lock-down can go a long way to contain the spread.

Several models have been proposed to explain the regularity of yearly recurring outbreaks and the phase-differences observed at different latitudes on Earth. Such models take into account known internal causes, primarily the periodic emergence of new virus variants that evade the host immune response. Yet, this alone, is generally unable to explain the regularity of recurrences and the observed phase-differences. Here we show that seasonality of viral respiratory diseases, as well as its distribution with latitude on Earth, can be fully explained by the virucidal properties of UV-B and A Solar photons through a daily, minute-scale, resonant forcing mechanism. Such an induced periodicity can last, virtually unperturbed, from tens to hundreds of cycles, and even in presence of internal dynamics (host's loss of immunity) much slower than seasonal will, on a long period, generate seasonal oscillations.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fabrizio Nicastro","author_inst":"Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica - Osservatorio Astronomico di Roma"},{"author_name":"Giorgia Sironi","author_inst":"Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica - Osservatorio Astronomico di Brera"},{"author_name":"Elio Antonello","author_inst":"Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica - Osservatorio Astronomico di Brera"},{"author_name":"Andrea Bianco","author_inst":"Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica - Osservatorio Astronomico di Brera"},{"author_name":"Mara Biasin","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences L.

EM during the first 20 weeks of 2020 was estimated by comparing observed mortality rates with expected mortality rates during the five previous years (N=2,379,792). EM variation by socioeconomic status (tertiles of income, education, Swedish-born, gainful employment) and age distribution (share of 70+ year-old persons) was explored based on Demographic Statistics Area (DeSO) data. Findings: An EM was first detected during the week of March 23-29 2020. During the peaking week of the epidemic (6-12 April 2020), an EM of 160% was observed: 211% in 80+ year-old women; 179% in 80+ year-old men. During the same week, the highest EM was observed for DeSOs with lowest income (171%), lowest education (162%), lowest share of Swedish-born (178%), and lowest share of gainfully employed (174%). There was a 1.2 to 1.7-fold increase in EM between those areas with a higher vs. lower proportion of young people. Interpretation: Living in areas with lower socioeconomic status and younger populations is linked to COVID-19 EM. These conditions might have facilitated the viral spread. Our findings add to the well-known biological vulnerability linked to increasing age, the relevance of the sociodemographic context when estimating the individual risk to COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amaia Calderon-Larranaga","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Davide L Vetrano","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Debora Rizzuto","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Tom Bellander","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Laura Fratiglioni","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Serhiy Dekhtyar","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Ilaria Ermolli","author_inst":"Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica - Osservatorio Astronomico di Roma"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Pareschi","author_inst":"Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica - Osservatorio Astronomico di Brera"},{"author_name":"Marta Salvati","author_inst":"ARPA - Lombardia"},{"author_name":"Paolo Tozzi","author_inst":"Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica - Osservatorio Astrofisco di Arcetri"},{"author_name":"Daria Trabattoni","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences L.

Design: Modelling study. Setting: England and India. Participants: 1,375,548 respondents aged 18 to 99 to the District Level Household Survey-4 and Annual Health Survey in India. Additional information on health condition prevalence on individuals aged 18 to 99 was obtained from the Health Survey for England and the Global Burden of Diseases, Risk Factors, and Injuries Studies (GBD). Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was the proportional increase in age-specific mortality in each country due to the prevalence of each COVID-19 mortality risk factor (diabetes, hypertension, obesity, chronic heart disease, respiratory illness, kidney disease, liver disease, and cancer, among others). The combined change in overall mortality and the share of deaths under 60 from the combination of risk factors was estimated in each country. Results: Relative to England, Indians have higher rates of diabetes (10.6% vs. 8.5%), chronic respiratory disease (4.8% vs. 2.5%), and kidney disease (9.7% vs. 5.6%), and lower rates of obesity (4.4% vs. 27.9%), chronic heart disease (4.4% vs. 5.9%), and cancer (0.3% vs. 2.8%). Population COVID-19 mortality in India relative to England is most increased by diabetes (+5.4%) and chronic respiratory disease (+2.3%), and most reduced by obesity (-9.7%), cancer (-3.2%), and chronic heart disease (-1.9%). Overall, comorbidities lower mortality in India relative to England by 9.7%. Accounting for demographics and population health explains a third of the difference in share of deaths under age 60 between the two countries. Conclusions: Known COVID-19 health risk factors are not expected to have a large effect on aggregate mortality or its age distribution in India relative to England. The high share of COVID-19 deaths from people under 60 in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remains unexplained. Understanding mortality risk associated with health conditions prevalent in LMICs, such as malnutrition and HIV\/AIDS, is essential for understanding differential mortality.

The new model takes into account the hierarchic structure of social clusters in the human society. We apply the well developed theory of random walk on the energy landscapes represented mathematically with ultrametric spaces. This theory was created for applications to spin glasses and protein dynamics. To move from one social cluster (valley) to another, the virus (its carrier) should cross a social barrier between them. The magnitude of a barrier depends on the number of social hierarchy's levels composing this barrier. As the most appropriate for the recent situation in Sweden, we consider linearly increasing (with respect to hierarchy's levels) barriers. This structure of barriers matches with a rather soft regulations imposed in Sweden in March 2020. In this model, the infection spreads rather easily inside a social cluster (say working collective), but jumps to other clusters are constrained by social barriers. This model's feature matches with the real situation during the covid-19 epidemy, with its cluster spreading structure. Clusters need not be determined solely geographically, they are based on a number of hierarchically ordered social coordinates. The model differs crucially from the standard mathematical models of spread of disease, such as the SIR-model. In particular, our model describes such a specialty of spread of covid-19 virus as the presence of \"super-spreaders\" who by performing a kind of random walk on a hierarchic landscape of social clusters spreads infection. In future, this model will be completed by adding the SIR-type counterpart. But, the latter is not a specialty of covid-19 spreading.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrei Khrennikov","author_inst":"Linnaeus University"},{"author_name":"Radhika Jain","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Alison Campion","author_inst":"Development Data Lab"},{"author_name":"Sam Asher","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University SAIS"},{"author_name":"Laura Fratiglioni","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Serhiy Dekhtyar","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Ilaria Ermolli","author_inst":"Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica - Osservatorio Astronomico di Roma"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Pareschi","author_inst":"Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica - Osservatorio Astronomico di Brera"},{"author_name":"Marta Salvati","author_inst":"ARPA - Lombardia"},{"author_name":"Paolo Tozzi","author_inst":"Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica - Osservatorio Astrofisco di Arcetri"},{"author_name":"Daria Trabattoni","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences L.

Pooling is most advantageous in populations with low infection (positivity) rates, but is expected to remain better than non-pooled testing in populations with infection rates up to 30%. For populations with infection rates lower than 10%, additional testing efficiency may be realized by performing a second round of pooling to test all the samples in the positive first-round pools. The present predictions are validated by recent COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pooled testing and detection sensitivity measurements performed using non-optimal pool sizes, and quantify the additional improvement in testing efficiency that could have been obtained using optimal pooling. Although large pools are most advantageous for testing populations with very low infection rates, they are predicted to become highly non-optimal with increasing infection rate, while pool sizes smaller than 10 remain near-optimal over a broader range of infection rates.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dor Ben-Amotz","author_inst":"Purdue University"},{"author_name":"Radhika Jain","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Alison Campion","author_inst":"Development Data Lab"},{"author_name":"Sam Asher","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University SAIS"},{"author_name":"Laura Fratiglioni","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Serhiy Dekhtyar","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Ilaria Ermolli","author_inst":"Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica - Osservatorio Astronomico di Roma"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Pareschi","author_inst":"Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica - Osservatorio Astronomico di Brera"},{"author_name":"Marta Salvati","author_inst":"ARPA - Lombardia"},{"author_name":"Paolo Tozzi","author_inst":"Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica - Osservatorio Astrofisco di Arcetri"},{"author_name":"Daria Trabattoni","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences L.

We assessed national public perceptions (e.g., severity, concerns, health), knowledge (e.g., transmission, information sources), and behaviors (e.g., physical distancing) related to COVID-19 in Canada to understand public perspectives and inform future public health initiatives. Methods: We administered a national online survey with the goal of obtaining responses from 2000 adults residing in Canada. Respondent sampling was stratified by age, sex, and region. We used descriptive statistics to summarize respondent characteristics and tested for significant overall regional differences using chi-squared tests and t-tests, as appropriate. Results: We collected 1,996 eligible questionnaires between April 26th and May 1st, 2020. One-fifth (20%) of respondents knew someone diagnosed with COVID-19, but few had tested positive themselves (0.6%). Negative impacts of pandemic conditions were evidenced in several areas, including concerns about healthcare (e.g. sufficient equipment, 52%), pandemic stress (45%), and worsening social (49%) and mental\/emotional (39%) health. Most respondents (88%) felt they had good to excellent knowledge of virus transmission, and predominantly accessed (74%) and trusted (60%) Canadian news television, newspapers\/magazines, or non-government news websites for COVID-19 information. We found high compliance with distancing measures (80% either self-isolating or always physical distancing). We identified regional differences in perceptions, knowledge, and behaviors related to COVID-19. Discussion: We found that knowledge about COVID-19 is largely acquired through domestic news sources, which may explain high self-reported compliance with prevention measures. The results highlight the broader impact of a pandemic on the general public's overall health and wellbeing, outside of personal infection. The study findings should be used to inform public health communications during COVID-19 and future pandemics.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jeanna Parsons Leigh","author_inst":"Dalhousie University"},{"author_name":"Kirsten Fiest","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Brundin-Mather","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Kara Plonikoff","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Andrea Soo","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Emma E.

To create a repeatable modelling process to identify regional population centers with pandemic vulnerability, readily available COVID-19 and socioeconomic variable datasets were compiled, and linear regression models were built during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. The models were validated later in the pandemic timeline using actual COVID-19 mortality rates in states with high population densities, with New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Louisiana, Michigan and Pennsylvania showing the strongest predictive results. Our models have been shared with the Department of Health Commissioners of each of these states as input into a much needed pandemic playbook for local healthcare agencies in allocating medical testing and treatment resources.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tara Fusillo","author_inst":"John F.

Atypical presentations of COVID-19 are being reported in older adults and may pose difficulties for early isolation and treatment, particularly in institutional care settings. We aimed to characterise the presenting symptoms and associated mortality of COVID-19 in older adults, with a focus on care home residents and older adults living in the community. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of consecutive inpatients over 80 years old hospitalised with PCR confirmed COVID-19 between 10th March 2020 and 8th April 2020. Symptoms at presentation, including those associated with frailty, were analysed. Differences between community dwelling and care home residents, and associations with mortality, were assessed using between-group comparisons and logistic regression. Results: Care home residents were less likely to experience cough (46.9% vs 72.9%, p=0.002) but more likely to present with delirium (51.6% vs 31.4%, p=0.018), particularly hypoactive delirium (40.6% vs 24.3%, p=0.043). Mortality was more likely in the very frail (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.00, 1.58, p=0.049) and those presenting with anorexia (OR 3.20, 95% CI 1.21, 10.09, p=0.028). There were no differences in either mortality or length of stay between those admitted from care homes and community dwelling older adults. Conclusion: COVID-19 in those over 80 does not always present with typical symptoms, particularly in those admitted from institutional care. These individuals have a reduced incidence of cough and increased hypoactive delirium. Individuals presenting atypically, especially with anorexia, have higher mortality.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mark James Rawle","author_inst":"MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL & Department of Geriatric Medicine, Barnet Hospital, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Deborah Lee Bertfield","author_inst":"Department of Geriatric Medicine, Barnet Hospital, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Simon Edward Brill","author_inst":"Department of Geriatric Medicine, Barnet Hospital, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Kara Plonikoff","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Andrea Soo","author_inst":"University of Calgary"},{"author_name":"Emma E.

In this study, we develop two early-detection models to identify COVID-19 using routinely collected data typically available within one hour (laboratory tests, blood gas and vital signs) during 115,394 emergency presentations and 72,310 admissions to hospital. Our emergency department (ED) model achieved 77.4% sensitivity and 95.7% specificity (AUROC 0.939) for COVID- 19 amongst all patients attending hospital, and Admissions model achieved 77.4% sensitivity and 94.8% specificity (AUROC 0.940) for the subset admitted to hospital. Both models achieve high negative predictive values (>99%) across a range of prevalences (<5%), facilitating rapid exclusion during triage to guide infection control. We prospectively validated our models across all patients presenting and admitted to a large UK teaching hospital group in a two-week test period, achieving 92.3% (n= 3,326, NPV: 97.6%, AUROC: 0.881) and 92.5% accuracy (n=1,715, NPV: 97.7%, AUROC: 0.871) in comparison to RT-PCR results. Sensitivity analyses to account for uncertainty in negative PCR results improves apparent accuracy (95.1% and 94.1%) and NPV (99.0% and 98.5%). Our artificial intelligence models perform effectively as a screening test for COVID-19 in emergency departments and hospital admission units, offering high impact in settings where rapid testing is unavailable.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew AS Soltan","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Samaneh Kouchaki","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tingting Zhu","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Dani Kiyasseh","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Thomas Taylor","author_inst":"Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Dept.

Clinical presentations range from asymptomatic, mild respiratory tract infection, to severe cases with acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, and death. Reports on a dysregulated immune system in the severe cases calls for a better characterization and understanding of the changes in the immune system. Here, we profiled whole blood transcriptomes of 39 COVID-19 patients and 10 control donors enabling a data-driven stratification based on molecular phenotype. Neutrophil activation-associated signatures were prominently enriched in severe patient groups, which was corroborated in whole blood transcriptomes from an independent second cohort of 30 as well as in granulocyte samples from a third cohort of 11 COVID-19 patients. Comparison of COVID-19 blood transcriptomes with those of a collection of over 2,600 samples derived from 11 different viral infections, inflammatory diseases and independent control samples revealed highly specific transcriptome signatures for COVID-19. Further, stratified transcriptomes predicted patient subgroup-specific drug candidates targeting the dysregulated systemic immune response of the host.","rel_num_authors":54,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anna C.

Malaysia is not spared from this pandemic as all universities were forced to close and initiate online learning with the implementation of Movement Control Order since mid-March 2020.The abrupt shift from conventional medical education to fully virtual learning definitely deserves a reflection on how it affects the learning motivation among medical students. Hence, this is the first study that compares the effect of digital learning on learning motivation among medical students in Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic period. A modified Students Motivation towards Science Learning (SMTSL) was used to assess the learning motivation of UKM medical students throughout Year 1-5. The number of students that use digital learning during COVID-19 is significantly higher compared to before COVID-19 (p<0.05). However, there is no significant difference (p=0.872) in learning motivation among medical students before and during COVID-19 crisis. Higher frequency in digital learning usage frequency does not exert a great impact on learning motivation. Reflections from each participant were collated to justify the current situation. This could be due to motivation coming from the very choice to pursue medicine as a doctor, which is mainly influenced by intrinsic motivation, and ability to adapt in difficult situations. Thus, medical educators should be creative in enhancing extrinsic motivation by making use of digital learning as a platform so that medical students are able to independently fish for information in the vast pool of digital information and apply in actual medical practice in the future for life-long learning.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Noor A.S.

This study seeks to develop and validate a data-driven personalized mortality risk calculator for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods: De-identified data was obtained for 3,927 COVID-19 positive patients from six independent centers, comprising 33 different hospitals. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables were collected at hospital admission. The COVID-19 Mortality Risk (CMR) tool was developed using the XGBoost algorithm to predict mortality. Its discrimination performance was subsequently evaluated on three validation cohorts. Findings: The derivation cohort of 3,062 patients has an observed mortality rate of 26.84%. Increased age, decreased oxygen saturation ([&le;] 93%), elevated levels of C-reactive protein ([&ge;] 130 mg\/L), blood urea nitrogen ([&ge;] 18 mg\/dL), and blood creatinine ([&ge;] 1.2 mg\/dL) were identified as primary risk factors, validating clinical findings. The model obtains out-of-sample AUCs of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.87-0.94) on the derivation cohort. In the validation cohorts, the model obtains AUCs of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.88-0.95) on Seville patients, 0.87 (95% CI, 0.84-0.91) on Hellenic COVID-19 Study Group patients, and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.76-0.85) on Hartford Hospital patients. The CMR tool is available as an online application at covidanalytics.io\/mortality_calculator and is currently in clinical use. Interpretation: The CMR model leverages machine learning to generate accurate mortality predictions using commonly available clinical features. This is the first risk score trained and validated on a cohort of COVID-19 patients from Europe and the United States.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dimitris Bertsimas","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Galit Lukin","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Luca Mingardi","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Omid Nohadani","author_inst":"Benefits Science Technologies"},{"author_name":"Agni Orfanoudaki","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Bartolomeo Stellato","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Holly Wiberg","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Sara Gonzalez-Garcia","author_inst":"Institute of Biomedicine of Seville (IBIS), Virgen del Rocio University Hospital, CSIC, University of Seville"},{"author_name":"Carlos Luis Parra-Calderon","author_inst":"Institute of Biomedicine of Seville (IBIS), Virgen del Rocio University Hospital, CSIC, University of Seville"},{"author_name":"- The Hellenic COVID-19 Study Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Kenneth Robinson","author_inst":"Hartford HealthCare"},{"author_name":"Michelle Schneider","author_inst":"Hartford HealthCare"},{"author_name":"Barry Stein","author_inst":"Hartford HealthCare"},{"author_name":"Alberto Estirado","author_inst":"HM Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Lia a Beccara","author_inst":"Azienda Socio-Sanitaria Territoriale di Cremona"},{"author_name":"Rosario Canino","author_inst":"Azienda Socio-Sanitaria Territoriale di Cremona"},{"author_name":"Martina Dal Bello","author_inst":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Federica Pezzetti","author_inst":"Azienda Socio-Sanitaria Territoriale di Cremona"},{"author_name":"Angelo Pan","author_inst":"Azienda Socio-Sanitaria Territoriale di Cremona"},{"author_name":"Arik Horne","author_inst":"Life and Medical Science Institute, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ioanna D.

It has also been suggested that the D614G variant found more commonly in the US and across European countries may explain why PIMS-TS appears to be common in these countries. Here we analysed viral sequences from 13 paediatric COVID-19 patients of whom five were diagnosed with PIMS-TS. This is the first characterisation of viruses from PIMS-TS patients.

Methods: This Pilot clinical trial conducted on hospitalized adult patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 diagnosed according to WHO interim guidance. Sixteen Patients received a single dose of IVM 200Mcg \/kg on admission day as add on therapy to hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ)and Azithromycin (AZT) and were compared with 71 controls received HCQ and AZT matched in age, gender, clinical features, and comorbidities. The primary outcome was percentage of cured patients, defined as symptoms free to be discharged from the hospital and 2 consecutive negative PCR test from nasopharyngeal swabs at least 24 hours apart. The secondary outcomes were time to cure in both groups and evaluated by measuring time from admission of the patient to the hospital till discharge. Results: Of 87 patients included in the study,t he mean age {+\/-} SD (range) of patients in the IVM group was similar to controls [44.87 {+\/-} 10.64 (28-60) vs 45.23 {+\/-} 18.47 (8-80) years, p=0.78] Majority of patients in both groups were male but statistically not significant [11(69%) versus 52 (73%), with male: female ratio 2.21 versus 2.7-, p=0.72) All the patients of IVM group were cured compared with the controls [ 16 (100 %) vs 69 (97.2 %)]. Two patients died in the controls. The mean time to stay in the hospital was significantly lower in IVM group compared with the controls (7.62 {+\/-}2.75 versus 13.22 {+\/-}.90 days, p=0.00005, effect size= 0.82). No adverse events were observed Conclusions : Add-on use of IVM to HCQ and AZT had better effectiveness, shorter hospital stay, and relatively safe compared with controls. however, a larger prospective study with longer follow up may be needed to validate these results.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Faiq I.

SARS-CoV-2 emerged in China in December 2019 as new cause of severe viral pneumonia (CoVID-19) reaching Europe by late January 2020. We validated the WHO-recommended assay and describe the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 and community-acquired respiratory viruses (CARVs). Methods. Naso-oropharyngeal swabs (NOPS) from 7663 individuals were prospectively tested by the Basel-S-gene and the WHO-based E-gene-assay (Roche) using Basel-N-gene-assay for confirmation. CARVs were tested in 2394 NOPS by multiplex-NAT, including 1816 together with SARS-CoV-2. Results. Basel-S-gene and Roche-E-gene-assays were concordant in 7475 cases (97.5%) including 825 (11%) positive samples. In 188 (2.5%) discordant cases, SARS-CoV-2 loads were significantly lower than in concordant positive ones and confirmed in 105 NOPS. Adults were more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2, while children were more likely to test CARV-positive. CARV co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 occurred in 1.8%. SARS-CoV-2 replaced other CARVs within 3 weeks reaching 48% of all detected respiratory viruses followed by rhino\/enterovirus (13%), influenzavirus (12%), coronavirus (9%), respiratory syncytial (6%) and metapneumovirus (6%). Conclusions. The differential diagnosis for respiratory infections was broad during the early pandemic, affecting infection control and treatment decisions. We discuss the role of pre-existing immunity and competitive CARV replication for the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection among adults and children.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Karoline Leuzinger","author_inst":"University of Basel and University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Tim Roloff","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Rainer Gosert","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Kirstine Soegaard","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Klaudia Naegele","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Katharina Rentsch","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Roland Bingisser","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Christian Nickel","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Hans Pargger","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Stefano Bassetti","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Julia Anna Bielicki","author_inst":"University Children Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Nina Khanna","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Sarah Tschudin Sutter","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Andreas Widmer","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Vladimira Hinic","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Manuel Battegay","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Adrian Egli","author_inst":"University Hospital Basel"},{"author_name":"Hans H Hirsch","author_inst":"University of Basel"},{"author_name":"Angelo Pan","author_inst":"Azienda Socio-Sanitaria Territoriale di Cremona"},{"author_name":"Arik Horne","author_inst":"Life and Medical Science Institute, University of Bonn, Germany"},{"author_name":"Ioanna D.
