It degrades the polyuridine extensions in (-) sense strand of viral RNA and some non-translated RNA on (+) sense strand. This activity seems to be responsible for the interference with the innate immune response and evasion of host pattern recognition. Nsp15 is highly conserved in coronaviruses suggesting that its activity is important for virus replication. Here we report first structures with bound nucleotides and show that SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 specifically recognizes U in a pattern previously predicted for EndoU. In the presence of manganese ions, the enzyme cleaves unpaired RNAs. Inhibitors of Nsp15 have been reported but not actively pursued into therapeutics. The current COVID-19 pandemic brought to attention the repurposing of existing drugs and the rapid identification of new antiviral compounds. Tipiracil is an FDA approved drug that is used with trifluridine in the treatment of colorectal cancer. Here, we combine crystallography, biochemical and whole cell assays, and show that this compound inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 and interacts with the uridine binding pocket of the enzyme\u2019s active site, providing basis for the uracil scaffold-based drug development.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Youngchang Kim","author_inst":"Argonne National Laboratory\/University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Jacek Wower","author_inst":"Auburn University"},{"author_name":"Natalia Maltseva","author_inst":"Argonne National Laboratory\/University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Changsoo Chang","author_inst":"Argonne National Laboratory\/University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Robert Jedrzejczak","author_inst":"Argonne National Laboratory\/University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Mateusz Wilamowski","author_inst":"Argonne National Laboratory\/University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Soowon Kang","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Vlad Nicolaescu","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Glenn Randall","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Karolina Michalska","author_inst":"Argonne National Laboratory\/University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Andrzej Joachimiak","author_inst":"Argonne National Laboratory\/University of Chicago"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"molecular biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.25.172403","rel_title":"Virus-Receptor Interactions of Glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 Spike and Human ACE2 Receptor","rel_date":"2020-06-26","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.25.172403","rel_abs":"The current COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 betacoronavirus, which utilizes its highly glycosylated trimeric Spike protein to bind to the cell surface receptor ACE2 glycoprotein and facilitate host cell entry. We utilized glycomics-informed glycoproteomics to characterize site-specific microheterogeneity of glycosylation for a recombinant trimer Spike mimetic immunogen and for a soluble version of human ACE2. We combined this information with bioinformatic analyses of natural variants and with existing 3D-structures of both glycoproteins to generate molecular dynamics simulations of each glycoprotein alone and interacting with one another. Our results highlight roles for glycans in sterically masking polypeptide epitopes and directly modulating Spike-ACE2 interactions. Furthermore, our results illustrate the impact of viral evolution and divergence on Spike glycosylation, as well as the influence of natural variants on ACE2 receptor glycosylation that, taken together, can facilitate immunogen design to achieve antibody neutralization and inform therapeutic strategies to inhibit viral infection.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peng Zhao","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 306"},{"author_name":"Jeremy L Praissman","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 306"},{"author_name":"Oliver C Grant","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 306"},{"author_name":"Yongfei Cai","author_inst":"Division of Molecular Medicine, Childrens Hospital and Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, 02115, USA"},{"author_name":"Tianshu Xiao","author_inst":"Division of Molecular Medicine, Childrens Hospital and Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, 02115, USA"},{"author_name":"Katelyn E Rosenbalm","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 306"},{"author_name":"Kazuhiro Aoki","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 306"},{"author_name":"Benjamin P Kellman","author_inst":"Departments of Pediatrics and Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, 92093, USA"},{"author_name":"Robert Bridger","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 306"},{"author_name":"Dan H Barouch","author_inst":"Center for Virology and Vaccine Research, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, 02215, USA"},{"author_name":"Melinda A Brindley","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Department of Population Health, Center for Vaccines and Immunology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Georgia, A"},{"author_name":"Nathan E Lewis","author_inst":"Departments of Pediatrics and Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, 92093, USA, Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosusta"},{"author_name":"Michael Tiemeyer","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 306"},{"author_name":"Bing Chen","author_inst":"Division of Molecular Medicine, Childrens Hospital and Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, 02115, USA"},{"author_name":"Robert J Woods","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 306"},{"author_name":"Lance Wells","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 306"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.25.20140061","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 has been circulating in northern Italy since December 2019: evidence from environmental monitoring","rel_date":"2020-06-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.25.20140061","rel_abs":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the coronavirus disease COVID-19, a public health emergency worldwide, and Italy is among the world's first and most severely affected countries. The first autochthonous Italian case of COVID-19 was documented on February 21. We investigated the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Italy earlier than that date, by analysing 40 composite influent wastewater samples collected - in the framework of other wastewater-based epidemiology projects - between October 2019 and February 2020 from five wastewater treatment plants (WTPs) in three cities and regions in northern Italy (Milan\/Lombardy, Turin\/Piedmont and Bologna\/Emilia Romagna). Twenty-four additional samples collected in the same WTPs between September 2018 and June 2019 were included as blank samples. Viral concentration was performed according to the standard World Health Organization procedure for poliovirus sewage surveillance. Molecular analysis was undertaken with both nested RT-PCR and real-rime RT-PCR assays. A total of 15 positive samples were confirmed by both methods. Of these, 8 were collected before the first autochthonous Italian case. The earliest dates back to 18 December 2019 in Milan and Turin and 29 January 2020 in Bologna. Samples collected in January and February in the three cities were also positive. Our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 was already circulating in northern Italy at the end of 2019. Moreover, it was circulating in different geographic regions simultaneously, which changes our previous understanding of the geographical circulation of the virus in Italy. Our study highlights once again the importance of environmental surveillance as an early warning system, to monitor the levels of virus circulating in the population and identify outbreaks even before cases are notified to the healthcare system.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Giuseppina La Rosa","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita'"},{"author_name":"Pamela Mancini","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita'"},{"author_name":"Giusy Bonanno Ferraro","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita'"},{"author_name":"Carolina Veneri","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di sanita'"},{"author_name":"Marcello Iaconelli","author_inst":"Istituto Supere di Sanita'"},{"author_name":"Lucia Bonadonna","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita'"},{"author_name":"Luca Lucentini","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita'"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta Suffredini","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita'"},{"author_name":"Robert Bridger","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 306"},{"author_name":"Dan H Barouch","author_inst":"Center for Virology and Vaccine Research, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, 02215, USA"},{"author_name":"Melinda A Brindley","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Department of Population Health, Center for Vaccines and Immunology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Georgia, A"},{"author_name":"Nathan E Lewis","author_inst":"Departments of Pediatrics and Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, 92093, USA, Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosusta"},{"author_name":"Michael Tiemeyer","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 306"},{"author_name":"Bing Chen","author_inst":"Division of Molecular Medicine, Childrens Hospital and Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, 02115, USA"},{"author_name":"Robert J Woods","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 306"},{"author_name":"Lance Wells","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 306"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.26.20140525","rel_title":"Hypoferremia predicts hospitalization and oxygen demand in COVID-19 patients","rel_date":"2020-06-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.26.20140525","rel_abs":"Background: Iron metabolism might play a crucial role in cytokine release syndrome in COVID-19 patients. Therefore we assessed iron metabolism markers in COVID-19 patients for their ability to predict disease severity. Methods: COVID-19 patients referred to the Heidelberg University Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into outpatients (cohort A, n=204), inpatients (cohort B, n=81), and outpatients later admitted to hospital because of health deterioration (cohort C, n=23). Results: Iron metabolism parameters were severely altered in patients of cohort B and C compared to cohort A. In multivariate regression analysis including age, gender, CRP and iron-related parameters only serum iron and ferritin were significantly associated with hospitalization. ROC analysis revealed an AUC for serum iron of 0.894 and an iron concentration <6micromol\/l as the best cutoff-point predicting hospitalization with a sensitivity of 94.7% and a specificity of 67.9%. When stratifying inpatients in a low- and high oxygen demand group serum iron levels differed significantly between these two groups and showed a high negative correlation with the inflammatory parameters IL-6, procalcitonin, and CRP. Unexpectedly, serum iron levels poorly correlate with hepcidin. Conclusion: We conclude that measurement of serum iron can help predicting the severity of COVID-19. The differences in serum iron availability observed between the low and high oxygen demand group suggest that disturbed iron metabolism likely plays a causal role in the pathophysiology leading to lung injury.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Theresa Hippchen","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine IV, University Hospital Heidelberg"},{"author_name":"Sandro Altamura","author_inst":"Pediatric Oncology, Hematology & Immunology, University Hospital Heidelberg"},{"author_name":"Martina U.

In the model, nodes correspond to locations or communities that are connected by links indicating travel and commuting between different locations. While this proposed modelling framework can be applied on all levels of spatial granularity and different countries, we consider Ireland as a case study. The network comprises 3440 electoral divisions (EDs) of the Republic of Ireland and 890 superoutput areas (SOAs) for Northern Ireland, which corresponds to local administrative units below the NUTS 3 regions. The local dynamics within each node follows a phenomenological SIRX compartmental model including classes of Susceptibles, Infected, Recovered and Quarantined (X) inspired from Science 368, 742 (2020). For better comparison to empirical data, we extended that model by a class of Deaths. We consider various scenarios including the 5-phase roadmap for Ireland. In addition, as proof of concept, we investigate the effect of dynamic interventions that aim to keep the number of infected below a given threshold. This is achieved by dynamically adjusting containment measures on a national scale, which could also be implemented at a regional (county) or local (ED\/SOA) level. We find that - in principle - dynamic interventions are capable to limit the impact of future waves of outbreaks, but on the downside, such a strategy can last several years until herd immunity will be reached.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rory Humphries","author_inst":"School of Mathematical Sciences, University College Cork"},{"author_name":"Mary Spillane","author_inst":"School of Mathematical Sciences, University College Cork"},{"author_name":"Kieran Mulchrone","author_inst":"School of Mathematical Sciences, University College Cork"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Wieczorek","author_inst":"School of Mathematical Sciences, University College Cork"},{"author_name":"Micheal O'Riordain","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Mercy University Hospital, Cork"},{"author_name":"Philipp Hoevel","author_inst":"School of Mathematical Sciences, University College Cork"},{"author_name":"Luca Lucentini","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita'"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta Suffredini","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita'"},{"author_name":"Robert Bridger","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 306"},{"author_name":"Dan H Barouch","author_inst":"Center for Virology and Vaccine Research, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, 02215, USA"},{"author_name":"Melinda A Brindley","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Department of Population Health, Center for Vaccines and Immunology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Georgia, A"},{"author_name":"Nathan E Lewis","author_inst":"Departments of Pediatrics and Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, 92093, USA, Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosusta"},{"author_name":"Michael Tiemeyer","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 306"},{"author_name":"Bing Chen","author_inst":"Division of Molecular Medicine, Childrens Hospital and Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, 02115, USA"},{"author_name":"Robert J Woods","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 306"},{"author_name":"Lance Wells","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 306"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.25.20140004","rel_title":"Covid-19 Pandemic Data Analysis and Forecasting using Machine Learning Algorithms","rel_date":"2020-06-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.25.20140004","rel_abs":"India reported its first Covid19 case on 30th Jan 2020 and the number of cases reported heavily escalated from March, 2020. This research paper analyses COVID19 data initially at a global level and then drills down to the scenario obtained in India. Data is gathered from multiple data sources- several authentic government websites. The need of the hour is to accurately forecast when the numbers will reach at its peak and then diminish. It will be of huge help to public welfare professionals to plan the preventive measures to be taken keeping the economic balance of the country as well. Variables such as gender, geographical location, age etc. have been represented using Python and Data Visualization techniques. Time Series Forecasting techniques including Machine Learning models like Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, Polynomial Regression and Deep Learning Forecasting Model like LSTM(Long short-term memory) are deployed to study the probable hike in cases and in the near future. A comparative analysis is also done to understand which model fits the best for our data. Data is considered till 30th July, 2020. The results show that a statistical model named sigmoid model is outperforming other models. Also the Sigmoid model is giving an estimate of the day on which we can expect the number of active cases to reach its peak and also when the curve will start to flatten. Strength of Sigmoid model lies in providing a count of date that no other model offers and thus it is the best model to predict Covid cases counts: this is unique feature of analysis in this paper. Certain feature engineering techniques have been used to transfer data into logarithmic scale as is affords better comparison removing any data extremities or outliers. Based on the predictions of the short-term interval, our model can be tuned to forecast long time intervals.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"SOHINI Sengupta","author_inst":"Welingkar Institute of Management"},{"author_name":"Sareeta Mugde","author_inst":"Welingkar Institute of Management"},{"author_name":"Garima Sharma","author_inst":"Welingkar Institute of Management"},{"author_name":"Sebastian Wieczorek","author_inst":"School of Mathematical Sciences, University College Cork"},{"author_name":"Micheal O'Riordain","author_inst":"Department of Surgery, Mercy University Hospital, Cork"},{"author_name":"Philipp Hoevel","author_inst":"School of Mathematical Sciences, University College Cork"},{"author_name":"Luca Lucentini","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita'"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta Suffredini","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita'"},{"author_name":"Robert Bridger","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 306"},{"author_name":"Dan H Barouch","author_inst":"Center for Virology and Vaccine Research, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, 02215, USA"},{"author_name":"Melinda A Brindley","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Department of Population Health, Center for Vaccines and Immunology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Georgia, A"},{"author_name":"Nathan E Lewis","author_inst":"Departments of Pediatrics and Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, 92093, USA, Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosusta"},{"author_name":"Michael Tiemeyer","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 306"},{"author_name":"Bing Chen","author_inst":"Division of Molecular Medicine, Childrens Hospital and Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, 02115, USA"},{"author_name":"Robert J Woods","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 306"},{"author_name":"Lance Wells","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 306"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.25.20139931","rel_title":"Evaluation on the diagnostic efficiency of different methods in detecting COVID-19.","rel_date":"2020-06-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.25.20139931","rel_abs":"Objective: To evaluate the diagnostic efficiency of different methods in detecting COVID-19 to provide preliminary evidence on choosing favourable method for COVID-19 detection.

A significant set of patients with extra pulmonary symptoms has been reported worldwide. Neurological involvement in the form of altered mental status, loss of consciousness in considerable amounts has drawn attention of physicians all across the globe. Here we venture out to summarise the clinical profile, investigations and radiological findings among patients with SARS-CoV-2 associated meningoencephalitis in the form of a systematic review, which may aid clinicians in early diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of the disease. Methodology: This review was carried out based on the existing PRISMA (Preferred Report for Systemic Review and Meta analyses) consensus statement. The data for this review was collected from four databases: Pubmed\/Medline, NIH Litcovid, Embase and Cochrane library and Preprint servers up till 10th June, 2020. Search strategy comprised of a range of keywords from relevant medical subject headings which includes \"SARS-COV-2\", \"COVID-19\", \"meningoencephalitis\" etc. All peer reviewed, case control, case report, pre print articles satisfying our inclusion criteria were involved in the study. The inclusion prerequisites comprised of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases with neurological manifestations, previous cases of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV with neurological involvement provided all the studies were published in English language. Quantitative data was expressed in mean+\/-SD, while the qualitative date in percentages. Paired t test was used for analysing the data based on differences between mean and respective values with a p value of <0.05 considered to be statistically significant. Results: A total of 43 cases were involved from 24 studies after screening from databases and preprint servers, out of which 29 of them had completed investigation profile and were included in the final analysis. Clincial and Laboratory findings as well as neuroimaging findings (CT, MRI and MRS) revealed consistent presentations towards association of COVID-19 with meningoencephalitis. Epileptogenic pictures were also evident on EEG (electroencephalogram) findings. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated from CSF as well as cerebrum of cases with meningoencephalitis depicting the natural tendency of the virus to invade the central nervous system.

This important information provides us a unique opportunity to assess the dose-response relation of the viruses, if reasonable exposure dose could be estimated. Here we developed a simple framework to integrate the a priori dose-response relation for SARS-CoV based on mice experiments, and the recent data on infection risk and viral shedding, to shed light on the dose-response relation for human. The developed dose-response relation is an exponential function with a constant k in the range of 6.19E4 to 7.28E5 virus copies. The result mean that the infection risk caused by one virus copy in viral shedding is about 1.5E-6 to 1.6E-5.

Methods: We used mobility data from a large, anonymized sample of smartphone users to assess the relationship between neighborhood median household income and physical distancing during the COVID-19 epidemic. We assessed changes in several behaviors including: spending the day entirely at home; working outside the home; and visits to supermarkets, parks, hospitals, and other locations. We also assessed differences in effects of state policies on physical distancing across neighborhood income levels. Results: We found a strong gradient between neighborhood income and physical distancing. Compared to January and February 2020, the proportion of individuals spending the day entirely at home in April 2020 increased by 10.9 percentage points in low-income neighborhoods and by 27.1 percentage points in high-income neighborhoods. During April 2020, people in low-income neighborhoods were more likely to work outside the home, compared to people in higher-income neighborhoods, but not more likely to visit non-work locations. State physical distancing orders were associated with a 1.5 percentage-point increase (95% CI [0.9, 2.1], p < 0.001) in staying home in low-income neighborhoods and a 2.4 percentage point increase (95% CI [1.4, 3.4], p < 0.001) in high-income neighborhoods. Discussion: People in lower-income neighborhoods have faced barriers to physical distancing, particularly the need to work outside the home. State physical distancing policies have not mitigated these disparities.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jonathan Jay","author_inst":"Boston University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Jacob Bor","author_inst":"Boston University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Elaine Nsoesie","author_inst":"Boston University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Sarah Ketchen Lipson","author_inst":"Boston University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"David K Jones","author_inst":"Boston University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Sandro Galea","author_inst":"Boston University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Julia Raifman","author_inst":"Boston University School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta Suffredini","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita'"},{"author_name":"Robert Bridger","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 306"},{"author_name":"Dan H Barouch","author_inst":"Center for Virology and Vaccine Research, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, 02215, USA"},{"author_name":"Melinda A Brindley","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Department of Population Health, Center for Vaccines and Immunology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Georgia, A"},{"author_name":"Nathan E Lewis","author_inst":"Departments of Pediatrics and Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, 92093, USA, Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosusta"},{"author_name":"Michael Tiemeyer","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 306"},{"author_name":"Bing Chen","author_inst":"Division of Molecular Medicine, Childrens Hospital and Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, 02115, USA"},{"author_name":"Robert J Woods","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 306"},{"author_name":"Lance Wells","author_inst":"Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Department of Chemistry, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 306"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.26.173567","rel_title":"Adhesive Contact Between Cylindrical (Ebola) and Spherical (SARS-CoV-2) Viral Particles and a Cell Membrane","rel_date":"2020-06-26","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.26.173567","rel_abs":"A critical event during the process of cell infection by a viral particle is attachment, which is driven by adhesive interactions and resisted by bending and tension. The biophysics of this process has been studied extensively but the additional role of externally applied force or displacement has generally been neglected. In this work we study the adhesive force-displacement response of viral particles against a cell membrane. We have built two models: one in which the viral particle is cylindrical (say, representative of filamentous virus such as Ebola) and another in which it is spherical (such as SARS-CoV-2 and Zika). Our interest is in initial adhesion, in which case deformations are small and the mathematical model for the system can be simplified considerably. The parameters that characterize the process combine into two dimensionless groups that represent normalized membrane bending stiffness and tension. In the limit where bending dominates, for sufficiently large values of normalized bending stiffness, there is no adhesion between viral particles and the cell membrane without applied force. (The zero-external-force contact width and pull-off force are both zero.) For large values of normalized membrane tension, the adhesion between virus and cell membrane is weak but stable. (The contact width at zero external force has a small value.) Our results for pull-off force and zero force contact width help to quantify conditions that could aid the development of therapies based on denying the virus entry into the cell by blocking its initial adhesion.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jiajun Wang","author_inst":"Lehigh University"},{"author_name":"Nicole Fortoul","author_inst":"Lehigh University"},{"author_name":"X.

In human studies, CT prevented colds in healthy subjects and enhanced antibody production after influenza vaccination in elderly individuals with a poor nutritional status. The mechanism of action of CT is thought to be glutathione (GSH)-mediated regulation of intracellular redox, which might affect innate immune systems such as macrophages to exert physiological effects. The effect of CT on influenza is independent of viral type, and this treatment has a broad range of antiviral activities. To explore the mechanisms of CT in viral infection, we performed transcriptome profiling of spleen tissues isolated from influenza A virus (IAV)-infected mice. We identified unique gene signatures in response to CT in the IAV-infected mice. Genes upregulated by CT included redox-regulated genes such as GCLC\/GCLM (subunits of glutamate cysteine ligase, a rate-limiting enzyme of GSH biosynthesis), TXN1, TXN2, TXNRD2, and SOD1, suggesting that the intracellular redox environment is substantially altered by CT. However, genes downregulated in response to CT included chemokine\/chemokine receptor genes (CCL5, CCL19, CXCL9, CXCL12, CXCR3, CXCR4, and ACKR3), some of which are related to cytokine storm. A comparison with public COVID-19-related gene set data showed that the upregulated gene signature was highly similar to the downregulated gene sets of SARS-CoV\/SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and the upregulated gene set of attenuated SARS-CoV-infected cells. In conclusion, the unique gene signatures observed in response to orally administered CT in IAV-infected mouse spleen tissues suggested that CT may attenuate viral infection, replication and associated symptoms such as cytokine storm.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Akira Mitsui","author_inst":"Ajinomoto Co., Inc."},{"author_name":"Ryosei Sakai","author_inst":"Ajinomoto Co., Inc."},{"author_name":"Kiyoshi Miwa","author_inst":"Ajinomoto Co., Inc."},{"author_name":"Susumu Shibahara","author_inst":"Ajinomoto Co., Inc."},{"author_name":"Shigekazu Kurihara","author_inst":"Ajinomoto Co., Inc."},{"author_name":"Kenji Nagao","author_inst":"Ajinomoto Co., Inc."},{"author_name":"Rafael Rahal Guaragna Machado","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, ICB, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Douglas Sales Medina","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, ICB, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Lara Kelly Ribeiro","author_inst":"Center for the Development of Functional Materials, CDMF, Federal University of Sao Carlos, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Ieda Lucia Viana Rosa","author_inst":"Center for the Development of Functional Materials, CDMF, Federal University of Sao Carlos, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Marcelo Assis","author_inst":"Center for the Development of Functional Materials, CDMF, Federal University of Sao Carlos, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Juan Manuel Andres Bort","author_inst":"Laboratory of Theoretical and Computational Chemistry, Department of Analytical and Physical Chemistry, University Jaume I, Spain"},{"author_name":"Elson Longo","author_inst":"Center for the Development of Functional Materials, CDMF, Federal University of Sao Carlos, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Lucio H.

Here, we have characterized and compared viral populations of SARS-CoV-2 among COVID-19 patients within and across households. Our work showed an active viral replication activity in the human respiratory tract and the co-existence of genetically distinct viruses within the same host. The inter-host comparison among viral populations further revealed a narrow transmission bottleneck between patients from the same households, suggesting a dominated role of stochastic dynamics in both inter-host and intra-host evolutions.\n\nAuthor summaryIn this study, we compared SARS-CoV-2 populations of 13 Chinese COVID-19 patients. Those viral populations contained a considerable proportion of viral sub-genomic messenger RNAs (sgmRNA), reflecting an active viral replication activity in the respiratory tract tissues. The comparison of 66 identified intra-host variants further showed a low viral genetic distance between intra-household patients and a narrow transmission bottleneck size. Despite the co-existence of genetically distinct viruses within the same host, most intra-host minor variants were not shared between transmission pairs, suggesting a dominated role of stochastic dynamics in both inter-host and intra-host evolutions. Furthermore, the narrow bottleneck and active viral activity in the respiratory tract show that the passage of a small number of virions can cause infection. Our data have therefore delivered a key genomic resource for the SARS-CoV-2 transmission research and enhanced our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":30,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daxi Wang","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Yanqun Wang","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wanying Sun","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Lu Zhang","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jingkai Ji","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Zhaoyong Zhang","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xinyi Cheng","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Yimin Li","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Fei Xiao","author_inst":"The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Airu Zhu","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jiandong Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Peidi Ren","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Zhihua Ou","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Minfeng Xiao","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Min Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Ziqing Deng","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Huanzi Zhong","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Fuqiang Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Weijun Chen","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Shida Zhu","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Wenjing Wang","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Yongwei Zhang","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Xun Xu","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Xin Jin","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Jingxian Zhao","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Nanshan Zhong","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wenwei Zhang","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Jincun Zhao","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Junhua Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Yonghao Xu","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"genetics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.26.174193","rel_title":"A cytosine-to-uracil change within the programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift signal of SARS-CoV-2 results in structural similarities with the MERS-CoV signal","rel_date":"2020-06-26","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.26.174193","rel_abs":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, like many other viruses, uses programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) to enable synthesis of multiple proteins from its compact genome.

The conformationally dynamic S-protein is the primary immunogenic target of vaccine design owing to its role in host-cell fusion, displaying multiple receptor binding domain (RBD) \u2018up\u2019 and \u2018down\u2019 state configurations. Here, we investigated the potential for RBD adjacent, N-terminal domain (NTD) glycans to influence the conformational equilibrium of these RBD states. Using a combination of antigenic screens and high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination, we show that an N-glycan deletion at position 234 results in a dramatically reduced population of the \u2018up\u2019 state RBD position. Conversely, glycan deletion at position N165 results in a discernable increase in \u2018up\u2019 state RBDs. This indicates the glycan shield acts not only as a passive hinderance to antibody meditated immunity but also as a conformational control element. Together, our results demonstrate this highly dynamic conformational machine is responsive to glycan modification with implications in viral escape and vaccine design.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rory Henderson","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Robert J Edwards","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Katayoun Mansouri","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Katarzyna Janowska","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Victoria Stalls","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Megan Kopp","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Barton F Haynes","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Priyamvada Acharya","author_inst":"Duke University"},{"author_name":"Fei Xiao","author_inst":"The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Airu Zhu","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jiandong Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Peidi Ren","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Zhihua Ou","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Minfeng Xiao","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Min Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Ziqing Deng","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Huanzi Zhong","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Fuqiang Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Weijun Chen","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Shida Zhu","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Wenjing Wang","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Yongwei Zhang","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Xun Xu","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Xin Jin","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Jingxian Zhao","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Nanshan Zhong","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wenwei Zhang","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Jincun Zhao","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Junhua Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Yonghao Xu","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"biophysics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.24.20139048","rel_title":"A geotemporal survey of hospital bed saturation across England during the first wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic","rel_date":"2020-06-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.24.20139048","rel_abs":"Background: Non-pharmacological interventions were introduced based on modelling studies which suggested that the English National Health Service (NHS) would be overwhelmed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we describe the pattern of bed occupancy across England during the first wave of the pandemic, January 31st to June 5th 2020. Methods: Bed availability and occupancy data was extracted from daily reports submitted by all English secondary care providers, between 27-Mar and 5-June. Two thresholds (85% as per Royal College of Emergency Medicine and 92% as per NHS Improvement) were applied as thresholds for safe occupancy. Findings: At peak availability, there were 2711 additional beds compatible with mechanical ventilation across England, reflecting a 53% increase in capacity, and occupancy never exceeded 62%. A consequence of the repurposing of beds meant that at the trough, there were 8.7% (8,508) fewer general and acute (G&A) beds across England, but occupancy never exceeded 72%. The closest to (surge) capacity that any trust in England reached was 99.8% for general and acute beds. For beds compatible with mechanical ventilation there were 326 trust-days (3.7%) spent above 85% of surge capacity, and 154 trust-days (1.8%) spent above 92%. 23 trusts spent a cumulative 81 days at 100% saturation of their surge ventilator bed capacity (median number of days per trust = 1 [range: 1 to 17]). However, only 3 STPs (aggregates of geographically co-located trusts) reached 100% saturation of their mechanical ventilation beds. Interpretation: Throughout the first wave of the pandemic, an adequate supply of all bed-types existed at a national level. Due to an unequal distribution of bed utilization, many trusts spent a significant period operating above safe occupancy thresholds, despite substantial capacity in geographically co-located trusts; a key operational issue to address in preparing for a potential second wave. Funding: This study received no funding.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bilal A Mateen","author_inst":"The Alan Turing Institute; University of Warwick; Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"},{"author_name":"Harrison Wilde","author_inst":"University of Warwick, Department of Statistics"},{"author_name":"John m Dennis","author_inst":"University of Exeter Medical School"},{"author_name":"Andrew Duncan","author_inst":"The Alan Turing Institute; Imperial College London, Faculty of Natural Sciences"},{"author_name":"Nicholas John Meyrick Thomas","author_inst":"University of Exeter Medical School"},{"author_name":"Andrew P McGovern","author_inst":"Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust, Diabetes and Endocrinology; University of Exeter Medical School"},{"author_name":"Spiros Denaxas","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Matt J Keeling","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Sebastian J Vollmer","author_inst":"The Alan Turing Institute; University of Warwick, Department of Statistics"},{"author_name":"Airu Zhu","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Jiandong Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Peidi Ren","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Zhihua Ou","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Minfeng Xiao","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Min Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Ziqing Deng","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Huanzi Zhong","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Fuqiang Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Weijun Chen","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Shida Zhu","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Wenjing Wang","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Yongwei Zhang","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Xun Xu","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Xin Jin","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Jingxian Zhao","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Nanshan Zhong","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wenwei Zhang","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Jincun Zhao","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Junhua Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Yonghao Xu","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health systems and quality improvement"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.24.20138941","rel_title":"Co-occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 and Respiratory Pathogens in the Frail Elderly","rel_date":"2020-06-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.24.20138941","rel_abs":"Background: Elderly SARS-CoV-2 patients are associated with higher hospitalization and mortality. Co-infection is critical in the severity of respiratory diseases. It is largely understudied for SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Between March 24th and April 27th, 2020, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs from 3,348 patients from nursing homes and assisted living facilities in 22 states in the US were tested by Capstone Healthcare for SARS-CoV-2, 24 other respiratory viruses, and 8 respiratory bacteria. Total nucleic acid was extracted with MagMAXTM Viral\/Pathogen Ultra nucleic acid isolation kit. SARS-Co-V-2 was detected with the CDC 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) diagnostic panel. Total nucleic acid was pre-amplified before analysis for other respiratory pathogens with Taqman OpenArrayTM Respiratory Tract Microbiota Plate. Results: Patients mean age was 76.9 years. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 1,413 patients (42.2%). Among them, 1,082 (76.6%) and 737 (43.7%) patients were detected with at least one bacterium or another virus, respectively. SARS-CoV-2-positive patients were more likely to have bacterial co-occurrences (76.6%) than SARS-CoV-2-negative patients (70.0%) (p<0.0001). The most common co-occurring bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumonia, detected in 55.8% and 40.1% SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, respectively. Staphylococcus aureus was associated with SARS-CoV-2, with higher detection rates in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients (55.8%) than SARS-CoV-2-negative patients (46.2%) (p<0.0001). Human herpes virus 6 (HHV6) also was common and associated with SARS-CoV-2, with higher detection rates in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients (26.6%) than SARS-CoV-2-negative patients (19.1%) (p<0.0001). Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2-positive patients are more likely to be positive for certain respiratory bacteria and viruses. This observation may help explain high hospitalization and mortality rates in older patients.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David Baunoch","author_inst":"Pathnostics"},{"author_name":"Alan Wolfe","author_inst":"Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Dakun Wang","author_inst":"Stat4ward"},{"author_name":"Ryan Gnewuch","author_inst":"Pathnostics"},{"author_name":"Xinhua Zhao","author_inst":"Stat4ward"},{"author_name":"Thomas Halverson","author_inst":"Loyola University Chicago"},{"author_name":"Patrick Cacdac","author_inst":"Pathnostics"},{"author_name":"Shuguang Huang","author_inst":"Stat4ward"},{"author_name":"Trisha Lauterbach","author_inst":"Capstone Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Natalie Luke","author_inst":"Pathnostics"},{"author_name":"Jiandong Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Peidi Ren","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Zhihua Ou","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Minfeng Xiao","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Min Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Ziqing Deng","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Huanzi Zhong","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Fuqiang Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Weijun Chen","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Shida Zhu","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Wenjing Wang","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Yongwei Zhang","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Xun Xu","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Xin Jin","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Jingxian Zhao","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Nanshan Zhong","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wenwei Zhang","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Jincun Zhao","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Junhua Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Yonghao Xu","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.24.20138982","rel_title":"Modeling the Covid-19 Pandemic Response of the US States","rel_date":"2020-06-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.24.20138982","rel_abs":"Background: The United States of America (USA) has been the country worst affected, in absolute terms, by the Covid-19 pandemic. The country comprises 50 states under a federal system. The impact of the pandemic has resulted in different responses at the state level, which are driven by differing intervention policies, demographics, connectedness and other factors. Understanding the dynamics of the Covid-19 pandemic at the state level is essential in predicting its future evolution. Objective: Our objective is to identify and characterize multiple waves of the pandemic by analyzing the reported infected population curve in each of the 50 US states. Based on the intensity of the waves, characterized by declining, stationary, or increasing strengths, each state's response can be inferred and quantified. Methods: We apply a recently proposed multiple-wave model to fit the infected population data for each state in USA, and use the proposed Pandemic Response Index to quantify their response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Results: We have analyzed reported infected cases from each one of the 50 USA states and the District of Columbia, based on the multiple-wave model, and present the relevant parameters. Multiple waves have been identified and this model is found to describe the data better. Each of the states can be classified into one of three distinct classes characterized by declining, increasing, or stationary strength of the waves following the initial one. The effectiveness of intervention measures can be inferred by the peak intensities of the waves, and states with similar population characteristics can be directly compared. We estimate how much lower the number of infections might have been, if early and strict intervention measures had been imposed to stop the disease spread at the first wave, as was the case for certain states. Based on our model's results, we compute the value of the Pandemic Response Index, a recently introduced metric for quantifying in an objective manner the response to the pandemic. Conclusions: Our results reveal a series of epidemic waves, characterizing USA's pandemic response at the state level, and also infer to what extent the imposition of early intervention measures could have had on the spread and impact of the disease. As of June 11, 2020, only 19 states and the District of Columbia (40% of the total) clearly exhibit declining trends in the numbers of reported infected cases, while 13 states exhibit stationary and 18 states increasing trends in the numbers of reported cases.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Georgios Neofotistos","author_inst":"Institute for Applied Computational Science (IACS),  John A.

Deaths in both Sweden and England and Wales peaked on 8 April. The build up to the peak was very similar in both.

We estimate that to 7 August, lockdown saved 17,700 lives in England and Wales, or just under 20,000 extrapolating to a UK level.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rickard Bengt Emanuel Nyman","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Paul Ormerod","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Dakun Wang","author_inst":"Stat4ward"},{"author_name":"Ryan Gnewuch","author_inst":"Pathnostics"},{"author_name":"Xinhua Zhao","author_inst":"Stat4ward"},{"author_name":"Thomas Halverson","author_inst":"Loyola University Chicago"},{"author_name":"Patrick Cacdac","author_inst":"Pathnostics"},{"author_name":"Shuguang Huang","author_inst":"Stat4ward"},{"author_name":"Trisha Lauterbach","author_inst":"Capstone Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Natalie Luke","author_inst":"Pathnostics"},{"author_name":"Jiandong Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Peidi Ren","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Zhihua Ou","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Minfeng Xiao","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Min Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Ziqing Deng","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Huanzi Zhong","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Fuqiang Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Weijun Chen","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Shida Zhu","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Wenjing Wang","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Yongwei Zhang","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Xun Xu","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Xin Jin","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Jingxian Zhao","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Nanshan Zhong","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wenwei Zhang","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Jincun Zhao","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Junhua Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Yonghao Xu","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.24.20139014","rel_title":"Strategies for Controlling the Spread of COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-06-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.24.20139014","rel_abs":"We consider a deterministic epidemiological compartmental model that includes age and social contact structure for the COVID-19 crisis and explore the consequences of different strategies for easing current lockdown measures that are in place in many countries.

To lessen the global health consequences of COVID-19, sweeping COVID-19 lockdown and quarantine measures have been imposed within many nations. These measures have significantly impacted the world's economy and in many cases has led to the loss of livelihood. Mathematical modeling of pandemics is of critical importance to understand the unfolding of transmission events and to formulate control measures. In this research letter, we have introduced a novel approach to forecasting epidemics like COVID-19. The proposed mathematical model stems from the fundamental principles of fluid dynamics, and can be utilized to make projections of the number of infected people. This unique mathematical model can be beneficial for predicting and designing potential strategies to mitigate the spread and impact of pandemics.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Harris Rabbani","author_inst":"Texas A&M University at Qatar"},{"author_name":"Kofi Osei-Bonsu","author_inst":"Beekin Inc"},{"author_name":"Peter Kwame Osei-Bonsu","author_inst":"Aberdeen Royal Infirmary"},{"author_name":"Thomas Daniel Seers","author_inst":"Texas A&M University at Qatar"},{"author_name":"Xinhua Zhao","author_inst":"Stat4ward"},{"author_name":"Thomas Halverson","author_inst":"Loyola University Chicago"},{"author_name":"Patrick Cacdac","author_inst":"Pathnostics"},{"author_name":"Shuguang Huang","author_inst":"Stat4ward"},{"author_name":"Trisha Lauterbach","author_inst":"Capstone Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Natalie Luke","author_inst":"Pathnostics"},{"author_name":"Jiandong Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Peidi Ren","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Zhihua Ou","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Minfeng Xiao","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Min Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Ziqing Deng","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Huanzi Zhong","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Fuqiang Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Weijun Chen","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Shida Zhu","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Wenjing Wang","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Yongwei Zhang","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Xun Xu","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Xin Jin","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Jingxian Zhao","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Nanshan Zhong","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wenwei Zhang","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Jincun Zhao","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Junhua Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Yonghao Xu","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.24.20138990","rel_title":"Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite...

We investigate the extent to which this event contributed to the COVID-19 epidemics in France. To this end, we first predict each departement's own dynamics using information up to the election to calibrate a standard logistic model. We then take advantage of electoral turnout differences between departements to distinguish the impact of the election on prediction errors in hospitalizations from that of simultaneously implemented anti-contagion policies. We report a detrimental effect of the election in locations that were at relatively advanced stages of the epidemics by the time of the election. In contrast, we show that the election did not contribute to the epidemics in departements with lower infection levels by March 15. All in all, our estimates suggest that elections accounted for about 4,000 excess hospitalizations by the end of March, which represents 15% of all hospitalizations by this time. They also suggest that holding elections in June may not be as detrimental.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guilhem Cassan","author_inst":"University of Namur"},{"author_name":"Marc Sangnier","author_inst":"University of Namur, Aix-Marseille University"},{"author_name":"Peter Kwame Osei-Bonsu","author_inst":"Aberdeen Royal Infirmary"},{"author_name":"Thomas Daniel Seers","author_inst":"Texas A&M University at Qatar"},{"author_name":"Xinhua Zhao","author_inst":"Stat4ward"},{"author_name":"Thomas Halverson","author_inst":"Loyola University Chicago"},{"author_name":"Patrick Cacdac","author_inst":"Pathnostics"},{"author_name":"Shuguang Huang","author_inst":"Stat4ward"},{"author_name":"Trisha Lauterbach","author_inst":"Capstone Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Natalie Luke","author_inst":"Pathnostics"},{"author_name":"Jiandong Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Peidi Ren","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Zhihua Ou","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Minfeng Xiao","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Min Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Ziqing Deng","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Huanzi Zhong","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Fuqiang Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Weijun Chen","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Shida Zhu","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Wenjing Wang","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Yongwei Zhang","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Xun Xu","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Xin Jin","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Jingxian Zhao","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Nanshan Zhong","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wenwei Zhang","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Jincun Zhao","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Junhua Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Yonghao Xu","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.24.20138925","rel_title":"IMPACT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON MENTAL HEALTH OF MEDICAL STUDENTS:A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY USING GAD-7 AND PHQ-9 QUESTIONNAIRES","rel_date":"2020-06-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.24.20138925","rel_abs":"Aim: to evaluate anxiety and depression disorders among medical students during COVID-19 pandemic.

The global impact of COVID-19 has resulted in a surge of related research. Researchers have turned to social media platforms, namely Twitter, to disseminate their articles. The online database Altmetric is a tool which tracks the social media metrics of articles and is complementary to traditional, citation-based metrics. Citation-based metrics may fail to portray dissemination accurately, due to the lengthy publication process. Altmetrics are not subject to this time-lag, suggesting that they may be an effective marker of research dissemination during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objectives: To assess the dissemination of COVID-19 articles as measured by Twitter dissemination, compared to traditional citation-based metrics, and determine article characteristics associated with tweet rates. Methods: COVID-19 articles obtained from LitCovid published between January 1st to March 18th, 2020 were screened for inclusion. The following article characteristics were extracted independently, in single: Topic (General Info, Mechanism, Diagnosis, Transmission, Treatment, Prevention, Case Report, and Epidemic Forecasting), open access status (open access and subscription-based), continent of corresponding author (Asia, Australia, Africa, North America, South America, and Europe), tweets, and citations. A sign test was used to compare the tweet rate and citation rate per day. A negative binomial regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the association between tweet rate and article characteristics of interest. Results: 1328 articles were included in the analysis. Tweet rates were found to be significantly higher than citation rates for COVID-19 articles, with a median tweet rate of 1.09 (IQR 6.83) tweets per day and median citation rate of 0.00 (IQR 0.00) citations per day, resulting in a median of differences of 1.09 (95% CI 0.86-1.33, P < .001). 2018 journal impact factors were positively correlated with tweet rate (P < .001). The topics Diagnosis (P = .01), Transmission (P < .001), Treatment (P = .01), and Epidemic Forecasting (P < .001) were positively correlated with tweet rate, relative to Case Report. The following continents of the corresponding author were negatively correlated with tweet rate, Africa (P < .001), Australia (P = .03), and South America (P < .001), relative to Asia. Open access journals were negatively correlated with tweet rate, relative to subscription-based journals (P < .001). Conclusions: COVID-19 articles had significantly higher tweets rates compared to citation rates. This study further identified article characteristics that are correlated with the dissemination of articles on Twitter, such as 2018 journal impact factor, continent of the corresponding author, topic, and open access status.

Because SARS-CoV-2 can spread from individuals with pre-symptomatic, symptomatic, and asymptomatic infections, the re-opening of societies and the control of virus spread will be facilitated by robust surveillance, for which virus testing will often be central. After infection, individuals undergo a period of incubation during which viral titers are usually too low to detect, followed by an exponential viral growth, leading to a peak viral load and infectiousness, and ending with declining viral levels and clearance. Given the pattern of viral load kinetics, we model surveillance effectiveness considering test sensitivities, frequency, and sample-to-answer reporting time. These results demonstrate that effective surveillance depends largely on frequency of testing and the speed of reporting, and is only marginally improved by high test sensitivity. We therefore conclude that surveillance should prioritize accessibility, frequency, and sample-to-answer time; analytical limits of detection should be secondary.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel B Larremore","author_inst":"University of Colorado Boulder"},{"author_name":"Bryan Wilder","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Evan Lester","author_inst":"University of Colorado Boulder"},{"author_name":"Soraya Shehata","author_inst":"University of Colorado Boulder"},{"author_name":"James M Burke","author_inst":"University of Colorado Boulder"},{"author_name":"James A Hay","author_inst":"Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Milind Tambe","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Michael J Mina","author_inst":"Harvard School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Roy Parker","author_inst":"University of Colorado Boulder"},{"author_name":"Natalie Luke","author_inst":"Pathnostics"},{"author_name":"Jiandong Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Peidi Ren","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Zhihua Ou","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Minfeng Xiao","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Min Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Ziqing Deng","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Huanzi Zhong","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Fuqiang Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Weijun Chen","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Shida Zhu","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Wenjing Wang","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Yongwei Zhang","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Xun Xu","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Xin Jin","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Jingxian Zhao","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Nanshan Zhong","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wenwei Zhang","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Jincun Zhao","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Junhua Li","author_inst":"BGI"},{"author_name":"Yonghao Xu","author_inst":"First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.06.24.20139006","rel_title":"Evaluation of two commercial and two non-commercial immunoassays for the detection of prior infection to SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-06-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.06.24.20139006","rel_abs":"Background Seroepidemiology is an important tool to characterize the epidemiology and immunobiology of SARS-CoV-2 but many immunoassays have not been externally validated raising questions about reliability of study findings. To ensure meaningful data, particularly in a low seroprevalence population, assays need to be rigorously characterized with high specificity. Methods We evaluated two commercial (Roche Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics IgM\/IgG) and two non-commercial (Simoa and Ragon\/MGH IgG) immunoassays against 68 confirmed positive and 232 pre-pandemic negative controls. Sensitivity was stratified by time from symptom onset. The Simoa multiplex assay applied three pre-defined algorithm models to determine sample result. Results The Roche and Ragon\/MGH IgG assays each registered 1\/232 false positive, the primary Simoa model registered 2\/232 false positives, and the Epitope registered 2\/230 and 3\/230 false positives for the IgG and IgM assays respectively. Sensitivity >21 days post symptom-onset was 100% for all assays except Epitope IgM, but lower and\/or with greater variability between assays for samples collected 9-14 days (67-100%) and 15-21 days (69-100%) post-symptom onset. The Simoa and Epitope IgG assays demonstrated excellent sensitivity earlier in the disease course. The Roche and Ragon\/MGH IgG assays were less sensitive during early disease, particularly among immunosuppressed individuals. Conclusions The Epitope IgG demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity. The Roche and Ragon\/MGH IgG assays registered rare false positives with lower early sensitivity. The Simoa assay primary model had excellent sensitivity and few false positives.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eric J.
