Here, we developed machine learning approaches to identify key pathogenic regions in coronavirus genomes. We trained and evaluated 7,562,625 models on 3,665 genomes including SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses of human and animal origins to return quantitative and biologically interpretable signatures at nucleotide and amino acid resolutions. We identified hotspots across the SARS-CoV-2 genome including previously unappreciated features in spike, RdRp and other proteins. Finally, we integrated pathogenicity genomic profiles with B cell and T cell epitope predictions for enrichment of sequence targets to help guide vaccine development. These results provide a systematic map of predicted pathogenicity in SARS-CoV-2 that incorporates sequence, structural and immunological features, providing an unbiased collection of genetic elements for functional studies. This metavirome-based framework can also be applied for rapid characterization of new coronavirus strains or emerging pathogenic viruses.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jonathan J Park","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Sidi Chen","author_inst":"Yale University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.13.243303","rel_title":"Furin cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 Spike promotes but is not essential for infection and cell-cell fusion","rel_date":"2020-08-14","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.13.243303","rel_abs":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects cells by binding to the host cell receptor Ace2 and undergoing virus-host membrane fusion. Fusion is triggered by the protease TMPRSS2, which processes the viral Spike (S) protein to reveal the fusion peptide. SARS-CoV-2 has evolved a multibasic site at the S1-S2 boundary, which is thought to be cleaved by furin in order to prime S protein for TMPRSS2 processing. Here we show that CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of furin reduces, but does not prevent, the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus. Comparing S processing in furin knockout cells to multibasic site mutants reveals that while loss of furin substantially reduces S1-S2 cleavage it does not prevent it. SARS-CoV-2 S protein also mediates cell-cell fusion, potentially allowing virus to spread virion-independently. We show that loss of furin in either donor or acceptor cells reduces, but does not prevent, TMPRSS2-dependent cell-cell fusion, unlike mutation of the multibasic site that completely prevents syncytia formation. Our results show that while furin promotes both SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and cell-cell spread it is not essential, suggesting furin inhibitors will not prevent viral spread.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guido Papa","author_inst":"MRC-Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Donna Mallery","author_inst":"MRC-Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Anna Albecka","author_inst":"MRC-Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Lawrence Welch","author_inst":"MRC-Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Jerome Cattin-Ortola","author_inst":"MRC-Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Jakub Luptak","author_inst":"MRC-Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"David Paul","author_inst":"MRC-Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Harvey T McMahon","author_inst":"MRC-Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK"},{"author_name":"Ian G.

Predeparture serological and viral RT-PCR testing along with repeat testing after return to shore was available for 120 of the 122 persons on board over a median follow-up of 32.5 days (range 18.8 to 50.5 days). A total of 104 individuals had an RT-PCR positive viral test with Ct <35 or seroconverted during the follow-up period, yielding an attack rate on board of 85.2% (104\/122 individuals). Metagenomic sequencing of 39 viral genomes suggested the outbreak originated largely from a single viral clade. Only three crewmembers tested seropositive prior to the boat's departure in initial serological screening and also had neutralizing and spike-reactive antibodies in follow-up assays. None of these crewmembers with neutralizing antibody titers showed evidence of bona fide viral infection or experienced any symptoms during the viral outbreak. Therefore, the presence of neutralizing antibodies from prior infection was significantly associated with protection against re-infection (Fisher's exact test, p=0.002).","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amin Addetia","author_inst":"University of  Washington"},{"author_name":"Katharine HD Crawford","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Adam Dingens","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Haiying Zhu","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Pavitra Roychoudhury","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Meeili Huang","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Keith R Jerome","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jesse D Bloom","author_inst":"FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER"},{"author_name":"Alexander Greninger","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Richard Pinapati","author_inst":"Nimble Therapeutics Inc, Madison, WI 53719, United States"},{"author_name":"Eric Sullivan","author_inst":"Nimble Therapeutics Inc, Madison, WI 53719, United States"},{"author_name":"Adrian Caciula","author_inst":"Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Rafal Tokarz","author_inst":"Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Thomas Briese","author_inst":"Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Jiahai Lu","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China"},{"author_name":"W.

Previously, a few articles have been published with regard to COVID-19 suicides in Bangladesh. However, all these articles talked about sporadic cases of suicides with no clear picture of the holistic overview of suicides in Bangladesh. Herein, we looked into all COVID-19 suicide cases from March 01, 2020, to July 31, 2020, as reported in Bangladeshi media. Our study also reports the risk factors contributing to suicidal incidents. Moreover, we also identified the impact of gender, profession, and COVID-19 diagnosis status on committing suicide. This study will shed light on the topic with a clear understanding of the causalities influencing individuals to suicide. Furthermore, it will help the policymakers to take necessary actions to prevent any further suicides.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sadia Noosrat Boshra","author_inst":"Pharmaceutical professional based on Mohammadpur, Dhaka-1207, Bangladesh; Registered Pharmacist, Pharmacy Council of Bangladesh, Dhaka-1000, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Mohiminul Islam","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee"},{"author_name":"Adam Dingens","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Haiying Zhu","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Pavitra Roychoudhury","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Meeili Huang","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Keith R Jerome","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jesse D Bloom","author_inst":"FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER"},{"author_name":"Alexander Greninger","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Richard Pinapati","author_inst":"Nimble Therapeutics Inc, Madison, WI 53719, United States"},{"author_name":"Eric Sullivan","author_inst":"Nimble Therapeutics Inc, Madison, WI 53719, United States"},{"author_name":"Adrian Caciula","author_inst":"Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Rafal Tokarz","author_inst":"Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Thomas Briese","author_inst":"Center for Infection and Immunity, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Jiahai Lu","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China"},{"author_name":"W.

We investigated phenotypic and genetic factors associated with subcutaneous adipose tissue expression of Angiotensin I Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), which has been shown to act as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry. In a meta-analysis of three independent studies including up to 1,471 participants, lower adipose tissue ACE2 expression was associated with adverse cardio-metabolic health indices including type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity status, higher serum fasting insulin and BMI, and lower serum HDL levels (P<5.32x10-4). ACE2 expression levels were also associated with estimated proportions of cell types in adipose tissue; lower ACE2 expression was associated with a lower proportion of microvascular endothelial cells (P=4.25x10-4) and higher macrophage proportion (P=2.74x10-5), suggesting a link to inflammation. Despite an estimated heritability of 32%, we did not identify any proximal or distal genetic variants (eQTLs) associated with adipose tissue ACE2 expression. Our results demonstrate that at-risk individuals have lower background ACE2 levels in this highly relevant tissue. Further studies will be required to establish how this may contribute to increased COVID-19 severity.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Julia Sarah El-Sayed Moustafa","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Anne U.

The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the essential role these functions have to preserve public health. Syndromic surveillance, electronic laboratory reporting in the meaningful use program, and the growth of the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) have created linkages between hospitals, commercial labs, and public health that can collect and organize data, often through EHR and order workflows, to improve the timeliness and completeness of reporting. In theory, the standard data formats and exchange methods provided by meaningful use should enable rapid healthcare data exchange in the setting of disruptive healthcare events like a pandemic. In reality, access to data remains challenging, and even if available, often lack conformity to regulated standards. Objective: We sought to use regulated interoperability standards already in production to generate regional bed capacity awareness, enhance the capture of epidemiological risk factors and clinical variables among COVID-19 tested patients, and reduce the administrative burden of reporting for stakeholders in a manner that could be replicated by other public health agencies. Methods: Following a public health order mandating data submission, we developed technical infrastructure to combine multiple data feeds from electronic health record systems. We measured the completeness of each feed, and the match rate between feeds. Results: A cloud-based environment was created that received data from electronic lab reporting, consolidated clinical data architecture, and bed capacity data feeds from sites. Data governance was planned from the project beginning to aid in consensus and principles for data use. 88,906 total persons from CCDA data among 14 facilities, and 408,741 persons from ELR records among 88 facilities, were submitted. Fields routinely absent from ELR feeds included travel histories, clinical symptoms, and comorbidities. CCDA data provided an improvement in the quality of data available for surveillance and was highly complete with <5% for all records types with the exception of patient cell phone. 90.1% of records could be matched between CCDA and ELR feeds. Conclusions: We describe the development of a city-wide public health data hub for the surveillance of COVID-19 infection. We were able to assess the completeness of existing ELR feeds, augment these feeds with CCDA documents, establish secure transfer methods for data exchange, develop cloud-based architecture to enable secure data storage and analytics, and produced meaningful dashboards for the monitoring of capacity and disease burden. We see this public health and clinical data registry as an informative example of the power of common standards across electronic records, and a potential template for future extension of the use of standards to improve public health surveillance.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bala Hota","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Paul Casey","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Anne F McIntyre","author_inst":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Jawad Khan","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Shafiq Rab","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Aneesh Chopra","author_inst":"CareJourney"},{"author_name":"Omar Lateef","author_inst":"Rush University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jennifer E Layden","author_inst":"Chicago Department of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Michael R Erdos","author_inst":"National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Narisu Narisu","author_inst":"National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Heather M.

Logistic Regression with L1 regularization (LASSO) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models were trained using local data at each site, a pooled model with combined data from all five sites, and a federated model that only shared parameters with a central aggregator.

In light of the recent pandemic, we use Google Search data to explore online interest about COVID-19 and related topics in 20 countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. Method: Data from Google Trends from 2019\/12\/30 to 2020\/04\/25 regarding COVID-19 and other related topics were retrieved and correlated with official data on COVID-19 cases and with national epidemiological indicators. Results: The Latin American and Caribbean countries with the most interest for COVID-19 were Peru (100%) and Panama (98.39%). No correlation was found between this interest and national epidemiological indicators. The global and local response time were 20.2{+\/-}1.2 days and 16.7{+\/-}15 days, respectively. The duration of public attention was 64.8{+\/-}12.5 days. The most popular topics related to COVID-19 were: the country's situation (100{+\/-}0) and coronavirus symptoms (36.82{+\/-}16.16). Most countries showed a strong or moderated (r=0.72) significant correlation between searches related to COVID-19 and daily new cases. In addition, the highest significant lag correlation was found on day 13.35{+\/-}5.76 (r=0.79). Conclusions: Interest shown by Latin American and Caribbean countries for COVID-19 was high. The degree of online interest in a country does not clearly reflect the magnitude of their epidemiological indicators. The response time and the lag correlation were greater than in European and Asian countries. Little interest was found for preventive measures. Strong correlation between searches for COVID-19 and daily new cases suggests a predictive utility that should be investigated by further studies.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carlos Jes\u00fas Arag\u00f3n-Ayala","author_inst":"Universidad Nacional de San Agust&iacuten de Arequipa, Arequipa, Peru"},{"author_name":"Julissa Copa-Uscamayta","author_inst":"Universidad Nacional de San Agust\u00edn de Arequipa, Arequipa, Peru"},{"author_name":"Luis Herrera","author_inst":"Universidad Nacional de San Agust\u00edn de Arequipa, Arequipa, Peru"},{"author_name":"Frank Zela-Coila","author_inst":"Universidad Nacional de San Agust\u00edn de Arequipa, Arequipa, Peru"},{"author_name":"Cender U Quispe-Juli","author_inst":"Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Peru"},{"author_name":"Samuel Lee","author_inst":"The Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA; The Mount Sinai COVID Informatics Center"},{"author_name":"Sulaiman Somani","author_inst":"The Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA; The Mount Sinai COVID Informatics Center"},{"author_name":"Ishan Paranjpe","author_inst":"The Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA; The Mount Sinai COVID Informatics Center"},{"author_name":"Jessica K De Freitas","author_inst":"The Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA; The Mount Sinai COVID Informatics Center"},{"author_name":"Tingyi Wanyan","author_inst":"The Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA; Intelligent System Engineering, Indiana "},{"author_name":"Kipp W Johnson","author_inst":"The Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA; The Mount Sinai COVID Informatics Center"},{"author_name":"Mesude Bicak","author_inst":"The Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA; The Mount Sinai COVID Informatics Center"},{"author_name":"Eyal Klang","author_inst":"Institute for Healthcare Delivery Science, Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA."},{"author_name":"Young Joon Kwon","author_inst":"Department of Neurological Surgery, Icahn School of Medicine, New York, USA."},{"author_name":"Anthony Costa","author_inst":"Department of Neurological Surgery, Icahn School of Medicine, New York, USA."},{"author_name":"Shan Zhao","author_inst":"The Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA; Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperat"},{"author_name":"Riccardo Miotto","author_inst":"The Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA; Department of Genetics and Genomic Scien"},{"author_name":"Alexander W Charney","author_inst":"The Mount Sinai COVID Informatics Center, New York, USA; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA."},{"author_name":"Erwin B\u00f6ttinger","author_inst":"The Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA; The Mount Sinai COVID Informatics Center"},{"author_name":"Zahi A Fayad","author_inst":"The BioMedical Engineering and Imaging Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA; Department of Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at M"},{"author_name":"Girish N Nadkarni","author_inst":"The Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA; The Mount Sinai COVID Informatics Center"},{"author_name":"Fei Wang","author_inst":"Department of Population Health Sciences.

However, in Texas for instance, 63% of diagnosed cases are currently under 50, compared to only 52% nationally in March-April. Current demographics in Arizona and Florida are similar. Therefore, whether decreasing Covid-19 mortality rates are a reflection of changing demographics or represent improvements in clinical care is unknown. We assessed outcomes over time in a single health system, accounting for changes in demographics and clinical factors. Methods We analyzed biweekly mortality rates for admissions between March 1 and June 20, 2020 in a single health system in New York City. Outcomes were obtained as of July 14, 2020. We included all hospitalizations with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 disease. Patients with multiple hospitalizations (N=157, 3.3%) were included repeatedly if they continued to have laboratory-confirmed disease. Mortality was defined as in-hospital death or discharge to hospice care. Based on prior literature, we constructed a multivariable logistic regression model to generate expected risk of death, adjusting for age; sex; self-reported race and ethnicity; body mass index; smoking history; presence of hypertension, heart failure, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, diabetes, cancer, chronic kidney disease, or pulmonary disease individually as dummy variables; and admission oxygen saturation, D-dimer, C reactive protein, ferritin, and cycle threshold for RNA detection. All data were obtained from the electronic health record. We then calculated the sum of observed and expected deaths in each two-week period and multiplied each period's observed\/expected (O\/E) risk by the overall average crude mortality to generate biweekly adjusted rates. We calculated Poisson control limits and indicated points outside the control limits as significantly different, following statistical process control standards. The NYU institutional review board approved the study and granted a waiver of consent. Results We included 4,689 hospitalizations, of which 4,661 (99.4%) had died or been discharged. The median age, and the proportion male or with any comorbidity decreased over time; median real-time PCR cycle threshold increased (indicating relatively less concentration of virus) (Table). For instance, median age decreased from 67 years in the first two weeks to 49 in the last two. Peak hospitalizations were during the fifth and sixth study weeks, which accounted for 40% of the hospitalizations. Median length of stay for patients who died or were discharged to hospice was 8 days (interquartile range, 4-16). Unadjusted mortality dropped each period, from 30.2% in the first two weeks to 3% in the last two weeks, with the last eight weeks being lower than the 95% control limits. Risk adjustment partially attenuated the mortality decline, but adjusted mortality rates in the second-to-last two weeks remained outside the control limits (Figure, Table). The O\/E risk of mortality decreased from 1.07 (0.64-1.67) in the first two weeks to 0.39 (0.08-1.12) in the last two weeks. Discussion In this 16-week study of Covid-19 mortality at a single health system, we found that changes in demographics and severity of illness at presentation account for some, but not all, of the decrease in unadjusted mortality. Even after risk adjustment for a variety of clinical and demographic factors, mortality was significantly lower towards the end of the study period. Incremental improvements in outcomes are likely a combination of increasing clinical experience, decreasing hospital volume, growing use of new pharmacologic treatments (such as corticosteroids, remdesivir and anti-cytokine treatments), non-pharmacologic treatments (such as proning), earlier intervention, community awareness, and lower viral load exposure from increasing mask wearing and social distancing. It is also possible that earlier periods had a more virulent circulating strain. In summary, data from one health system suggest that Covid-19 remains a serious disease for high risk patients, but that outcomes may be improving.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Leora Horwitz","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Simon A.

We aimed to develop a risk score to identify patients with increased risk of COVID-19, allowing proper identification and allocation of limited resources. A retrospective study was conducted of 338 patients who were admitted to the hospital from the emergency room and tested for COVID-19 at an acute care hospital in the Metropolitan Washington D.C. area. The dataset was split into development and validation sets with a ratio of 6:4. Demographics, presenting symptoms, sick contact, triage vital signs, initial laboratory and chest X-ray results were analyzed to develop a prediction model for COVID-19 diagnosis. Multivariable logistic regression was performed in a stepwise fashion to develop a prediction model, and a scoring system was created based on the coefficients of the final model. Among 338 patients admitted to the hospital from the emergency room, 136 (40.2%) patients tested positive for COVID-19 and 202 (59.8%) patients tested negative. Nursing facility residence (2 points), sick contact (2 points), constitutional symptom (1 point), respiratory symptom (1 point), gastrointestinal symptom (1 point), obesity (1 point), hypoxia at triage (1 point), and leukocytosis (-1 point) were included in the prediction score. A risk score for COVID-19 diagnosis achieved AUROC of 0.87 (95% CI 0.83-0.92) in the development dataset and 0.83 (95% CI 0.76-0.90) in the validation dataset. A risk prediction score for COVID-19 can be used as a supplemental tool to assist clinical decision to triage, test, and quarantine patients admitted to the hospital from the emergency room.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joowhan Sung","author_inst":"MedStar Southern Maryland Hospital Center"},{"author_name":"Naveed Choudry","author_inst":"MedStar Southern Maryland Hospital Center"},{"author_name":"Rima Bachour","author_inst":"MedStar Southern Maryland Hospital Center"},{"author_name":"Fritz Francois","author_inst":"NYU Grossman School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Joseph Greco","author_inst":"NYU Winthrop Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bret Rudy","author_inst":"NYU Langone Hospital - Brooklyn"},{"author_name":"Christopher M Petrilli","author_inst":"NYU Langone Health"},{"author_name":"Ishan Paranjpe","author_inst":"The Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA; The Mount Sinai COVID Informatics Center"},{"author_name":"Jessica K De Freitas","author_inst":"The Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA; The Mount Sinai COVID Informatics Center"},{"author_name":"Tingyi Wanyan","author_inst":"The Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA; Intelligent System Engineering, Indiana "},{"author_name":"Kipp W Johnson","author_inst":"The Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA; The Mount Sinai COVID Informatics Center"},{"author_name":"Mesude Bicak","author_inst":"The Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA; The Mount Sinai COVID Informatics Center"},{"author_name":"Eyal Klang","author_inst":"Institute for Healthcare Delivery Science, Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA."},{"author_name":"Young Joon Kwon","author_inst":"Department of Neurological Surgery, Icahn School of Medicine, New York, USA."},{"author_name":"Anthony Costa","author_inst":"Department of Neurological Surgery, Icahn School of Medicine, New York, USA."},{"author_name":"Shan Zhao","author_inst":"The Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA; Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperat"},{"author_name":"Riccardo Miotto","author_inst":"The Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA; Department of Genetics and Genomic Scien"},{"author_name":"Alexander W Charney","author_inst":"The Mount Sinai COVID Informatics Center, New York, USA; Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA."},{"author_name":"Erwin B\u00f6ttinger","author_inst":"The Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA; The Mount Sinai COVID Informatics Center"},{"author_name":"Zahi A Fayad","author_inst":"The BioMedical Engineering and Imaging Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA; Department of Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at M"},{"author_name":"Girish N Nadkarni","author_inst":"The Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA; The Mount Sinai COVID Informatics Center"},{"author_name":"Fei Wang","author_inst":"Department of Population Health Sciences.

In this study, we report the clinical characteristics of Covid-19 in Chile, with a focus on subjects requiring hospitalization during the initial phases of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods: This is a single center study including all consecutive patients diagnosed with Covid-19 during the first month of the pandemic. Demographics, clinical characteristics and laboratory data were collected within 24 hours of admission. The primary outcome was a composite of ICU admission or all-cause, in-hospital mortality. Results: During the first month of the pandemic, 381 patients were confirmed as positive for SARS- CoV-2 by molecular testing; 88 (23.1%) of them eventually required hospitalization. Median age of the cohort was 39 years (IQR 31-49). Overall mortality was 0.7% and 18 (3.7%) out of the 88 subjects who required hospitalization either died and\/or required ICU. Increased body mass index (BMI), C-reactive protein levels (CRP) and the SaTO2\/FiO2 index on admission were independently associated with a higher risk of ICU care or death. Discussion: The lower mortality observed in our prospective cohort during the first month of SARS-Cov-2 pandemic was lower than previously reported. This finding could be due to a lower threshold for admission, a healthcare system not yet overburdened and a younger population, among other factors. BMI, CRP on admission were strong predictors for ICU care or all-cause, in- hospital mortality. Our data provide important information regarding the clinical course of Covid- 19 in Latin America.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Macarena R Vial","author_inst":"Facultad de Medicina Clinica Alemana Universidad del Desarrollo"},{"author_name":"Anne Peters","author_inst":"Instituto de Ciencias e Innovacion en Medicina, Facultad de Medicina Clinica Alemana, Universidad del Desarrollo"},{"author_name":"Inia Perez","author_inst":"Facultad de Medicina Clinica Alemana Universidad del Desarrollo"},{"author_name":"Maria Spencer","author_inst":"Instituto de Ciencias e Innovacion en Medicina, Facultad de Medicina Clinica Alemana, Universidad del Desarrollo"},{"author_name":"Mario Barbe","author_inst":"Clinica Alemana de Santiago"},{"author_name":"Mabel Aylwin","author_inst":"Facultad de Medicina Clinica Alemana, Universidad del Desarrollo"},{"author_name":"Lorena Porte","author_inst":"Facultad de Medicina Clinica Alemana, Universidad del Desarrollo"},{"author_name":"Thomas Weitzel","author_inst":"Instituto de Ciencias e Innovacion en Medicina, Facultad de Medicina Clinica Alemana, Universidad del Desarrollo"},{"author_name":"Pablo Vial","author_inst":"Instituto de Ciencias e Innovacion en Medicina, Facultad de Medicina Clinica Alemana, Universidad del Desarrollo"},{"author_name":"Rafael Araos","author_inst":"Instituto de Ciencias e Innovacion en Medicina, Facultad de Medicina Clinica Alemana, Universidad del Desarrollo; Millennium Initiative for Collaborative Resear"},{"author_name":"Jose M.

A clear acquired decrease of CR1 density of E from COVID-19 patients was observed, particularly among fatal cases, and paralleling several severity parameters. Deposits of C4d largely above values observed in normal individuals, mostly without C3 deposits, have been observed in more than 80% of the patients, reminiscent of the sub endothelial pericapil-lary deposits in organ transplant rejection, already observed on E in parallel, as well as also observed on E in clinical SLE flares. Conversely, significant C3 deposits were only observed among 1\/4 of the patients. The decrease of CR1\/E density, and the detection of virus spike, C3 or C4 fragment on E, among COVID-19 pa-tients, are likely to be two aspects of the same phenomenon of immune complexes or complement fragment coated cell debris handling and clearance. Measurement of C4d deposit on E might represent a way for assessing inflammation and comple-ment activation occurring in organ capillaries. CR1\/E decrease might represent a cumulative index of complement activation in COVID-19 patients. Taken together, these original findings stress on the participation of the complement regulatory pro-teins in that disease and evidence that E matter in immune mechanisms in COVID-19 patients. The use of CR1, or CR1-like molecules with the aim of down regulating complement activation and inflammation for therapy should also be considered.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aymric KISSERLI","author_inst":"Rheims University hospital"},{"author_name":"Nathalie SCHNEIDER","author_inst":"Rheims University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sandra AUDONNET","author_inst":"University of Rheims Champagne-Ardenne"},{"author_name":"Thierry TABARY","author_inst":"Rheims University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Antoine GOURY","author_inst":"Rheims University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Joel COUSSON","author_inst":"Rheims University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Rachid MAHMOUDI","author_inst":"Rheims University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Firouze BANI-SADR","author_inst":"Rheims University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lukshe KANAGARATNAM","author_inst":"Rheims University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Damien JOLLY","author_inst":"Rheims University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jacques H M COHEN","author_inst":"University of Rheims Champagne-Ardenne"},{"author_name":"Alexander M.

We discuss the merits and disadvantages of each approach, we interpret the parameters of the model and assess the realistic nature of the parameters resulting from the optimization procedure. Importantly, we explore a model involving two sub-populations (younger and older than a specific age), to more accurately reflect the observed impact as concerns symptoms and behavior in different age groups. For definitiveness and to separate people that are (typically) in the active workforce, our partition of population is with respect to members younger vs. older than the age of 65. The basic reproductive number of the model is computed for both the single- and the two-population variant. Finally, we consider what would be the impact on the number of deaths and cumulative infections upon imposition of partial lockdown (involving only the older population) and full lockdown (involving the entire population).","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jes\u00fas Cuevas-Maraver","author_inst":"Universidad de Sevilla"},{"author_name":"Panayotis Kevrekidis","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts"},{"author_name":"Qian-Yong Chen","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts"},{"author_name":"George Kevrekidis","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts"},{"author_name":"V\u00edctor Villalobos-Daniel","author_inst":"National Center of Disease Prevention and Control Programs - CENAPRECE"},{"author_name":"Zoi Rapti","author_inst":"University of Illinois"},{"author_name":"Yannis Drossinos","author_inst":"European Comission"},{"author_name":"Firouze BANI-SADR","author_inst":"Rheims University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lukshe KANAGARATNAM","author_inst":"Rheims University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Damien JOLLY","author_inst":"Rheims University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jacques H M COHEN","author_inst":"University of Rheims Champagne-Ardenne"},{"author_name":"Alexander M.

Evidence suggests that virus transmission can be reduced by face coverings, but robust evidence for how mask usage might affect safe distancing parameters is lacking. Accordingly, we investigate the effectiveness of surgical masks and single-layer cotton masks on mitigating dispersion of large respiratory droplets (i.e. non aerosol). We tested a manikin ejecting fluorescent droplets and human volunteers in speaking and coughing conditions. We quantified the number of droplets in flight using laser sheet illumination and UV-light for those that had landed at table height at up to 2m. For human volunteers, expiratory droplets were caught on a microscope slide 5cm from the mouth. Whether manikin or human, wearing a face covering decreased the number of projected droplets by >1000-fold. We estimated that a person standing 2m from someone coughing without a mask is exposed to over 1000 times more respiratory droplets than from someone standing 5 cm away wearing a basic single layer mask. Our results indicate that face coverings show consistent efficacy at blocking respiratory droplets. If aerosol transmission is later determined to be a significant driver of infection, then our findings may overestimate the effectiveness of face coverings.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lucia Bandiera","author_inst":"School of Engineering, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Geethanjali Pavar","author_inst":"School of Engineering, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Gabriele Pisetta","author_inst":"School of Engineering, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Shuji Otomo","author_inst":"School of Engineering, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Enzo Mangano","author_inst":"School of Engineering, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Jonathan R.

Wastewater surveillance has rapidly emerged as a potential tool to effectively monitor community infections for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), through measuring trends of viral RNA signal in wastewater systems. In this study SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA N1 and N2 genes are quantified in solids collected from influent post grit solids (PGS) and primary clarified sludge (PCS) in two water resource recovery facilities (WRRF) serving Canada's national capital region, i.e., the City of Ottawa, ON (pop. = 1.1M) and the City of Gatineau, QC (pop. = 280K). PCS samples show signal inhibition using RT-ddPCR compared to RT-qPCR, with PGS samples showing similar quantifiable concentrations of RNA using both assays. RT-qPCR shows higher frequency of detection of N1 and N2 genes in PCS (92.7, 90.6%) as compared to PGS samples (79.2, 82.3%). Sampling of PCS may therefore be an effective approach for SARS-CoV-2 viral quantification, especially during periods of declining and low COVID-19 incidence in the community. The pepper mild mottle virus (PMMV) is determined to have a less variable RNA signal in PCS over a three month period for two WRRFs, regardless of environmental conditions, compared to Bacteroides 16S rRNA or human eukaryotic 18S rRNA, making PMMV a potentially useful biomarker for normalization of SARS-CoV-2 signal. PMMV-normalized PCS RNA signal from WRRFs of two cities correlated with the regional public health epidemiological metrics, identifying PCS normalized to a fecal indicator (PMMV) as a potentially effective tool for monitoring trends during decreasing and low-incidence of infection of SARS-Cov-2 in communities.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patrick M.

We aimed to describe the place and cause of death during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This national death registry included all adult (aged [&ge;]18 years) deaths in England and Wales between 1st January 2014 and 30th June 2020. Analyses were based upon ICD-10 codes corresponding to the underlying cause of death as stated on the Medical Certificate of Cause of Death. Daily deaths during COVID-19 pandemic were compared against the expected daily deaths estimated using Farrington surveillance algorithm for daily historical data between 2014 and 2020, by place and cause of death. Findings Between 2nd March and 30th June 2020, there was an excess mortality of 57860 (a proportional increase of 35%) compared with the expected deaths, of which 50603 (86.2%) were COVID-19 related. Almost half the excess deaths occurred in care homes (25611 deaths) where deaths were 55% higher than expected. One fifth of the excess deaths occurred in hospital (15938 deaths; a proportional increase of 21%) with the remainder occurring at home (16190 deaths; a proportional increase of 39%). At home, only 14% of 16190 excess deaths were related to COVID-19, with 5 963 deaths due to cancer and 2485 deaths due to cardiac disease, very few of which involved COVID-19. In care homes or hospices, 61% of the 25611 excess deaths were related to COVID-19, 5539 of which were due to respiratory disease and most of these (4315 deaths) involved COVID-19. In hospital, there were 16174 fewer deaths than expected which did not involve COVID-19, and there were 4088 fewer deaths due to cancer and 1398 fewer deaths due to cardiac disease than expected. Interpretation The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a substantial increase in the absolute numbers of deaths occurring at home and care homes. There was a huge burden of excess deaths occurring in care homes, which were poorly characterised, and were likely to be, at least in part, the result of undiagnosed COVID-19. There was a smaller but important and ongoing excess in deaths at home, particularly from cancer and cardiac disease, which suggests avoidance of hospital care for non-COVID-19 conditions.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jianhua Wu","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Marion Mafham","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Mamas Mamas","author_inst":"University of Keele"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Rashid","author_inst":"University of Keele"},{"author_name":"Evangelos Kontopantelis","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"John Deanfield","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Mark de Belder","author_inst":"Barts NHS trust"},{"author_name":"Chris P Gale","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Xu Zhang","author_inst":"University of Ottawa - Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology"},{"author_name":"Tommy Alain","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario - Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Mark R.

The detection of this virus as early as possible will help in contaminating the spread of it as the virus is mutating itself as fast as possible and currently there are about 4,300 strains of the virus according to the reports. Clinical studies have shown that most of the COVID-19 patients suffer from a lung infection similar to influenza. So, it is possible to diagnose lung infection using imaging techniques. Although a chest computed tomography (CT) scan has been shown to be an effective imaging technique for lung-related disease diagnosis, chest X-ray is more widely available across the hospitals due to its considerably lower cost and faster imaging time than CT scan. The advancements in the area of machine learning and pattern recognition has resulted in intelligent systems that analyze CT Scans or X-ray images and classify between pneumonia and normal patients. This paper proposes KE Sieve Neural Network architecture, which helps in the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 using chest X-ray images. This architecture is achieving an accuracy of 98.49%. This noninvasive prediction method can assist the doctors in this pandemic and reduce the stress on health care systems.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"S Sai Thejeshwar","author_inst":"Alpes.ai"},{"author_name":"Chaitanya Chokkareddy","author_inst":"ALPES.ai"},{"author_name":"K Eswaran","author_inst":"Sreenidhi Institute Of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Rashid","author_inst":"University of Keele"},{"author_name":"Evangelos Kontopantelis","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"John Deanfield","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Mark de Belder","author_inst":"Barts NHS trust"},{"author_name":"Chris P Gale","author_inst":"University of Leeds"},{"author_name":"Xu Zhang","author_inst":"University of Ottawa - Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology"},{"author_name":"Tommy Alain","author_inst":"Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario - Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Mark R.

Studies have shown that the average number of working hours per week is a significant predictor of stress and that the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the nurses stress levels. Objective: Therefore, we investigated (1) if a change had occurred in the nurses working hours during the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to the hours employed and (2) the influence of the nursing staffs working hours during COVID-19 pandemic on the perceived level of stress. Design: We used an online survey in this Austrian cross-sectional study, distributed using a snowball sampling method. Participants and methods: In the online survey, we asked the nurses many relevant questions, including how many hours they are employed per week and how many hours they had worked on average per week since the outbreak of COVID-19. We used the Perceived Stress scale to measure stress level among these nurses. Data were collected between mid-May and mid-July 2020. Results: Three-quarters of the 2600 participating nurses reported changes in their working hours during the COVID-19 pandemic. The nursing staffs hours of employment were statistically significantly associated with their average number of working hours during the COVID-19 pandemic. About two-thirds of the nurses who were employed either less than 10 hours or for 31-40 hours worked for more than 40 hours. Most of the nurses experienced a moderate level of stress. We identified a statistically significant association between increasing the number of working hours per week and the nurses perceived stress level. In addition, 15% of the nurses who had worked more than 40 hours reported experiencing a high level of stress. In addition, we found that nurses who worked more hours during the pandemic experienced higher stress than nurses who reduced their working hours or kept the same working hours. Conclusions: We found a statistically significant association between an increase in the nursing staffs working hours and their level of stress. We believe that these results reflect the negative consequences of prolonged working hours. For this reason, a (inter-)national discussion is needed on the topic of restricting the working hours of healthcare workers during such pandemics. This discussion can improve the health and safety of the health care workers, the patients, as well as members of the general population.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Manuela Hoedl","author_inst":"Institute of Nursing Science, Medical University of Graz"},{"author_name":"Silvia Bauer","author_inst":"Institute of Nursing Science, Medical University Graz"},{"author_name":"Doris Eglseer","author_inst":"Institute of Nursing Science, Medical University of Graz"},{"author_name":"Rick van der Geest","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Mara Sullivan","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Mark Ross","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Georgios D Kitsios","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Barbara Methe","author_inst":"University of Pittsburgh"},{"author_name":"Bryan J.

Materials and Methods Clinical data, including demographics, signs, symptoms, comorbidities and blood test results and chest CT scans of 346 patients from two hospitals in the Hubei province, China, were used to develop machine learning models for automated severity assessment of diagnosed COVID-19 cases. We compared the predictive power of clinical and imaging data by testing multiple machine learning models, and further explored the use of four oversampling methods to address the imbalance distribution issue. Features with the highest predictive power were identified using the SHAP framework. Results Targeting differentiation between mild and severe cases, logistic regression models achieved the best performance on clinical features (AUC:0.848, sensitivity:0.455, specificity:0.906), imaging features (AUC:0.926, sensitivity:0.818, specificity:0.901) and the combined features (AUC:0.950, sensitivity:0.764, specificity:0.919). The SMOTE oversampling method further improved the performance of the combined features to AUC of 0.960 (sensitivity:0.845, specificity:0.929). Discussion Imaging features had the strongest impact on the model output, while a combination of clinical and imaging features yielded the best performance overall. The identified predictive features were consistent with findings from previous studies. Oversampling yielded mixed results, although it achieved the best performance in our study. Conclusions This study indicates that clinical and imaging features can be used for automated severity assessment of COVID-19 patients and have the potential to assist with triaging COVID-19 patients and prioritizing care for patients at higher risk of severe cases.

These efforts have used various coding frameworks, but most have relied on binary coding that may not adequately describe the gradient in social distancing policies as states re-open. We developed a COVID-19 social distancing intensity framework that is sufficiently specific and sensitive to capture this gradient. Based on a review of policies from a 12-state sample, we developed a social distancing intensity framework consisting of 16 domains and intensity scales of 0-5 for each domain. We found that the states with the highest average daily intensity from our sample were Pennsylvania, Washington, Colorado, California, and New Jersey, with Georgia, Florida, Massachusetts, and Texas having the lowest. While some domains (such as restaurants and movie theaters) showed bimodal policy intensity distributions compatible with binary (yes\/no) coding, others (such as childcare and religious gatherings) showed broader variability that would be missed without more granular coding. We also present a range of methodological recommendations to strengthen COVID-19 comparative policy coding efforts.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jeff Lane","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Michelle M Garrison","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"James Kelley","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Priya Sarma","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Aaron Katz","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Graham Simmons","author_inst":"Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, California, United States."},{"author_name":"Steven Chu","author_inst":"Department of Physics and Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, United States."},{"author_name":"Scott Weaver","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, and Institute for Human Infections and Immunity, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, United States."},{"author_name":"Wah Chiu","author_inst":"Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States; and Division of CryoEM and Bioimaging, SSRL, SLAC National Accelerator L"},{"author_name":"Yi Cui","author_inst":"Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States and Stanford Institute for Materials and Energy Scienc"},{"author_name":"Lei Song","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Xiangyang Central Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Hubei University of Arts and Science, Xiangyang, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoming Qiu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Huangshi Central Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Hubei Polytechnic University, Edong Healthcare Group, Huangshi, China"},{"author_name":"Sidong Liu","author_inst":"Centre for Health Informatics, Australian Institute of Health Innovation, Faculty of Medicine, Health and Human Sciences, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australi"},{"author_name":"Xiangran Cai","author_inst":"Medical Imaging Centre, The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China"},{"author_name":"Pamela J.

Acute lung inflammatory edema is a major pathological finding in autopsies explaining O2 diffusion failure and hypoxemia. Only dexamethasone has been shown to reduce mortality in severe cases, further supporting a role for inflammation in disease severity. SARS-CoV-2 enters cells employing angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor, which is highly expressed in lung alveolar cells. ACE2 is one of the components of the cellular machinery that inactivates the potent inflammatory agent bradykinin, and SARS-CoV-2 infection could interfere with the catalytic activity of ACE2, leading to accumulation of bradykinin. In this open-label, randomized clinical trial, we tested two pharmacological inhibitors of the kinin-kallikrein system that are currently approved for the treatment of hereditary angioedema, icatibant and inhibitor of C1 esterase\/kallikrein, in a group of 30 patients with severe COVID-19. Neither icatibant nor inhibitor of C1 esterase\/kallikrein resulted in significant changes in disease mortality and time to clinical improvement. However, both compounds promoted significant improvement of lung computed tomography scores and increased blood eosinophils, which has been reported as an indicator of disease recovery. In this small cohort, we found evidence for a beneficial role of pharmacological inhibition of the kinin-kallikrein system in two markers that indicate improved disease recovery.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eli Mansour","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Andre C Palma","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Raisa G Ulaf","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Luciana C Ribeiro","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Ana Flavia Bernardes","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Thyago A Nunes","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Marcus V Agrela","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Bruna Bombassaro","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Milena Monfort-Pires","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Rafael L Camargo","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Eliana P Araujo","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Natalia S Brunetti","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Alessandro S Farias","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Antonio L Falcao","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Thiago M Santos","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Plinio Trabasso","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Rachel P Dertkigil","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Sergio S Dertkigil","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Maria Luiza Moretti","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Licio A Velloso","author_inst":"University of Campinas"},{"author_name":"Girish N Nadkarni","author_inst":"The Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA; The Mount Sinai COVID Informatics Center"},{"author_name":"Fei Wang","author_inst":"Department of Population Health Sciences.

The majority of infected individuals experience mildly symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but it is unknown whether this can induce persistent immune memory that might contribute to herd immunity. Thus, we performed a longitudinal assessment of individuals recovered from mildly symptomatic COVID-19 to determine if they develop and sustain immunological memory against the virus. We found that recovered individuals developed SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody and neutralizing plasma, as well as virus-specific memory B and T cells that not only persisted, but in some cases increased numerically over three months following symptom onset. Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2-specific memory lymphocytes exhibited characteristics associated with potent antiviral immunity: memory T cells secreted IFN-{gamma} and expanded upon antigen re-encounter, while memory B cells expressed receptors capable of neutralizing virus when expressed as antibodies. These findings demonstrate that mild COVID-19 elicits memory lymphocytes that persist and display functional hallmarks associated with antiviral protective immunity.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lauren B Rodda","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jason Netland","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Laila Shehata","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kurt B Pruner","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Peter M Morawski","author_inst":"Benaroya Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Christopher Thouvenel","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Kennidy K Takehara","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Julie Eggenberger","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Emily A Hemann","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Hayley R Waterman","author_inst":"Benaroya Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Mitchell L Fahning","author_inst":"Benaroya Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Rathe","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Caleb Stokes","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Samuel Wrenn","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Brooke Fiala","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Lauren P Carter","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Jessica A Hamerman","author_inst":"Benaroya Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Neil P King","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Michael Gale","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Daniel J Campbell","author_inst":"Benaroya Research Institute"},{"author_name":"David Rawlings","author_inst":"Seattle Children's Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Marion Pepper","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Laura J.
