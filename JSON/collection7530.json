In this way, the wavelengths of the outbreaks can be calculated, ensuring that the outbreaks are valid, reliable and easy to follow at the national and international level. Wavelength models consist of approved case, death, recovered case and net wavelength models. Thus, the size of the outbreak can be measured both individually and as a whole. COVID-19 cases of 181 countries were used to demonstrate the application of the models. The prominent findings in the applied wavelength models are as follows: the countries with the highest case wavelength are USA, Italy, Spain and Germany, respectively. However, Italy ranks first in the death wavelength, followed by Spain, the USA and France. On the other hand, China has taken the first place in the recovered case wavelength. This country was followed by Spain and Germany and Italy, respectively. Based on all these wavelength models mentioned, net wavelength lengths are calculated. According to the findings of net wavelengths obtained, Canada ranked first, followed by United Kingdom, USA and Italy, respectively.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tevfik Bulut","author_inst":"The Ministry of Industry and Technology"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.07.20056887","rel_title":"A secure and rapid query-software for COVID-19 test results that can easily be integrated into the clinical workflow to avoid communication overload","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.07.20056887","rel_abs":"Overcoming the COVID-19 crisis requires new ideas and strategies. Rapid testing of a large number of subjects is essential to monitor, and delay, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to mitigate the consequences of the pandemic. People not knowing that they are infected may not stay in quarantine and, thus, are a risk for infecting others. Unfortunately, the massive number of COVID-19 tests performed is challenging for both laboratories and the units that take the throat swab and have to communicate test results. Here, we present a secure tracking system (CTest) to report COVID-19 test results online as soon as they become available. The system can be integrated into the clinical workflow with very modest effort and avoids excessive load to telephone hotlines. With this open-source and browser-based online tracking system, we aim to minimize the time required to inform the tested person but also the test units, e.g. hospitals or the public healthcare system. Instead of personal calls, CTest updates the status of the test automatically when the test results are available. Test reports are published on a secured web-page enabling regular status checks also by patients not using smartphones with dedicated mobile apps which has some importance as smartphone usage diminishes with age. The source code, as well as further information to integrate CTest into the IT environment of other clinics or test-centres, are freely available from https:\/\/github.com\/sysbio-bioinf\/CTest under the Eclipse Public License v2.0 (EPL2).","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gunnar Voelkel","author_inst":"Ulm University"},{"author_name":"Axel Fuerstberger","author_inst":"Ulm University"},{"author_name":"Julian D.

We develop a scalable approach for determining the viral status of pooled patient samples. Our approach converts group testing to a linear inverse problem, where false positives and negatives are interpreted as generated by a noisy communication channel, and a message passing algorithm estimates the illness status of patients. Numerical results reveal that our approach estimates patient illness using fewer pooled measurements than existing noisy group testing algorithms. Our approach can easily be extended to various applications, including where false negatives must be minimized.

Risk factors for mortality have not been well summarized. Current meta-analysis of retrospective cohort studies was done to summarize available findings on the association between age, gender, comorbidities and risk of death from COVID-19 infection. Methods: Online databases including Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library and Google scholar were searched to detect relevant publications up to 1 May 2020, using relevant keywords. To pool data, random-effects model was used. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis and publication bias test were also done. Results: In total, 14 studies with 29,909 COVID-19 infected patients and 1,445 cases of death were included in the current meta-analysis. Significant associations were found between older age ([&ge;]65 vs <65 years old) (pooled ORs=4.59, 95% CIs=2.61-8.04, p<0.001), gender (male vs female) (pooled ORs=1.50, 95% CIs=1.06-2.12, p=0.021) and risk of death from COVID-19 infection. In addition, hypertension (pooled ORs=2.70, 95% CIs=1.40-5.24, p=0.003), cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) (pooled ORs=3.72, 95% CIs=1.77-7.83, p=0.001), diabetes (pooled ORs=2.41, 95% CIs=1.05-5.51, p=0.037), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (pooled ORs=3.53, 95% CIs=1.79-6.96, p<0.001) and cancer (pooled ORs=3.04, 95% CIs=1.80-5.14, p<0.001), were associated with higher risk of mortality. Conclusion: Older age ([&ge;]65 years old), male gender, hypertension, CVDs, diabetes, COPD and malignancies were associated with greater risk of death from COVID-19 infection. These findings could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammad Parohan","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sajad Yaghoubi","author_inst":"Iranshahr University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Asal Seraji","author_inst":"Islamic Azad University, Damavand Branch"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Hassan Javanbakht","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Payam Sarraf","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mahmoud Djalali","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Alexander Gross","author_inst":"Ulm University"},{"author_name":"Florian Kohlmayer","author_inst":"TU Munich"},{"author_name":"Peter Kuhn","author_inst":"University Hospital Ulm"},{"author_name":"Klaus A.

The first case of COVID-19 was confirmed at the Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre on March 1st, a large public hospital with 1200 beds, covering an area over 400000 inhabitants in southern Madrid. During March 2020 highly active circulation of SARS-CoV-2 was experienced in Madrid with 24090 cases officially reported by March 29th. Methods Since the beginning of the epidemics the Occupational Health and Safety Service (OHSS) organized the consulting and testing of the hospital personnel with confirmed exposure and also those presenting symptoms suggestive of viral respiratory infection. For molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection both nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were obtained from suspected cases and processed at the Microbiology Laboratory by automatized specific PCR methods that was operative from February 25th as part of the preparedness. Results From a total of 6800 employees of the hospital, 2085 (30,6 %) were tested during the period 1-29 March 2020, some of them repeatedly (2286 total samples). The first HCW infected was confirmed on March 9th. A total of 791 HCW and personnel were confirmed to be infected by March 29th, representing 38% of those tested and 11,6 % of all the hospital workers. The proportion of infected individuals was estimated among the different groups of occupational exposure and the evolution of the cases during the expansive epidemic wave was compared between HCW and those patients attending at the Emergency Department (ER) during the same period and adjusted by the same age range. There were no statistically significant differences in the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR detection between HCW from high risk areas involved in close contact with COVID-19 patients in comparison with clerical, administrative or laboratory personnel without direct contact with patients. The curves of evolution of accumulated cases between patients and HCW during March 2020 showed an almost parallel shape. Discussion The recommendation from our OHSS did not include testing of asymptomatic cases but was highly proactive in testing even patients with minor symptoms therefore, a high proportion of HCW and non-sanitary personnel was tested in March 2020 during the rapid period of expansion of the epidemics in Madrid, accounting for a total of 30,6 % of the hospital employees. Most of the COVID-19 cases among the hospital HCW and personnel were mild and managed at home under self-isolation measures, however 23 (3%) required hospitalization mostly due to severe bilateral interstitial pneumonia, two of those cases required mechanical ventilation at the ICU. No fatalities occurred during the study period. Although there were some cases of highly probable transmission from COVID-19 patients to HCWs, mainly at the first phase of the epidemics, there were no significant differences on the infection rates of HCW and hospital personnel that can be related to working in areas of high exposure risk. Furthermore, the evolution of cases during the same time period (March 2020) between patients attending the ER and hospital staff suggests that both groups were driven by the same dynamics. This experience is similar to the communicated from Wuhan verified by the WHO Joint Mission and also from recent experiences at hospital in the Netherlands, where most of the infections of HCW were related to household or community contacts. Significance Since the collective of hospital HCW are exhaustively screened in specific centers, their rate of infection for SARS-CoV-2 could be an indicator of the epidemic dynamics in the community. There appears to be a close connection between HCW infection and the driving forces of transmission in the community. Although we cannot exclude an additional risk factor of infection by SARS-CoV-2 due to the fact of the hospital environment, the similar proportions of positive cases among all the areas of the hospital and the evolutive wave of infection, as compared with the community, are clear arguments against a major factor of occupational risk. Exhaustive testing, such as the one carried out in our institution, covering over one third of all the workers, could be used as a reference of the population infected in the community. Since a significant proportion of COVID-19 cases can be asymptomatic and not all the hospital employees were actually tested, it is highly likely that this 11,6 % is a minimum estimation of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 circulation in Madrid during the first 4 weeks of the epidemics. This is in high and clear contrast with the official figures circulating at national and international levels. This has important implications to more precisely estimate the actual number of cases in the community and to develop public health policies for containment, treatment and recovery.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria Dolores Folgueira","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Carmen Munoz-Ruiperez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Miguel Angel Alonso-Lopez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Rafael Delgado","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Payam Sarraf","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mahmoud Djalali","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Alexander Gross","author_inst":"Ulm University"},{"author_name":"Florian Kohlmayer","author_inst":"TU Munich"},{"author_name":"Peter Kuhn","author_inst":"University Hospital Ulm"},{"author_name":"Klaus A.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is viral infection that generates a severe acute respiratory syndrome with serious pneumonia that may result in progressive respiratory failure and death. What are the goals of this investigation? This study explains the geo-environmental determinants of the accelerated diffusion of COVID-19 in Italy that is generating a high level of deaths and suggests general lessons learned for a strategy to cope with future epidemics similar to COVID-19 to reduce viral infectivity and negative impacts in economic systems and society. What are the results of this study? The main results are: o The accelerate and vast diffusion of COVID-19 in North Italy has a high association with air pollution. o Hinterland cities have average days of exceeding the limits set for PM10 (particulate matter 10 micrometers or less in diameter) equal to 80 days, and an average number of infected more than 2,000 individuals as of April 1st, 2020, coastal cities have days of exceeding the limits set for PM10 equal to 60 days and have about 700 infected in average. o Cities that average number of 125 days exceeding the limits set for PM10, last year, they have an average number of infected individual higher than 3,200 units, whereas cities having less than 100 days (average number of 48 days) exceeding the limits set for PM10, they have an average number of about 900 infected individuals. o The results reveal that accelerated transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in specific environments is due to two mechanisms given by: air pollution-to-human transmission and human-to-human transmission; in particular, the mechanisms of air pollution-to-human transmission play a critical role rather than human-to-human transmission. o The finding here suggests that to minimize future epidemic similar to COVID-19, the max number of days per year in which cities can exceed the limits set for PM10 or for ozone, considering their meteorological condition, is less than 50 days. After this critical threshold, the analytical output here suggests that environmental inconsistencies because of the combination between air pollution and meteorological conditions (with high moisture%, low wind speed and fog) trigger a take-off of viral infectivity (accelerated epidemic diffusion) with damages for health of population, economy and society. What is a socioeconomic strategy to prevent future epidemics similar to COVID-19? Considering the complex interaction between air pollution, meteorological conditions and biological characteristics of viral infectivity, lessons learned for COVID-19 have to be applied for a proactive socioeconomic strategy to cope with future epidemics, especially an environmental policy based on reduction of air pollution mainly in hinterland zones of countries, having low wind speed, high percentage of moisture and fog that create an environment that can damage immune system of people and foster a fast transmission of viral infectivity similar to the COVID-19. This study must conclude that a strategy to prevent future epidemics similar to COVID 19 has also to be designed in environmental and sustainability science and not only in terms of biology.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mario Coccia","author_inst":"National Research Council of Italy"},{"author_name":"Carmen Munoz-Ruiperez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Miguel Angel Alonso-Lopez","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Rafael Delgado","author_inst":"Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain"},{"author_name":"Payam Sarraf","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mahmoud Djalali","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Alexander Gross","author_inst":"Ulm University"},{"author_name":"Florian Kohlmayer","author_inst":"TU Munich"},{"author_name":"Peter Kuhn","author_inst":"University Hospital Ulm"},{"author_name":"Klaus A.

This was the first signal of ongoing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the country. The outbreak rapidly escalated to a national level epidemic, amid the WHO declaration of a pandemic. Methods We analysed data from the national case-based integrated surveillance system of all RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infections as of March 24th 2020, collected from all Italian regions and autonomous provinces. Here we provide a descriptive epidemiological summary on the first 62,843 COVID-19 cases in Italy as well as estimates of the basic and net reproductive numbers by region. Findings Of the 62,843 cases of COVID-19 analysed, 71.6% were reported from three Regions (Lombardia, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna). All cases reported after February 20th were locally acquired. Estimates of R0 varied between 2.5 (95%CI: 2.18-2.83) in Toscana and 3 (95%CI: 2.68-3.33) in Lazio, with epidemic doubling time of 3.2 days (95%CI: 2.3-5.2) and 2.9 days (95%CI: 2.2-4.3), respectively. The net reproduction number showed a decreasing trend starting around February 20-25, 2020 in northern regions. Notably, 5,760 cases were reported among health care workers. Of the 5,541 reported COVID-19 associated deaths, 49% occurred in people aged 80 years or above with an overall crude CFR of 8.8%. Male sex and age were independent risk factors for COVID-19 death. Interpretation The COVID-19 infection in Italy emerged with a clustering onset similar to the one described in Wuhan, China and likewise showed worse outcomes in older males with comorbidities. Initial R0 at 2.96 in Lombardia, explains the high case-load and rapid geographical spread observed. Overall Rt in Italian regions is currently decreasing albeit with large diversities across the country, supporting the importance of combined non-pharmacological control measures.","rel_num_authors":29,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Flavia Riccardo","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Marco Ajelli","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Xanthi Andrianou","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita; Cyprus University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Antonino Bella","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Martina Del Manso","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Massimo Fabiani","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Stefania Bellino","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Stefano Boros","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Alberto Mateo Urdiales","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Valentina Marziano","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Maria Cristina Rota","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Antonietta Filia","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Fortunato (Paolo) D'Ancona","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Andrea Siddu","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Ornella Punzo","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Filippo Trentini","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Guzzetta","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Piero Poletti","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Paola Stefanelli","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Maria Rita Castrucci","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Ciervo","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Corrado Di Benedetto","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Marco Tallon","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Andrea Piccioli","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Silvio Brusaferro","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Rezza","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Stefano Merler","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Patrizio Pezzotti","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"COVID-19 working group","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.07.20055772","rel_title":"A Very Flat Peak: Exponential growth phase of COVID-19 is mostly followed by a prolonged linear growth phase, not an immediate saturation","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.07.20055772","rel_abs":"Innumerable variants of the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model predicted the course of COVID-19 infections for different countries, along with the peaks and the subsequent decline of infections. One thing these models could not have predicted prospectively in January or did not adapt to in the following months is that the peak is rather a plateau for many countries. For example, USA and UK have been persisting at the same high peak of approximately 30,000 and 5,000 daily new infections respectively, for more than a month. Other countries had shorter plateaus of about 3 weeks (6,400 cases in Spain). We establish that this plateau is not an artifact, and the persistence number describing the decline needs an equally important attention as the reproduction number. The solution lies in including the specific epidemiological role of asymptomatics and pre-symptomatics in COVID-19 transmission, different from SARS and influenza. We identify the minimal changes that can be made to any SEIR model to capture this plateau while studying seasonal effects, mitigation strategies, or the second wave of infections etc.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Santosh Ansumali","author_inst":"Jawaharlal Nehru Center for Advanced Scientific Research"},{"author_name":"Meher K Prakash","author_inst":"Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research"},{"author_name":"Xanthi Andrianou","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita; Cyprus University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Antonino Bella","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Martina Del Manso","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Massimo Fabiani","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Stefania Bellino","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Stefano Boros","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Alberto Mateo Urdiales","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Valentina Marziano","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Maria Cristina Rota","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Antonietta Filia","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Fortunato (Paolo) D'Ancona","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Andrea Siddu","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Ornella Punzo","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Filippo Trentini","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Guzzetta","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Piero Poletti","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Paola Stefanelli","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Maria Rita Castrucci","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Ciervo","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Corrado Di Benedetto","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Marco Tallon","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Andrea Piccioli","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Silvio Brusaferro","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Rezza","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Stefano Merler","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Patrizio Pezzotti","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"COVID-19 working group","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.09.20056242","rel_title":"Liver injury is associated with severe Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis of retrospective studies","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.09.20056242","rel_abs":"Aim: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is a major threat to human beings. Lung injury has been reported as the major outcome of COVID-19 infection. However, liver damage has also been considered to occur in severe cases. Current meta-analysis of retrospective studies was done to summarize available findings on the association between liver injury and severity of COVID-19 infection. Methods: Online databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane Library were searched to detect relevant publications up to 1 April 2020, using relevant keywords. To pool data, a fixed- or random-effects model was used depending on the heterogeneity between studies. Furthermore, publication bias test and sensitivity analysis were also done. Results: In total, 20 retrospective studies with 3,428 COVID-19 infected patients (severe cases = 1,455 and mild cases = 1,973), were included in this meta-analysis. Higher serum levels of Aspartate aminotransferase (weighted mean difference = 8.84 U\/L, 95% CI = 5.97 to 11.71, P<0.001), Alanine aminotransferase (weighted mean difference = 7.35 U\/L, 95% CI = 4.77 to 9.93, P<0.001), total Bilirubin (weighted mean difference = 2.30 mmol\/L, 95% CI = 1.24 to 3.36, P<0.001) and lower serum levels of Albumin (weighted mean difference = -4.24 g\/L, 95% CI = -6.20 to -2.28, P<0.001), were associated with a significant increase in the severity of COVID-19 infection. Conclusions: The incidence of liver injury seems to be higher in patients with severe COVID-19 infection. This finding could help physicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammad Parohan","author_inst":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sajad Yaghoubi","author_inst":"Iranshahr University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Asal Seraj","author_inst":"Islamic Azad University, Damavand Branch"},{"author_name":"Antonino Bella","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Martina Del Manso","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Massimo Fabiani","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Stefania Bellino","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Stefano Boros","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Alberto Mateo Urdiales","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Valentina Marziano","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Maria Cristina Rota","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Antonietta Filia","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Fortunato (Paolo) D'Ancona","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Andrea Siddu","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Ornella Punzo","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Filippo Trentini","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Guzzetta","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Piero Poletti","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Paola Stefanelli","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Maria Rita Castrucci","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Ciervo","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Corrado Di Benedetto","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Marco Tallon","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Andrea Piccioli","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Silvio Brusaferro","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Rezza","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Stefano Merler","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Patrizio Pezzotti","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"COVID-19 working group","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.05.20054346","rel_title":"The Framework for the Prediction of the Critical Turning Period for Outbreak of COVID-19 Spread in China based on the iSEIR Model","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.05.20054346","rel_abs":"The goal of this study is to establish a general framework for predicting the so-called critical Turning Period in an infectious disease epidemic such as the COVID-19 outbreak in China early this year. This framework enabled a timely prediction of the turning period when applied to Wuhan COVID-19 epidemic and informed the relevant authority for taking appropriate and timely actions to control the epidemic. It is expected to provide insightful information on turning period for the world's current battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. The underlying mathematical model in our framework is the individual Susceptible-Exposed-Infective-Removed (iSEIR) model, which is a set of differential equations extending the classic SEIR model. We used the observed daily cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan from February 6 to 10, 2020 as the input to the iSEIR model and were able to generate the trajectory of COVID-19 cases dynamics for the following days at midnight of February 10 based on the updated model, from which we predicted that the turning period of CIVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan would arrive within one week after February 14. This prediction turned to be timely and accurate, providing adequate time for the government, hospitals, essential industry sectors and services to meet peak demands and to prepare aftermath planning. Our study also supports the observed effectiveness on flatting the epidemic curve by decisively imposing the Lockdown and Isolation Control Program in Wuhan since January 23, 2020.

In hospitals, health-care workers wear facemasks as a minimum medical droplet precaution to protect themselves. Due to the shortage of masks during the pandemic, priority is given to hospitals for their distribution. As a result, the availability\/use of medical masks is discouraged for the public. However, given that asymptomatic individuals, not wearing masks within the public, can be highly contagious for COVID-19, prevention of environmental droplet contamination (EnDC) from coughing\/sneezing\/speech is fundamental to reducing transmission. As an immediate solution to promote public droplet safety, we assessed household textiles to quantify their potential as effective environmental droplet barriers (EDBs). The synchronized implementation of a universal community droplet reduction solution is discussed as a model against COVID-19. Using a bacterial-suspension spray simulation model of droplet ejection (mimicking a sneeze), we quantified the extent by which widely available clothing fabrics reduce the dispersion of droplets onto surfaces within 1.8m, the minimum distance recommended for COVID-19 social distancing. All textiles reduced the number of droplets reaching surfaces, restricting their dispersion to <30cm, when used as single layers. When used as double-layers, textiles were as effective as medical mask\/surgical-cloth materials, reducing droplet dispersion to <10cm, and the area of circumferential contamination to ~0.3%. The synchronized implementation of EDBs as a community droplet reduction solution (i.e., face covers\/scarfs\/masks & surface covers) could reduce EnDC and the risk of transmitting or acquiring infectious respiratory pathogens, including COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexander Rodriguez-Palacios","author_inst":"Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fabio Cominelli","author_inst":"Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Abigail Basson","author_inst":"Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Theresa Pizarro","author_inst":"Case Western Reserve University  School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sanja Ilic","author_inst":"Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Richard S.

Diagnostic performance was computed for a system trained on CXRs of Italian subjects from two hospitals in Lombardy, Italy. Methods We used for training and internal testing an ensemble of ten convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with mainly bedside CXRs of 250 COVID-19 and 250 non-COVID-19 subjects from two hospitals. We then tested such system on bedside CXRs of an independent group of 110 patients (74 COVID-19, 36 non COVID-19) from one of the two hospitals. A retrospective reading was performed by two radiologists in the absence of any clinical information, with the aim to differentiate COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 patients. Real-time polymerase chain reaction served as reference standard. Results At 10-fold cross-validation, our AI model classified COVID-19 and non COVID-19 patients with 0.78 sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-0.81), 0.82 specificity (95% CI 0.78-0.85) and 0.89 area under the curve (AUC) (95% CI 0.86-0.91). For the independent dataset, AI showed 0.80 sensitivity (95% CI 0.72-0.86) (59\/74), 0.81 specificity (29\/36) (95% CI 0.73-0.87), and 0.81 AUC (95% CI 0.73-0.87). Radiologists reading obtained 0.63 sensitivity (95% CI 0.52-0.74) and 0.78 specificity (95% CI 0.61-0.90) in one centre and 0.64 sensitivity (95% CI 0.52-0.74) and 0.86 specificity (95% CI 0.71-0.95) in the other. Conclusions This preliminary experience based on ten CNNs trained on a limited training dataset shows an interesting potential of AI for COVID-19 diagnosis. Such tool is in training with new CXRs to further increase its performance.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Isabella Castiglioni","author_inst":"Department of Physics, Universita degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca, Piazza della Scienza 3, 20126 Milano, Italy"},{"author_name":"Davide Ippolito","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, San Gerardo Hospital, Via Pergolesi 33, 20900 Monza, Italy"},{"author_name":"Matteo Interlenghi","author_inst":"Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Physiology, National Research Council, Segrate, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Caterina Beatrice Monti","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences for Health, Universita degli Studi di Milano, Via Mangiagalli 31, 20133, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Christian Salvatore","author_inst":"Scuola Universitaria Superiore IUSS Pavia, Piazza della Vittoria 15, 27100 Pavia, Italy; DeepTrace Technologies S.R.L., Via Conservatorio 17, 20122, Milan, Ital"},{"author_name":"Simone Schiaffino","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, IRCCS Policlinico San Donato, Via Morandi 30, 20097 San Donato Milanese, Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Annalisa Polidori","author_inst":"DeepTrace Technologies S.r.l., Via Conservatorio 17, 20122 Milan, Italy."},{"author_name":"Davide Gandola","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, San Gerardo Hospital, Via Pergolesi 33, 20900 Monza, Italy."},{"author_name":"Cristina Messa","author_inst":"Fondazione Tecnomed, Universita di Milano-Bicocca, Palazzina Ciclotrone, Via Pergolesi 33,, 20126 Milano, Italy."},{"author_name":"Francesco Sardanelli","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences for Health, Universita degli Studi di Milano, Via Mangiagalli 31, 20133, Milan, Italy; Department of Radiology, IRCCS Policlin"},{"author_name":"Maria Cristina Rota","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Antonietta Filia","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Fortunato (Paolo) D'Ancona","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Andrea Siddu","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Ornella Punzo","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Filippo Trentini","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Guzzetta","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Piero Poletti","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Paola Stefanelli","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Maria Rita Castrucci","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Ciervo","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Corrado Di Benedetto","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Marco Tallon","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Andrea Piccioli","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Silvio Brusaferro","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Rezza","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Stefano Merler","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Patrizio Pezzotti","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"COVID-19 working group","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"radiology and imaging"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.07.20049049","rel_title":"Is the impact of social distancing on coronavirus growth rates effective across different settings?

Data and Method Data from confirmed COVID-19 cases in Sichuan Province were obtained from the National Notifiable Diseases Reporting System (NNDRS) and field survey. We collected information on demographic, epidemiological, clinical characteristics, and the length of hospital stay for confirmed patients. We conducted an exploratory analysis using adjusted multivariate cox-proportional models. Participants A total of 538 confirmed patients of COVID-19 infection in Sichuan Province from January to March 2020. Outcome measure The length of hospital stay after admissions for confirmed patients. Results From January 16, 2020 to March 4, 2020, 538 human cases of COVID-19 infection were laboratory-confirmed, and were hospitalized for treatment. Among these, 271 (50%) were 45 years of age or above, 285 (53%) were male, 450 (84%) were considered as having mild symptoms. The median hospital length of stay was 19 days (interquartile range (IQR): 14-23, Range: 3-41). Adjusted multivariate analysis showed that longer hospital length of stay was associated with factors aged 45 and over (HR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.60-0.91), those admitted to provincial hospital (HR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.54-0.99), and those with serious illness (HR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.48-0.90); living in areas with more than 5.5 healthcare workers per 1000 population (HR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.05-1.65) was associated with shorter hospital length of stay. There was no gender difference. Conclusions Preparation control measures of COVID-19 should involve the allocation of sufficient medical resources, especially in areas with older vulnerable populations and in areas that lack basic medical resources.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"zhuo wang","author_inst":"Sichuan Center of Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"John S.

OBJECTIVE To investigate the role of several adjuvant treatments in preventing severe pneumonia in patients with COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multicenter, retrospective cohort study of 564 consecutively hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha Public Health Treatment Center, First Hospital of Yueyang, Junshan People's Hospital of Yueyang, Central Hospital of Shaoyang, Central Hospital of Xiangtan, Second Hospital of Changde, Central Hospital of Loudi, and First Affiliated Hospital of University of South China in Hunan province from January 17, 2020 to February 28, 2020; The final date of follow-up was March 15, 2020. EXPOSURES Nonspecific antivirals (arbidol, lopinavir\/ritonavir, and interferon ), antihypertensives, and chloroquine. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The development of severe COVID-19 pneumonia; Demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS Of 564 patients, the median age was 47 years (interquartile range, 36-58 years), and 284 (50.4%) patients were men. Sixty-nine patients (12.2%) developed severe pneumonia. Patients who developed severe pneumonia were older (median age of 59 and 45 years, respectively), and more patients had comorbidities including hypertension (30.4% and 12.3%, respectively), diabetes (17.4% and 6.7%, respectively), and cardiovascular disease (8.7% and 3.2%, respectively) and presented with fever (84.1% and 60.4%, respectively) and shortness of breath (10.1% and 3.8%, respectively) compared with those who did not. Nonspecific antiviral therapy did not prevent clinical progression to severe pneumonia, although fewer hypertensive patients on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ACEI\/ARB) therapy developed severe pneumonia in contrast with those on non-ACEI\/ARB antihypertensive therapy (1 of 16 [6.3%] patients and 16 of 49 [32.7%] patients, respectively [difference, 26.4%; 95% CI, 1.5% to 41.3%]). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that hypertension without receiving ACEI\/ARB therapy was an independent risk factor (odds ratio [OR], 2.07; 95% CI, 1.07 to 4.00) for developing severe pneumonia irrespective of age. Besides, none of patients treated with chloroquine developed severe pneumonia, though without significance (difference, 12.0%; 95% CI, -3.5% to 30.0%) by propensity score matching. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Hypertensive patients on ACEI or ARB may be protective from severe pneumonia in COVID-19 and hence these therapies should not be ceased unless there is a strong indication or further epidemiological evidence. Though none of the current antiviral and immunoregulation therapy showed benefit in preventing COVID-19 progression, chloroquine deserved further investigation.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhichao Feng","author_inst":"Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Li","author_inst":"Westmead Clinical School, Faculty of Medicine and Health, University of Sydney"},{"author_name":"Shanhu Yao","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Qizhi Yu","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Changsha"},{"author_name":"Wenming Zhou","author_inst":"Department of Medical Imaging, First Hospital of Yueyang"},{"author_name":"Xiaowen Mao","author_inst":"Department of Medical Imaging, Central Hospital of Shaoyang"},{"author_name":"Huiling Li","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Wendi Kang","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xin Ouyang","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Central Hospital of Xiangtan"},{"author_name":"Ji Mei","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Second Hospital of Changde"},{"author_name":"Qiuhua Zeng","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Central Hospital of Loudi"},{"author_name":"Jincai Liu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, First Affiliated Hospital of University of South China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqian Ma","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Pengfei Rong","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xianping Wu","author_inst":"Sichuan Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Guzzetta","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Piero Poletti","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Paola Stefanelli","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Maria Rita Castrucci","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Ciervo","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Corrado Di Benedetto","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Marco Tallon","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Andrea Piccioli","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Silvio Brusaferro","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Rezza","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Stefano Merler","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Patrizio Pezzotti","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"COVID-19 working group","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.08.20058578","rel_title":"The Role of Vitamin D in Suppressing Cytokine Storm in COVID-19 Patients and Associated Mortality","rel_date":"2020-04-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.08.20058578","rel_abs":"Abstract Objectives To investigate the possible role of Vitamin D (Vit D) deficiency via unregulated inflammation in COVID-19 complications and associated mortality. Design The time-adjusted case mortality ratio (T-CMR) was estimated as the number of deceased patients on day N divided by the number of confirmed cases on day N-8. The adaptive average of T-CMR (A-CMR) was further calculated as a metric of COVID-19 associated mortality in different countries. A model based on positivity change (PC) and an estimated prevalence of COVID-19 was developed to determine countries with similar screening strategies. Mean concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) in elderly individuals in countries with similar screening strategies were compared to investigate the potential impact of Vit D on A-CMR. We analyzed data showing a possible association between high C-Reactive Protein (CRP) concentration (CRP greater than or equal to 1 mg\/dL) and severe COVID-19. We estimated a link between Vit D status and high CRP in healthy subjects (CRP greater than or equal to 0.2 mg\/dL) with an adjustment for age and income to explore the possible role of Vit D in reducing complications attributed to unregulated inflammation and cytokine production. Data Sources Daily admission, recovery, and deceased rate data for patients with COVID-19 were collected from Kaggle as of April 20, 2020. Screening data were collected from Our World in Data and official statements from public authorities. The mean concentration of 25(OH)D among the elderly for comparison with A-CMR was collected from previously published studies from different countries. Chronic factor data used in regression analysis was obtained from published articles. The correlation between Vit D and CRP was calculated based on 9,212 subject-level data from NHANES, 2009-2010. Results A link between 25(OH)D and A-CMR in the US, France, Iran and the UK (countries with similar screening status) may exist. We observed an inverse correlation (correlation coefficient ranging from -0.84 to -1) between high CRP and 25(OH)D. Age and the family income status also correlated to high CRP and subjects with higher age and lower family income presented more incidences of high CRP. Our analysis determined a possible link between high CRP and Vit D deficiency and calculated an OR of 1.8 with 95%CI (1.2 to 2.6) among the elderly (age greater than or equal to 60 yo) in low-income families and an OR of 1.9 with 95%CI (1.4 to 2.7) among the elderly (age greater than or equal to 60 yo) in high-income families. COVID-19 patient-level data shows a notable OR of 3.4 with 95%CI (2.15 to 5.4) for high CRP in severe COVID-19 patients. Conclusion Given that CRP is a surrogate marker for cytokine storm and is associated with Vit D deficiency, based on retrospective data and indirect evidence we see a possible role of Vit D in reducing complications attributed to unregulated inflammation and cytokine storm. Further research is needed to account for other factors through direct measurement of Vit D levels in COVID-19 patients.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ali Daneshkhah","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Vasundhara Agrawal","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Adam Eshein","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Hariharan Subramanian","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Hemant Kumar Roy","author_inst":"Boston Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Vadim Backman","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Huiling Li","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Wendi Kang","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xin Ouyang","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Central Hospital of Xiangtan"},{"author_name":"Ji Mei","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Second Hospital of Changde"},{"author_name":"Qiuhua Zeng","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Central Hospital of Loudi"},{"author_name":"Jincai Liu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, First Affiliated Hospital of University of South China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqian Ma","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Pengfei Rong","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xianping Wu","author_inst":"Sichuan Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Guzzetta","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Piero Poletti","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Paola Stefanelli","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Maria Rita Castrucci","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Ciervo","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Corrado Di Benedetto","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Marco Tallon","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Andrea Piccioli","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Silvio Brusaferro","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Rezza","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Stefano Merler","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Patrizio Pezzotti","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"COVID-19 working group","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.07.20051474","rel_title":"Variation in False Negative Rate of RT-PCR Based SARS-CoV-2 Tests by Time Since Exposure","rel_date":"2020-04-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.07.20051474","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR based tests are being used to rule out infection among high-risk individuals such as exposed inpatients and healthcare workers. It is critical to understand how the predictive value of the test varies with time from exposure and symptom onset in order to avoid being falsely reassured by negative tests. As such, the goal of our study was to estimate the false negative rate by day since infection. We used previously published data on RT-PCR sensitivity on samples derived from nasal swabs by day since symptom onset (n=633) and fit a cubic polynomial spline to calculate the false negative rate by day since exposure and symptom onset. Over the four days of infection prior to the typical time of symptom onset (day 5) the probability of a false negative test in an infected individual falls from 100% on day one (95% CI 69-100%) to 61% on day four (95% CI 18-98%), though there is considerable uncertainty in these numbers. On the day of symptom onset, the median false negative rate was 39% (95% CI 16-77%). This decreased to 26% (95% CI 18-34%) on day 8 (3 days after symptom onset), then began to rise again, from 27% (95% CI 20-34%) on day 9 to 61% (95% CI 54-67%) on day 21. Care must be taken when interpreting RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly if performed early in the course of infection, when using these results as a basis for removing precautions intended to prevent onward transmission. If there is high clinical suspicion, patients should not be ruled out on the basis of RT-PCR alone, and the clinical and epidemiologic situation should be carefully considered.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lauren Kucirka","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Stephen Lauer","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Oliver Laeyendecker","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Denali Boon","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Justin Lessler","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Vadim Backman","author_inst":"Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Huiling Li","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Wendi Kang","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xin Ouyang","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Central Hospital of Xiangtan"},{"author_name":"Ji Mei","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Second Hospital of Changde"},{"author_name":"Qiuhua Zeng","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Central Hospital of Loudi"},{"author_name":"Jincai Liu","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, First Affiliated Hospital of University of South China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoqian Ma","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Pengfei Rong","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Wei Wang","author_inst":"Department of Radiology, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Xianping Wu","author_inst":"Sichuan Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Guzzetta","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Piero Poletti","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Paola Stefanelli","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Maria Rita Castrucci","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Ciervo","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Corrado Di Benedetto","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Marco Tallon","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Andrea Piccioli","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Silvio Brusaferro","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Rezza","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"Stefano Merler","author_inst":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler"},{"author_name":"Patrizio Pezzotti","author_inst":"Istituto Superiore di Sanita"},{"author_name":"COVID-19 working group","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.07.20051060","rel_title":"The respiratory sound features of COVID-19 patients fill gaps between clinical data and screening methods","rel_date":"2020-04-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.07.20051060","rel_abs":"Background: The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has continuous outbreaks around the world. Lung is the main organ that be involved. There is a lack of clinical data on the respiratory sounds of COVID-19 infected pneumonia, which includes invaluable information concerning physiology and pathology. The medical resources are insufficient, which are now mainly supplied for the severe patients. The development of a convenient and effective screening method for mild or asymptomatic suspicious patients is highly demanded. Methods: This is a retrospective case series study. 10 patients with positive results of nucleic acid were enrolled in this study. Lung auscultation was performed by the same physician on admission using a hand-held portable electronic stethoscope delivered in real time via Bluetooth. The recorded audio was exported, and was analyzed by six physicians. Each physician individually described the abnormal breathing sounds that he heard. The results were analyzed in combination with clinical data. Signal analysis was used to quantitatively describe the most common abnormal respiratory sounds. Results: All patients were found abnormal breath sounds at least by 3 physicians, and one patient by all physicians. Cackles, asymmetrical vocal resonance and indistinguishable murmurs are the most common abnormal breath sounds. One asymptomatic patient was found vocal resonance, and the result was correspondence with radiographic computed tomography. Signal analysis verified the credibility of the above abnormal breath sounds. Conclusions: This study describes respiratory sounds of patients with COVID-19, which fills up for the lack of clinical data and provides a simple screening method for suspected patients.","rel_num_authors":33,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ying hui Huang","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping, Nanping"},{"author_name":"Si jun Meng","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yi Zhang","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shui sheng Wu","author_inst":"Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yu Zhang","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Ya wei Zhang","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yi xiang Ye","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"},{"author_name":"Qi feng Wei","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"},{"author_name":"Nian gui Zhao","author_inst":"The Second Afficiated Hospital of Xiamen Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jian ping Jiang","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xiao ying Ji","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Chun xia Zhou","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Chao Zheng","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of XiaMen University"},{"author_name":"Wen Zhang","author_inst":"Friedman Brain Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Li zhong Xie","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yong chao Hu","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jian quan He","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jian Chen","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wang yue Wang","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Chang hua Zhang","author_inst":"Center for Digestive Disease, the Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Liming Cao","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Wen Xu","author_inst":"Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yunhong Lei","author_inst":"Department of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, The First College of Clinical Medical Science, T"},{"author_name":"Zheng hua Jian","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"},{"author_name":"Wei ping Hu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of XiaMen University"},{"author_name":"Wen juan Qin","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wan yu Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of XiaMen University"},{"author_name":"Yu long He","author_inst":"The First College of Clinical Medical Science"},{"author_name":"Hang Xiao","author_inst":"Jiying (XiaMen) Technology Co."},{"author_name":"Xiao fang Zheng","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yi Qun Hu","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wen Sheng Pan","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jian feng Cai","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.06.20053124","rel_title":"Recent update on COVID-19 in India: Is locking down the country enough?","rel_date":"2020-04-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.06.20053124","rel_abs":"Abstract Background: India is the second-largest population in the world, and it is not well equipped, hitherto, in the scenario of the global pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 could impart a devastating impact on the Indian population. Only way to respond against this critical condition is by practicing large-scale social distancing. India lock down for 21 days, however, till 7 April 2020, SARS-CoV-2 positive cases were growing exponentially, which raises the concerns if the number of reported and actual cases are similar. Methods: We use Lasso Regression with =0.12 and Polynomial features of degree 2 to predict the growth factor. Also, we predicted Logistic curve using the Prophet Python. Further, using the growth rate to logistic, and carrying capacity is 20000 allowed us to calculate the maximum cases and new cases per day. Results: We found the predicted growth factor with a standard deviation of 0.3443 for the upcoming days. When the growth factor becomes 1.0, which is known as Inflection point, it will be safe to state that the rate is no longer exponential. The estimated time to reach the inflection point is between 15-20 April. At that time, the estimated number of total positive cases will be over 12500, if lockdown remains continue. Conclusions: Our analysis suggests that there is an urgent need to take action to extend the period of lockdown and allocate enough resources, including personnel, beds, and intensive care facilities, to manage the situation in the next few days and weeks. Otherwise, the outbreak in India can reach the level of the USA or Italy or could be worse than these countries within a few days or weeks, given the size of the population and lack of resources.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jitender Singh Virk","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology, IIT Ropar"},{"author_name":"Syed Azmal Ali","author_inst":"National Dairy Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Gurjeet Kaur","author_inst":"University of New South Wales"},{"author_name":"Shui sheng Wu","author_inst":"Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yu Zhang","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Ya wei Zhang","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yi xiang Ye","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"},{"author_name":"Qi feng Wei","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"},{"author_name":"Nian gui Zhao","author_inst":"The Second Afficiated Hospital of Xiamen Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jian ping Jiang","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xiao ying Ji","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Chun xia Zhou","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Chao Zheng","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of XiaMen University"},{"author_name":"Wen Zhang","author_inst":"Friedman Brain Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Li zhong Xie","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yong chao Hu","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jian quan He","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jian Chen","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wang yue Wang","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Chang hua Zhang","author_inst":"Center for Digestive Disease, the Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Liming Cao","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Wen Xu","author_inst":"Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yunhong Lei","author_inst":"Department of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, The First College of Clinical Medical Science, T"},{"author_name":"Zheng hua Jian","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"},{"author_name":"Wei ping Hu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of XiaMen University"},{"author_name":"Wen juan Qin","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wan yu Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of XiaMen University"},{"author_name":"Yu long He","author_inst":"The First College of Clinical Medical Science"},{"author_name":"Hang Xiao","author_inst":"Jiying (XiaMen) Technology Co."},{"author_name":"Xiao fang Zheng","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yi Qun Hu","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wen Sheng Pan","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jian feng Cai","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.08.20057281","rel_title":"Spatial modeling cannot currently differentiate SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and human distributions on the basis of climate in the United States","rel_date":"2020-04-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.08.20057281","rel_abs":"The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is wreaking havoc globally, yet knowledge of its biology is limited. Climate and seasonality influence the distributions of many diseases, and studies suggest a link between SARS-CoV-2 and cool weather. One such study, building species distribution models (SDMs), predicted SARS-CoV-2 risk may remain concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere, shifting northward in summer months. Others have highlighted issues with SARS-CoV-2 SDMs, notably: the primary niche of the virus is the host it infects, climate may be a weak distributional predictor, global prevalence data have issues, and the virus is not in a population equilibrium. While these issues should be considered, climate still may be important for predicting the future distribution of SARS-CoV-2. To further examine if there is a link, we model with raw cases and population scaled cases for SARS-CoV-2 county-level data from the United States. We show that SDMs built from population scaled cases data cannot be distinguished from control models built from raw human population data, while SDMs built on raw data fail to predict the current known distribution of cases in the US. The population scaled analyses indicate that climate may not play a central role in current US viral distribution and that human population density is likely a primary driver. Still, we do find slightly more population scaled viral cases in cooler areas. This coupled with our geographically constrained focus make it so we cannot rule out climate as a partial driver of the US SARS-CoV-2 distribution. Climate's role on SARS-CoV-2 should continue to be cautiously examined, but at this time we should assume that SARS-CoV-2 can spread anywhere in the US.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robert S Harbert","author_inst":"Stonehill College"},{"author_name":"Seth W Cunningham","author_inst":"American Museum of Natural History"},{"author_name":"Michael Tessler","author_inst":"American Museum of Natural History"},{"author_name":"Shui sheng Wu","author_inst":"Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yu Zhang","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Ya wei Zhang","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yi xiang Ye","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"},{"author_name":"Qi feng Wei","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"},{"author_name":"Nian gui Zhao","author_inst":"The Second Afficiated Hospital of Xiamen Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jian ping Jiang","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xiao ying Ji","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Chun xia Zhou","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Chao Zheng","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of XiaMen University"},{"author_name":"Wen Zhang","author_inst":"Friedman Brain Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Li zhong Xie","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yong chao Hu","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jian quan He","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jian Chen","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wang yue Wang","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Chang hua Zhang","author_inst":"Center for Digestive Disease, the Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Liming Cao","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Wen Xu","author_inst":"Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yunhong Lei","author_inst":"Department of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, The First College of Clinical Medical Science, T"},{"author_name":"Zheng hua Jian","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"},{"author_name":"Wei ping Hu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of XiaMen University"},{"author_name":"Wen juan Qin","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wan yu Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of XiaMen University"},{"author_name":"Yu long He","author_inst":"The First College of Clinical Medical Science"},{"author_name":"Hang Xiao","author_inst":"Jiying (XiaMen) Technology Co."},{"author_name":"Xiao fang Zheng","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yi Qun Hu","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wen Sheng Pan","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jian feng Cai","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.07.20052340","rel_title":"COVID-19 UK Lockdown Forecasts and R0","rel_date":"2020-04-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.07.20052340","rel_abs":"Introduction The first reported UK case of COVID-19 occurred on 31 January 2020, and a lockdown of unknown duration began on 24 March. One model to forecast disease spread depends on clinical parameters and transmission rates. Output includes the basic reproduction number R0 and the log growth rate r in the exponential phase. Methods UK data on reported deaths is used to estimate r. A likelihood for the transmission parameters is defined from a gaussian density for r using the mean and standard error of the estimate. Parameter samples from the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm lead to an estimate and credible interval for R0 and forecasts for severe and critical cases, and deaths during a lockdown. Results In the exponential phase, the UK growth rate for log(deaths) is r = 0.224 with s.e. 0.005. R0 = 5.81 with 90% CI (5.08 , 6.98). In a 12 week lockdown from 24 March with transmission parameters reduced to 20% of their previous values, around 63,000 severely ill patients will need hospitalisation by mid June, 37,000 critically ill will need intensive care, whilst over 81,000 are expected to die. Had the lockdown begun on 17 March around 16,500 severe, 9,250 critical cases and 18,500 deaths would be expected by early June. With 10% transmission, severe and critical cases peak in April. Discussion The R0 estimate is around twice the value quoted by the UK government. The NHS faces extreme pressures, even if transmission is reduced ten-fold. An earlier lockdown could have saved many lives.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Greg Dropkin","author_inst":"independent researcher"},{"author_name":"Seth W Cunningham","author_inst":"American Museum of Natural History"},{"author_name":"Michael Tessler","author_inst":"American Museum of Natural History"},{"author_name":"Shui sheng Wu","author_inst":"Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yu Zhang","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Ya wei Zhang","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yi xiang Ye","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"},{"author_name":"Qi feng Wei","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"},{"author_name":"Nian gui Zhao","author_inst":"The Second Afficiated Hospital of Xiamen Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jian ping Jiang","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xiao ying Ji","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Chun xia Zhou","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Chao Zheng","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of XiaMen University"},{"author_name":"Wen Zhang","author_inst":"Friedman Brain Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Li zhong Xie","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yong chao Hu","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jian quan He","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jian Chen","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wang yue Wang","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Chang hua Zhang","author_inst":"Center for Digestive Disease, the Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Liming Cao","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Wen Xu","author_inst":"Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yunhong Lei","author_inst":"Department of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, The First College of Clinical Medical Science, T"},{"author_name":"Zheng hua Jian","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"},{"author_name":"Wei ping Hu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of XiaMen University"},{"author_name":"Wen juan Qin","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wan yu Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of XiaMen University"},{"author_name":"Yu long He","author_inst":"The First College of Clinical Medical Science"},{"author_name":"Hang Xiao","author_inst":"Jiying (XiaMen) Technology Co."},{"author_name":"Xiao fang Zheng","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yi Qun Hu","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wen Sheng Pan","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jian feng Cai","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.07.20057133","rel_title":"On Data-Driven Management of the COVID-19 Outbreak in South Africa","rel_date":"2020-04-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.07.20057133","rel_abs":"The rapid spread of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has highlighted the need for the development of rapid mitigating responses under conditions of extreme uncertainty.

In this work, we calibrate the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) compartmental model to South African data using initial conditions inferred from progression in Hubei, China and Lombardy, Italy. The results suggest two plausible hypotheses - either the COVID-19 pandemic is still at very early stages of progression in South Africa or a combination of prompt mitigating measures, demographics and social factors have resulted in a slowdown in its spread and severity. We further propose pandemic monitoring and health system capacity metrics for assisting decision-makers in evaluating which of the two hypotheses is most probable.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rendani Mbuvha","author_inst":"University of Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Tshilidzi Marwala","author_inst":"University of Johannesburg"},{"author_name":"Michael Tessler","author_inst":"American Museum of Natural History"},{"author_name":"Shui sheng Wu","author_inst":"Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yu Zhang","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Ya wei Zhang","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Yi xiang Ye","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"},{"author_name":"Qi feng Wei","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"},{"author_name":"Nian gui Zhao","author_inst":"The Second Afficiated Hospital of Xiamen Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jian ping Jiang","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xiao ying Ji","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Chun xia Zhou","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Chao Zheng","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of XiaMen University"},{"author_name":"Wen Zhang","author_inst":"Friedman Brain Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Li zhong Xie","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yong chao Hu","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jian quan He","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jian Chen","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wang yue Wang","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Chang hua Zhang","author_inst":"Center for Digestive Disease, the Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Liming Cao","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Wen Xu","author_inst":"Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yunhong Lei","author_inst":"Department of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, The First College of Clinical Medical Science, T"},{"author_name":"Zheng hua Jian","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"},{"author_name":"Wei ping Hu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of XiaMen University"},{"author_name":"Wen juan Qin","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wan yu Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of XiaMen University"},{"author_name":"Yu long He","author_inst":"The First College of Clinical Medical Science"},{"author_name":"Hang Xiao","author_inst":"Jiying (XiaMen) Technology Co."},{"author_name":"Xiao fang Zheng","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yi Qun Hu","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wen Sheng Pan","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jian feng Cai","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.08.20057471","rel_title":"Protocol for a multicentre study of nosocomial SARS-CoV2 transmission The NOSO-COR Project","rel_date":"2020-04-10","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.08.20057471","rel_abs":"Introduction: The newly identified SARS-CoV2 can cause serious acute respiratory infections such as pneumonia with a mortality rate of approximately 2% to 4%. In the current context of high incidence rates of SARS-CoV2 in the community, a significant increase in the rate of nosocomial transmission is expected. The risk of nosocomial transmission could even be higher in low-income countries that have fragile healthcare systems. This protocol is intended to study and document suspected or confirmed cases of nosocomial SARS-CoV2 infection, the clinical spectrum and the determinants (risk factors\/protective) at participating hospitals. Methods and analysis: This will be an international multicentre prospective, observational, hospital-based study in adults and children. It will include volunteer patients, care givers and healthcare professionals in France and hospitals affiliated with the GABRIEL network. Demographic and clinical data will be collected using case-report forms designed especially for the purpose of the project. A nasopharyngeal swab will be collected and tested for SARS-CoV2 by RT-PCR. Characteristics of the study participants, the proportion of confirmed nosocomial SARS-CoV2 infections relative to all patients with syndromes suggestive of 2019-nCoV infection will be analysed. Appropriate multivariate modelling will be used to identify the determinants associated with nosocomial onset. Ethics and dissemination: This study was approved by the clinical research and committee of Ile de France V on March 8, 2020. Registration details: The trial was registered in ClinicalTrials (NCT04290780).","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mitra Saadatian-Elahi","author_inst":"Laboratoire des Pathogenes Emergents, Fondation Merieux, Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie (CIRI), INSERM U1111, CNRS, Lyon, France AND Service"},{"author_name":"Valentina Picot-Sanchez","author_inst":"Fondation Merieux, France"},{"author_name":"Laetitia Henaff","author_inst":"Laboratoire des Pathogenes Emergents, Fondation Merieux, Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie (CIRI), INSERM U1111, CNRS, Lyon, France"},{"author_name":"Florence Pradel","author_inst":"Fondation Merieux , France"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Escuret","author_inst":"Laboratoire de Virologie, Institut des Agents Infectieux, Hopital de la Croix Rousse, Hospices Civils de Lyon, France"},{"author_name":"Cedric Dananche","author_inst":"Laboratoire des Pathogenes Emergents, Fondation Merieux, Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie (CIRI), INSERM U1111, CNRS, Lyon, France AND Service"},{"author_name":"Christelle Elias","author_inst":"Laboratoire des Pathogenes Emergents, Fondation Merieux, Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie (CIRI), INSERM U1111, CNRS, Lyon, France AND Service"},{"author_name":"Hubert Endtz","author_inst":"Fondation Merieux, France"},{"author_name":"Philippe Vanhems","author_inst":"Laboratoire des Pathogenes Emergents, Fondation Merieux, Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie (CIRI), INSERM U1111, CNRS, Lyon, France AND Service"},{"author_name":"Jian ping Jiang","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Xiao ying Ji","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Chun xia Zhou","author_inst":"The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Chao Zheng","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of XiaMen University"},{"author_name":"Wen Zhang","author_inst":"Friedman Brain Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Li zhong Xie","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yong chao Hu","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jian quan He","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Jian Chen","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wang yue Wang","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Chang hua Zhang","author_inst":"Center for Digestive Disease, the Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Liming Cao","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Wen Xu","author_inst":"Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yunhong Lei","author_inst":"Department of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, The First College of Clinical Medical Science, T"},{"author_name":"Zheng hua Jian","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"},{"author_name":"Wei ping Hu","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of XiaMen University"},{"author_name":"Wen juan Qin","author_inst":"Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wan yu Wang","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of XiaMen University"},{"author_name":"Yu long He","author_inst":"The First College of Clinical Medical Science"},{"author_name":"Hang Xiao","author_inst":"Jiying (XiaMen) Technology Co."},{"author_name":"Xiao fang Zheng","author_inst":"Pucheng County Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yi Qun Hu","author_inst":"Xiamen University"},{"author_name":"Wen Sheng Pan","author_inst":"Zhejiang provincial people's hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jian feng Cai","author_inst":"First Hospital of Nanping"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"}]}
