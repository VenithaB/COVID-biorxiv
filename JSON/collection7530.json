Cell membrane bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and associated proteases, transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and Cathepsin L (CTSL), were previously identified as mediators of SARS-CoV2 cellular entry. Here, we assess the cell type-specific RNA expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL through an integrated analysis of 107 single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-Seq studies, including 22 lung and airways datasets (16 unpublished), and 85 datasets from other diverse organs. Joint expression of ACE2 and the accessory proteases identifies specific subsets of respiratory epithelial cells as putative targets of viral infection in the nasal passages, airways, and alveoli. Cells that co-express ACE2 and proteases are also identified in cells from other organs, some of which have been associated with COVID-19 transmission or pathology, including gut enterocytes, corneal epithelial cells, cardiomyocytes, heart pericytes, olfactory sustentacular cells, and renal epithelial cells. Performing the first meta-analyses of scRNA-seq studies, we analyzed 1,176,683 cells from 282 nasal, airway, and lung parenchyma samples from 164 donors spanning fetal, childhood, adult, and elderly age groups, associate increased levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL in specific cell types with increasing age, male gender, and smoking, all of which are epidemiologically linked to COVID-19 susceptibility and outcomes. Notably, there was a particularly low expression of ACE2 in the few young pediatric samples in the analysis. Further analysis reveals a gene expression program shared by ACE2+TMPRSS2+ cells in nasal, lung and gut tissues, including genes that may mediate viral entry, subtend key immune functions, and mediate epithelial-macrophage cross-talk. Amongst these are IL6, its receptor and co-receptor, IL1R, TNF response pathways, and complement genes. Cell type specificity in the lung and airways and smoking effects were conserved in mice. Our analyses suggest that differences in the cell type-specific expression of mediators of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry may be responsible for aspects of COVID-19 epidemiology and clinical course, and point to putative molecular pathways involved in disease susceptibility and pathogenesis.","rel_num_authors":103,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christoph Muus","author_inst":"Broad Institute"},{"author_name":"Malte D Luecken","author_inst":"Institute of Computational Biology, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Gokcen Eraslan","author_inst":"Klarman Cell Observatory, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA"},{"author_name":"Avinash Waghray","author_inst":"Center for Regenerative Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA Departments of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Pulmonary and Critical Care U"},{"author_name":"Graham Heimberg","author_inst":"Klarman Cell Observatory, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA"},{"author_name":"Lisa Sikkema","author_inst":"Institute of Computational Biology, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Yoshihiko Kobayashi","author_inst":"Department of Cell Biology, Duke University Medical School, Durham, NC 27710, USA"},{"author_name":"Eeshit Dhaval Vaishnav","author_inst":"Klarman Cell Observatory, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge,"},{"author_name":"Ayshwarya Subramanian","author_inst":"Klarman Cell Observatory, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA"},{"author_name":"Christopher Smillie","author_inst":"Klarman Cell Observatory, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA"},{"author_name":"Karthik Jagadeesh","author_inst":"Klarman Cell Observatory, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Thu Duong","author_inst":"University of California San Diego Department of Pediatrics, Division of Respiratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Evgenij Fiskin","author_inst":"Klarman Cell Observatory, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA"},{"author_name":"Elena Torlai Triglia","author_inst":"Klarman Cell Observatory, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard,  Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA"},{"author_name":"Christophe Becavin","author_inst":"Universite Cote dAzur, CNRS, IPMC, Sophia-Antipolis, 06560, France"},{"author_name":"Meshal Ansari","author_inst":"Comprehensive Pneumology Center (CPC) \/ Institute of Lung Biology and Disease (ILBD), Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Member of the German Center for Lung Research ("},{"author_name":"Peiwen Cai","author_inst":"Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicineat Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA"},{"author_name":"Brian Lin","author_inst":"Center for Regenerative Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA Departments of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Pulmonary and Critical Care U"},{"author_name":"Justin Buchanan","author_inst":"Center for Epigenomics, University of California-San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA, 92093.

These viruses usually cause a mild to moderate upper respiratory tract infection, however, they can also cause more severe symptoms, gastrointestinal and central nervous system diseases. These viruses are capable of flexibly adapting to new environments, hence health threats from coronavirus are constant and long-term. Immunogenic spike proteins are glyco-proteins found on the surface of Coronaviridae particles that mediate entry to host cells. The aim of this study was to train deep learning neural networks to produce simulated spike protein sequences, which may be able to aid in knowledge and\/or vaccine design by creating alternative possible spike sequences that could arise from zoonotic sources in future.\n\nResultsHere we have trained deep learning recurrent neural networks (RNN) to provide computer-simulated coronavirus spike protein sequences in the style of previously known sequences and examine their characteristics. Training used a dataset of alpha, beta, gamma and delta coronavirus spike sequences. In a test set of 100 simulated sequences, all 100 had most significant BLAST matches to Spike proteins in searches against NCBI non-redundant dataset (NR) and also possessed concomitant Pfam domain matches.\n\nConclusionsSimulated sequences from the neural network may be able to guide us in future with prospective targets for vaccine discovery in advance of a potential novel zoonosis. We may effectively be able to fast-forward through evolution using neural networks to investigate sequences that could arise.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lisa Caroline Crossman","author_inst":"SequenceAnalysis.co.uk & University of East Anglia, Norwich"},{"author_name":"Malte D Luecken","author_inst":"Institute of Computational Biology, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Gokcen Eraslan","author_inst":"Klarman Cell Observatory, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA"},{"author_name":"Avinash Waghray","author_inst":"Center for Regenerative Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA Departments of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Pulmonary and Critical Care U"},{"author_name":"Graham Heimberg","author_inst":"Klarman Cell Observatory, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA"},{"author_name":"Lisa Sikkema","author_inst":"Institute of Computational Biology, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Munich, Germany"},{"author_name":"Yoshihiko Kobayashi","author_inst":"Department of Cell Biology, Duke University Medical School, Durham, NC 27710, USA"},{"author_name":"Eeshit Dhaval Vaishnav","author_inst":"Klarman Cell Observatory, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge,"},{"author_name":"Ayshwarya Subramanian","author_inst":"Klarman Cell Observatory, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA"},{"author_name":"Christopher Smillie","author_inst":"Klarman Cell Observatory, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA"},{"author_name":"Karthik Jagadeesh","author_inst":"Klarman Cell Observatory, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Thu Duong","author_inst":"University of California San Diego Department of Pediatrics, Division of Respiratory Medicine"},{"author_name":"Evgenij Fiskin","author_inst":"Klarman Cell Observatory, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA"},{"author_name":"Elena Torlai Triglia","author_inst":"Klarman Cell Observatory, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard,  Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA"},{"author_name":"Christophe Becavin","author_inst":"Universite Cote dAzur, CNRS, IPMC, Sophia-Antipolis, 06560, France"},{"author_name":"Meshal Ansari","author_inst":"Comprehensive Pneumology Center (CPC) \/ Institute of Lung Biology and Disease (ILBD), Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Member of the German Center for Lung Research ("},{"author_name":"Peiwen Cai","author_inst":"Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicineat Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA"},{"author_name":"Brian Lin","author_inst":"Center for Regenerative Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA Departments of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Pulmonary and Critical Care U"},{"author_name":"Justin Buchanan","author_inst":"Center for Epigenomics, University of California-San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA, 92093.

Here, we compared a variety of replication features of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV and analysed the cytopathology caused by the two closely related viruses in the commonly used Vero E6 cell line. Compared to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 generated higher levels of intracellular viral RNA, but strikingly about 50-fold less infectious viral progeny was recovered from the culture medium. Immunofluorescence microscopy of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells established extensive cross-reactivity of antisera previously raised against a variety of nonstructural proteins, membrane and nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV. Electron microscopy revealed that the ultrastructural changes induced by the two SARS viruses are very similar and occur within comparable time frames after infection. Furthermore, we determined that the sensitivity of the two viruses to three established inhibitors of coronavirus replication (Remdesivir, Alisporivir and chloroquine) is very similar, but that SARS-CoV-2 infection was substantially more sensitive to pre-treatment of cells with pegylated interferon alpha. An important difference between the two viruses is the fact that - upon passaging in Vero E6 cells - SARS-CoV-2 apparently is under strong selection pressure to acquire adaptive mutations in its spike protein gene. These mutations change or delete a putative  furin-like cleavage site in the region connecting the S1 and S2 domains and result in a very prominent phenotypic change in plaque assays.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Natacha Ogando","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden"},{"author_name":"Timmothy Dalebout","author_inst":"Leiden University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jessika  C.

SARS-CoV-2 relies on its spike protein, in particular the receptor binding domain (RBD), to bind human cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for viral entry, and thus targeting RBD holds the promise for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this work, a competitive biopanning strategy of a phage display antibody library was applied to screen blocking antibodies against RBD. High-affinity antibodies were enriched after the first round using a standard panning process in which RBD-His recombinant protein was immobilized as a bait. At the next two rounds, immobilized ACE2-Fc and free RBD-His proteins were mixed with the enriched phage antibodies. Antibodies binding to RBD at epitopes different from ACE2-binding site were captured by the immobilized ACE2-Fc, forming a \"sandwich\" complex. Only antibodies competed with ACE2 for recognizing RBD at the same or similar epitopes can bind to the free RBD-His in the supernatant and be subsequently separated by the Ni-NTA magnetic beads. Top 1 lead from the competitive biopanning of a synthetic antibody library, Lib AB1, was produced as the full-length IgG1 format. It was proved to competitively block the binding of RBD to ACE2 protein, and potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection of ACE2-overexpressing Hela cells with IC50 values of 12nM. Nevertheless, top 1 lead from the standard biopanning of Lib AB1, can only bind to RBD in vitro but not have the blocking or neutralization activity. Our strategy can efficiently isolate the blocking antibodies of RBD, and it would speed up the discovery of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xin Zeng","author_inst":"School of Bioscience and Technology, Chengdu Medical College; ABLINK Biotech Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Lingfang Li","author_inst":"ABLINK Biotech Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Jing Lin","author_inst":"ABLINK Biotech Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Xinlei Li","author_inst":"ABLINK Biotech Co., Ltd; School of Bioscience and Technology, Chengdu Medical College"},{"author_name":"Bin Liu","author_inst":"ABLINK Biotech Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Yang Kong","author_inst":"ABLINK Biotech Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Shunze Zeng","author_inst":"ABLINK Biotech Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Jianhua Du","author_inst":"ABLINK Biotech Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Huahong Xiao","author_inst":"ABLINK Biotech Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Tao Zhang","author_inst":"School of Bioscience and Technology, Chengdu Medical College"},{"author_name":"Shelin Zhang","author_inst":"Kezhi People&[prime]s Air-Defense Equipment Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Jianghai Liu","author_inst":"School of Bioscience and Technology, Chengdu Medical College; ABLINK Biotech Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Evgenij Fiskin","author_inst":"Klarman Cell Observatory, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA"},{"author_name":"Elena Torlai Triglia","author_inst":"Klarman Cell Observatory, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard,  Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA"},{"author_name":"Christophe Becavin","author_inst":"Universite Cote dAzur, CNRS, IPMC, Sophia-Antipolis, 06560, France"},{"author_name":"Meshal Ansari","author_inst":"Comprehensive Pneumology Center (CPC) \/ Institute of Lung Biology and Disease (ILBD), Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Member of the German Center for Lung Research ("},{"author_name":"Peiwen Cai","author_inst":"Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicineat Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA"},{"author_name":"Brian Lin","author_inst":"Center for Regenerative Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA Departments of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Pulmonary and Critical Care U"},{"author_name":"Justin Buchanan","author_inst":"Center for Epigenomics, University of California-San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA, 92093.

Here, we investigate angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the host protein bound by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. We find that the ACE2 gene is under strong selection pressure in bats, the group in which the progenitors of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are hypothesized to have evolved, particularly in residues that contact SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. We detect positive selection in non-bat mammals in ACE2 but in a smaller proportion of branches than in bats, without enrichment of selection in residues that contact SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we evaluate similarity between humans and other species in residues that contact SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2, revealing potential susceptible species but also highlighting the difficulties of predicting spillover events. This work increases our understanding of the relationship between mammals, particularly bats, and coronaviruses, and provides data that can be used in functional studies of how host proteins are bound by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 strains.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hannah K.

As of 30 March 2020, 7,680 consensus sequences have been shared on GISAID, the principal repository for SARS-CoV-2 genetic information. These sequences are primarily consensus sequences from clinical and passaged samples, but few reports have looked at diversity of virus populations within individual hosts or cultures. Understanding such diversity is essential to understanding viral evolutionary dynamics. Here, we characterize within-host viral diversity from a primary isolate and passaged samples, all originally deriving from an individual returning from Wuhan, China, who was diagnosed with COVID-19 and subsequently sampled in Wisconsin, United States. We use a metagenomic approach with Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) GridION in combination with Illumina MiSeq to capture minor within-host frequency variants [&ge;]1%. In a clinical swab obtained from the day of hospital presentation, we identify 15 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) [&ge;]1% frequency, primarily located in the largest gene - ORF1a. While viral diversity is low overall, the dominant genetic signatures are likely secondary to population size changes, with some evidence for mild purifying selection throughout the genome. We see little to no evidence for positive selection or ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 within cell culture or in the primary isolate evaluated in this study.\n\nAuthor SummaryWithin-host variants are critical for addressing molecular evolution questions, identifying selective pressures imposed by vaccine-induced immunity and antiviral therapeutics, and characterizing interhost dynamics, including the stringency and character of transmission bottlenecks. Here, we sequenced SARS-CoV-2 viruses isolated from a human host and from cell culture on three distinct Vero cell lines using Illumina and ONT technologies. We show that SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences can remain stable through at least two serial passages on Vero 76 cells, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 can be propagated in cell culture in preparation for in-vitro and in-vivo studies without dramatic alterations of its genotype. However, we emphasize the need to deep-sequence viral stocks prior to use in experiments to characterize sub-consensus diversity that may alter outcomes.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gage Kahl Moreno","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin Madison"},{"author_name":"Katarina M Braun","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin Madison"},{"author_name":"Peter J Halfmann","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin Madison"},{"author_name":"Trent M Prall","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin Madison"},{"author_name":"Kasen K Riemersma","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin Madison"},{"author_name":"Amelia K Haj","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin Madison"},{"author_name":"Joseph Lalli","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin Madison"},{"author_name":"Kelsey R Florek","author_inst":"Wisconsin State Lab of Hygiene"},{"author_name":"Thomas C Friedrich","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin Madison"},{"author_name":"Yoshihiro Kawaoka","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin Madison"},{"author_name":"Shelin Zhang","author_inst":"Kezhi People&[prime]s Air-Defense Equipment Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Jianghai Liu","author_inst":"School of Bioscience and Technology, Chengdu Medical College; ABLINK Biotech Co., Ltd"},{"author_name":"Evgenij Fiskin","author_inst":"Klarman Cell Observatory, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA"},{"author_name":"Elena Torlai Triglia","author_inst":"Klarman Cell Observatory, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard,  Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA"},{"author_name":"Christophe Becavin","author_inst":"Universite Cote dAzur, CNRS, IPMC, Sophia-Antipolis, 06560, France"},{"author_name":"Meshal Ansari","author_inst":"Comprehensive Pneumology Center (CPC) \/ Institute of Lung Biology and Disease (ILBD), Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Member of the German Center for Lung Research ("},{"author_name":"Peiwen Cai","author_inst":"Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicineat Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA"},{"author_name":"Brian Lin","author_inst":"Center for Regenerative Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA Departments of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Pulmonary and Critical Care U"},{"author_name":"Justin Buchanan","author_inst":"Center for Epigenomics, University of California-San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA, 92093.

This study aims to analyze the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 in Spain\/Europe.\n\nMethodsMaximum likelihood phylogenetic and Bayesian phylodynamic analyses have been performed to estimate the most probable temporal and geographic origin of different phylogenetic clusters and the diffusion pathways of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nResultsPhylogenetic analyses of the first 28 SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences obtained from patients in Spain revealed that most of them are distributed in G and S clades (13 sequences in each) with the remaining two sequences branching in the V clade. Eleven of the Spanish viruses of the S clade and six of the G clade grouped in two different monophyletic clusters (S-Spain and G-Spain, respectively), with the S-Spain cluster also comprising 8 sequences from 6 other countries from Europe and the Americas. The most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was estimated in the city of Wuhan, China, around November 24, 2019, with a 95% highest posterior density (HPD) interval from October 30-December 17, 2019. The origin of S-Spain and G-Spain clusters were estimated in Spain around February 14 and 18, 2020, respectively, with a possible ancestry of S-Spain in Shanghai.\n\nConclusionsMultiple SARS-CoV-2 introductions have been detected in Spain and at least two resulted in the emergence of locally transmitted clusters, with further dissemination of one of them to at least 6 other countries. These results highlight the extraordinary potential of SARS-CoV-2 for rapid and widespread geographic dissemination.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Francisco D\u00edez Fuertes","author_inst":"Centro Nacional de Microbiolog\u00eda - Instituto de Salud Carlos III \/ IDIBAPS - Hospital Cl\u00ednic de Barcelona"},{"author_name":"Mar\u00eda Iglesias Caballero","author_inst":"Centro Nacional de Microbiolog\u00eda - Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Sara Monz\u00f3n","author_inst":"Unidad de Bioinform\u00e1tica - Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Pilar Jim\u00e9nez","author_inst":"Unidad de Gen\u00f3mica - Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Sarai Varona","author_inst":"Unidad de Bioinform\u00e1tica - Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Isabel Cuesta","author_inst":"Unidad de Bioinform\u00e1tica - Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"\u00c1ngel Zaballos","author_inst":"Unidad de Gen\u00f3mica - Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Michael M.

Therefore, we implemented immunoinformatics approach to design an efficient multi-epitopes vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.\n\nResultsThe designed vaccine construct has several immunodominant epitopes from structural proteins of Spike, Nucleocapsid, Membrane and Envelope. These peptides promote cellular and humoral immunity and Interferon gamma responses. In addition, these epitopes have antigenicity ability and no allergenicity probability. To enhance the vaccine immunogenicity, we used three potent adjuvants; Flagellin, a driven peptide from high mobility group box 1 as HP-91 and human beta defensin 3 protein. The physicochemical and immunological properties of the vaccine structure were evaluated. Tertiary structure of the vaccine protein was predicted and refined by I-Tasser and galaxi refine and validated using Rampage and ERRAT. Results of Ellipro showed 242 residues from vaccine might be conformational B cell epitopes. Docking of vaccine with Toll-Like Receptors 3, 5 and 8 proved an appropriate interaction between the vaccine and receptor proteins. In silico cloning demonstrated that the vaccine can be efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli.\n\nConclusionsThe designed multi epitope vaccine is potentially antigenic in nature and has the ability to induce humoral and cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV-2. This vaccine can interact appropriately with the TLR3, 5, and 8. Also, this vaccine has high quality structure and suitable characteristics such as high stability and potential for expression in Escherichia coli.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zahra Yazdani","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, Molecular and Cell Biology Research Center, School of Medicine, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran"},{"author_name":"Alireza Rafiei","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, Molecular and Cell Biology Research Center, School of Medicine, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran"},{"author_name":"Mohammadreza Yazdani","author_inst":"Department of Chemistry, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, 84156-83111, Iran"},{"author_name":"Reza Valadan","author_inst":"Department of Immunology, Molecular and Cell Biology Research Center, School of Medicine, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran"},{"author_name":"Sarai Varona","author_inst":"Unidad de Bioinform\u00e1tica - Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Isabel Cuesta","author_inst":"Unidad de Bioinform\u00e1tica - Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"\u00c1ngel Zaballos","author_inst":"Unidad de Gen\u00f3mica - Instituto de Salud Carlos III"},{"author_name":"Michael M.

Therefore, assays to measure how antibodies and sera affect Spike-mediated viral infection are important for studying immunity. Because SARS-CoV-2 is a biosafety-level-3 virus, one way to simplify such assays is to pseudotype biosafety-level-2 viral particles with Spike. Such pseudotyping has now been described for single-cycle lentiviral, retroviral and VSV particles, but the reagents and protocols are not widely available. Here we detail how to effectively pseudotype lentiviral particles with SARS-CoV-2 Spike and infect 293T cells engineered to express the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2. We also make all the key experimental reagents available in the BEI Resources repository of ATCC and the NIH. Furthermore, we demonstrate how these pseudotyped lentiviral particles can be used to measure the neutralizing activity of human sera or plasma against SARS-CoV-2 in convenient luciferase-based assays, thereby providing a valuable complement to ELISA-based methods that measure antibody binding rather than neutralization.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kate H.D.

The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus is called COVID-19, which is highly contagious and has an overall mortality rate of 6.96% as of May 4, 2020. There is no vaccine or antiviral available for SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we report our discovery of inhibitors targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). Using the FRET-based enzymatic assay, several inhibitors including boceprevir, GC-376, and calpain inhibitors II, and XII were identified to have potent activity with single-digit to submicromolar IC50 values in the enzymatic assay. The mechanism of action of the hits was further characterized using enzyme kinetic studies, thermal shift binding assays, and native mass spectrometry. Significantly, four compounds (boceprevir, GC-376, calpain inhibitors II and XII) inhibit SARS-CoV-2 viral replication in cell culture with EC50 values ranging from 0.49 to 3.37 M. Notably, boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII represent novel chemotypes that are distinct from known Mpro inhibitors. A complex crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with GC-376, determined at 2.15 [A] resolution with three monomers per asymmetric unit, revealed two unique binding configurations, shedding light on the molecular interactions and protein conformational flexibility underlying substrate and inhibitor binding by Mpro. Overall, the compounds identified herein provide promising starting points for the further development of SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chunlong Ma","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Michael D Sacco","author_inst":"University of South Florida"},{"author_name":"Brett Hurst","author_inst":"Utah State University"},{"author_name":"Julia A Townsend","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Yanmei Hu","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Tommy Szeto","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Xiujun Zhang","author_inst":"University of South Florida"},{"author_name":"Bart Tarbet","author_inst":"Utah State University"},{"author_name":"Michael T Marty","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"University of South Florida"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Neil P King","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Alejandro B Balazs","author_inst":"Ragon Institute"},{"author_name":"Jesse D Bloom","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Christophe Becavin","author_inst":"Universite Cote dAzur, CNRS, IPMC, Sophia-Antipolis, 06560, France"},{"author_name":"Meshal Ansari","author_inst":"Comprehensive Pneumology Center (CPC) \/ Institute of Lung Biology and Disease (ILBD), Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Member of the German Center for Lung Research ("},{"author_name":"Peiwen Cai","author_inst":"Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicineat Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA"},{"author_name":"Brian Lin","author_inst":"Center for Regenerative Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA Departments of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Pulmonary and Critical Care U"},{"author_name":"Justin Buchanan","author_inst":"Center for Epigenomics, University of California-San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA, 92093.

We constructed two independent lung protein interactome to reveal the signaling process on receptor activation and host protein hijacking machinery in the pathogenesis of virus. Further, we test the functional role of the hubs derived from both interactome. Most hubs proteins were differentially regulated on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Also, the proteins of viral replication hubs were related with cardiovascular disease, diabetes and hypertension confirming the vulnerability and severity of infection in the risk individual. Additionally, the hub proteins were closely linked with other viral infection, including MERS and HCoVs which suggest similar infection pattern in SARS-CoV-2. We identified five interconnecting cascades between hubs of both networks that show the preparation of optimal environment in the host for viral replication process upon receptor attachment. Interestingly, we propose that seven potential miRNAs, targeting the intermediate phase that connects receptor and viral replication process a better choice as a drug for SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ahmed Shiek","author_inst":"Drug discovery lab, Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, Chettinad Academy of Research and Education, Tamil Nadu India."},{"author_name":"Prabu Paramasivam","author_inst":"School of Medicine, Department of Neurology, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, University of New Mexico, USA."},{"author_name":"Kamal Raj","author_inst":"Madras Diabetic Research"},{"author_name":"Vishal Kumar","author_inst":"YRG CARE"},{"author_name":"Ram Murugesan","author_inst":"Drug discovery lab, Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, Chettinad Academy of Research and Education, Tamil Nadu India."},{"author_name":"RamaKrishanan V","author_inst":"Human Genetics lab, Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, Chettinad Academy of Research and Education, Tamil Nadu India."},{"author_name":"Xiujun Zhang","author_inst":"University of South Florida"},{"author_name":"Bart Tarbet","author_inst":"Utah State University"},{"author_name":"Michael T Marty","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"University of South Florida"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Neil P King","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Alejandro B Balazs","author_inst":"Ragon Institute"},{"author_name":"Jesse D Bloom","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Christophe Becavin","author_inst":"Universite Cote dAzur, CNRS, IPMC, Sophia-Antipolis, 06560, France"},{"author_name":"Meshal Ansari","author_inst":"Comprehensive Pneumology Center (CPC) \/ Institute of Lung Biology and Disease (ILBD), Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Member of the German Center for Lung Research ("},{"author_name":"Peiwen Cai","author_inst":"Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicineat Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA"},{"author_name":"Brian Lin","author_inst":"Center for Regenerative Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA Departments of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Pulmonary and Critical Care U"},{"author_name":"Justin Buchanan","author_inst":"Center for Epigenomics, University of California-San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA, 92093.

Internet search interest was found highly correlated with COVID-19 daily incidence in China, but not yet applied to the U.S. Therefore, we examined the association of search interest with COVID-19 daily incidence and deaths in the U.S. Methods: We extracted the COVDI-19 daily incidence and death data in the U.S. from two population-based datasets. The search interest of COVID-19 related terms was obtained using Google Trends. Pearson correlation test and general linear model were used to examine correlations and predict future trends, respectively. Results: There were 555,245 new cases and 22,019 deaths of COVID-19 reported in the U.S. from March 1 to April 12, 2020. The search interest of COVID, COVID pneumonia, and COVID heart were correlated with COVDI-19 daily incidence with about 12-day of delay (Pearson r=0.978, 0.978 and 0.979, respectively) and deaths with 19-day of delay (Pearson r=0.963, 0.958 and 0.970, respectively). The COVID-19 daily incidence and deaths appeared to both peak on April 10. The 4-day follow-up with prospectively collected data showed moderate to good accuracies for predicting new cases (Pearson r=-0.641 to -0.833) and poor to good acuracies for daily new deaths (Pearson r=0.365 to 0.935). Conclusions: Search terms related to COVID-19 are highly correlated with the trends in COVID-19 daily incidence and deaths in the U.S. The prediction-models based on the search interest trend reached moderate to good accuracies.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaoling Yuan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, Chin"},{"author_name":"Jie Xu","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Disease, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China"},{"author_name":"Sabiha Hussain","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, NJ, USA"},{"author_name":"He Wang","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, NJ, USA"},{"author_name":"Nan Gao","author_inst":"Department of Biological Sciences, Rutgers University Newark, NJ, USA"},{"author_name":"Lanjing Zhang","author_inst":"Princeton Medical Center\/Rutgers University"},{"author_name":"Xiujun Zhang","author_inst":"University of South Florida"},{"author_name":"Bart Tarbet","author_inst":"Utah State University"},{"author_name":"Michael T Marty","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"University of South Florida"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Neil P King","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Alejandro B Balazs","author_inst":"Ragon Institute"},{"author_name":"Jesse D Bloom","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Christophe Becavin","author_inst":"Universite Cote dAzur, CNRS, IPMC, Sophia-Antipolis, 06560, France"},{"author_name":"Meshal Ansari","author_inst":"Comprehensive Pneumology Center (CPC) \/ Institute of Lung Biology and Disease (ILBD), Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Member of the German Center for Lung Research ("},{"author_name":"Peiwen Cai","author_inst":"Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicineat Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA"},{"author_name":"Brian Lin","author_inst":"Center for Regenerative Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA Departments of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Pulmonary and Critical Care U"},{"author_name":"Justin Buchanan","author_inst":"Center for Epigenomics, University of California-San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA, 92093.

Recent reports suggest that 10-30% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are asymptomatic. Other studies report that some subjects have significant viral shedding prior to symptom onset. Since both asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic subjects can spread the disease, identifying such individuals is critical for effective control of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Therefore, there is an urgent need to increase diagnostic testing capabilities in order to also screen asymptomatic carriers. In fact, such tests will be routinely required until a vaccine is developed. Yet, a major bottleneck of managing the COVID-19 pandemic in many countries is diagnostic testing, due to limited laboratory capabilities as well as limited access to genome-extraction and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) reagents. We developed P-BEST - a method for Pooling-Based Efficient SARS-CoV-2 Testing, using a non-adaptive group-testing approach, which significantly reduces the number of tests required to identify all positive subjects within a large set of samples. Instead of testing each sample separately, samples are pooled into groups and each pool is tested for SARS-CoV-2 using the standard clinically approved PCR-based diagnostic assay. Each sample is part of multiple pools, using a combinatorial pooling strategy based on compressed sensing designed for maximizing the ability to identify all positive individuals. We evaluated P-BEST using leftover samples that were previously clinically tested for COVID-19. In our current proof-of-concept study we pooled 384 patient samples into 48 pools providing an 8-fold increase in testing efficiency. Five sets of 384 samples, containing 1-5 positive carriers were screened and all positive carriers in each set were correctly identified. P-BEST provides an efficient and easy-to-implement solution for increasing testing capacity that will work with any clinically approved genome-extraction and PCR-based diagnostic methodologies.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Noam Shental","author_inst":"Open University of Isarel"},{"author_name":"Shlomia Levy","author_inst":"Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"},{"author_name":"Shosh Skorniakov","author_inst":"Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"},{"author_name":"Vered Wuvshet","author_inst":"Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"},{"author_name":"Yonat Shemer-Avni","author_inst":"Soroka University Medical Center and Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"},{"author_name":"Angel Porgador","author_inst":"Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"},{"author_name":"Tomer Hertz","author_inst":"Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Bart Tarbet","author_inst":"Utah State University"},{"author_name":"Michael T Marty","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Yu Chen","author_inst":"University of South Florida"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"University of Arizona"},{"author_name":"Neil P King","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Alejandro B Balazs","author_inst":"Ragon Institute"},{"author_name":"Jesse D Bloom","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Christophe Becavin","author_inst":"Universite Cote dAzur, CNRS, IPMC, Sophia-Antipolis, 06560, France"},{"author_name":"Meshal Ansari","author_inst":"Comprehensive Pneumology Center (CPC) \/ Institute of Lung Biology and Disease (ILBD), Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Member of the German Center for Lung Research ("},{"author_name":"Peiwen Cai","author_inst":"Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicineat Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA"},{"author_name":"Brian Lin","author_inst":"Center for Regenerative Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA Departments of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Pulmonary and Critical Care U"},{"author_name":"Justin Buchanan","author_inst":"Center for Epigenomics, University of California-San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA, 92093.

Using a SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray developed in our lab, we comprehensively profiled both IgM and IgG antibodies in forty patients with early-stage COVID-19, influenza, or non-influenza who had similar symptoms. The results revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein is not an ideal biomarker for COVID-19 diagnosis because of its low immunogenicity, thus tests that rely on this marker alone will have a high false negative rate. Our data further suggest that the S protein subunit 1 receptor binding domain (S1-RBD) might be the optimal antigen for IgM antibody detection, while the S protein extracellular domain (S1+S2ECD) would be the optimal antigen for both IgM and IgG antibody detection. Notably, the combination of all IgM and IgG biomarkers can identify 87% and 73.3% COVID-19 patients, respectively. Finally, the COVID-19-specific antibodies are significantly correlated with the clinical indices of viral infection and acute myocardial injury (p[&le;]0.05). Our data may help understand the function of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and improve serology tests for rapid COVID-19 screening.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaomei Zhang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Xian Wu","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100730, Chi"},{"author_name":"Dan Wang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Minya Lu","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100730, Chi"},{"author_name":"Xin Hou","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100730, Chi"},{"author_name":"Hongye Wang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Te Liang","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Jiayu Dai","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Hu Duan","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Yingchun Xu","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100730, Chi"},{"author_name":"Yongzhe Li","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100730, Chi"},{"author_name":"Xiaobo Yu","author_inst":"State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Beijing Proteome Research Center, National Center for Protein Sciences-Beijing (PHOENIX Center), Beijing Institute of Lifeom"},{"author_name":"Alejandro B Balazs","author_inst":"Ragon Institute"},{"author_name":"Jesse D Bloom","author_inst":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"},{"author_name":"Christophe Becavin","author_inst":"Universite Cote dAzur, CNRS, IPMC, Sophia-Antipolis, 06560, France"},{"author_name":"Meshal Ansari","author_inst":"Comprehensive Pneumology Center (CPC) \/ Institute of Lung Biology and Disease (ILBD), Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Member of the German Center for Lung Research ("},{"author_name":"Peiwen Cai","author_inst":"Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicineat Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA"},{"author_name":"Brian Lin","author_inst":"Center for Regenerative Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA Departments of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Pulmonary and Critical Care U"},{"author_name":"Justin Buchanan","author_inst":"Center for Epigenomics, University of California-San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA, 92093.

We report onset, course, correlations with comorbidities, and diagnostic accuracy of nasopharyngeal swab in 539 individuals suspected to carry SARS-COV-2 admitted to the hospital of Crema, Italy. All individuals underwent clinical and laboratory exams, SARS-COV-2 reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction on nasopharyngeal swab, and chest X-ray and\/or computed tomography (CT). Data on onset, course, comorbidities, number of drugs including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-II-receptor antagonists (sartans), follow-up swab, pharmacological treatments, non-invasive respiratory support, ICU admission, and deaths were recorded. Among 411 SARS-COV-2 patients (66.6% males) median age was 70.5 years (range 1-99). Chest CT was performed in 317 (77.2%) and showed interstitial pneumonia in 304 (96%). Fatality rate was 17.5% (74% males), with 6.6% in 60-69 years old, 21.1% in 70-79 years old, 38.8% in 80-89 years old, and 83.3% above 90 years. No death occurred below 60 years. Non-invasive respiratory support rate was 27.2% and ICU admission 6.8%. Older age, cough and dyspnea at onset, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, renal insufficiency, >7 drugs intake and positive X-ray, low lymphocyte count, high C-reactive protein, aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase values, and low PO2 partial pressure with high lactate at arterial blood gas analysis at admission were significantly associated with death. Use of ACE inhibitors or sartans was not associated with outcomes. Comorbidity network analysis revealed homogenous distribution of deceased and 60-80 aged SARS-COV-2 patients across diseases. Among 128 swab negative patients at admission (63.3% males) median age was 67.7 years (range 1-98). Chest CT was performed in 87 (68%) and showed interstitial pneumonia in 76 (87.3%). Follow-up swab turned positive in 13 of 32 patients. Using chest CT at admission as gold standard on the entire study population of 539 patients, nasopharyngeal swab had 80% sensitivity. SARS-CoV-2 caused high mortality among patients older than 60 years and correlated with pre-existing multiorgan impairment. ACE inhibitors and sartans did not influence patients' outcome.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gianpaolo Benelli","author_inst":"Ospedale Maggiore di Crema, Crema, Italy"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta Buscarini","author_inst":"Ospedale Maggiore di Crema"},{"author_name":"Ciro Canetta","author_inst":"Ospedale Maggiore di Crema"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe La Piana","author_inst":"Ospedale Maggiore di Crema"},{"author_name":"Guido Merli","author_inst":"Ospedale Maggiore di Crema"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Scartabellati","author_inst":"Ospedale Maggiore di Crema"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Vigano","author_inst":"Ospedale Maggiore di Crema"},{"author_name":"Roberto Sfogliarini","author_inst":"Ospedale Maggiore di Crema"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Melilli","author_inst":"Ospedale Maggiore di Crema"},{"author_name":"Roberto Assandri","author_inst":"Ospedale Maggiore di Crema"},{"author_name":"Daniele Cazzato","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico \"Carlo Besta\", Milan"},{"author_name":"Davide Sebastiano Rossi","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico \"Carlo Besta\", Milan"},{"author_name":"Susanna Usai","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico \"Carlo Besta\", Milan"},{"author_name":"Guido Caldarelli","author_inst":"IMT School for Advanced Studies, Lucca"},{"author_name":"Tommaso Gili","author_inst":"IMT School for Advanced Studies, Lucca"},{"author_name":"Irene Tramacere","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico \"Carlo Besta\", Milan"},{"author_name":"Germano Pellegata","author_inst":"Ospedale Maggiore di Crema"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Lauria","author_inst":"IRCCS FONDAZIONE ISTITUTO NEUROLOGICO CARLO BESTA"},{"author_name":"Justin Buchanan","author_inst":"Center for Epigenomics, University of California-San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA, 92093.

For each volunteer, we first measured background aerosol levels in the room immediately prior to testing. We then measured aerosol levels while the healthy volunteer laid in bed - - with the head of bed at 30 degrees - - wearing the following oxygen delivery devices: (a) 6L\/min nasal canula (NC) with humidification; (b) non-re-breather mask (NRB) with 15L\/min gas flow, non-humidified; (c) HHFNC with 30L\/min gas flow; (d) HHFNC with 60L\/min gas flow. Two scanning mobility particle sizing (SMPS) systems (TSI 3080\/3030, TSI 3080\/3750) were used to measure aerosols 10 to 500 nanometer (nm) in size for each of the oxygen delivery devices. There was no variation in aerosol level within patients between room air, 6 L\/min NC, 15 L\/min NRB, 30 L\/min HHFNC, and 60 L\/min HHFNC, regardless of coughing.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Theodore John Iwashyna","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Andre Boehman","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jesse Capelcelatro","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Amy M Cohn","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"James M Cooke","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Deena Kelly Costa","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Richard M Eakin","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Hallie C Prescott","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Margaret S Woolridge","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Roberto Assandri","author_inst":"Ospedale Maggiore di Crema"},{"author_name":"Daniele Cazzato","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico \"Carlo Besta\", Milan"},{"author_name":"Davide Sebastiano Rossi","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico \"Carlo Besta\", Milan"},{"author_name":"Susanna Usai","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico \"Carlo Besta\", Milan"},{"author_name":"Guido Caldarelli","author_inst":"IMT School for Advanced Studies, Lucca"},{"author_name":"Tommaso Gili","author_inst":"IMT School for Advanced Studies, Lucca"},{"author_name":"Irene Tramacere","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico \"Carlo Besta\", Milan"},{"author_name":"Germano Pellegata","author_inst":"Ospedale Maggiore di Crema"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Lauria","author_inst":"IRCCS FONDAZIONE ISTITUTO NEUROLOGICO CARLO BESTA"},{"author_name":"Justin Buchanan","author_inst":"Center for Epigenomics, University of California-San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA, 92093.

Several preventive measures have been recommended to halt the spread of the disease and its associated mortality. However, the level knowledge and practice of these preventive measures against COVID-19 infection among pregnant women, which constitute vulnerable groups, are yet to be evaluated. Aim: To determine the knowledge and practice of preventive measures against COVID-19 infection among pregnant women in Abakaliki. Materials and Methods: This was a self-administered questionnaire-based cross-sectional study conducted from February 1, 2020 to March 31, 2020 among 284 antenatal clinic attendees at Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki, Ebonyi State. A pretested and validated questionnaire was used to collect the data. Data analysis was done using SPSS version 22. Results: Of 284 participants, 60.9% (n=173) had adequate knowledge of the preventive measures against COVID-19 infection. However, the overall practice of these preventive measures among the participants were poor as 69.7% of the participants were not practicing the preventive measures against the coronavirus. The determinants of poor practice of the preventive measures among the participants were being in age group 31-40 years (AOR=2.04, 95%CI: 1.26 - 5.37, p=0.022), married (AOR=2.99, 95%CI: 1.40 - 6.33, p=0.035) grandmultiparous (AOR=3.11, 95%CI: 1.32 - 6.56, p=0.021), residing in rural area (AOR=2.08, 95%CI: 1.32 - 4.05, p=0.031), and having no formal education (AOR=6.73, 95%CI: 2.66 - 18.34, p=0.002). Conclusion: The study showed that most of the participants had adequate knowledge of preventive measures against COVID-19 infection but the practice of these preventive measures were poor among the participants.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Johnbosco Ifunanya Nwafor","author_inst":"Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki, Ebonyi State, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Joseph Kenechi Aniukwu","author_inst":"Emergency Department, Qatif Central Hospital, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"},{"author_name":"Bonaventure Okechukwu Anozie","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki"},{"author_name":"Arinze Chidiebere Ikeotuonye","author_inst":"Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki."},{"author_name":"James M Cooke","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Deena Kelly Costa","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Richard M Eakin","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Hallie C Prescott","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Margaret S Woolridge","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Roberto Assandri","author_inst":"Ospedale Maggiore di Crema"},{"author_name":"Daniele Cazzato","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico \"Carlo Besta\", Milan"},{"author_name":"Davide Sebastiano Rossi","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico \"Carlo Besta\", Milan"},{"author_name":"Susanna Usai","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico \"Carlo Besta\", Milan"},{"author_name":"Guido Caldarelli","author_inst":"IMT School for Advanced Studies, Lucca"},{"author_name":"Tommaso Gili","author_inst":"IMT School for Advanced Studies, Lucca"},{"author_name":"Irene Tramacere","author_inst":"Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico \"Carlo Besta\", Milan"},{"author_name":"Germano Pellegata","author_inst":"Ospedale Maggiore di Crema"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Lauria","author_inst":"IRCCS FONDAZIONE ISTITUTO NEUROLOGICO CARLO BESTA"},{"author_name":"Justin Buchanan","author_inst":"Center for Epigenomics, University of California-San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA, 92093.

Patchy virological testing has hampered interpretation of confirmed case counts, and unknown rates of asymptomatic and mild infections make it challenging to develop evidence-based public health policies. Serological tests that identify past infection can be used to estimate cumulative incidence, but the relative accuracy and robustness of various sampling strategies has been unclear. Here, we used a flexible framework that integrates uncertainty from test characteristics, sample size, and heterogeneity in seroprevalence across tested subpopulations to compare estimates from sampling schemes. Using the same framework and making the assumption that serological positivity indicates immune protection, we propagated these estimates and uncertainty through dynamical models to assess the uncertainty in the epidemiological parameters needed to evaluate public health interventions. We examined the relative accuracy of convenience samples versus structured surveys to estimate population seroprevalence, and found that sampling schemes informed by demographics and contact networks outperform uniform sampling. The framework can be adapted to optimize the design of serological surveys given particular test characteristics and capacity, population demography, sampling strategy, and modeling approach, and can be tailored to support decision-making around introducing or removing interventions.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel B Larremore","author_inst":"University of Colorado Boulder"},{"author_name":"Bailey K Fosdick","author_inst":"Colorado State University"},{"author_name":"Kate M Bubar","author_inst":"University of Colorado Boulder"},{"author_name":"Sam Zhang","author_inst":"University of Colorado Boulder"},{"author_name":"Stephen M Kissler","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

There is an urgent need for reliable antibody detection approaches to support diagnosis, vaccine development, safe release of individuals from quarantine, and population lock-down exit strategies. We set out to evaluate the performance of ELISA and lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) devices. Design: We tested plasma for COVID (SARS-CoV-2) IgM and IgG antibodies by ELISA and using nine different LFIA devices. Setting: We performed laboratory work at the University of Oxford. Participants: We used a panel of plasma samples from individuals who have had confirmed COVID infection based on a PCR result (n=40), and pre-pandemic negative control samples banked in the UK prior to December-2019 (n=142). Main outcome measures: We recorded optical density results from ELISA experiments and positive\/negative\/invalid results from LFIA devices. Results: ELISA detected IgM or IgG in 34\/40 individuals with a confirmed history of COVID infection (sensitivity 85%, 95%CI 70-94%), vs. 0\/50 pre-pandemic controls (specificity 100% [95%CI 93-100%]). IgG levels were detected in 31\/31 COVID-positive individuals tested [&ge;]10 days after symptom onset (sensitivity 100%, 95%CI 89-100%). IgG titres rose during the 3 weeks post symptom onset and began to fall by 8 weeks, but remained above the detection threshold. Point estimates for the sensitivity of LFIA devices ranged from 55-70% versus RT-PCR and 65-85% versus ELISA, with specificity 95-100% and 93-100% respectively. Within the limits of the study size, the performance of most LFIA devices was similar. Conclusions: Currently available commercial LFIA devices do not perform sufficiently well for individual patient applications. ELISA can be calibrated to be specific for detecting and quantifying SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG and is highly sensitive for IgG from 10 days following first symptoms.","rel_num_authors":71,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emily R Adams","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mark Ainsworth","author_inst":"Oxford University

We find an excess mortality that is correlated in time with the official COVID-19 death rate, but exceeds it by a factor of at least 1.5. Our analysis suggests that there is a large population of predominantly older people that are missing from the official fatality statistics. We estimate that the number of COVID-19 deaths in Italy is 49,000-53,000 as of May 9 2020, as compared to the official number of 33,000. The Population Fatality Rate (PFR) has reached 0.26% in the most affected region of Lombardia and 0.58% in the most affected province of Bergamo. These PFRs constitutes a lower bound to the Infection Fatality Rate (IFR). We combine the PFRs with the Test Positivity Ratio to derive a better lower bound of 0.61% on the IFR for Lombardia. We further estimate the IFR as a function of age and find a steeper age dependence than previous studies: we find 17% of COVID-related deaths are attributed to the age group above 90, 7.5% to 80-89, declining to 0.04% for age 40-49 and 0.01% for age 30-39, the latter more than an order of magnitude lower than previous estimates. We observe that the IFR traces the Yearly Mortality Rate (YMR) above ages of 60 years, which can be used as a model to estimate the IFR for other populations and thus other regions in the world. We predict an IFR lower bound of 0.5% for NYC and that 27% of the total COVID-19 fatalities in NYC should arise from the population below 65 years. This is in agreement with the official NYC data and three times higher than the percentage observed in Lombardia. Combining the PFR with the Princess Diamond cruise ship IFR for ages above 70 we estimate the infection rates (IR) for regions in Italy. These peak in Lombardia at 26% (13%-47%, 95% c.l.), and for provinces in Bergamo at 69% (35%- 100%, 95% c.l.). These estimates suggest that the number of infected people greatly exceeds the number of positive tests, e.g., by a factor of 35 in Lombardia.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chirag Modi","author_inst":"University of California, Berkeley"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Boehm","author_inst":"University of California,

These are the two questions we raise by studying the number of new cases arising after lockdowns in a few European countries. The analysis which purely relies on the publicly available data of the numbers of new infections, rather than extensive contact tracing of individual patients, suggests a memory of the infections in the community with a median of 13.3 days. This distribution of the memory of infections which may even be considered as a surrogate of the incubation time in a perfect lockdown, suggests that even a perfect quarantine of 30 days is only 90% complete.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Meher K Prakash","author_inst":"Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research"},{"author_name":"Vanessa

In this study, Greece is the main focus for assessing the national outbreak and estimating the general trends and outlook of it. Multiple data analytics procedures, spectral decomposition and curve-fitting formulations are developed based on the data available at hand. Standard SIEQRDP epidemic modelling is applied for Greece and for the general region around it, providing hints for the outbreak progression in the mid- and long-term, for various infections under-reporting rates. The overall short-term outlook for Greece seems to be towards positive, with a downward trend in infections rate daily increase (i.e., now beyond the exponential growth rate), a possible peak within a few days beyond April 14th, as well as the high availability level of ICU w.r.t. expected demand at peak. On the negative side, the fade-out period seems to be in the order of several months, with high probability of recurrent surges of the outbreak. The mitigation policies for the `next day' should be focused on close tracking of the epidemic via large-scale tests, strict border checking in international travelling and an adaptive plan for selective activation of mitigation measures when deemed necessary.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Harris V Georgiou","author_inst":"University of Piraeus"},{"author_name":"Vanessa

During the initial phase of the outbreak the spread was primarily determined by human mobility. Yet empirical evidence on the effect of key geographic factors on local epidemic spread is lacking. We analyse highly-resolved spatial variables for cities in China together with case count data in order to investigate the role of climate, urbanization, and variation in interventions across China. Here we show that the epidemic intensity of COVID-19 is strongly shaped by crowding, such that epidemics in dense cities are more spread out through time, and denser cities have larger total incidence. Observed differences in epidemic intensity are well captured by a metapopulation model of COVID-19 that explicitly accounts for spatial hierarchies. Densely-populated cities worldwide may experience more prolonged epidemics. Whilst stringent interventions can shorten the time length of these local epidemics, although these may be difficult to implement in many affected settings.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Benjamin Rader","author_inst":"Boston University, United States"},{"author_name":"Samuel Scarpino","author_inst":"Northeastern University, United States"},{"author_name":"Anjalika Nande","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Alison Hill","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Robert Reiner Jr.","author_inst":"Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, Seattle, USA"},{"author_name":"David Pigott","author_inst":"Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, Seattle, United States"},{"author_name":"Bernardo Gutierrez","author_inst":"University of Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Munik Shrestha","author_inst":"Northeastern University, United States"},{"author_name":"John Brownstein","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Marcia Castro","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

Faced with such brutally difficult decisions, it is essential that as many people as possible understand (1) why lock-down interventions represent the only realistic way for individual countries to contain their national-level epidemics before they turn into public health catastrophes, (2) why these need to be implemented so early, so aggressively and for such extended periods, and (3) why international co-operation to conditionally re-open trade and travel between countries that have successfully eliminated local transmission represents the only way to contain the pandemic at global level. Here we present simplified arithmetic models of COVID-19 transmission, control and elimination in user-friendly Shiny and Excel formats that allow non-specialists to explore, query, critique and understand the containment decisions facing their country and the world at large. Based on parameter values representative of the United Republic of Tanzania, which is still early enough in its epidemic cycle and response to avert a national catastrophe, national containment and elimination with less than 10 deaths is predicted for highly rigorous lock down within 5 weeks of the first confirmed cases and maintained for 15 weeks. However, elimination may only be sustained if case importation from outside the country is comprehensively contained by isolating for three weeks all incoming travellers, except those from countries certified as COVID-free in the future. Any substantive relaxation of these assumptions, specifically shortening the lock-down period, less rigorous lock-down or imperfect importation containment, may facilitate epidemic re-initiation, resulting in over half a million deaths unless rigorously contained a second time. Removing contact tracing and isolation has minimal impact on successful containment trajectories because high incidence of similar mild symptoms caused by other common pathogens attenuates detection success of COVID-19 testing. Nevertheless, contact tracing is recommended as an invaluable epidemiological surveillance platform for monitoring and characterizing the epidemic, and for understanding the influence of interventions on transmission dynamics.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gerry Killeen","author_inst":"Ifakara Health Institute"},{"author_name":"Samson Kiware","author_inst":"Ifakara Health Institute"},{"author_name":"Anjalika Nande","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Alison Hill","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Robert Reiner Jr.","author_inst":"Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, Seattle, USA"},{"author_name":"David Pigott","author_inst":"Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, Seattle, United States"},{"author_name":"Bernardo Gutierrez","author_inst":"University of Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Munik Shrestha","author_inst":"Northeastern University, United States"},{"author_name":"John Brownstein","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Marcia Castro","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

COVID-19 patient autopsies have revealed thrombi in the microvasculature, suggesting intravascular coagulation as a prominent feature of organ failure in these patients. Interestingly, in COVID-19, pulmonary compliance is preserved despite severe hypoxemia corroborating the hypothesis that perfusion mismatch may play a significant role in the development of respiratory failure. METHODS: We describe a series of 27 consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to Sirio-Libanes Hospital in Sao Paulo-Brazil and treated with heparin in therapeutic doses tailored to clinical severity. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: PaO2\/FiO2 ratio increased significantly over the 72 hours following the start of anticoagulation, from 254(SD 90) to 325(SD 80), p=0.013, and 81% of the patients were discharged home within a mean time of 11.4 (SD 7.9) days. Most mechanically ventilated patients (67%) were extubated within 12.5(SD 5.7) days. There were no bleeding complications or fatal events. Even though this uncontrolled case series does not offer absolute proof of DIC as the underlying mechanism of respiratory failure in COVID-19, patients positive response to tailored dose heparinization contributes to the understanding of the pathophysiological mechanism of the disease and provides valuable information for the treatment of these very sick patients while we await the results of further prospective controlled studies.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Elnara Marcia Negri","author_inst":"Sirio Libanes Hospital; LIM-59, University of Sao Paulo Medical School"},{"author_name":"Bruna Piloto","author_inst":"Heart Institute, University of Sao Paulo Medical School; Sirio-Libanes Hospital."},{"author_name":"Luciana Kato Morinaga","author_inst":"Heart Institute, University of Sao Paulo Medical School; Sirio Libanes Hospital"},{"author_name":"Carlos Viana Poyares Jardim","author_inst":"Heart Institute, University of Sao Paulo Medical School; Sirio Libanes Hospital"},{"author_name":"Shari Anne El-Dash Lamy","author_inst":"A.C.

Here we report that mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) initially seeded on FFR filter material is inactivated (6 log reduction as measured by 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50)) after dry heating at 75 {degrees}C for 30 minutes. We also find that the quantitative fit of FFRs after heat treatment at this temperature, under dry conditions or at 90% relative humidity, is not affected by single or ten heating cycles. Previous studies have reported that the filtration efficiency of FFR filters is not negatively impacted by these heating conditions. These results suggest that thermal inactivation of coronaviruses is a potentially rapid and widely deployable method to re-use N95 FFRs in emergency situations where re-using FFRs is a necessity and broad-spectrum sterilization is unavailable. However, we also found that a heat source that emits radiation (e.g., an exposed heating element) results in rapid qualitative degradation of the FFR. Finally, we discuss differences in the results reported here and other recent studies investing heat as a means to recycle FFRs and suggest that overall wear time and donning\/doffing cycles are important factors that need to be considered.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Travis Massey","author_inst":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Monica Borucki","author_inst":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Sam Paik","author_inst":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Kyle Fuhrer","author_inst":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Mihail Bora","author_inst":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Staci Kane","author_inst":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Razi Haque","author_inst":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"SALMAAN H BAXAMUSA","author_inst":"Lawrence Livermore National Security"},{"author_name":"John Brownstein","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Marcia Castro","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

However, as case numbers decrease, air travel will gradually resume. We considered a future scenario in which case numbers are low and air travel returns to normal. Under that scenario, there will be a risk of outbreaks in locations worldwide due to imported cases. We estimated the risk of different locations acting as sources of future COVID-19 outbreaks elsewhere. Methods: We use modelled global air travel data and population density estimates from locations worldwide to analyse the risk that 1364 airports are sources of future COVID-19 outbreaks. We use a probabilistic, branching-process based approach that considers the volume of air travelers between airports and the reproduction number at each location, accounting for local population density. Results: Under the scenario we model, we identify airports in East Asia as having the highest risk of acting as sources of future outbreaks. Moreover, we investigate the locations most likely to cause outbreaks due to air travel in regions that are large and potentially vulnerable to outbreaks: India, Brazil and Africa. We find that outbreaks in India and Brazil are most likely to be seeded by individuals travelling from within those regions. We find that this is also true for less vulnerable regions, such as the United States, Europe, and China. However, outbreaks in Africa due to imported cases are instead most likely to be initiated by passengers travelling from outside the continent. Conclusions: Variation in flight volumes and destination population densities create a non-uniform distribution of the risk that different airports pose of acting as the source of an outbreak. Accurate quantification of the spatial distribution of outbreak risk can therefore facilitate optimal allocation of resources for effective targeting of public health interventions.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yair Daon","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University"},{"author_name":"Robin N Thompson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Uri Obolski","author_inst":"Tel Aviv University"},{"author_name":"Kyle Fuhrer","author_inst":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Mihail Bora","author_inst":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Staci Kane","author_inst":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Razi Haque","author_inst":"Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"},{"author_name":"SALMAAN H BAXAMUSA","author_inst":"Lawrence Livermore National Security"},{"author_name":"John Brownstein","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Marcia Castro","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

Here we use RT-qPCR to monitor wastewater for SARS-CoV-2 RNA over a 52-day time course. We show that changes in SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations correlate with local COVID-19 epidemiological data (R2=0.9), though detection in wastewater trails symptom onset dates by 5-8 days. We determine a near-complete (98.5%) SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence from the wastewater and use phylogenic analysis to infer viral ancestry. Collectively, this work demonstrates how wastewater can be used as a proxy to monitor viral prevalence in the community and how genome sequencing can be used for high-resolution genotyping of the predominant strains circulating in a community.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Artem Nemudryi","author_inst":"Montana State University"},{"author_name":"Anna Nemudraia","author_inst":"Montana State University"},{"author_name":"Kevin Surya","author_inst":"Montana State University"},{"author_name":"Tanner Wiegand","author_inst":"Montana State University"},{"author_name":"Murat Buyukyoruk","author_inst":"Montana State University"},{"author_name":"Royce Wilkinson","author_inst":"Montana State University"},{"author_name":"Blake Wiedenheft","author_inst":"Montana State University"},{"author_name":"SALMAAN H BAXAMUSA","author_inst":"Lawrence Livermore National Security"},{"author_name":"John Brownstein","author_inst":"Harvard University"},{"author_name":"Marcia Castro","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.
