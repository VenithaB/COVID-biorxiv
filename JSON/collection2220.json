Long-read sequencing devices from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) promise significant improvements in turnaround time, portability and cost, compared to established short-read sequencing platforms for viral WGS (e.g., Illumina). However, adoption of ONT sequencing for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance has been limited due to common concerns around sequencing accuracy. To address this, we performed viral WGS with ONT and Illumina platforms on 157 matched SARS-CoV-2-positive patient specimens and synthetic RNA controls, enabling rigorous evaluation of analytical performance. Despite the elevated error rates observed in ONT sequencing reads, highly accurate consensus-level sequence determination was achieved, with single nucleotide variants (SNVs) detected at >99% sensitivity and >98% precision above a minimum ~60-fold coverage depth, thereby ensuring suitability for SARS-CoV-2 genome analysis. ONT sequencing also identified a surprising diversity of structural variation within SARS-CoV-2 specimens that were supported by evidence from short-read sequencing on matched samples. However, ONT sequencing failed to accurately detect short indels and variants at low read-count frequencies. This systematic evaluation of analytical performance for SARS-CoV-2 WGS will facilitate widespread adoption of ONT sequencing within local, national and international COVID-19 public health initiatives.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rowena A Bull","author_inst":"The Kirby Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia."},{"author_name":"Thiruni Adikari","author_inst":"The Kirby Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia."},{"author_name":"Jillian M Hammond","author_inst":"Kinghorn Centre for Clinical Genomics, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, NSW, Australia."},{"author_name":"Igor Stevanovski","author_inst":"Kinghorn Centre for Clinical Genomics, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, NSW, Australia."},{"author_name":"James M Ferguson","author_inst":"Kinghorn Centre for Clinical Genomics, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, NSW, Australia."},{"author_name":"Alicia G Beukers","author_inst":"NSW Health Pathology, Department of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney,"},{"author_name":"Zin Naing","author_inst":"Virology Research Laboratory, Serology and Virology Division (SAViD), NSW Health Pathology, Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia."},{"author_name":"Malinna Yeang","author_inst":"Virology Research Laboratory, Serology and Virology Division (SAViD), NSW Health Pathology, Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia."},{"author_name":"Andrey Verich","author_inst":"The Kirby Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia."},{"author_name":"Hasindu Gamaarachichi","author_inst":"Kinghorn Centre for Clinical Genomics, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, NSW, Australia."},{"author_name":"Ki Wook Kim","author_inst":"Virology Research Laboratory, Serology and Virology Division (SAViD), NSW Health Pathology, Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia."},{"author_name":"Fabio Luciani Sr.","author_inst":"The Kirby Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia."},{"author_name":"Sacha Stelzer-Braid","author_inst":"Virology Research Laboratory, Serology and Virology Division (SAViD), NSW Health Pathology, Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia."},{"author_name":"John-Sebastian Eden","author_inst":"Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity & Sydney Medical School, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia"},{"author_name":"William D Rawlinson","author_inst":"Virology Research Laboratory, Serology and Virology Division (SAViD), NSW Health Pathology, Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia."},{"author_name":"Sebastiaan J van Hal","author_inst":"NSW Health Pathology, Department of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney,"},{"author_name":"Ira W Deveson","author_inst":"Kinghorn Centre for Clinical Genomics, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, NSW, Australia."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.04.235549","rel_title":"Hypertonic saline solution inhibits SARS-CoV-2 in vitro assay","rel_date":"2020-08-04","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.04.235549","rel_abs":"We are facing an unprecedented global health crisis caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

We performed experiments to test if hypertonic saline solution is able to inhibit virus replication in vitro. Our data shows that 260 mM NaCl (1.5%) inhibits 100% SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero cells. Furthermore, our results suggest that the virus replication inhibition is due to an intracellular mechanism and not due to the dissociation between spike SARS-CoV-2 protein and its human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 interaction. NaCl depolarizes the plasma membrane supposedly associated with the inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle.

Independent of it, another reproduction number is introduced, which is defined similarly to the usual net reproduction number. Due to its simple analytic form, it enables a clear interpretation for all values. A further parameter, provisionally called acceleration parameter, is introduced and applied, which enables a more differentiated characterization of the infection number dynamics. By a variable transformation the 3 equations of the modified SIR-model can be reduced to 2. The latter are solved up to ordinary integrations. The solutions are evaluated for current situations, yielding a pretty good match with the data reported. Encouraged by this, a variety of possible future developments is examined, including linear and exponential growth of the infection numbers as well as sub- and super-exponential growth. In particular, the behavior of the two reproduction numbers and the acceleration parameter is studied, which in some cases leads to surprising results. With regard to the number of unreported infections it is shown, that from the solution for a special one solutions for others can be derived by similarity transformations.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Eckhard Rebhan","author_inst":"Heinrich Heine Universitaet Duesseldorf"},{"author_name":"Talita Glaser","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Danielle Bastos Araujo","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Lyvia Lintzmaier Petiz","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Danielle Bruna Leal Oliveira","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo Instituto de Ciencias Biomedicas"},{"author_name":"Giuliana Stravinskas Durigon","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Lima Leal","author_inst":"Gaspar Vianna Clinic Hospital Foundation"},{"author_name":"Joao Renato R.

The nsp13 of highly pathogenic MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV exhibit the most conserved CoV replicases. Using single-molecule FRET, we observed that MERS-CoV nsp13 unwound DNA in discrete steps of approximately 9 bp when ATP was used. If another NTP was used, then the steps were only 4 to 5 bp. In dwell time analysis, we detected 3 or 4 hidden steps in each unwinding process, which indicated the hydrolysis of 3 or 4 dTTP. Based on crystallographic and biochemical studies of CoV nsp13 helicases, we modeled an unwinding mechanism similar to the spring-loaded mechanism of HCV NS3 helicase, although our model proposes that flexible 1B and stalk domains, by allowing a lag greater than 4 bp during unwinding, cause the accumulated tension on the nsp13-DNA complex. The hinge region between two RecA-like domains in SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 is intrinsically more flexible than in MERS-CoV nsp13 due to the difference of a single amino acid, which causes the former to induce significantly greater NTP hydrolysis. Our findings thus establish a blueprint for determining the unwinding mechanism of a unique helicase family.\n\nO_LIWhen dTTP was used as the energy source, 4 hidden steps in each individual unwinding step after 3 - 4 NTP hydrolysis were observed.\nC_LIO_LIAn unwinding model of MERS-CoV-nsp13 which is similar to the spring-loaded mechanism of HCV NS3 helicase, except the accumulation of tension on nsp13\/DNA complex is caused by the flexible 1B and stalk domains that allow a lag of 4-bp in unwinding.\nC_LIO_LIComparing to MERS-CoV nsp13, the hinge region between two RecA-like domains in SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 is intrinsically more flexible due to a single amino acid difference, which contributes to the significantly higher NTP hydrolysis by SARS-CoV-2 nsp13.\nC_LI","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiao Hu","author_inst":"University of Cincinnati College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Wei Hao","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Bo Qin","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Zhiqi Tian","author_inst":"University of Cincinnati College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ziheng Li","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Pengjiao Hou","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Rong Zhao","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Sheng Cui","author_inst":"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"},{"author_name":"Jiajie Diao","author_inst":"University of Cincinnati College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Henning Ulrich","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Edison Luiz Rodrigues Durigon","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo Instituto de Ciencias Biomedicas"},{"author_name":"Cristiane Rodrigues Guzzo","author_inst":"Universidade de Sao Paulo"},{"author_name":"Sacha Stelzer-Braid","author_inst":"Virology Research Laboratory, Serology and Virology Division (SAViD), NSW Health Pathology, Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia."},{"author_name":"John-Sebastian Eden","author_inst":"Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity & Sydney Medical School, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia"},{"author_name":"William D Rawlinson","author_inst":"Virology Research Laboratory, Serology and Virology Division (SAViD), NSW Health Pathology, Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia."},{"author_name":"Sebastiaan J van Hal","author_inst":"NSW Health Pathology, Department of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney,"},{"author_name":"Ira W Deveson","author_inst":"Kinghorn Centre for Clinical Genomics, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, NSW, Australia."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"biophysics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.02.230839","rel_title":"Natural Killer cell activation, reduced ACE2, TMPRSS2, cytokines G-CSF, M-CSF and SARS-CoV-2-S pseudovirus infectivity by MEK inhibitor treatment of human cells","rel_date":"2020-08-03","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.02.230839","rel_abs":"COVID-19 affects vulnerable populations including elderly individuals and patients with cancer.

We show MEK inhibitors (MEKi) VS-6766, trametinib and selumetinib reduce ACE2 expression in human cells. In some human cells, remdesivir increases ACE2-promoter luciferase-reporter expression, ACE2 mRNA and protein, and ACE2 expression is attenuated by MEKi. In serum-deprived and stimulated cells treated with remdesivir and MEKi we observed correlations between pRB, pERK, and ACE2 expression further supporting role of proliferative state and MAPK pathway in ACE2 regulation. We show elevated cytokines in COVID-19-(+) patient plasma (N=9) versus control (N=11). TMPRSS2, inflammatory cytokines G-CSF, M-CSF, IL-1, IL-6 and MCP-1 are suppressed by MEKi alone or with remdesivir.

Pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus with a lentiviral core and SARS-CoV-2 D614 or G614 SPIKE (S) protein on its envelope infected human bronchial epithelial cells, small airway epithelial cells, or lung cancer cells and MEKi suppressed infectivity of the pseudovirus. We show a drug class-effect with MEKi to stimulate NK cells, inhibit inflammatory cytokines and block host-factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection leading also to suppression of SARS-CoV-2-S pseudovirus infection of human cells.

The presented library of images, deep learning features, and compound screening data from immune profiling and COVID-19 screens serves as a deep resource for immune biology and cellular-model drug discovery with immediate impact on the COVID-19 pandemic.","rel_num_authors":32,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michael F Cuccarese","author_inst":"Recursion"},{"author_name":"Berton A Earnshaw","author_inst":"Recursion"},{"author_name":"Katie Heiser","author_inst":"Recursion"},{"author_name":"Ben Fogelson","author_inst":"Recursion"},{"author_name":"Chadwick T Davis","author_inst":"Recursion"},{"author_name":"Peter F McLean","author_inst":"Recursion"},{"author_name":"Hannah B Gordon","author_inst":"Recursion"},{"author_name":"Kathleen-Rose Skelly","author_inst":"Recursion"},{"author_name":"Fiona L Weathersby","author_inst":"Recursion"},{"author_name":"Vlad Rodic","author_inst":"Recursion"},{"author_name":"Ian K Quigley","author_inst":"Recursion"},{"author_name":"Elissa D Pastuzyn","author_inst":"Recursion"},{"author_name":"Brandon M Mendivil","author_inst":"Recursion"},{"author_name":"Nathan H Lazar","author_inst":"Recursion"},{"author_name":"Carl A Brooks","author_inst":"Recursion"},{"author_name":"Joseph Carpenter","author_inst":"Recursion"},{"author_name":"Brandon L Probst","author_inst":"Recursion"},{"author_name":"Pamela Jacobson","author_inst":"Recursion"},{"author_name":"Seth W Glazier","author_inst":"Recursion"},{"author_name":"Jes Ford","author_inst":"Recursion"},{"author_name":"James D Jensen","author_inst":"Recursion"},{"author_name":"Nicholas D Campbell","author_inst":"Recursion"},{"author_name":"Michael A Statnick","author_inst":"Recursion"},{"author_name":"Adeline S Low","author_inst":"Recursion"},{"author_name":"Kirk R Thomas","author_inst":"Recursion"},{"author_name":"Anne E Carpenter","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Sharath S Hegde","author_inst":"Recursion"},{"author_name":"Ronald W Alfa","author_inst":"Recursion"},{"author_name":"Mason L Victors","author_inst":"Recursion"},{"author_name":"Imran S Haque","author_inst":"Recursion"},{"author_name":"Yolanda T Chong","author_inst":"Recursion"},{"author_name":"Christopher C Gibson","author_inst":"Recursion"},{"author_name":"George D Yancopoulos","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc."},{"author_name":"Christos A Kyratsous","author_inst":"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc."}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.03.234559","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 disrupts nucleocytoplasmic transport through interactions with Rae1 and Nup98","rel_date":"2020-08-03","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.03.234559","rel_abs":"RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm often disrupt nucleocytoplasmic transport to preferentially translate their own transcripts and prevent host antiviral responses. The Sarbecovirus accessory protein ORF6 has previously been shown to be the major inhibitor of interferon production in both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 was recently shown to co-purify with the host mRNA export factors Rae1 and Nup98. Here, we demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 strongly represses protein expression of co-transfected reporter constructs and imprisons host mRNA in the nucleus, which is associated with its ability to co-purify with Rae1 and Nup98. These protein-protein interactions map to the C-terminus of ORF6 and can be abolished by a single amino acid mutation in Met58. Overexpression of Rae1 restores reporter expression in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 ORF6. We further identify an ORF6 mutant containing a 9-amino acid deletion, ORF6 {Delta}22-30, in multiple SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates that can still downregulate the expression of a co-transfected reporter and interact with Rae1 and Nup98. SARS-CoV ORF6 also interacts with Rae1 and Nup98. However, SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 more strongly co-purifies with Rae1 and Nup98 and results in significantly reduced expression of reporter proteins compared to SARS-CoV ORF6, a potential mechanism for the delayed symptom onset and pre-symptomatic transmission uniquely associated with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.\n\nImportanceSARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, is an RNA virus with a large genome that encodes accessory proteins. While these accessory proteins are not required for growth in vitro, they can contribute to the pathogenicity of the virus. One of SARS-CoV-2s accessory proteins, ORF6, was recently shown to co-purify with two host proteins, Rae1 and Nup98, involved in mRNA nuclear export. We demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 interaction with these proteins is associated with reduced expression of a reporter protein and accumulation of poly-A mRNA within the nucleus. SARS-CoV ORF6 also shows the same interactions with Rae1 and Nup98. However, SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 more strongly represses reporter expression and co-purifies with Rae1 and Nup98 compared to SARS-CoV ORF6. The ability of SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 to more strongly disrupt nucleocytoplasmic transport than SARS-CoV ORF6 may partially explain critical differences in clinical presentation between the two viruses.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amin Addetia","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Nicole A.P.

COVA1-16 binds a highly conserved epitope on the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, mainly through a long CDR H3, and competes with ACE2 binding due to steric hindrance rather than epitope overlap.

The designed proteins act as decoys that block cellular entry and aim to be resilient to viral mutational escape. Using our novel platform, in less than ten weeks, we engineered, validated, and optimized de novo protein decoys of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), the membrane-associated protein that SARS-CoV-2 exploits to infect cells. Our optimized designs are hyperstable de novo proteins ([~]18-37 kDa), have high affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and can potently inhibit the virus infection and replication in vitro. Future refinements to our strategy can enable the rapid development of other therapeutic de novo protein decoys, not limited to neutralizing viruses, but to combat any agent that explicitly interacts with cell surface proteins to cause disease.","rel_num_authors":30,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas William Linsky","author_inst":"Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc"},{"author_name":"Renan Vergara","author_inst":"Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc"},{"author_name":"Nuria Codina","author_inst":"Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc"},{"author_name":"Jorgen W Nelson","author_inst":"Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc"},{"author_name":"Matthew J Walker","author_inst":"Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc"},{"author_name":"Wen Su","author_inst":"University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Tien-Ying Hsiang","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Katharina Esser-Nobis","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Kevin Yu","author_inst":"Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc"},{"author_name":"Yixuan J Hou","author_inst":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"},{"author_name":"Tanu Priya","author_inst":"Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc"},{"author_name":"Masaya Mitsumoto","author_inst":"Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc"},{"author_name":"Avery Pong","author_inst":"Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc"},{"author_name":"Uland Y Lau","author_inst":"Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc"},{"author_name":"Marsha L Mason","author_inst":"Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc"},{"author_name":"Jerry Chen","author_inst":"Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc"},{"author_name":"Alex Chen","author_inst":"Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc"},{"author_name":"Tania Berrocal","author_inst":"Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc"},{"author_name":"Hong Peng","author_inst":"Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc"},{"author_name":"Nicole S Clairmont","author_inst":"Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc"},{"author_name":"Javier Castellanos","author_inst":"Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc"},{"author_name":"Yu-Ru Lin","author_inst":"Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc"},{"author_name":"Anna Josephson-Day","author_inst":"Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc"},{"author_name":"Ralph S.

The samples were collected across 10 states covering different zones within India. Given the importance of this information for public health response initiatives investigating transmission of COVID-19, the sequence data is being released in GISAID database. This information will improve our understanding on how the virus is spreading, ultimately helping to interrupt the transmission chains, prevent new cases of infection, and provide impetus to research on intervention measures.

Initial results indicate that multiple lineages of SARS-CoV-2 are circulating in India, probably introduced by travel from Europe, USA and East Asia. A2a (20A\/B\/C) was found to be predominant, along with few parental haplotypes 19A\/B. In particular, there is a predominance of the D614G mutation, which is found to be emerging in almost all regions of the country. Additionally, mutations in important regions of the viral genome with significant geographical clustering have also been observed. The temporal haplotype diversities landscape in each region appears to be similar pan India, with haplotype diversities peaking between March-May, while by June A2a (20A\/B\/C) emerged as the predominant one. Within haplotypes, different states appear to have different proportions. Temporal and geographic patterns in the sequences obtained reveal interesting clustering of mutations. Some mutations are present at particularly high frequencies in one state as compared to others. The negative estimate Tajimas D (D = -2.26817) is consistent with the rapid expansion of SARS-CoV-2 population in India. Detailed mutational analysis across India to understand the gradual emergence of mutants at different regions of the country and its possible implication will help in better disease management.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Arindam Maitra","author_inst":"National INstitute of Biomedical Genomics"},{"author_name":"Sunil Raghav","author_inst":"Institute of Life Science"},{"author_name":"Ashwin Dalal","author_inst":"Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics"},{"author_name":"Farhan Ali","author_inst":"National Centre for Biological Sciences"},{"author_name":"Vanessa Molin Paynter","author_inst":"Institute for Stem Cell Science and Regenerative Medicine"},{"author_name":"Dhiraj Paul","author_inst":"National Centre for Cell Science"},{"author_name":"Nidhan K Biswas","author_inst":"National institute of Biomedical Genomics"},{"author_name":"Arup Ghosh","author_inst":"Institute of Life Science"},{"author_name":"Kunal Jani","author_inst":"National Centre for Cell Science"},{"author_name":"Sreedhar Chinnaswamy","author_inst":"National institute of Biomedical Genomics"},{"author_name":"Sanghamitra Pati","author_inst":"ICMR-Regional Centre for Medical Research"},{"author_name":"Arvind Sahu","author_inst":"National Centre for Cell Science"},{"author_name":"Debashis Mitra","author_inst":"Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics, National Centre for Cell Science"},{"author_name":"Manoj Kumar Bhat","author_inst":"National Centre for Cell Science"},{"author_name":"Satyajit Mayor","author_inst":"National Centre for Biological Sciences"},{"author_name":"Apurva Sarin","author_inst":"Institute for Stem Cell Science and Regenerative Medicine"},{"author_name":"- The PAN-INDIA 1000 SARS-CoV-2 RNA Genome Sequencing Consortium","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Yogesh S Shouche","author_inst":"National Centre for Cell Science"},{"author_name":"Aswin Sai Narain Seshasayee","author_inst":"National Centre for Biological Sciences"},{"author_name":"Dasaradhi Palakodeti","author_inst":"Institute For Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine"},{"author_name":"Murali Dharan Bashyam","author_inst":"Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD)"},{"author_name":"AJAY PARIDA","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences,"},{"author_name":"Saumitra Das","author_inst":"National Institute of Biomedical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ralph S.

In both cases, designed sequences were optimized first in silico and then experimentally for target binding, folding and stability. Nine designs bound the RBD with affinities ranging from 100pM to 10nM, and blocked bona fide SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells with IC50 values ranging from 35 pM to 35 nM; the most potent of these -- 56 and 64 residue hyperstable proteins made using the second approach -- are roughly six times more potent on a per mass basis (IC50 ~ 0.23 ng\/ml) than the best monoclonal antibodies reported thus far. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of the SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain trimer in complex with the two most potent minibinders show that the structures of the designs and their binding interactions with the RBD are nearly identical to the computational models, and that all three RBDs in a single Spike protein can be engaged simultaneously.

We compared the mutational spectrum in the new SARS-CoV-2 mutation dataset with the previously published mutation spectrum in hypermutated genomes of rubella - another positive single stranded (ss) RNA virus. Each of the rubella isolates arose by accumulation of hundreds of mutations during propagation in a single subject, while SARS-CoV-2 mutation spectrum represents a collection events in multiple virus isolates from individuals across the world. We found a clear similarity between the spectra of single base substitutions in rubella and in SARS-CoV-2, with C to U as well as A to G and U to C being the most prominent in plus strand genomic RNA of each virus. Of those, U to C changes universally showed preference for loops versus stems in predicted RNA secondary structure. Similarly, to what was previously reported for rubella, C to U changes showed enrichment in the uCn motif, which suggested a subclass of APOBEC cytidine deaminase being a source of these substitutions. We also found enrichment of several other trinucleotide-centered mutation motifs only in SARS-CoV-2 - likely indicative of a mutation process characteristic to this virus. Altogether, the results of this analysis suggest that the mutation mechanisms that lead to hypermutation of the rubella vaccine virus in a rare pathological condition may also operate in the background of the SARS-CoV-2 viruses currently propagating in the human population.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dmitry  A.

Method We analysed mental health data collected during COVID-19 from adults aged 50 and over alongside comparable annual data collected between 2015 and 2019 from the same sample. Trajectories of depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) were analysed with respect to loneliness, physical activity levels and a number of socioeconomic and demographic characteristics using zero-inflated negative binomial regression. Results 3,281 people completed the COVID-19 mental health questionnaire, all had at least one data point prior to 2020. In 2020, the adjusted PHQ-9 score for loneliness was 3.2. (95% CI: 3.0-3.4), an increase of one point on previous years and 2 points higher than people not rated lonely, whose score did not change in 2020 (1.2, 95% CI: 1.1-1.3). PHQ-9 was 2.6 (95% CI: 2.4-2.8) in people with decreased physical activity, an increase of 0.5 on previous years. In contrast, PHQ-9 in 2020 for people whose physical activity had not decreased was 1.7 (95% CI: 1.6-1.8), similar to previous years. A similar relationship was observed for GAD-7 though the differences were smaller and the absolute burden of symptoms lower. Conclusions After accounting for pre-COVID-19 trends, we show that experiencing loneliness and decreased physical activity are risk factors for worsening mental health during the pandemic. Our findings highlight the need to examine policies which target these potentially modifiable risk factors.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Byron Creese","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Zunera Khan","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"William Henley","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Anne Corbett","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Miguel Vasconcelos Da Silva","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Mills","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Natalie Wright","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Ingelin Testad","author_inst":"Stavanger University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dag Aarsland","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Clive Ballard","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Young-Jun Park","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Lance Stewart","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Michael Diamond","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David Veesler","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Satyajit Mayor","author_inst":"National Centre for Biological Sciences"},{"author_name":"Apurva Sarin","author_inst":"Institute for Stem Cell Science and Regenerative Medicine"},{"author_name":"- The PAN-INDIA 1000 SARS-CoV-2 RNA Genome Sequencing Consortium","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Yogesh S Shouche","author_inst":"National Centre for Cell Science"},{"author_name":"Aswin Sai Narain Seshasayee","author_inst":"National Centre for Biological Sciences"},{"author_name":"Dasaradhi Palakodeti","author_inst":"Institute For Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine"},{"author_name":"Murali Dharan Bashyam","author_inst":"Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD)"},{"author_name":"AJAY PARIDA","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences,"},{"author_name":"Saumitra Das","author_inst":"National Institute of Biomedical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ralph S.

OUTCOME MEASURES Growth of any bacteria or fungi, or positive polymerase chain reaction results for common respiratory viruses and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) RESULTS 25 PAPR hoods were swabbed; ten (40%) returned positive results. Bacterial growth was detected on six hoods (bacillus simplex, kocuria rhizophilia, bacillus weihenstephensis, microcccus luteus and staphylococcus epidermidis); five of the hoods were positive for fungal growth (non-sporulating environmental mould, NSEM); all sampled hoods tested negative for both SARS-CoV-2 and an expanded panel of respiratory viruses. There was wide variation in the storage of cleaned hoods. CONCLUSION Despite following recommended cleaning procedures, bacteria and fungi can remain on the internal components of PAPR hoods, at levels significant enough to be swabbed and cultured. PAPR hoods have the potential to cross-infect wearers and patients and are used primarily by clinicians who fail to fit disposable FFP3 respirators; the female sex and non-Caucasian people are less likely to fit FFP3 respirators. The hoods tested cannot be adequately cleaned for use in high risk healthcare environments, PAPR hoods and tubes can act as fomites, and there are evident shortcomings in their provision.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abhijoy Chakladar","author_inst":"Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Claire Gabrielle Jones","author_inst":"Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Jimmy Siu","author_inst":"Brighton and Sussex university Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Osman Hassan-Ibrahim","author_inst":"Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Mansoor Khan","author_inst":"Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Mills","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Natalie Wright","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Ingelin Testad","author_inst":"Stavanger University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dag Aarsland","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Clive Ballard","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Young-Jun Park","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Lance Stewart","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Michael Diamond","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David Veesler","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Satyajit Mayor","author_inst":"National Centre for Biological Sciences"},{"author_name":"Apurva Sarin","author_inst":"Institute for Stem Cell Science and Regenerative Medicine"},{"author_name":"- The PAN-INDIA 1000 SARS-CoV-2 RNA Genome Sequencing Consortium","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Yogesh S Shouche","author_inst":"National Centre for Cell Science"},{"author_name":"Aswin Sai Narain Seshasayee","author_inst":"National Centre for Biological Sciences"},{"author_name":"Dasaradhi Palakodeti","author_inst":"Institute For Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine"},{"author_name":"Murali Dharan Bashyam","author_inst":"Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD)"},{"author_name":"AJAY PARIDA","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences,"},{"author_name":"Saumitra Das","author_inst":"National Institute of Biomedical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ralph S.

We use daily confirmed cases, active cases, recovered cases, deceased cases, Case-Fatality-Rate (CFR), and infectious time as inputs for the model. Furthermore, we define a Transmission Index (TI) as a ratio between the instantaneous and the maximum value of the effective reproduction number. The value of TI shows the disease transmission in a contact between a susceptible and an infectious individual due to current measures such as physical distancing and lock-down relative to a normal condition. Based on the value of TI, we forecast different scenarios to see the effect of relaxing and tightening public measures. Case studies in three countries are provided to show the practicability of our approach.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Agus Hasan","author_inst":"University of Southern Denmark"},{"author_name":"Endah Putri","author_inst":"Institut Teknologi Sepuluh November"},{"author_name":"Hadi Susanto","author_inst":"Khalifa University"},{"author_name":"Nuning Nuraini","author_inst":"Institut Teknologi Bandung"},{"author_name":"Mansoor Khan","author_inst":"Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Mills","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Natalie Wright","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Ingelin Testad","author_inst":"Stavanger University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dag Aarsland","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Clive Ballard","author_inst":"University of Exeter"},{"author_name":"Young-Jun Park","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Lance Stewart","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Michael Diamond","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David Veesler","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Satyajit Mayor","author_inst":"National Centre for Biological Sciences"},{"author_name":"Apurva Sarin","author_inst":"Institute for Stem Cell Science and Regenerative Medicine"},{"author_name":"- The PAN-INDIA 1000 SARS-CoV-2 RNA Genome Sequencing Consortium","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Yogesh S Shouche","author_inst":"National Centre for Cell Science"},{"author_name":"Aswin Sai Narain Seshasayee","author_inst":"National Centre for Biological Sciences"},{"author_name":"Dasaradhi Palakodeti","author_inst":"Institute For Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine"},{"author_name":"Murali Dharan Bashyam","author_inst":"Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD)"},{"author_name":"AJAY PARIDA","author_inst":"Institute of Life Sciences,"},{"author_name":"Saumitra Das","author_inst":"National Institute of Biomedical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ralph S.

The final 4C Mortality Score included eight variables readily available at initial hospital assessment: age, sex, number of comorbidities, respiratory rate, peripheral oxygen saturation, level of consciousness, urea, and C-reactive protein (score range 0-21 points). The 4C risk stratification score demonstrated high discrimination for mortality (derivation cohort: AUROC 0.79; 95% CI 0.78 - 0.79; validation cohort 0.78, 0.77-0.79) with excellent calibration (slope = 1.0). Patients with a score [&ge;]15 (n = 2310, 17.4%) had a 67% mortality (i.e., positive predictive value 67%) compared with 1.0% mortality for those with a score [&le;]3 (n = 918, 7%; negative predictive value 99%). Discriminatory performance was higher than 15 pre-existing risk stratification scores (AUROC range 0.60-0.76), with scores developed in other covid-19 cohorts often performing poorly (range 0.63-0.73). Conclusions We have developed and validated an easy-to-use risk stratification score based on commonly available parameters at hospital presentation. This outperformed existing scores, demonstrated utility to directly inform clinical decision making, and can be used to stratify inpatients with covid-19 into different management groups. The 4C Mortality Score may help clinicians identify patients with covid-19 at high risk of dying during current and subsequent waves of the pandemic.

clinical diagnosis and epidemiological investigations. Recently, assays for the large-volume detection of total antibodies (Ab) and immunoglobulin (Ig) G and M against SARS-CoV-2 antigens have been developed, but there are limited data on the diagnostic accuracy of these assays. This study was organized as a Danish national collaboration and included fifteen commercial and one in-house anti-SARS-CoV-2 assays in sixteen laboratories. Sensitivity was evaluated using 150 serum samples from individuals diagnosed with asymptomatic, mild or moderate nonhospitalized (n=129) or hospitalized (n=31) COVID-19, confirmed by nucleic acid amplification tests, collected 13-73 days from symptom onset. Specificity and cross-reactivity were evaluated in samples collected prior to the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic from > 586 blood donors and patients with autoimmune diseases or CMV or EBV infections. Predefined specificity criteria of [&ge;]99% were met by all total-Ab and IgG assays except one (Diasorin\/LiaisonXL-IgG 97.2%). The sensitivities in descending order were: Wantai\/ELISA total-Ab (96.7%), CUH\/NOVO in-house ELISA total-Ab (96.0%), Ortho\/Vitros total-Ab (95.3%), YHLO\/iFlash-IgG (94.0%), Ortho\/Vitros-IgG (93.3%), Siemens\/Atellica total-Ab (93.2%), Roche-Elecsys total-Ab (92.7%), Abbott-Architect-IgG (90.0%), Abbott\/Alinity-IgG (median 88.0%), Diasorin\/LiaisonXL-IgG (84.6%), Siemens\/Vista total-Ab (81.0%), Euroimmun\/ELISA-IgG (78.0%), and Snibe\/Maglumi-IgG (median 78.0%). The IgM results were variable, but one assay (Wantai\/ELISA-IgM) had both high sensitivity (82.7%) and specificity (99%). The rate of seropositivity increased with time from symptom onset and symptom severity. In conclusion, predefined sensitivity and specificity acceptance criteria of 90%\/99%, respectively, for diagnostic use were met in five of six total-Ab and three of seven IgG assays.","rel_num_authors":38,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lene Holm Harritshoej","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet"},{"author_name":"Mikkel Gybel-Brask","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet"},{"author_name":"Shoaib Afzal","author_inst":"Copenhagen University Hospital, Herlev and Gentofte Hospital"},{"author_name":"Pia R.

Lateral flow immunoassays for antibody testing have been viewed as a cheap and rapidly deployable method for determining previous infection with SARS-CoV-2; however, these assays have shown unacceptably low sensitivity. We report on nine lateral flow immunoassays currently available and compare their titer sensitivity in serum to a best-practice enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and viral neutralization assay. For a small group of PCR-positive, we found two lateral flow immunoassay devices with titer sensitivity roughly equal to the ELISA; these devices were positive for all PCR-positive patients harboring SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. One of these devices was deployed in Northern Italy to test its sensitivity and specificity in a real-world clinical setting. Using the device with fingerstick blood on a cohort of 27 hospitalized PCR-positive patients and seven hospitalized controls, ROC curve analysis gave AUC values of 0.7646 for IgG. For comparison, this assay was also tested with saliva from the same patient population and showed reduced discrimination between cases and controls with AUC values of 0.6841 for IgG. Furthermore, during viral neutralization testing, one patient was discovered to harbor autoantibodies to ACE2, with implications for how immune responses are profiled. We show here through a proof-of-concept study that these lateral flow devices can be as analytically sensitive as ELISAs and adopted into hospital protocols; however, additional improvements to these devices remain necessary before their clinical deployment.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amanda Haymond","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Claudius Mueller","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Hannah Steinberg","author_inst":"University of Illinois, Chicago"},{"author_name":"K.

The immune response to this disease is thought to lead to a cytokine storm, which contributes to the severity of illness. There is an urgent need to confirm whether the use of tocilizumab provides a benefit in individuals with COVID-19. Methods A single-center propensity-score matched cohort study, including all consecutive COVID-19 patients, admitted to the medical center who were either discharged from the medical center or expired between March 1, 2020, and May 5, 2020, was performed. Patients were stratified according to the receipt of tocilizumab for cytokine storm and matched to controls using propensity scores. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Results A total of 132 patients were included in the matched dataset (tocilizumab=66; standard of care=66). Approximately 73% of the patients were male. Hypertension (55%), diabetes mellitus (31%), and chronic pulmonary disease (15%) were the most common comorbidities present. There were 18 deaths (27.3%) in the tocilizumab group and 18 deaths (27.3%) in the standard of care group (odds ratio, 1.0; 95% confidence interval, 0.465 - 2.151; p=1.00). Advanced age, history of myocardial infarction, dementia, chronic pulmonary disease, heart failure, and malignancy were significantly more common in patients who died. Interpretation The current analysis does not support the use of tocilizumab for the management of cytokine storm in patients with COVID-19. Use of this therapeutic agent should be limited to the context of a clinical trial until more evidence is available.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andrew Tsai","author_inst":"Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Somerset"},{"author_name":"Oumou Diawara","author_inst":"Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Somerset"},{"author_name":"Ronald G Nahass","author_inst":"ID Care"},{"author_name":"Luigi Brunetti","author_inst":"Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy"},{"author_name":"Caitlin W Lehman","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Shih-Chao Lin","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Lucia Collini","author_inst":"Santa Chiara Hospital"},{"author_name":"Heather Branscome","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Tuong Vi Nguyen","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Sally Rucker","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Lauren Panny","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Rafaela Flor","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Raouf Guirguis","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Richard Hoefer","author_inst":"Sentara Dorothy G.

Thus, effective measures are needed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission in indoor environments. In this regard, we have investigated whether a system based on a filter combining Tungsten Trioxide-Based (WO3) photocatalysis and an antiviral fabric treated-copper nanocluster could inactivate SARS-CoV-2. To this purpose, an infectious SARS-CoV-2 suspension was introduced in the upper opening of a closed cylinder containing a WO3 filter and a lightbased system that activates WO3 and the antiviral fabric. From the bottom exit, aliquots of fluid were collected every 10 min (up to 60 min) and tested for their infectivity by means of a viral plaque assay in Vero cells whereas, in parallel, the viral RNA content was measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR). As we have previously shown for SARS-CoV, a 1:1,000 ratio of plaque forming units (PFU) vs. viral RNA copies was observed also for SARS-CoV-2. After 10 min, the infectious viral content was already decreased by 98.2% reaching 100% inactivation after 30 min whereas the SARS-CoV-2 RNA load was decreased of 1.5 log10 after 30 min. Thus, in spite of only a partial decrease of viral RNA, SARS-CoV-2 infectivity was completely abolished by the WO3 photocatalysis system by 30 min. These results support the hypothesis that this system could be exploited to achieve SARS-CoV-2 inactivation in indoor environments.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Silvia Ghezzi","author_inst":"Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Isabel Pagani","author_inst":"Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Guido Poli","author_inst":"Vita-Salute San Raffaele University School of Medicine, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Stefano Perboni","author_inst":"Nanohub, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Elisa Vicenzi","author_inst":"Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Shih-Chao Lin","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Lucia Collini","author_inst":"Santa Chiara Hospital"},{"author_name":"Heather Branscome","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Tuong Vi Nguyen","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Sally Rucker","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Lauren Panny","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Rafaela Flor","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Raouf Guirguis","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Richard Hoefer","author_inst":"Sentara Dorothy G.

In many types of serology tests, the sensitivity and the specificity are directly influenced by the quality of the antigens manufactured. Protein purification of these recombinantly expressed viral antigens [e.g., spike and its receptor binding domain (RBD)] is an important step in the manufacturing process. Simple and high-capacity protein purification schemes for spike, RBD, and CR3022 mAb, recombinantly expressed in CHO and HEK293 cells, are reported in this article. The schemes consist of an affinity chromatography step and a desalting step. Purified proteins were validated in ELISA-based serological tests. Interestingly, extracellular matrix proteins [most notably heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG)] were co-purified from spike-expressing CHO culture with a long cultivation time. HSPG-spike interaction could play a functional role in the pathology and the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kang Lan Tee","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Philip J Jackson","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Joseph M Scarrott","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Stephen RP Jaffe","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Abayomi O Johnson","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Yusuf Johari","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Thilo H Pohle","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Theo Mozzanino","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Joseph Price","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"James Grinham","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Adam Brown","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Martin J Nicklin","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"David C James","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Mark J Dickman","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Tuck Seng Wong","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Emanuel Petricoin","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Fatah Kashanchi","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Kylene Kehn-Hall","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Paolo Lanzafame","author_inst":"Santa Chiara Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lance Liotta","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Luchini","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Jingjing Gong","author_inst":"NanoString Inc."},{"author_name":"Erroll H Rueckert","author_inst":"NanoString Inc."},{"author_name":"Benjamin D Greenbaum","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Nir Hacohen","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Stephen M Lagana","author_inst":"Columbia University Irving Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Miguel N Rivera","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lynette M Sholl","author_inst":"Brigham and Woman's Hospital"},{"author_name":"James R Stone","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"David T Ting","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Vikram Deshpande","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Susanne G.

Its genome encodes about 29 proteins. Most of the viral proteins are non-structural proteins (NSP) except envelop (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) and Spike (S) proteins that constitute the viral nucleocapsid, envelop and surface. We have recently cloned all the 29 SARS-CoV-2 genes into vectors for their expressions in mammalian cells except NSP11 that has only 14 amino acids (aa). We are able to express all the 28 cloned SARS-CoV-2 genes in human cells to characterize their subcellular distributions. The proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are mostly cytoplasmic but some are both cytoplasmic and nuclear. Those punctate staining proteins were further investigated by immunofluorescent assay (IFA) using specific antibodies or by co-transfection with an organelle marker-expressing plasmid. As a result, we found that NSP15, ORF6, M and ORF7a are related to Golgi apparatus, and that ORF7b, ORF8 and ORF10 colocalize with endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Interestingly, ORF3a distributes in cell membrane, early endosome, endosome, late endosome and lysosome, which suggests that ORF3a might help the infected virus to usurp endosome and lysosome for viral use. Furthermore, we revealed that NSP13 colocalized with SC35, a protein standing for splicing compartments in the nucleus. Our studies for the first time visualized the subcellular locations of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and might provide novel insights into the viral proteins biological functions.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jing Zhang","author_inst":"Advanced Medical Research Institute, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, China"},{"author_name":"Ruth Cruz-cosme","author_inst":"Howard University College of Medicine, 520 W Street NW, Washington, DC 20059"},{"author_name":"Meng-Wei Zhuang","author_inst":"Advanced Medical Research Institute, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, China"},{"author_name":"Dongxiao Liu","author_inst":"Howard University College of Medicine, 520 W Street NW, Washington, DC 20059"},{"author_name":"Yuan Liu","author_inst":"Weill Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"},{"author_name":"Shaolei Teng","author_inst":"Department of Biology, Howard University, 415 College St. NW, Washington, DC 20059"},{"author_name":"Pei-Hui Wang","author_inst":"Advanced Medical Research Institute, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, China"},{"author_name":"Qiyi Tang","author_inst":"Howard University College of Medicine, 520 W Street NW, Washington, DC 20059"},{"author_name":"Joseph Price","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"James Grinham","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Adam Brown","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Martin J Nicklin","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"David C James","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Mark J Dickman","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Tuck Seng Wong","author_inst":"The University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Emanuel Petricoin","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Fatah Kashanchi","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Kylene Kehn-Hall","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Paolo Lanzafame","author_inst":"Santa Chiara Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lance Liotta","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Alessandra Luchini","author_inst":"George Mason University"},{"author_name":"Jingjing Gong","author_inst":"NanoString Inc."},{"author_name":"Erroll H Rueckert","author_inst":"NanoString Inc."},{"author_name":"Benjamin D Greenbaum","author_inst":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Nir Hacohen","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Stephen M Lagana","author_inst":"Columbia University Irving Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Miguel N Rivera","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lynette M Sholl","author_inst":"Brigham and Woman's Hospital"},{"author_name":"James R Stone","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"David T Ting","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Vikram Deshpande","author_inst":"Massachusetts General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Susanne G.
