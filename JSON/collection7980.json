A sensitive and accurate diagnosis method will substantially help to control disease expansion. Here, we developed a chemiluminescence-immunoassay method based on the recombinant nucleocapsid antigen and the magnetic beads for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections and surveillance of antibody changing pattern. Serums from 29 healthy individuals, 51 tuberculosis patients, and 79 SARS-CoV-2 confirmed patients were employed to evaluate the performance of this approach. Compared to the IgM testing, the IgG testing was more reliable in which it identified 65 SARS-CoV-2 infections from the 79 confirmed patients and only two false-positive cases from the 80 control group with a sensitivity and specificity reaching 82.28% and 97.5%, respectively. However, only a slight difference (not statistically significant) in the detected cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections was observed between the IgM and IgG testing manner in patients at a different time of onset of disease. A performance comparison between an ELISA kit using the same nucleocapsid antigen and our chemiluminescence method was undertaken. The same false-positive cases were seen in both methods from the paired control group, while ELISA kit can only detect half of the SARS-CoV-2 infections from paired SARS-CoV-2 confirmed patients group than that of the chemiluminescence method, indicating a higher performance for the chemiluminescence-immunoassay approach. Together, our studies provide a useful and valuable serological testing tool for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the community.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dachuan Lin","author_inst":"Shenzhen University"},{"author_name":"Lei Liu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mingxia Zhang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yunlong Hu","author_inst":"Shenzhen University"},{"author_name":"Qianting Yang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jiubiao Guo","author_inst":"Shenzhen University"},{"author_name":"Youchao Dai","author_inst":"Shenzhen University"},{"author_name":"Yuzhong Xu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Baoan people's hospital"},{"author_name":"Yi Cai","author_inst":"Shenzhen University"},{"author_name":"Xinchun Chen","author_inst":"Shenzhen University"},{"author_name":"Kaisong Huang","author_inst":"Shenzhen University"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.27.20045336","rel_title":"A COVID-19 Infection Risk Model for Frontline Health Care Workers","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.27.20045336","rel_abs":"The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted in hospitals is continuously increasing in the Philippines. Frontline health care workers are faced with imminent risks of getting infected. In this study, we formulate a theoretical model to calculate the risk of being infected in health care facilities considering the following factors: the average number of encounters with a suspected COVID-19 patient per hour; interaction time for each encounter; work shift duration or exposure time; crowd density, which may depend on the amount of space available in a given location; and availability and effectiveness of protective gears and facilities provided for the frontline health care workers. Based on the simulation results, a set of risk assessment criteria is proposed to classify risks as low, moderate, or high. We recommend the following: (i) decrease the rate of patient encounter per frontline health care worker, e.g., maximum of three encounters per hour in a 12-hour work shift duration; (ii) decrease the interaction time between the frontline health care worker and the patients, e.g., less than 40 minutes for the whole day; (iii) increase the clean and safe space for social distancing, e.g., maximum of 10% crowd density, and if possible, implement compartmentalization of patients; and\/or (iv) provide effective protective gears and facilities, e.g., 95% effective, that the frontline health care workers can use during their shift. Moreover, the formulated model can be used for other similar scenarios, such as identifying infection risk in public transportation, school classroom settings, offices, and mass gatherings.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Louie Florendo Dy","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Manila"},{"author_name":"Jomar Fajardo Rabajante","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Mingxia Zhang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yunlong Hu","author_inst":"Shenzhen University"},{"author_name":"Qianting Yang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jiubiao Guo","author_inst":"Shenzhen University"},{"author_name":"Youchao Dai","author_inst":"Shenzhen University"},{"author_name":"Yuzhong Xu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Baoan people's hospital"},{"author_name":"Yi Cai","author_inst":"Shenzhen University"},{"author_name":"Xinchun Chen","author_inst":"Shenzhen University"},{"author_name":"Kaisong Huang","author_inst":"Shenzhen University"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.27.20045575","rel_title":"Basic prediction methodology for covid-19: estimation and sensitivity considerations","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.27.20045575","rel_abs":"The purpose of the present paper is to present simple estimation and prediction methods for basic quantities in an emerging epidemic like the ongoing covid-10 pandemic. The simple methods have the advantage that relations between basic quantities become more transparent, thus shedding light to which quantities have biggest impact on predictions, with the additional conclusion that uncertainties in these quantities carry over to high uncertainty also in predictions. A simple non-parametric prediction method for future cumulative case fatalities, as well as future cumulative incidence of infections (assuming a given infection fatality risk f), is presented. The method uses cumulative reported case fatalities up to present time as input data. It is also described how the introduction of preventive measures of a given magnitude{rho} will affect the two incidence predictions, using basic theory of epidemic models. This methodology is then reversed, thus enabling estimation of the preventive magnitude{rho} , and of the resulting effective reproduction number RE. However, the effects of preventive measures only start affecting case fatalities some 3-4 weeks later, so estimates are only available after this time has elapsed. The methodology is applicable in the early stage of an outbreak, before, say, 10% of the community have been infected. Beside giving simple estimation and prediction tools for an ongoing epidemic, another important conclusion lies in the observation that the two quantities f (infection fatality risk) and{rho} (the magnitude of preventive measures) have very big impact on predictions. Further, both of these quantities currently have very high uncertainty: current estimates of f lie in the range 0.2% up to 2% ([9], [7]), and the overall effect of several combined preventive measures is clearly very uncertain. The two main findings from the paper are hence that, a) any prediction containing f, and\/or some preventive measures, contain a large amount of uncertainty (which is usually not acknowledged well enough), and b) obtaining more accurate estimates of in particular f, should be highly prioritized. Seroprevalence testing of random samples in a community where the epidemic has ended are urgently needed.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tom Britton","author_inst":"Stockholm University"},{"author_name":"Jomar Fajardo Rabajante","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Mingxia Zhang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yunlong Hu","author_inst":"Shenzhen University"},{"author_name":"Qianting Yang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jiubiao Guo","author_inst":"Shenzhen University"},{"author_name":"Youchao Dai","author_inst":"Shenzhen University"},{"author_name":"Yuzhong Xu","author_inst":"Shenzhen Baoan people's hospital"},{"author_name":"Yi Cai","author_inst":"Shenzhen University"},{"author_name":"Xinchun Chen","author_inst":"Shenzhen University"},{"author_name":"Kaisong Huang","author_inst":"Shenzhen University"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.27.20040816","rel_title":"Correlation between hypophosphatemia and the severity of Corona Virus Disease 2019 patients","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.27.20040816","rel_abs":"Objective: Retrospectively analyze the clinical data of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and explore the value of serum phosphorus level in evaluating the severity and prognosis of the disease. Methods: COVID-19 patients transferred from the first emergency ward of Taiyuan fourth people's Hospital from February 8 to March 3, 2020 were selected. The information of general conditions, clinical manifestations, laboratory indexes, nucleic acid detection and treatment were collected. The changes of blood phosphorus level and absolute value of lymphocytes in ordinary and severe\/critical patients were recorded and compared. Results: A total of 32 patients with COVID-19 were collected, including 12 cases of common type and 20 cases of severe\/critical type. Before treatment, the serum phosphorus levels of the two groups were significantly lower than the normal level, and the serum phosphorus levels of the severe\/critical patients were lower than those of the common type patients (t = 2.767, P < 0.010). After treatment, the serum phosphorus levels of the two groups reached normal, and there was no significant difference between the two groups (t = 0.231, P > 0.819). The level of lymphocytes in severe\/critical patients was lower than that in normal patients (t = 4.636, P < 0.001) before treatment. After treatment, the absolute value of lymphocytes in the two groups reached normal, and there was no significant difference between the two groups (t=1.208, P=0.237). There was a positive correlation between lymphocytes and serum phosphorus, and the correlation coefficient was 0.479. Conclusion: hypophosphatemia is related to the severity of COVID-19, and strengthening the monitoring of serum phosphorus level of COVID-19's severe\/critical patients and correcting hypophosphatemia in time are of significance to improve the prognosis.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaobo Xue","author_inst":"Shanxi Cardiovascular Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jing Ma","author_inst":"Shanxi Cardiovascular Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuxia Zhao","author_inst":"Taiyuan Fourth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Aibin Zhao","author_inst":"Taiyuan Fourth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiaohong Liu","author_inst":"The Second Affiliated Hospital of Shanxi Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wei Guo","author_inst":"Shanxi Tumor Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fang Yan","author_inst":"Shanxi Cardiovascular Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhixin Wang","author_inst":"Shanxi Cardiovascular Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yanqing Guo","author_inst":"Shanxi Cardiovascular Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mengbai Fan","author_inst":"Taiyuan Fourth People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Kaisong Huang","author_inst":"Shenzhen University"},{"author_name":"Zheng Zhang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Third Peoples Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.27.20045658","rel_title":"Meteorological factors and Covid-19 incidence in 310 regions across the world","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.27.20045658","rel_abs":"In absence of empirical research data, there has been considerable speculative hypothesis on the relationship between climatic factors (such as temperature and humidity) and the incidence of Covid-19.

As of now, many countries have been severely affected, partly because of slow responses to the crisis, ill-preparedness of their health system, and the fragile health infrastructure and the shortage of protective equipment. This note evaluates various scenarios, based on an estimation of number of identified and unidentified infected cases, and examines the effectiveness of different policy responses to contain this pandemic. Our result, based on an estimation of the model for Iran, show that in many instances the number of unidentified cases, including asymptomatic individuals, could be much bigger than the reported numbers. The results confirm that in such circumstances, social distancing alone cannot be an effective policy unless a large portion of the population confine themselves for an extended period of time, which is not only difficult to implement, but it could also prove extremely costly and damaging to the economy. An alternative policy, this note argues, is to couple effective social distancing with extensive testing, even to those who are asymptomatic, and isolate the identified cases actively. Otherwise, many lives will be lost, and the health system will collapse, adding to the ongoing economic troubles that many countries have started to encounter.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Majid Einian","author_inst":"MBRI"},{"author_name":"Hamid Reza Tabarraei","author_inst":"International Monetary Fund"},{"author_name":"C\u00e9cile Viboud","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Bryan T Grenfell","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Dushoff","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Xiaomin Jian","author_inst":"Beijing Fuxing Hospital Affiliated to Capital University of Medical Science"},{"author_name":"Liping Wang","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jiejun Shi","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chunyang Wu","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guoxiang Li","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuan Fu","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Keyin Wang","author_inst":"the First Hospital of Jiaxing City"},{"author_name":"Mingqin Lu","author_inst":"the first affiliated hospital of Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Guoqing Qian","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.28.20040204","rel_title":"The time-series ages distribution of the reported COVID-2019 infected people suggests the undetected local spreading of COVID-2019 in Hubei and Guangdong provinces before 19th Jan 2020","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.28.20040204","rel_abs":"COVID-2019 is broken out in China. It becomes a severe public health disaster in one month. Find the period in which the spreading of COVID-2019 was overlooked, and understand the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-2019 in the period will provide valuable information for the countries facing the threats of COVID-2019. The most extensive epidemiological analysis of COVID-2019 shows that older people have lower infection rates compared to middle-aged persons. Common sense is that older people prefer to report their illness and get treatment from the hospital compared to middle-aged persons. We propose a hypothesis that when the spreading of COVID-2019 was overlooked, we will find more older cases than the middle-aged cases. At first, we tested the hypothesis with 4597 COVID-2019 infected samples reported from 26th Nov 2019 to 17th Feb 2020 across the mainland of China. We found that 19th Jan 2020 is a critical time point. Few samples were reported before that day, and most of them were older ones. Then samples were explosively increased after that day, and many of them were middle-aged people. We have demonstrated the hypothesis to this step. Then, we grouped samples by their residences(provinces). We found that, in the provinces of Hubei and Guangdong, the ages of samples reported before 19th Jan 2020 are significantly higher than the ages of samples reported after that day. It suggests the COVID-2019 may be spreading in Hubei and Guangdong provinces before 19th Jan 2020 while people were unconscious of it. At last, we proposed that the ages distribution of each-day-reported samples could serve as a warning indicator of whether all potential COVID-2019 infected people are found. We think the power of our analysis is limit because 1. the work is data-driven, and 2. only ~5% of the COVID-2019 infected people in China are included in the study. However, we believe it still shows some value for its ability to estimate the possible unfound COVID-2019 infected people.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"CHAO WU","author_inst":"Zhe Jiang University, China"},{"author_name":"min zheng","author_inst":"zhe jiang university"},{"author_name":"C\u00e9cile Viboud","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Bryan T Grenfell","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Dushoff","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Xiaomin Jian","author_inst":"Beijing Fuxing Hospital Affiliated to Capital University of Medical Science"},{"author_name":"Liping Wang","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jiejun Shi","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chunyang Wu","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Guoxiang Li","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuan Fu","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Keyin Wang","author_inst":"the First Hospital of Jiaxing City"},{"author_name":"Mingqin Lu","author_inst":"the first affiliated hospital of Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Guoqing Qian","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.29.20039529","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic and symptomatic patients and risk for transfusion transmission","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.29.20039529","rel_abs":"Oral swabs, sputum and blood samples from 18 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were examined using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing.

In contrast, preoperative assessments use cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) to categorise patients to higher and lower risk independent of diagnostic labels. Since CPET is not feasible in population-based settings, our aims included evaluation of a triage\/screening tool for cardiorespiratory risk. METHODS: CPET-derived anaerobic thresholds were evaluated retrospectively in 26 patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) who represent a challenging group to risk-categorise. Pulmonary AVM-induced hypoxaemia secondary to intrapulmonary right-to-left shunts, anaemia from underlying hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia and metabolic equivalents derived from the 13-point Veterans Specific Activity Questionnaire (VSAQ) were evaluated as part of routine clinical care. Pre-planned analyses evaluated associations and modelling of the anaerobic threshold and patient-specific variables. RESULTS: In the 26 patients (aged 21-77, median 57 years), anaerobic threshold ranged from 7.6-24.5 (median 12.35) ml.min-1kg-1 and placed more than half of the patients (15, 57.7%) in the >11 ml.min-1kg-1 category suggested as lower-risk for intra-abdominal surgeries. Neither age nor baseline SpO2 predicted anaerobic threshold, or lower\/higher risk categories, either alone or in multivariate analyses, despite baseline oxygen saturation (SpO2) ranging from 79 to 99 (median 92)%, haemoglobin from 108 to 183 (median 156)g.L-1. However, lower haemoglobin, and particularly, arterial oxygen content and oxygen pulse were associated with increased cardiorespiratory risk: Modelling a haemoglobin increase of 25g.L-1 placed a further 7\/26 (26.9%) patients in a lower risk category. For patients completing the VSAQ, derived metabolic equivalents were strongly associated with anaerobic threshold enabling risk evaluations through a simple questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline exercise tolerance may override age and diagnostic labels in triage settings. These data support approaches to risk reduction by aerobic conditioning and attention to anaemia. The VSAQ is suggested as a rapid screening tool for cardiorespiratory risk assessment to implement during triage\/screening.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Saranya Thurairatnam","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Filip Gawecki","author_inst":"Imprial College London"},{"author_name":"Timothy Strangeways","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Joseph Perks","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Vatshalan Santhirapala","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Myers","author_inst":"Palo Alto Health Care System and Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Hannah C Tighe","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Luke SGE Howard","author_inst":"Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Claire L Shovlin","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Guoxiang Li","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuan Fu","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Keyin Wang","author_inst":"the First Hospital of Jiaxing City"},{"author_name":"Mingqin Lu","author_inst":"the first affiliated hospital of Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Guoqing Qian","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"emergency medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.27.20045195","rel_title":"A mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission between frontliners and the general public","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.27.20045195","rel_abs":"The number of COVID-19 cases is continuously increasing in different countries (as of March 2020) including the Philippines. It is estimated that the basic reproductive number of COVID-19 is around 1.5 to 4. The basic reproductive number characterizes the average number of persons that a primary case can directly infect in a population full of susceptible individuals. However, there can be superspreaders that can infect more than this estimated basic reproductive number. In this study, we formulate a conceptual mathematical model on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 between the frontliners and the general public. We assume that the general public has a reproductive number between 1.5 to 4, and frontliners (e.g. healthcare workers, customer service and retail personnel, food service crews, and transport or delivery workers) have a higher reproduction number. Our simulations show that both the frontliners and the general public should be protected or resilient against the disease. Protecting only the frontliners will not result in flattening the epidemic curve. Protecting only the general public may flatten the epidemic curve but the infection risk faced by the frontliners is still high, which may eventually affect their work. Our simple model does not consider all factors involved in COVID-19 transmission in a community, but the insights from our model results remind us of the importance of community effort in controlling the transmission of the disease. All in all, the take-home message is that everyone in the community, whether a frontliner or not, should be protected or should implement preventive measures to avoid being infected.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christian Alvin H Buhat","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Monica C Torres","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Yancee H Olave","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Maica Krizna A Gavina","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Edd Francis O Felix","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Gimelle B Gamilla","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Kyrell Vann B Verano","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Ariel L Babierra","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Jomar Fajardo Rabajante","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Guoxiang Li","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuan Fu","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Keyin Wang","author_inst":"the First Hospital of Jiaxing City"},{"author_name":"Mingqin Lu","author_inst":"the first affiliated hospital of Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Guoqing Qian","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.27.20045500","rel_title":"COVID-19: Projecting the impact in Rohingya refugee camps and beyond","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.27.20045500","rel_abs":"Background: COVID-19 could have even more dire consequences in refugees camps than in general populations. Bangladesh has confirmed COVID-19 cases and hosts almost 1 million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar with 600,000 concentrated in Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site (age mean: 21 years, sd: 18 years, 52% female). Projections of the potential COVID-19 burden, epidemic speed, and healthcare needs in such settings are critical for preparedness planning. Methods and Findings: To explore the potential impact of the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site, we used a stochastic SEIR transmission model with parameters derived from emerging literature and age as the primary determinant of infection severity. We considered three scenarios with different assumptions about the transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2. From the simulated infections, we estimated hospitalizations, deaths, and healthcare needs expected, age-adjusted for the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site age distribution. Our findings suggest that a large-scale outbreak is likely after a single introduction of the virus into the camp with 61-92% of simulations leading to at least 1,000 people infected across scenarios. On average, in the first 30 days of the outbreak, we expect 18 (95% prediction interval (PI), 2-65), 54 (95% PI, 3-223), and 370 (95% PI, 4-1,850) people infected in the low, moderate, and high transmission scenarios, respectively. These reach 421,500 (95% PI, 376,300-463,500), 546,800 (95% PI, 499,300-567,000) and 589,800 (95% PI, 578,800-595,600) people infected in 12 months, respectively. Hospitalization needs exceeded the existing hospitalization capacity of 340 beds after 55-136 days between the low and high transmission scenarios. We estimate 2,040 (95% PI, 1,660-2,500), 2,650 (95% PI, 2,030-3,380), and 2,880 (95% PI, 2,090-3,830) deaths in the low, moderate and high transmission scenarios, respectively. Due to limited data at the time of analyses, we assumed that age was the primary determinant of infection severity and hospitalization. We expect that comorbidities and limited hospitalization and intensive care capacity may increase this risk, thus we may be underestimating the potential burden. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that a COVID-19 epidemic in a refugee settlement may have profound consequences, requiring large increases in healthcare capacity and infrastructure that may exceed what is currently feasible in these settings. Detailed and realistic planning for the worst-case in Kutupalong-Balukhali and all refugee camps worldwide must begin now. Plans should consider novel and radical strategies to reduce infectious contacts and fill health worker gaps while recognizing that refugees may not have access to national health systems.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shaun A Truelove","author_inst":"Johns Hopksin Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Orit Abrahim","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Chiara Altare","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Stephen A Lauer","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Andrew Azman","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Paul B Spiegel","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Kyrell Vann B Verano","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Ariel L Babierra","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Jomar Fajardo Rabajante","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Guoxiang Li","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuan Fu","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Keyin Wang","author_inst":"the First Hospital of Jiaxing City"},{"author_name":"Mingqin Lu","author_inst":"the first affiliated hospital of Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Guoqing Qian","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.27.20045328","rel_title":"Elementary time-delay dynamics of COVID-19 disease","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.27.20045328","rel_abs":"An elementary model of COVID-19 dynamics, based on time-delay differential equations with a step-like survival function, is shown to be in good agreement with data from China and South Korea.

Second, we used an individual-level network-based model to reconstruct the epidemic dynamics in Hubei Province and examine the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the epidemic spreading with various scenarios. Our simulation results show that without continued control measures, the epidemic in Hubei Province could have become persistent. Only by continuing to decrease the infection rate through 1) protective measures and 2) social distancing can the actual epidemic trajectory that happened in Hubei Province be reconstructed in simulation. Finally, we simulate the COVID-19 transmission with non-Markovian processes and show how these models produce different epidemic trajectories, compared to those obtained with Markov processes. Since recent studies show that COVID-19 epidemiological parameters do not follow exponential distributions leading to Markov processes, future works need to focus on non-Markovian models to better capture the COVID-19 spreading trajectories. In addition, shortening the infectious period via early case identification and isolation can slow the epidemic spreading significantly.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Qihui Yang","author_inst":"Kansas State University"},{"author_name":"Chunlin Yi","author_inst":"Kansas State University"},{"author_name":"Aram Vajdi","author_inst":"Kansas State University"},{"author_name":"Lee W Cohnstaedt","author_inst":"United States Department of Agriculture"},{"author_name":"Hongyu Wu","author_inst":"Kansas State University"},{"author_name":"Xiaolong Guo","author_inst":"Kansas State University"},{"author_name":"Caterina M Scoglio","author_inst":"Kansas State University"},{"author_name":"Ariel L Babierra","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Jomar Fajardo Rabajante","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Los Banos"},{"author_name":"Guoxiang Li","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuan Fu","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"},{"author_name":"Keyin Wang","author_inst":"the First Hospital of Jiaxing City"},{"author_name":"Mingqin Lu","author_inst":"the first affiliated hospital of Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Guoqing Qian","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.29.20046730","rel_title":"Scaling analysis of COVID-19 spreading based on Belgian hospitalization data","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.29.20046730","rel_abs":"We analyze the temporal evolution of accumulated hospitalization cases due to COVID-19 in Belgium.

The need for IgG\/IgM combined antibody test is booming, but data on diagnostic indexes evaluation was inadequate. The aim of this study was to evaluate diagnostic indexes of a rapid IgG\/IgM combined antibody test for SARS-CoV-2. Methods A total of 179 patients were enrolled. Serum were collected for IgG-IgM combined antibody test and corresponding nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens were collected for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. According to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results, patients under study were categorized as PCR positive group in 90 patients and PCR negative group in 89 patients. Results 1. Of the 90 PCR positive samples, 77 were tested positive by SARS-CoV-2 IgG-IgM test kit, yielding a sensitivity of 85.6%. Meanwhile, of the 89 PCR negative sample, 8 samples were detected positive, resulting in a specificity of 91%. Positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of this test kit was 95.1%, 82.7%, and 88.3%, respectively. Kappa efficiency between IgG\/IgM test kit and RT-PCR were 0.75. 2. Accuracy in mild\/common and severe\/critical subgroup were 73.9% and 97.7%, respectively. Accuracy in clinical confirmed, suspected cases and other disease subgroups were 70%, 60%, and 100%, respectively. 3. Patients were further divided into 0-7, 8-15 and >= 16 groups according to the time from illness onset to sample collection. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy in these three groups were 18.8%, 77.8% and 40%; 100%, 50% and 87.5%; 100%, 64.3%, and 93.9, respectively. Conclusion The sensitivity and specificity of this ease-of-use IgG\/IgM combined test kit were adequate, plus short turnaround time, no specific requirements for additional equipment or skilled technicians, all of these collectively contributed to its competence for mass testing. At the current stage, it cannot take the place of SARA-CoV-2 nucleic acid RT-PCR, but can be served as a complementary option for RT-PCR. The combination of RT-PCR and IgG-IgM combined test kit could provide further insight into SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ying Liu","author_inst":"General Hospital of Central Theater Command"},{"author_name":"Yueping Liu","author_inst":"General Hospital of Central Theater Command"},{"author_name":"Bo Diao","author_inst":"General Hospital of Central Theater Command"},{"author_name":"Feifei Ren","author_inst":"General Hospital of Central Theater Command"},{"author_name":"Yue Wang","author_inst":"General Hospital of Central Theater Command"},{"author_name":"Jinya Ding","author_inst":"General Hospital of Central Theater Command"},{"author_name":"Qianchuan Huang","author_inst":"General Hospital of Central Theater Command"},{"author_name":"Nigam H Shah","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Arnold Milstein","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Kevin Schulman","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"David Scheinker","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Keyin Wang","author_inst":"the First Hospital of Jiaxing City"},{"author_name":"Mingqin Lu","author_inst":"the first affiliated hospital of Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Guoqing Qian","author_inst":"Ningbo First Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.24.20042374","rel_title":"What is required to prevent a second major outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 upon lifting the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan city, China","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.24.20042374","rel_abs":"Background: The Chinese government implemented a metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan city on 23rd January 2020 to curb the epidemic of the coronavirus COVID-19. Lifting of this quarantine is imminent. We modelled the effects of two key health interventions on the epidemic when the quarantine is lifted. Method: We constructed a compartmental dynamic model to forecast the trend of the COVID-19 epidemic at different quarantine lifting dates and investigated the impact of different rates of public contact and facial mask usage on the epidemic. Results: We estimated that at the end of the epidemic, a total of 65,572 (46,156-95,264) individuals would be infected by the virus, among which 16,144 (14,422-23,447, 24.6%) would be infected through public contacts, 45,795 (32,390-66,395, 69.7%) through household contact, 3,633 (2,344-5,865, 5.5%) through hospital contacts (including 783 (553-1,134) non-COVID-19 patients and 2,850 (1,801-4,981) medical staff members). A total of 3,262 (1,592-6,470) would die of COVID-19 related pneumonia in Wuhan. For an early lifting date (21st March), facial mask needed to be sustained at a relatively high rate ([&ge;]85%) if public contacts were to recover to 100% of the pre-quarantine level. In contrast, lifting the quarantine on 18th April allowed public person-to-person contact adjusted back to the pre-quarantine level with a substantially lower level of facial mask usage (75%). However, a low facial mask usage (<50%) combined with an increased public contact (>100%) would always lead a significant second outbreak in most quarantine lifting scenarios. Lifting the quarantine on 25th April would ensure a smooth decline of the epidemics regardless of the combinations of public contact rates and facial mask usage. Conclusion: The prevention of a second epidemic is viable after the metropolitan-wide quarantine is lifted but requires a sustaining high facial mask usage and a low public contact rate.","rel_num_authors":16,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lei Zhang","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Mingwang Shen","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Xiaomeng Ma","author_inst":"University of Toronto"},{"author_name":"Shu Su","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Wenfeng Gong","author_inst":"Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation"},{"author_name":"Jing Wang","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Yusha Tao","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Zhuoru Zou","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Rui Zhao","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Joseph Lau","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Wei Li","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Feng Liu","author_inst":"10.\tShaanxi Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Kai Ye","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Youfa Wang","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Guihua Zhuang","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Christopher K Fairley","author_inst":"Monash University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.24.20042366","rel_title":"Role of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine in the Treatment of COVID-19 Infection- A Systematic Literature Review","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.24.20042366","rel_abs":"Background: Coronavirus pandemic is currently a global public health emergency.

Objective: While there have been studies to describe the role of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in various viral conditions, there is limited information about the use of them in COVID-19. This systematic review aims to summarize the available evidence regarding the role of chloroquine in treating coronavirus infection. Methods: The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used for this review. A literature search was performed using PUBMED & Google Scholar to find articles about the role of CQ in COVID-19 patients. Results: We included 19 publications (Five published articles, three letters\/correspondence, one commentary, five pre-proofs of accepted articles, one abstract of yet to be published article, and four were pre-prints (not yet peer-reviewed) articles) in this systematic review.

Elucidating the diagnostic value of different methods, especially the auxiliary diagnosis value of antibodies assays for SARS-CoV-2 infection is helpful for improving the sensitivities of pathogenic-diagnosis, providing timely treatment, and differentiating the infected cases from the healthy, thus preventing further epidemics. Methods: Medical records from 38 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Second People's Hospital of Fuyang from January 22, 2020 to February 28, 2020 were collected and retrospectively analyzed. Specimens including throat swabs, sputum and serum were collected during the hospitalization period, viral RNAs and serum IgM-IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were measured respectively. The detectability of different methods as well as the auxiliary diagnosis value of antibodies test for SARS-CoV-2 infection were analyzed. Results: Among 38 patients, the total seropositive rate for IgM and IgG was 50.0% and 92.1%, respectively. Two patients remained seronegative throughout the course of illness. In the early phase of illness, the RNA test for sputum specimens possessed the highest detectability(92.3%), followed by the the RNA test for throat swabs (69.2%), and the antibodies assays presented lower positive rates(IgM, 23.0%, IgG, 53.8%). While, the sensitivity of antibodies assays overtook that of RNA test since day 8 after onset (IgM, 50.0%; IgG, 87.5%). Of note, the positive rate of throat swabs was only 13.0% for cases in later phase([&ge;]15 d.a.o), and the sensitivities of IgM and IgG rose to 52.2% and 91.3%, respectively. Combined use of antibodies assay and qRT-PCR at the same time was able to improve the sensitivities of pathogenic-diagnosis, especially for the throat swabs group at the later stage of illness. Moreover, most of these cases with undetectable viral RNA in throat swabs specimens at the early stage of illness were able to be IgM\/IgG seropositive after 7 days. Conclusions: The antibodies detection against SARS-CoV-2 offers vital clinical information for physicians, and could be used as an effective supplementary indicator for suspected cases of negative viral nucleic acid detection or in conjunction with nucleic acid detection in the diagnosis of suspected cases.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yong Gao","author_inst":"Department of Clinical laboratory, the Second People's Hospital of Fuyang, Fuyang 236015,China."},{"author_name":"Yi Yuan","author_inst":"Anhui Toneker Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Jinzhai 237300, China."},{"author_name":"Tuan Tuan Li","author_inst":"Department of Clinical laboratory, the Second People's Hospital of Fuyang, Fuyang 236015,China."},{"author_name":"Wu Xiao Wang","author_inst":"Department of Clinical laboratory, the Second People's Hospital of Fuyang, Fuyang 236015,China."},{"author_name":"Yong Xiu Li","author_inst":"Blood purification center, the Second People's Hospital of Fuyang, Fuyang 236015, China."},{"author_name":"Ang Li","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China."},{"author_name":"Feng Ming Han","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory, the Second People's Hospital of Fuyang, Fuyang 236015, China"},{"author_name":"Zhuoru Zou","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Rui Zhao","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Joseph Lau","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Wei Li","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Feng Liu","author_inst":"10.\tShaanxi Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Kai Ye","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Youfa Wang","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Guihua Zhuang","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Christopher K Fairley","author_inst":"Monash University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.24.20042168","rel_title":"Dispersion of a new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 by airlines in 2020: Temporal estimates of the outbreak in Mexico.","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.24.20042168","rel_abs":"On January 23, 2020, China imposed a quarantine on the city of Wuhan to contain the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.

This results in a virus spreading dynamics model. The results should be verified, but because of the current time pressure, we publish them in their current state. Recommendations for improvement are welcome. We come to the following conclusions: 1. Complete lockdown works. About 10 days after lockdown, the infection dynamics dies down. This assumes that lockdown is complete, which can be guaranteed in the simulation, but not in reality. Still, it gives strong support to the argument that it is never too late for complete lockdown. 2. As a rule of thumb, we would suggest complete lockdown no later than once 10% of hospital capacities available for COVID-19 are in use, and possibly much earlier. This is based on the following insights: a. Even after lockdown, the infection dynamics continues at home, leading to another tripling of the cases before the dynamics is slowed. b. There will be many critical cases coming from people who were infected before lockdown. Because of the exponential growth dynamics, their number will be large. c. Researchers with more detailed disease progression models should improve upon these statements. 3. Our simulations say that complete removal of infections at child care, primary schools, workplaces and during leisure activities will not be enough to sufficiently slow down the infection dynamics. It would have been better, but still not sufficient, if initiated earlier. 4. Infections in public transport play an important role. In the simulations shown later, removing infections in the public transport system reduces the infection speed and the height of the peak by approximately 20%. Evidently, this depends on the infection parameters, which are not well known. -- This does not point to reducing public transport capacities as a reaction to the reduced demand, but rather use it for lower densities of passengers and thus reduced infection rates. 5. In our simulations, removal of infections at child care, primary schools, workplaces, leisure activities, and in public transport may barely have been sufficient to control the infection dynamics if implemented early on. Now according to our simulations it is too late for this, and (even) harsher measures will have to be initiated until possibly a return to such a restrictive, but still somewhat functional regime will again be possible. Evidently, all of these results have to be taken with care. They are based on preliminary infection parameters taken from the literature, used inside a model that has more transport\/movement details than all others that we are aware of but still not enough to describe all aspects of reality, and suffer from having to write computer code under time pressure. Optimally, they should be confirmed independently. Short of that, given current knowledge we believe that they provide justification for \"complete lockdown\" at the latest when about 10% of available hospital capacities for COVID-19 are in use (and possibly earlier; we are no experts of hospital capabilities). What was not investigated in detail in our simulations was contact tracing, i.e. tracking down the infection chains and moving all people along infection chains into quarantine. The case of Singapore has so far shown that this may be successful. Preliminary simulation of that tactic shows that it is difficult to implement for COVID-19, since the incubation time is rather long, people are contagious before they feel sick, or maybe never feel sufficiently sick at all. We will investigate in future work if and how contact tracing can be used together with a restrictive, but not totally locked down regime. When opening up after lockdown, it would be important to know the true fraction of people who are already immune, since that would slow down the infection dynamics by itself. For Wuhan, the currently available numbers report that only about 0.1% of the population was infected, which would be very far away from \"herd immunity\". However, there have been and still may be many unknown infections.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sebastian Alexander Muller","author_inst":"TU Berlin"},{"author_name":"Michael Balmer","author_inst":"Senozon AG, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Andreas Neumann","author_inst":"Senozon GmbH, Germany"},{"author_name":"Kai Nagel","author_inst":"TU Berlin"},{"author_name":"Samuel Ponce-de-Leon","author_inst":"Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico"},{"author_name":"Ang Li","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China."},{"author_name":"Feng Ming Han","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory, the Second People's Hospital of Fuyang, Fuyang 236015, China"},{"author_name":"Zhuoru Zou","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Rui Zhao","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Joseph Lau","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Wei Li","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Feng Liu","author_inst":"10.\tShaanxi Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Kai Ye","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Youfa Wang","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Guihua Zhuang","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Christopher K Fairley","author_inst":"Monash University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.27.20045005","rel_title":"A modified SEIR model to predict the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain: simulating control scenarios and multi-scale epidemics","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.27.20045005","rel_abs":"After the spread of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic out of China, evolution in the pandemic worldwide shows dramatic differences among countries. In Europe, the situation of Italy first and later Spain has generated great concern, and despite other countries show better prospects, large uncertainties yet remain on the future evolution and the efficacy of containment, mitigation or attack strategies. Here we applied a modified SEIR compartmental model accounting for the spread of infection during the latent period, in which we also incorporate effects of varying proportions of containment. We fit data to quarantined populations in order to account for the uncertainties in case reporting and study the scenario projections for the 17 individual regions (CCAA). Results indicate that with data for March 23, the epidemics follow an evolution similar to the isolation of 1,5 percent of the population and if there were no effects of intervention actions it might reach a maximum of over 1.4M infected around April 27. The effect on the epidemics of the ongoing partial confinement measures is yet unknown (an update of results with data until March 31st is included), but increasing the isolation around ten times more could drastically reduce the peak to over 100k cases by early April, while each day of delay in taking this hard containment scenario represents a 90 percent increase of the infected population at the peak. Dynamics at the sub aggregated levels of CCAA show epidemics at the different levels of progression with the most worrying situation in Madrid an Catalonia. Increasing alpha values up to 10 times, in addition to a drastic reduction in clinical cases, would also more than halve the number of deaths. Updates for March 31st simulations indicate a substantial reduction in burden is underway. A similar approach conducted for Italy pre- and post-interventions also begins to suggest substantial reduction in both infected and deaths has been achieved, showing the efficacy of drastic social distancing interventions.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Leonardo R Lopez","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Xavier Rodo","author_inst":"Barcelona Institute for Global Health"},{"author_name":"Andreas Neumann","author_inst":"Senozon GmbH, Germany"},{"author_name":"Kai Nagel","author_inst":"TU Berlin"},{"author_name":"Samuel Ponce-de-Leon","author_inst":"Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico"},{"author_name":"Ang Li","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China."},{"author_name":"Feng Ming Han","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory, the Second People's Hospital of Fuyang, Fuyang 236015, China"},{"author_name":"Zhuoru Zou","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Rui Zhao","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Joseph Lau","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Wei Li","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Feng Liu","author_inst":"10.\tShaanxi Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Kai Ye","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Youfa Wang","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Guihua Zhuang","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Christopher K Fairley","author_inst":"Monash University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.27.20045237","rel_title":"Dynamic Modeling to Identify Mitigation Strategies for Covid-19 Pandemic","rel_date":"2020-03-30","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.03.27.20045237","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV2 spread is hard to control, as asymptomatic people contribute to transmission. Currently, Covid-19 mitigation imposes social distancing and isolates the diseased. This slows down virus spread, eases stress on health care systems and thereby reduces the death toll. However, this strategy takes a high economic toll, and virus transmission will surge again if measures are lifted. App-based contact tracing of symptomatic cases and isolating their contacts has been proposed as an alternative, but may not suffice for mitigation, as asymptomatic infections remain unidentified. Here, we evaluate complementary mitigation strategies relying on virus-RNA testing to detect and quarantine both, symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. Epidemic dynamics modeling shows that stopping the pandemic by mass testing alone is unrealistic, as we lack enough tests. However, realistic numbers of tests may suffice in a smart-testing strategy, e.g. when biasing tests towards people with exceptionally high numbers of contacts. These people are at particularly high risk to become infected (with or without symptoms) and transmit the virus. A mitigation strategy combining smart testing with contact counting (STeCC) and contact tracing in one app would reduce R0 by 2.4-fold (e.g. from R0=2.4 to R0=1) with realistic test numbers ({approx}166 per 100'000 people per day) when a realistic fraction of smartphone owners use the app ({approx}72%, i.e. {approx}50% in total population). Thereby, STeCC expands the portfolio of mitigation strategies and may help easing social distancing without compromising public health.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hossein Gorji","author_inst":"EPFL"},{"author_name":"Markus Arnoldini","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"David F Jenny","author_inst":"Fliweg 19, 8872 Weesen, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Wolf-Dietrich Hardt","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Patrick Jenny","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Ang Li","author_inst":"School of Life Sciences and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China."},{"author_name":"Feng Ming Han","author_inst":"Department of Respiratory, the Second People's Hospital of Fuyang, Fuyang 236015, China"},{"author_name":"Zhuoru Zou","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Rui Zhao","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Joseph Lau","author_inst":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"author_name":"Wei Li","author_inst":"Southeast University"},{"author_name":"Feng Liu","author_inst":"10.\tShaanxi Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Kai Ye","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Youfa Wang","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Guihua Zhuang","author_inst":"Xi'an Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Christopher K Fairley","author_inst":"Monash University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"}]}
