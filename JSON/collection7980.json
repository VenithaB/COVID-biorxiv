It is important to study the host range of SARS-CoV-2 because some domestic species might harbor the virus and transmit it back to humans. In addition, insight into the ability of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-like viruses to utilize animal orthologs of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 might provide structural insight into improving ACE2-based viral entry inhibitors. Here we show that ACE2 orthologs of a wide range of domestic and wild animals support entry of SARS-CoV-2, as well as that of SARS-CoV-1, bat coronavirus RaTG13, and a coronavirus isolated from pangolins. Some of these species, including camels, cattle, horses, goats, sheep, pigs, cats, and rabbits may serve as potential intermediate hosts for new human transmission, and rabbits in particular may serve as a useful experimental model of COVID-19. We show that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 entry could be potently blocked by recombinant IgG Fc-fusion proteins of viral spike protein receptor-binding domains (RBD-Fc) and soluble ACE2 (ACE2-Fc). Moreover, an ACE2-Fc variant, which carries a D30E mutation and has ACE2 truncated at its residue 740 but not 615, outperforms all the other ACE2-Fc variants on blocking entry of both viruses. Our data suggest that RBD-Fc and ACE2-Fc could be used to treat and prevent infection of SARS-CoV-2 and any new viral variants that emerge over the course of the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yujun Li","author_inst":"Shenzhen Bay Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Haimin Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Bay Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Xiaojuan Tang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Bay Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Danting Ma","author_inst":"Shenzhen Bay Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Chengzhi Du","author_inst":"Shenzhen Bay Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Yifei Wang","author_inst":"Shenzhen Bay Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Hong Pan","author_inst":"Shenzhen Bay Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Qing Zou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Bay Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Jie Zheng","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Liangde Xu","author_inst":"School of Biomedical Engineering and Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Michael Farzan","author_inst":"Department of Immunology and Microbiology, The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Guocai Zhong","author_inst":"Shenzhen Bay Laboratory"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.08.20057919","rel_title":"Burden and prevalence of prognostic factors for severe covid-19 disease in Sweden","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.08.20057919","rel_abs":"Objectives: Describe the burden and prevalence of prognostic factors of severe COVID-19 disease at national and county level in Sweden. Design: Cross sectional study Setting: Sweden Participants: 9,624,428 individuals living in Sweden on 31st December 2014 and alive on 1st January 2016 Main outcome measures: Burden and prevalence of prognostic factors for severe COVID-19 based on the guidelines from the World Health Organization and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, which are age 70 years and older, cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe asthma, and diabetes. Prognostic factors were identified based on records for three years before 1st January 2016 from the Swedish National Inpatient and Outpatient Specialist Care Register, Prescribed Drug Register, and Cancer Register. Results: 22.1% of the study population had at least one prognostic factor for severe COVID-19 (2,131,319 individuals), and 1.6% had at least three factors (154,746 individuals). The prevalence of underlying medical conditions in the whole study population ranged from 0.8% with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (78,516 individuals) to 7.4% with cardiovascular disease (708,090 individuals), and the county specific prevalence of at least one prognostic factor ranged from 19.2% in Stockholm (416,988 individuals) to 25.9% in Kalmar (60,005 individuals). Conclusions: The prevalence of prognostic factors for severe COVID-19 disease will aid authorities in optimally planning healthcare resources during the ongoing pandemic. Results can also be applied to underlying assumptions of disease burden in modelling efforts to support COVID-19 planning. This information is crucial when deciding appropriate strategies to mitigate the pandemic and reduce both the direct mortality burden from the disease itself, and the indirect mortality burden from potentially overwhelmed health systems.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Katalin Gemes","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Mats Talback","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Karin Modig","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Anders Ahlbom","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Anita Berglund","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Maria Feychting","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Anthony Matthews","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Qing Zou","author_inst":"Shenzhen Bay Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Jie Zheng","author_inst":"Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Liangde Xu","author_inst":"School of Biomedical Engineering and Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Michael Farzan","author_inst":"Department of Immunology and Microbiology, The Scripps Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Guocai Zhong","author_inst":"Shenzhen Bay Laboratory"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.09.033910","rel_title":"Integrative Network Biology Framework Elucidates Molecular Mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 Pathogenesis","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.09.033910","rel_abs":"COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) is a respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

We examined publically available time-series data of laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, the causal agent for COVID-19, to try to explore, using a Bayesian approach, about the sensitivity and specificity of the PCR-based diagnostic test. Data originated from Alberta, Canada (available on 3\/28\/2020) and city of Philadelphia, USA (available on 3\/31\/2020). Our analysis revealed that the data were compatible with near-perfect specificity but it was challenging to gain information about sensitivity (prior and posterior largely overlapped). We applied these insights to uncertainty\/bias analysis of epidemic curves into jurisdictions under the assumptions of both improving and degrading sensitivity. If the sensitivity improved from 60 to 95%, the observed and adjusted epidemic curves likely fall within the 95% confidence intervals of the observed counts. However, bias in the shape and peak of the epidemic curves can be pronounced, if sensitivity either degrades or remains poor in the 60-70% range. In the extreme scenario, hundreds of undiagnosed cases, even among tested, are possible, potentially leading to further unchecked contagion should these cases not self-isolate. The best way to better understand bias in the epidemic curves of COVID-19 due to errors in testing is to empirically evaluate misclassification of diagnosis in clinical settings and apply this knowledge to adjustment of epidemic curves, a task for which the Bayesian method we presented is well-suited.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Igor Burstyn","author_inst":"Drexel University"},{"author_name":"Neal D.

The genomes of SARS-COV-2 strains isolated from different parts of the world are now available and the unique features of constituent genes and proteins have gotten substantial attention recently. Spike glycoprotein is widely considered as a possible target to be explored because of its role during the entry of coronaviruses into host cells. We analyzed 320 whole-genome sequences and 320 spike protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 using multiple sequence alignment tools. In this study, 483 unique variations have been identified among the genomes including 25 non-synonymous mutations and one deletion in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Among the 26 variations detected, 12 variations were located at the N-terminal domain and 6 variations at the receptor-binding domain (RBD) which might alter the interaction with receptor molecules. In addition, 22 amino acid insertions were identified in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with that of SARS-CoV. Phylogenetic analyses of spike protein revealed that Bat coronavirus have a close evolutionary relationship with circulating SARS-CoV-2. The genetic variation analysis data presented in this study can help a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Based on our findings, potential inhibitors can be designed and tested targeting these proposed sites of variation.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Syed Mohammad Lokman","author_inst":"University of Chittagong"},{"author_name":"Md.

The resulting disease, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-2019), soon became a pandemic. This study aims to characterize key attributes of the epidemiology of this infection in China. Methods: An age-stratified mathematical model was constructed to describe the transmission dynamics and estimate the age-specific differences in the biological susceptibility to the infection, age-assortativeness in transmission mixing, case fatality rate (CFR), and transition in rate of infectious contacts (and reproduction number R0) following introduction of mass interventions. Results: The model estimated the infectious contact rate in early epidemic at 0.59 contacts per day (95% uncertainty interval (UI)=0.48-0.71). Relative to those 60-69 years of age, susceptibility to the infection was only 0.06 in those [&le;]19 years, 0.34 in 20-29 years, 0.57 in 30-39 years, 0.69 in 40-49 years, 0.79 in 50-59 years, 0.94 in 70-79 years, and 0.88 in [&ge;]80 years. The assortativeness in transmission mixing by age was very limited at 0.004 (95% UI=0.002-0.008). Final CFR was 5.1% (95% UI=4.8-5.4%). R0 rapidly declined from 2.1 (95% UI=1.8-2.4) to 0.06 (95% UI=0.05-0.07) following onset of interventions. Conclusion: Age appears to be a principal factor in explaining the patterns of COVID-19 transmission dynamics in China. The biological susceptibility to the infection seems limited among children, intermediate among young to mid-age adults, but high among those >50 years of age. There was no evidence for differential contact mixing by age, consistent with most transmission occurring in households rather than in schools or workplaces.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Houssein H Ayoub","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Physics, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Hiam Chemaitelly","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Epidemiology Group, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, Cornell University, Qatar Foundation - Education City, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Ghina R Mumtaz","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and population Health, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon"},{"author_name":"Shaheen Seedat","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Epidemiology Group, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, Cornell University, Qatar Foundation - Education City, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Susanne F Awad","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Epidemiology Group, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, Cornell University, Qatar Foundation - Education City, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Monia Makhoul","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Epidemiology Group, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, Cornell University, Qatar Foundation - Education City, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Laith J Abu-Raddad","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Epidemiology Group, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, Cornell University, Qatar Foundation - Education City, Doha, Qatar"},{"author_name":"Amam Zonaed Siddiki","author_inst":"University of Chittagong"},{"author_name":"Adnan Mannan","author_inst":"University of Chittagong"},{"author_name":"Md.

Considering the importance of the ongoing coronavirus crisis, we decided to evaluate genomes of all coronaviruses sequenced to date (stated more broadly, the order Nidovirales) to determine if they contain noncanonical nucleic acid structures. We discovered much evidence of putative G-quadruplex sites and even much more of inverted repeats (IRs) loci, which in fact are ubiquitous along the whole genomic sequence and indicate a possible mechanism for genomic RNA packaging. The most notable enrichment of IRs was found inside 5'UTR for IRs of size 12+ nucleotides, and the most notable enrichment of putative quadruplex sites (PQSs) was located before 3'UTR, inside 5'UTR, and before mRNA. This indicates crucial regulatory roles for both IRs and PQSs. Moreover, we found multiple G-quadruplex binding motifs in human proteins having potential for binding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Noncanonical nucleic acids structures in Nidovirales and in novel SARS-CoV-2 are therefore promising druggable structures that can be targeted and utilized in the future.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Martin Bartas","author_inst":"University of Ostrava"},{"author_name":"Vaclav Brazda","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic"},{"author_name":"Natalia Bohalova","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic"},{"author_name":"Alessio Cantara","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic"},{"author_name":"Adriana Volna","author_inst":"University of Ostrava"},{"author_name":"Tereza Stachurova","author_inst":"University of Ostrava"},{"author_name":"Katerina Malachova","author_inst":"University of Ostrava"},{"author_name":"Eva B Jagelska","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic"},{"author_name":"Otilia Porubiakova","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic"},{"author_name":"Jiri Cerven","author_inst":"University of Ostrava"},{"author_name":"Petr Pecinka","author_inst":"University of Ostrava"},{"author_name":"Guocai Zhong","author_inst":"Shenzhen Bay Laboratory"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.08.20058123","rel_title":"Long-term predictions for COVID-19 pandemic dynamics in Ukraine, Austria and Italy","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.08.20058123","rel_abs":"The SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) model, statistical approach to the parameter identification and the official WHO daily data about the confirmed cumulative number of cases were used to make some estimations for the dynamics of the coronavirus pandemic dynamics in Ukraine, Italy and Austria.

From India two clinical isolates have been sequenced and the full genome deposited in GenBank. We have performed sequence analyses of the spike protein of the Indian isolates and compared with that of the Wuhan, China (where the outbreak was first reported). While all the sequences of Wuhan isolates are identical, we found point mutations in the Indian isolates. Out of the two isolates one was found to harbour a mutation in its Receptor binding domain (RBD) at position 407. At this site arginine (a positively charged amino acid) was replaced by isoleucine (a hydrophobic amino acid that is also a C-beta branched amino acid). This mutation has been seen to change the secondary structure of the protein at that region and this can potentially alter receptor ding of the virus.

There are currently no proven pharmaceutical treatments, and vaccines are likely over a year away. At present, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are the only effective option to reduce transmission of the virus, but it is not clear how to deploy these potentially expensive and disruptive measures. Modeling can be used to understand the potential effectiveness of NPIs for both suppression and mitigation efforts. Methods and Findings: We developed Corvid, an adaptation of the agent-based influenza model called FluTE to SARS-CoV-2 transmission. To demonstrate features of the model relevant for studying the effects of NPIs, we simulated transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a synthetic population representing a metropolitan area in the United States. Transmission in the model occurs in several settings, including at home, at work, and in schools. We simulated several combinations of NPIs that targeted transmission in these settings, such as school closures and work-from-home policies. We also simulated three strategies for testing and isolating symptomatic cases. For our demonstration parameters, we show that testing followed by home isolation of ascertained cases reduced transmission by a modest amount. We also show how further reductions may follow by isolating cases in safe facilities away from susceptible family members or by quarantining all family members to prevent transmission from likely infections that have yet to manifest. Conclusions: Models that explicitly include settings where individuals interact such as the home, work, and school are useful for studying the effectiveness of NPIs, as these are more dependent on community structure than pharmaceutical interventions such as vaccination. Corvid can be used to help evaluate complex combinations of interventions, although there is no substitute for real-world observations. Our results on NPI effectiveness summarize the behavior of the model for an assumed set of parameters for demonstration purposes. Model results can be sensitive to the assumptions made about disease transmission and the natural history of the disease, both of which are not yet sufficiently characterized for SARS-CoV-2 for quantitative modeling. Models of SARS-CoV-2 transmission will need to be updated as the pathogen becomes better-understood.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dennis L Chao","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Assaf P Oron","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Devabhaktuni Srikrishna","author_inst":"Patient Knowhow, Inc."},{"author_name":"Michael Famulare","author_inst":"Institute for Disease Modeling"},{"author_name":"Upasana Ray","author_inst":"CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology"},{"author_name":"Tereza Stachurova","author_inst":"University of Ostrava"},{"author_name":"Katerina Malachova","author_inst":"University of Ostrava"},{"author_name":"Eva B Jagelska","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic"},{"author_name":"Otilia Porubiakova","author_inst":"Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic"},{"author_name":"Jiri Cerven","author_inst":"University of Ostrava"},{"author_name":"Petr Pecinka","author_inst":"University of Ostrava"},{"author_name":"Guocai Zhong","author_inst":"Shenzhen Bay Laboratory"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.09.034983","rel_title":"Classical drug digitoxin inhibits influenza cytokine storm, with implications for COVID-19 therapy.","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.09.034983","rel_abs":"Influenza viruses, corona viruses and related pneumotropic viruses cause sickness and death partly by inducing a hyper-proinflammatory response by immune cells and cytokines in the host airway.

Methods: We used the Robert Koch Institute data on weekly COVID-19 cases in different age groups in Germany. To minimize the effect of changes in healthcare seeking behavior (e.g. for older adults) and testing practices, we included the following eight 5-year age groups in the analyses: 10-14y through 45-49y. For each age group g, we considered the proportion PL(g) of individuals in age group g among all detected cases aged 10-49y during weeks 13-14, 2020 (later period), as well as corresponding proportion PE(g) for weeks 10-11, 2020 (early period), and defined the relative risk RR(g) for the age group g to be the ratio RR(g)=PL(g)\/PE(g). For each pair of age groups g1,g2, a higher value of RR(g1) compared to RR(g2), or, alternatively, a value above 1 for the odds ratio OR(g1,g2)=RR(g1)\/RR(g2) for a COVID-19 case to be in group g1 vs. g2 for the later vs. early periods is interpreted as the relative increase in the population incidence of SARS-Cov-2 in the age group g1 compared to g2 for the later vs. early period. Results: The relative risk RR(g) was highest for individuals aged 20-24y (RR=1.4(95% CI (1.27,1.55))), followed by individuals aged 15-19y (RR=1.14(0.99,1.32)), aged 30-34y (RR= 1.07(0.99,1.16)), aged 25-29y (RR= 1.06(0.98,1.15)), aged 35-39y (RR=0.95(0.87,1.03)), aged 40-44y (RR=0.9(0.83,0.98)), aged 45-49y (RR=0.83(0.77,0.89)) and aged 10-14y (RR=0.78(0.64,0.95)). For the age group 20-24y, the odds ratio relative to any other age group for a case to be during the later vs. early period was significantly above 1. For the age group 15-19y, the odds ratio relative to any other age group either above 35y or 10-14y for a case to be during the later vs. early period was significantly above 1. Conclusions: The observed relative increase with time in the prevalence of individuals aged 15-34y (particularly those aged 20-24y) among detected COVID-19 cases in Germany is unlikely to be explained by increases in the likelihood of seeking medical care or the likelihood of being tested for individuals in those age groups compared to individuals aged 35-49y or 10-14y, and should be indicative of the actual increase in the prevalence of individuals aged 15-34y among SARS-CoV-2 infections in the German population. That increase likely reflects elevated mixing among individuals aged 15-34y (particularly those aged 20-24y) compared to other age groups, possibly due to lesser adherence to social distancing practices.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Edward Goldstein","author_inst":"Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Marc Lipsitch","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

Here we report two newly identified adjacent amino acid polymorphisms in the nucleocapsid at positions 203 and 204 (R203K\/G204R) due to three adjacent nucleotide changes across the two codons (i.e. AGG GGA to AAA CGA). This new strain within the LGG clade may have arisen by a form of homologous recombination from the core sequence (CS-B) of the transcription-regulating sequences of SAS-CoV-2 itself and has rapidly increased to approximately one third of reported sequences from Europe during the month of March 2020. We note that these polymorphisms are predicted to reduce the binding of an overlying putative HLA-C*07-restricted epitope and that HLA-C*07 is prevalent in Caucasians being carried by >40% of the population. The findings suggest that homologous recombination may have occurred since its introduction into humans and be a mechanism for increased viral fitness and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to human populations.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shay Leary","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Murdoch University"},{"author_name":"Silvana Gaudieri","author_inst":"University of Western Australia"},{"author_name":"Abha Chopra","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Murdoch University"},{"author_name":"Suman Pakala","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Eric Alves","author_inst":"University of Western Australia"},{"author_name":"Mina John","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Murdoch University"},{"author_name":"Suman Das","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Simon Mallal","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Phillips Jane Phillips","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jiri Cerven","author_inst":"University of Ostrava"},{"author_name":"Petr Pecinka","author_inst":"University of Ostrava"},{"author_name":"Guocai Zhong","author_inst":"Shenzhen Bay Laboratory"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.09.20057257","rel_title":"Assessing the risk of spread of COVID-19 to the Asia Pacificregion","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.09.20057257","rel_abs":"During the early stages of an emerging disease outbreak, governments are required to make critical decisions on how to respond appropriately, despite limited data being available to inform these decisions. Analytical risk assessment is a valuable approach to guide decision-making on travel restrictions and border measures during the early phase of an outbreak, when transmission is primarily contained within a source country. Here we introduce a modular framework for estimating the importation risk of an emerging disease when the direct travel route is restricted and the risk stems from indirect importation via intermediary countries. This was the situation for Australia in February 2020. The framework was specifically developed to assess the importation risk of COVID-19 into Australia during the early stages of the outbreak from late January to mid-February 2020. The dominant importation risk to Australia at the time of analysis was directly from China, as the only country reporting uncontained transmission. However, with travel restrictions from mainland China to Australia imposed from February 1, our framework was designed to consider the importation risk from China into Australia via potential intermediary countries in the Asia Pacific region. The framework was successfully used to contribute to the evidence base for decisions on border measures and case definitions in the Australian context during the early phase of COVID-19 emergence and is adaptable to other contexts for future outbreak response.","rel_num_authors":0,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shay Leary","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Murdoch University"},{"author_name":"Silvana Gaudieri","author_inst":"University of Western Australia"},{"author_name":"Abha Chopra","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Murdoch University"},{"author_name":"Suman Pakala","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Eric Alves","author_inst":"University of Western Australia"},{"author_name":"Mina John","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Murdoch University"},{"author_name":"Suman Das","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Simon Mallal","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Phillips Jane Phillips","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jiri Cerven","author_inst":"University of Ostrava"},{"author_name":"Petr Pecinka","author_inst":"University of Ostrava"},{"author_name":"Guocai Zhong","author_inst":"Shenzhen Bay Laboratory"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.11.036855","rel_title":"Evaluation of heating and chemical protocols for inactivating SARS-CoV-2","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.11.036855","rel_abs":"Clinical samples collected in COVID-19 patients are commonly manipulated in BSL-2 laboratories for diagnostic purpose.

While some economies are actively recovering from this pestilence, others are experiencing fast and consistent disease spread, compelling governments to impose social distancing measures that have put a halt on routines, especially in densely populated areas. Objective: Aiming at bringing more light on key economic and population health factors affecting the disease spread, this initial study utilizes a quantitative statistical analysis based on the most recent publicly available COVID-19 datasets. Methods: We have applied Pearson Correlation Analysis and Clustering Analysis (X-Means Clustering) techniques on the data obtained by combining multiple datasets related to country economics, medical system & health, and COVID-19 - related statistics. The resulting dataset consisted of COVID-19 Case and Mortality Rates, Economic Statistics, and Population Public Health Statistics for 165 countries reported between 22 January 2020 and 28 March 2020. The correlation analysis was conducted with the significance level  of 0.05. The clustering analysis was guided by the value of Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) with the bin value b = 1.0 and the cutoff factor c = 0.5, and have provided a stable split into four country-level clusters. Results: The study showed and explained multiple significant relationships between the COVID-19 data and other country-level statistics. We also identified and statistically profiled four major country-level clusters with relation to different aspects of COVID-19 development and country-level economic and health indicators. Specifically, this study identified potential COVID-19 under-reporting traits, as well as various economic factors that impact COVID-19 Diagnosis, Reporting, and Treatment. Based on the country clusters, we also described the four disease development scenarios, which are tightly knit to country-level economic and population health factors. Finally, we highlighted the potential limitation of reporting and measuring COVID-19 and provided recommendations on further in-depth quantitative research. Conclusions: In this study, we first identified possible COVID-19 reporting issues and biases across different countries and regions. Second, we identified crucial factors affecting the speed of COVID-19 disease spread and provided recommendations on choosing and operating economic and health system factors when analyzing COVID-19 progression. Particularly, we discovered that the political system and compliance with international disease control norms are crucial for effective COVID-19 pandemic cessation. However, the role of some widely-adopted measures, such as GHS Health Index, might have been overestimated in lieu of multiple biases and underreporting challenges. Third, we benchmarked our findings against the widely-adopted Global Health Security (GHS) model and found that the latter might be redundant when measuring and forecasting COVID-19 spread, while its individual components could potentially serve as stronger COVID-19 indicators. Fourth, we discovered four clusters of countries characterized by different COVID-19 development scenarios, highlighting the differences of the disease reporting and progression in different economic and health system settings. Finally, we provided recommendations on sophisticated measures and research approaches to be implemented for effective outbreak measurements, evaluation and forecasting. We have supported the latter recommendations by a preliminary regression analysis based on the our-collected dataset. We believe that our work would encourage further in-depth quantitative research along the direction as well as would be of support to public policy development when addressing the COVID-19 crisis worldwide.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aleksandr Farseev","author_inst":"ITMO University"},{"author_name":"Yu-Yi Chu-Farseeva","author_inst":"SoMin.ai Research"},{"author_name":"Yang Qi","author_inst":"ITMO University"},{"author_name":"Daron Benjamin Loo","author_inst":"National University of Singapore"},{"author_name":"Remi N Charrel","author_inst":"Unite des Virus Emergents (UVE: Aix Marseille Univ, IRD 190, INSERM U1207, IHU Mediterranee Infection), Marseille, France"},{"author_name":"Mina John","author_inst":"Institute for Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Murdoch University"},{"author_name":"Suman Das","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Simon Mallal","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Phillips Jane Phillips","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jiri Cerven","author_inst":"University of Ostrava"},{"author_name":"Petr Pecinka","author_inst":"University of Ostrava"},{"author_name":"Guocai Zhong","author_inst":"Shenzhen Bay Laboratory"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.10.023358","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 detection with CRISPR diagnostics","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.10.023358","rel_abs":"The novel coronavirus (CoV) disease termed COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2) is causing a massive pandemic worldwide, threatening public health systems across the globe.

These observations might impact not only public health, but also suggest more studies are needed to understand the genetic mechanisms that may affect the development of therapeutic and preventive tools, like antivirals and vaccines.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lauro Velazquez-Salinas","author_inst":"Plum Island Animal Disease Center"},{"author_name":"Selene Zarate","author_inst":"Autonomous University of Mexico City, Mexico City, Mexico"},{"author_name":"Samantha Eberl","author_inst":"Central Connecticut State University, New Britain, CT 06053."},{"author_name":"Douglas P Gladue","author_inst":"Plum Island Animal Disease Center"},{"author_name":"Isabel Novella","author_inst":"Independent Researcher"},{"author_name":"Manuel V Borca","author_inst":"USDA\/ARS\/PIADC"},{"author_name":"Moyu Dai","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Bin Qu","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sen Fang","author_inst":"University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yihuan Mao","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yangcan Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Guihai Feng","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Qi Gu","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Liu Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ruiqi Rachel Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Qi Zhou","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wei Li","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"evolutionary biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.08.20058347","rel_title":"A Comprehensive Analysis of COVID-19 Outbreak situation in India","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.08.20058347","rel_abs":"The outbreak of COVID-19 in different parts of the world is a major concern for all the administrative units of respective countries. India is also facing this very tough task for controlling the virus outbreak and has managed its growth rate through some strict measures. This study presents the current situation of coronavirus spread in India along with the impact of various measures taken for it. With the help of data sources (till 7th-8th April 2020) from various state units of India and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, this study presents various trends and patterns. This study answers six different research ques-tions in a comprehensive manner. It has been reported that growth rate of infected cases has been controlled with the help of National Lockdown, however some uncontrolled mass level events had negatively impacted the infected cases. With the help of exponential and polyno-mial regression modelling, the predictions of up to 75000 cases have been done by the end of April 2020. It has also been seen that there are some prominent clusters and patient nodes in the network of patients which are the major influencers for COVID-19 spread. Also, death rate case predictions have been done through multi-class classification models with an accuracy of 75%. At the end, strategies for continuation for lockdown has been discussed and presented. It appears that only essential services should be open for the citizens of India and the national lockdown should be carried on for next 2-4 weeks. This study will be useful for the Government of India and various states of India, Administrative Units of India, Frontline health workforce of India, researchers and scientists. This study will also be favorable for the administrative units of other countries to consider various aspects related to the control of COVID-19 outspread in their respective regions.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rajan Gupta","author_inst":"University of Delhi"},{"author_name":"Saibal Kumar Pal","author_inst":"DRDO, Delhi"},{"author_name":"Gaurav Pandey","author_inst":"TheNorthCap University"},{"author_name":"Douglas P Gladue","author_inst":"Plum Island Animal Disease Center"},{"author_name":"Isabel Novella","author_inst":"Independent Researcher"},{"author_name":"Manuel V Borca","author_inst":"USDA\/ARS\/PIADC"},{"author_name":"Moyu Dai","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Bin Qu","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sen Fang","author_inst":"University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yihuan Mao","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yangcan Chen","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Guihai Feng","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Qi Gu","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Liu Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Ruiqi Rachel Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Qi Zhou","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Wei Li","author_inst":"Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.08.20058297","rel_title":"Work-related Covid-19 transmission","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.08.20058297","rel_abs":"Importance: Our study helps fill the knowledge gap related to work-related transmission in the emerging coronaviral pandemic. Objective: To demonstrate high-risk occupations for early coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) local transmission. Methods: In this observational study, we extracted confirmed Covid-19 cases from governmental investigation reports in Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. We followed each country\/area for 40 days after its first locally transmitted case, and excluded all imported cases. We defined a possible work-related case as a worker with evidence of close contact with another confirmed case due to work, or an unknown contact history but likely to be infected in the working environment (e.g. an airport taxi driver). We calculated the case number for each occupation, and illustrated the temporal distribution of all possible work-related cases and healthcare worker (HCW) cases. The temporal distribution was further defined as early outbreak (the earliest 10 days of the following period) and late outbreak (11th to 40th days of the following period). Results: We identified 103 possible work-related cases (14.9%) among a total of 690 local transmissions. The five occupation groups with the most cases were healthcare workers (HCWs) (22%), drivers and transport workers (18%), services and sales workers (18%), cleaning and domestic workers (9%) and public safety workers (7%). Possible work-related transmission played a substantial role in early outbreak (47.7% of early cases). Occupations at risk varied from early outbreak (predominantly services and sales workers, drivers, construction laborers, and religious professionals) to late outbreak (predominantly HCWs, drivers, cleaning and domestic workers, police officers, and religious professionals). Conclusions: Work-related transmission is considerable in early Covid-19 outbreaks, and the elevated risk of infection was not limited to HCW. Implementing preventive\/surveillance strategies for high-risk working populations is warranted.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fan-Yun Lan","author_inst":"Department of Environmental Health, Harvard University T.H.

Ultraviolet-C wavelength is a promising way of decontamination, however adequate dosimetry is needed to ensure balance between over and underexposed areas and provide reliable results. Our study demonstrates that UVGI light irradiance varies significantly on different respirator angles and propose a method to decontaminate several masks at once ensuring appropriate dosage in shaded zones. Methods: An UVGI irradiator was built with internal dimensions of 69.5 x55 x 33 cm with three 15W UV lamps. Inside, a grating of 58 x 41 x 15 cm was placed to hold the masks. Two different flat fold respirator models were used to assess irradiance, four of model Aura 9322 3M of dimensions 17 x 9 x 4cm (tri-fold), and two of model SAFE 231FFP3NR (bi-fold) with dimensions 17 x 6 x 5 cm. A spectrometer STN-SilverNova was employed to verify wavelength spectrum and surface irradiance. A simulation was performed to find the irradiance pattern inside the box and the six masks placed inside. These simulations were carried out using the software DIALUX EVO 8.2. Results: The data obtained reveal that the irradiance received inside the manufactured UVGI-irradiator depends not only on the distance between the lamps plane and the base of the respirators but also on the orientation and shape of the masks. This point becomes relevant in order to assure that all the respirators inside the chamber receive the correct dosage. Conclusion: Irradiance over FFR surfaces depend on several factors such as distance and angle of incidence of the light source. Careful irradiance measurement and simulation can ensure reliable dosage in the whole mask surface, balancing overexposure. Closed box systems might provide a more reliable, reproducible UVGI dosage than open settings.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aurora Baluja","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care.

Health systems will need surge capacity to absorb acute increases in caseload due to the pandemic. We assessed the capacity of the Kenyan health system to absorb surges in the number of people that will need hospitalization and critical care because of the COVID-19. Methods We assumed that 2% of the Kenyan population get symptomatic infection by SARS-Cov-2 based on modelled estimates for Kenya and determined the health system surge capacity for COVID-19 under three transmission curve scenarios, 6, 12, and 18 months. We estimated four measures of hospital surge capacity namely: 1) hospital bed surge capacity 2) ICU bed surge capacity 3) Hospital bed tipping point, and 5) ICU bed tipping point. We computed this nationally and for all the 47 county governments. Results The capacity of Kenyan hospitals to absorb increases in caseload due to COVID-19 is constrained by the availability of oxygen, with only 58% of hospital beds in hospitals with oxygen supply. There is substantial variation in hospital bed surge capacity across counties. For example, under the 6 months transmission scenario, the percentage of available general hospital beds that would be taken up by COVID-19 cases varied from 12% Tharaka Nithi county, to 145% in Trans Nzoia county. Kenya faces substantial gaps in ICU beds and ventilator capacity. Only 22 out of the 47 counties have at least 1 ICU unit. Kenya will need an additional 1,511 ICU beds and 1,609 ventilators (6 months transmission curve) to 374 ICU beds and 472 ventilators (18 months transmission curve) to absorb caseloads due to COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Edwine Barasa","author_inst":"Health Economics Research Unit, KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Paul O Ouma","author_inst":"Population Health Unit, KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Emelda A Okiro","author_inst":"Population Health Unit, KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme"},{"author_name":"Julio Corti\u00f1as","author_inst":"Department of Anaesthesiology and Critical Care.

In Taiwan, most cases to date were imported or linked to imported cases. Methods In collaboration with Facebook Data for Good, we characterized changes in movement patterns in Taiwan since February 2020, and built metapopulation models that incorporate human movement data to identify the high risk areas of disease spread and assess the potential effects of local travel restrictions in Taiwan. Results We found that mobility changed with the number of local cases in Taiwan in the past few months. For each city, we identified the most highly connected areas that may serve as sources of importation during an outbreak. We showed that the risk of an outbreak in Taiwan is enhanced if initial infections occur around holidays. Intracity travel reductions have a higher impact on the risk of an outbreak than intercity travel reductions, while intercity travel reductions can narrow the scope of the outbreak and help target resources. The timing, duration, and level of travel reduction together determine the impact of travel reductions on the number of infections, and multiple combinations of these can result in similar impact. Conclusions To prepare for the potential spread within Taiwan, we utilized Facebook's aggregated and anonymized movement and colocation data to identify cities with higher risk of infection and regional importation. We developed an interactive application that allows users to vary inputs and assumptions and shows the spatial spread of the disease and the impact of intercity and intracity travel reduction under different initial conditions. Our results can be used readily if local transmission occurs in Taiwan after relaxation of border control, providing important insights into future disease surveillance and policies for travel restrictions.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Meng-Chun Chang","author_inst":"National Tsing Hua University"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Kahn","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

It has been suggested that ACE- inhibitors (ACEi) and Angiotensin-2 Blockers (ARB), which are commonly used in patients with hypertension or diabetes and may raise ACE2 levels, could increase the risk of severe COVID19 infection. Methods and Results: We evaluated this hypothesis in a consecutive cohort of 1200 acute inpatients with COVID19 at two hospitals with a multi-ethnic catchment population in London (UK). The mean age was 68+-17 years (57% male) and 74% of patients had at least 1 comorbidity. 415 patients (34.6%) reached the primary endpoint of death or transfer to a critical care unit for organ support within 21-days of symptom onset. 399 patients (33.3 %) were taking ACEi or ARB. Patients on ACEi\/ARB were significantly older and had more comorbidities. The odds ratio (OR) for the primary endpoint in patients on ACEi and ARB, after adjustment for age, sex and co-morbidities, was 0.63 (CI 0.47-0.84, p<0.01). Conclusions: There was no evidence for increased severity of COVID19 disease in hospitalised patients on chronic treatment with ACEi or ARB. A trend towards a beneficial effect of ACEi\/ARB requires further evaluation in larger meta-analyses and randomised clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniel Bean","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Zeljko Kraljevic","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Thomas Searle","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Bendayan","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Andrew Pickles","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Amos Folarin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Lukasz Roguski","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Kawsar Noor","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Anthony Shek","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rosita Zakeri","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Ajay Shah","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"James Teo","author_inst":"King's College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Richard JB Dobson","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"Nancy Francoeur","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Betsaida Salom Melo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Irina Oussenko","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Gintaras Deikus","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Juan Soto","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Shwetha Hara Sridhar","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Ying-Chih Wang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Twyman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Andrew Kasarskis","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Deena Rose Altman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Melissa Smith","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Robert Sebra","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Judith Aberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Garcia-Sarstre","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Marta Luksza","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Gopi Patel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alberto Paniz-Mondolfi","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Melissa Gitman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Emilia Mia Sordillo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Viviana Simon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Harm van Bakel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.07.20056754","rel_title":"Applying the unified models of ecology to forecast epidemics, with application to Covid-19","rel_date":"2020-04-11","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.07.20056754","rel_abs":"During a burgeoning outbreak of a novel disease, public attention will ordinarily expand as the severity of the outbreak expands--as infections multiply and news reports accumulate. Such public attention will in turn reinforce tactics to control the outbreak. In classical epidemiological models, effects of such tactics can be incorporated in standard parameters of transmission, recovery, and mortality. Unfortunately, early in an outbreak those individual parameters may be poorly known, hence corresponding models can get lost in uncertainty. This makes it difficult to determine whether the disease is spreading exponentially or logistically, or along another path. Examining cases over time is also problematic, as a logistically growing infection that is leveling off appears exponential in early phases. Here we report on the most basic mechanistic, ecological model we can imagine, which can help distinguish growth that is and is not under control. This approach did a satisfactory job predicting the final outcome of the Ebola outbreak of 2014-15. The model's two parameters were computable in real time, well before the outcome was actually known. The first parameter is an intrinsic rate of increase in cumulative deaths or reported cases. The second parameter is related to the human social system and represents all tactics that combine to control the outbreak. That parameter is coupled to the number of cumulative deaths or cases. We examine the basic mechanisms operating in this model and show the predictions made during the Ebola outbreak. We also consider how this basic model is performing for the Covid-19 pandemic and highlight ecological models that align with popularly discussed concepts such as flatten-the-curve, exponential growth, and inflection points of curves.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shelby W Loberg","author_inst":"University of Minnesota Morris"},{"author_name":"Clarence Lehman","author_inst":"University of Minnesota Twin Cities"},{"author_name":"Thomas Searle","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Bendayan","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Andrew Pickles","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Amos Folarin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Lukasz Roguski","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Kawsar Noor","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Anthony Shek","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Rosita Zakeri","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Ajay Shah","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"James Teo","author_inst":"King's College Hospital"},{"author_name":"Richard JB Dobson","author_inst":"Kings College London"},{"author_name":"Nancy Francoeur","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Betsaida Salom Melo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Irina Oussenko","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Gintaras Deikus","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Juan Soto","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Shwetha Hara Sridhar","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Ying-Chih Wang","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Kathryn Twyman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Andrew Kasarskis","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Deena Rose Altman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Melissa Smith","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Robert Sebra","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Judith Aberg","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Florian Krammer","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Adolfo Garcia-Sarstre","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Marta Luksza","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Gopi Patel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alberto Paniz-Mondolfi","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Melissa Gitman","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Emilia Mia Sordillo","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Viviana Simon","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Harm van Bakel","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"}]}
