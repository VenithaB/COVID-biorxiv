However, data on hospitalized pregnant women show that the symptom profile and risk factors for severe disease are similar to those among women who are not pregnant, although preterm birth, Cesarean delivery, and stillbirth may be more frequent and vertical transmission is possible. Limited data are available for the cohort of pregnant women that gave rise to these hospitalized cases, hindering our ability to quantify risk of COVID-19 sequelae for pregnant women in the community. Objective: To test the hypothesis that pregnant women in community differ in their COVID-19 symptoms profile and disease severity compared to non-pregnant women. This was assessed in two community-based cohorts of women aged 18-44 years in the United Kingdom, Sweden and the United States of America. Study design: This observational study used prospectively collected longitudinal (smartphone application interface) and cross-sectional (web-based survey) data. Participants in the discovery cohort were drawn from 400,750 UK, Sweden and US women (79 pregnant who tested positive) who self-reported symptoms and events longitudinally via their smartphone, and a replication cohort drawn from 1,344,966 USA women (162 pregnant who tested positive) cross-sectional self-reports samples from the social media active user base. The study compared frequencies of symptoms and events, including self-reported SARS-CoV-2 testing and differences between pregnant and non-pregnant women who were hospitalized and those who recovered in the community. Multivariable regression was used to investigate disease severity and comorbidity effects. Results: Pregnant and non-pregnant women positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection drawn from these community cohorts were not different with respect to COVID-19-related severity. Pregnant women were more likely to have received SARS-CoV-2 testing than non-pregnant, despite reporting fewer clinical symptoms. Pre-existing lung disease was most closely associated with the severity of symptoms in pregnant hospitalized women. Heart and kidney diseases and diabetes were additional factors of increased risk. The most frequent symptoms among all non-hospitalized women were anosmia [63% in pregnant, 92% in non-pregnant] and headache [72%, 62%]. Cardiopulmonary symptoms, including persistent cough [80%] and chest pain [73%], were more frequent among pregnant women who were hospitalized. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea and vomiting, were different among pregnant and non-pregnant women who developed severe outcomes. Conclusions: Although pregnancy is widely considered a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and outcomes, and was associated with higher propensity for testing, the profile of symptom characteristics and severity in our community-based cohorts were comparable to those observed among non-pregnant women, except for the gastrointestinal symptoms. Consistent with observations in non-pregnant populations, comorbidities such as lung disease and diabetes were associated with an increased risk of more severe SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. Pregnant women with pre-existing conditions require careful monitoring for the evolution of their symptoms during SARS-CoV-2 infection.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Erika Molteni","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Christina M Astley","author_inst":"Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"Wenjie Ma","author_inst":"Clinical and Translational Epidemiology Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA"},{"author_name":"Carole Helene Sudre","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Laura A Magee","author_inst":"Department of Women and Childrens Health, School of Life Course Sciences and the Institute of Women and Childrens Health, Kings College London, London, United K"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Murray","author_inst":"School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, Kings College London, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Tove Fall","author_inst":"Department of Medical Sciences and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Maria F Gomez","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Sciences, Lund University Diabetes Centre, Jan Waldenstroems gata 35, SE-21428, Malmo, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Neli Tsereteli","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Sciences, Lund University Diabetes Centre, Jan Waldenstroems gata 35, SE-21428, Malmo, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Paul W Franks","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Sciences, Lund University Diabetes Centre, Jan Waldenstroems gata 35, SE-21428, Malmo, Sweden."},{"author_name":"John S Brownstein","author_inst":"Boston Childrens Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Richard Davies","author_inst":"Zoe Global Limited, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Wolf","author_inst":"Zoe Global Limited, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Timothy Spector","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Ourselin","author_inst":"School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, Kings College London, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Claire Steves","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Andrew T Chan","author_inst":"Clinical and Translational Epidemiology Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Marc Modat","author_inst":"School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, Kings College London, London, United Kingdom"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.17.20176271","rel_title":"Knowledge and Perception of COVID-19, Prevalence of Pre-Existing Conditions, and Access to Essential Resources and Health Services in Somali IDP Camps","rel_date":"2020-08-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.17.20176271","rel_abs":"Background: Three million internally displaced Somalis live in overcrowded settlements with weakened infrastructure, insufficient access to WASH facilities, and inaccessible health services. This vulnerable population is especially susceptible to COVID-19, which is expected to have worsened health outcomes and exacerbate existing structural challenges in the implementation of public health measures. This study examines knowledge of COVID-19, self-reported prevalence of preexisting conditions, and access to essential health services among residents of internally displaced persons (IDP) camps in Somalia. Methods: A descriptive, cross-sectional survey design assessing demographics, current health profiles, knowledge and perceptions of COVID-19, and access to resources was used. 401 Somali IDP camp residents completed the survey. Results: Though 77% of respondents reported taking at least one COVID-19 preventative public health measure, respondents reported a severe lack of access to adequate sanitation, an inability to practice social distancing, and nearly universal inability to receive a COVID-19 screening exam. Questions assessing knowledge surrounding COVID-19 prevention and treatment yielded answers of \"I don't know\" for roughly 50% of responses. The majority were not familiar with basic information about the virus or confident that they could receive medical services if infected. Those who perceived their health status to be \"fair,\" as opposed to \"good,\" showed 5.69 times higher odds of being concerned about contracting COVID-19. Respondents who felt more anxious or nervous and those who introduced one behavioral change to protect against COVID-19 transmission showed 10.16 and 5.20 times increased odds of being concerned about disease contraction, respectively. Conclusion: This study highlights immense gaps in the knowledge and perceptions of COVID-19 and access to treatment and preventative services among individuals living in Somali IDP camps. A massive influx of additional resources is required to adequately address COVID-19 in Somalia, starting with educating those individuals most vulnerable to infection.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jude Alawa","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Lucas A Walz","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Samir Al-Ali","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Eleanor Wiles","author_inst":"Milken Institute School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Nikhil Harle","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Awale Mohamed Abdullahi","author_inst":"SIMAD University"},{"author_name":"Deqo Mohamed","author_inst":"Hagarla Institute"},{"author_name":"Kaveh Khoshnood","author_inst":"Yale School of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Neli Tsereteli","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Sciences, Lund University Diabetes Centre, Jan Waldenstroems gata 35, SE-21428, Malmo, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Paul W Franks","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Sciences, Lund University Diabetes Centre, Jan Waldenstroems gata 35, SE-21428, Malmo, Sweden."},{"author_name":"John S Brownstein","author_inst":"Boston Childrens Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Richard Davies","author_inst":"Zoe Global Limited, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Wolf","author_inst":"Zoe Global Limited, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Timothy Spector","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Sebastien Ourselin","author_inst":"School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, Kings College London, London, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Claire Steves","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Andrew T Chan","author_inst":"Clinical and Translational Epidemiology Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"},{"author_name":"Marc Modat","author_inst":"School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, Kings College London, London, United Kingdom"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.17.20176370","rel_title":"Suboptimal SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T-cell response associated with the prominent HLA-A*02:01 phenotype","rel_date":"2020-08-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.17.20176370","rel_abs":"An improved understanding of human T-cell-mediated immunity in COVID-19 is important if we are to optimize therapeutic and vaccine strategies. Experience with influenza shows that infection primes CD8+ T-cell memory to shared peptides presented by common HLA types like HLA-A2. Following re-infection, cross-reactive CD8+ T-cells enhance recovery and diminish clinical severity. Stimulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells from COVID-19 convalescent patients with overlapping peptides from SARS-CoV-2 Spike, Nucleocapsid and Membrane proteins led to the clonal expansion of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells in vitro, with CD4+ sets being typically robust. For CD8+ T-cells taken directly ex vivo, we identified two HLA-A*02:01-restricted SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, A2\/S269-277 and A2\/Orf1ab3183-3191. Using peptide-HLA tetramer enrichment, direct ex vivo assessment of the A2\/S269+CD8+ and A2\/Orf1ab3183+CD8+ populations indicated that the more prominent A2\/S269+CD8+ set was detected at comparable frequency (1.3x10-5) in acute and convalescent HLA-A*02:01+ patients. But, while the numbers were higher than those found in uninfected HLA-A*02:01+ donors (2.5x10-6), they were low when compared with frequencies for influenza-specific (A2\/M158) and EBV-specific (A2\/BMLF1280) (1.38x10-4) populations. Phenotypic analysis ex vivo of A2\/S269+CD8+ T-cells from COVID-19 convalescents showed that A2\/S269+CD8+ T-cells were predominantly negative for the CD38, HLA-DR, PD-1 and CD71 activation markers, although the majority of total CD8+ T-cells were granzyme and\/or perforin-positive. Furthermore, the bias towards naive, stem cell memory and central memory A2\/S269+CD8+ T-cells rather than effector memory populations suggests that SARS-CoV2 infection may be compromising CD8+ T-cell activation. Priming with an appropriate vaccine may thus have great value for optimizing protective CD8+ T-cell immunity in COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jennifer R Habel","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Thi H O Nguyen","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Carolien E van de Sandt","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Jennifer A Juno","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Priyanka Chaurasia","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Kathleen Wragg","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Marios Koutsakos","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Luca Hensen","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Brendon Chua","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Wuji Zhang","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Hyon Xhi Tan","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Katie L Flanagan","author_inst":"Launceston General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Denise Doolan","author_inst":"James Cook University"},{"author_name":"Joseph Torresi","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Weisan Chen","author_inst":"La Trobe University"},{"author_name":"Linda Wakim","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Allen Cheng","author_inst":"Alfred Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jan Petersen","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Jamie Rossjohn","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Adam K Wheatley","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Stephen Kent","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Louise Rowntree","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Katherine Kedzierska","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.18.20177360","rel_title":"Information given by websites selling home self-sampling COVID-19 tests: An analysis of accuracy and completeness","rel_date":"2020-08-19","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.18.20177360","rel_abs":"Objectives: To assess the accuracy and completeness of information provided by websites selling home self-sampling and testing kits for COVID-19. Design: Cross-sectional observational study. Setting: All websites (n=27) selling direct to user home self-sampling and testing for COVID-19 (41 tests) in the UK (39 tests) and US (2 tests) identified by a website search on 23rd May 2020. Main outcome measures: Thirteen predefined basic information items to communicate to a user, including who should be tested, when and how testing should be done, test accuracy, and interpretation of results. Results: Many websites did not provide the name or manufacturer of the test (32\/41; 78%), when to use the test (10\/41; 24%), test accuracy (12\/41; 29%), and how to interpret results (21\/41; 51%). Sensitivity and specificity were the most commonly reported test accuracy measures (either reported for 27\/41 (66%) tests); we could only link these figures to manufacturers documents or publications for four (10%) tests. Predictive values, most relevant to users, were rarely reported (five [12%] tests reported positive predictive values). For molecular virus tests, 9\/23 (39%) websites explained that test positives should self-isolate, and 8\/23 (35%) explained that test negatives may still have the disease. For antibody tests, 12\/18 (67%) websites explained that testing positive does not necessarily infer immunity from future infection. Seven (39%) websites selling antibody tests claimed the test had a CE mark, when they were for a different intended use (venous blood rather than finger-prick samples). Conclusions: At the point of online purchase of home self-sampling COVID-19 tests, users in the UK are provided with incomplete, and in some cases misleading information on test accuracy, intended use and test interpretation. Best practice guidance for communication about tests to the public should be developed and enforced for online sales of COVID-19 tests.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sian Taylor-Phillips","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Sarah Berhane","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Alice Sitch","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Karoline Freeman","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Malcolm Price","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Clare Davenport","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Julia Geppert","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Isobel Harris","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Osemeke Osokogu","author_inst":"University of Warwick"},{"author_name":"Magdalena Skrybant","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Jonathan J Deeks","author_inst":"University of Birmingham"},{"author_name":"Katie L Flanagan","author_inst":"Launceston General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Denise Doolan","author_inst":"James Cook University"},{"author_name":"Joseph Torresi","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Weisan Chen","author_inst":"La Trobe University"},{"author_name":"Linda Wakim","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Allen Cheng","author_inst":"Alfred Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jan Petersen","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Jamie Rossjohn","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Adam K Wheatley","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Stephen Kent","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Louise Rowntree","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Katherine Kedzierska","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.18.256446","rel_title":"Neutralizing antibody-dependent and -independent immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 in cynomolgus macaques","rel_date":"2020-08-19","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.18.256446","rel_abs":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infectious disease (COVID-19) has been threatening the world because of severe symptoms and relatively high mortality.

Objective: Hypothesis is that increasing temperature results in reduced SARS CoV-2 transmission and may help slow the increase of cases over time. Setting: Fifty representative Northern Hemisphere countries meeting specific criteria had sufficient COVID-19 case and meteorological data for analysis. Methods: Regression was used to find relationship between the log of number of COVID-19 cases and temperature over time in 50 representative countries. To summarize the day-day variability, and reduce dimensionality, we selected a robust measure, Coefficient of Time (CT), for each location. The resulting regression coefficients were then used in a multivariable regression against meteorological, country-level and demographic covariates. Results: Median minimum daily temperature showed the strongest correlation with the reciprocal of CT (which can be considered as a rate associated with doubling time) for confirmed cases (adjusted R2=0.610, p= 1.45E-06). A similar correlation was found using median daily dewpoint, which was highly colinear with temperature, and therefore was not used in the analysis. The correlation between minimum median temperature and the rate of increase of the log of confirmed cases was 47% and 45% greater than for cases of death and recovered cases of COVID-19, respectively. This suggests the primary influence of temperature on SARS-CoV2 transmission more than COVID-19 morbidity. Based on the correlation between temperature and the rate of increase in COVID-19, it can be estimated that, between the range of 30 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit, a one degree increase leads to a 1% decrease--and a one degree decrease leads to a 3.7% increase--in the rate of increase of the log of daily confirmed cases. Conclusion: The results suggest that boreal summer months are associated with slower rates of COVID-19 transmission, with the reverse true in winter months. Knowledge of COVID-19 seasonality could prove useful in local planning for phased reductions social interventions and help to prepare for the timing of possible pandemic resurgence during cooler months.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adam Ian Kaplin","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Caesar Junker","author_inst":"Joint Artificial Intelligence Center"},{"author_name":"Anupama Kumar","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Mary Anne de Amorim Ribeiro","author_inst":"PUPA"},{"author_name":"Eileen Yu","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Michael Wang","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ted Smith","author_inst":"University of Louisville School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shesh Nath Rai","author_inst":"University of Louisville School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Aruni Bhatnager","author_inst":"University of Louisville School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Pedro A Piedra","author_inst":"Baylor College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Larry R Ellingsworth","author_inst":"Novavax, Inc."},{"author_name":"Gregory Glenn","author_inst":"Novavax, Inc."},{"author_name":"Gale Smith","author_inst":"Novavax, Inc."},{"author_name":"Joseph Torresi","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Weisan Chen","author_inst":"La Trobe University"},{"author_name":"Linda Wakim","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Allen Cheng","author_inst":"Alfred Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jan Petersen","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Jamie Rossjohn","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Adam K Wheatley","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Stephen Kent","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Louise Rowntree","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Katherine Kedzierska","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.17.20176842","rel_title":"Healthcare workers high COVID-19 infection rate: the source of infections and potential for respirators and surgical masks to reduce occupational infections","rel_date":"2020-08-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.17.20176842","rel_abs":"Objective: To analyse the work-related exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and trace the source of COVID-19 infections in tertiary hospitals healthcare workers in light of the used PPE and their ability to maintain social distances and follow governmental restrictions. Design: Cross-sectional study Setting: Tertiary hospitals in Uusimaa region, Finland Participants: Of 1072 enrolled, 866 HCWs (588 nurses, 170 doctors and 108 laboratory and medical imaging nurses) from the Helsinki University Hospital completed the questionnaire by July 15th, 2020. The average age of participants was 42.4 years and 772 (89.0%) were women. The participants answered a detailed questionnaire of their PPE usage, ability to follow safety restrictions, exposure to COVID-19, the source of potential COVID-19 infection and both mental and physical symptoms during the first wave of COVID-19 in Finland. Main outcome measures: All participants with COVID-19 symptoms were tested with either RT-PCR or antibody tests. The infections were traced and categorised based on the location and source of infection. The possibility to maintain social distance and PPE usage during exposure were analyzed. Results: Of the HCWs that participated, 41 (4.7%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, marking a substantially higher infection rate than that of the general population (0.3%); 22 (53.6%) of infections were confirmed or likely occupational, including 7 (31.8%) from colleagues. Additionally, 5 (26.3%) of other infections were from colleagues outside the working facilities. 14 (63.6%) of occupational infections occurred while using a surgical mask. No occupational infections were found while using an FFP2\/3 respirator and aerosol precautions while treating suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: While treating suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients, HCWs should wear an FFP2\/3 respirator and recommended PPE. Maintaining safety distances in the workplace and controlling infections between HCWs should be priorities to ensure safe working conditions.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lotta-Maria A.

Social risk factors, together with other demographic and community characteristics, may reveal local variations and inequities in COVID risk that could be useful for targeting testing and interventions. Yet to date, rates of infection and estimations of COVID risk are typically reported at the county and state level. In this study we develop a small area vulnerability index based on publicly-available sociodemographic data and 668,428 COVID diagnoses reported in 4,803 ZIP codes in the United States (15% of all ZIP codes). The outcome was COVID-19 diagnosis rates per 100,000 people by ZIP code. Explanatory variables included sociodemographic characteristics obtained from the 2018 American Community Survey 5-year estimates. Bayesian multivariable techniques were used to capture complexities of spatial data and spatial autocorrelation and identify individual risk factors and derive their respective weights in the index. COVID-19 diagnosis rates varied from zero to 29,508 per 100,000 people. The final vulnerability index showed that higher population density, higher percentage of noninsured, nonwhite race and Hispanic ethnicity were positively associated with COVID-19 diagnosis rates. Our findings indicate disproportionate risk of COVID-19 infection among some populations and validate and expand understanding of these inequities, integrating several risk factors into a summary index reflecting composite vulnerability to infection. This index can provide local public health and other agencies with evidence-based metrics of COVID risk at a geographical scale that has not been previously available to most US communities.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"ofer amram","author_inst":"Washington State University"},{"author_name":"Solmaz Amiri","author_inst":"Washington State University"},{"author_name":"Emily L Thorn","author_inst":"Washington State University"},{"author_name":"Jacob J.

In April 2020, multiple reports of an association between a hyperinflammatory, Kawasaki-like condition and SARS-CoV-2 were published and termed as pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS) or multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS). A thorough characterization of this syndrome (demographics, presentation, diagnosis, and outcome) is currently lacking. Objective. We aimed to perform a systematic review of published cases of this novel multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children associated with COVID-19. Evidence review. A literature search of Pubmed, Embase, BioRxiv, MedRxiv and COVID-19 specific research repositories (Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global Research Database) was conducted from December 30th, 2019 to June 30th, 2020. Publications describing inflammatory syndromes associated with COVID-19 were included. Of 333 unique publications, 229 records were excluded based on title and abstract. After screening the full text, 40 observational studies and case reports were included, comprising 687 cases (published between May 9th, 2020 and June 30th, 2020). Findings. In contrast to classic Kawasaki disease, epidemiological enrichment for adolescents (median age 9 [6.0-12.3]) and ethnic minorities (35.8% black and 24.5% Hispanic\/Latino) was observed. There was a male predominance (59.1%). Apart from obesity (24.4%), pre-existing conditions were infrequent. The majority suffered from gastrointestinal (87.2%) and cardiocirculatory (79.2%) manifestations. Respiratory symptoms (51.2%) were less frequent. Over half of patients (56.3%) presented with hemodynamic shock, and critical care interventions were often necessary (inotropics (56.5%), mechanical ventilation (22.9%), non-invasive ventilation (30.6%), extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO;4.5%)). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and RT-PCR were positive in respectively 69.4% and 36.7%. Eleven deaths were reported (1.6%). The RCPCH case definition proved to be most comprehensive comprising all single cases. In contrast, WHO and CDC MIS definitions are more stringent, with the CDC case definition often missing severe cases requiring intensive care (n = 33 out of 95 cases). Conclusions and Relevance. This novel pediatric multisystem hyperinflammatory condition, associated with COVID-19, is characterized by a severe and heterogeneous disease spectrum. Despite frequent intensive care interventions, mortality rate was low and short-term outcome favorable. Long-term follow-up of possible chronic complications and additional clinical research, to elucidate the underlying immunological pathogenesis and possible genetic predisposition is crucial.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Levi Hoste","author_inst":"Ghent University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ruben Van Paemel","author_inst":"Ghent University"},{"author_name":"Filomeen Haerynck","author_inst":"Ghent University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jacob J.

However, as some studies have shown, virions can remain infectious for up to 72 hours on surfaces, which can lead to transmission through contact. For this reason, a comprehensive study was conducted to determine the efficiency of protocols to recover SARS-CoV-2 from surfaces in built environments. This end-to-end (E2E) study showed that the effective combination of monitoring SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces include using an Isohelix swab as a collection tool, DNA\/RNA Shield as a preservative, an automated system for RNA extraction, and reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) as the detection assay. Using this E2E approach, this study showed that, in some cases, SARS-CoV-2 viral standards were still recovered from surfaces as detected by RT-qPCR for as long as eight days even after bleach treatment. Additionally, debris associated with specific built environment surfaces appeared to negatively impact the recovery of RNA, with Amerstat inhibition as high as 90% when challenged with an inactivated viral control. Overall, it was determined that this E2E protocol required a minimum of 1,000 viral particles per 25 cm2 to successfully detect virus from test surfaces. When this method was employed to evaluate 368 samples collected from various built environmental surfaces, all samples tested negative, indicating that the surfaces were either void of virus or below the detection limit of the assay.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ceth W.

In this study, combining capture-recapture methods with Bayesian inference in an age-structured mathematical model, we use a unique European dataset compiled by the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) to quantify the efficiency of 24 NPIs and their combinations (referred to as public health responses, PHR) in reducing SARS-Cov-2 transmission rates in 32 European countries. Of 166 unique PHR tested, we found that median decrease in viral transmission was 74%, which is enough to suppress the epidemic. PHR efficiency was positively associated with the number of NPIs implemented. We found that bans on mass gatherings had the largest effect among NPIs, followed by school closures, teleworking, and stay home orders. Partial implementation of most NPIs resulted in lower than average response efficiency. This first large-scale estimation of NPI and PHR efficiency against SARS-COV-2 transmission in Europe suggests that a combination of NPIs targeting different population groups should be favored to control future epidemic waves.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andres Garchitorena","author_inst":"Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement"},{"author_name":"Hugo Gruson","author_inst":"IRD"},{"author_name":"Bernard Cazelles","author_inst":"Sorbonne Universite"},{"author_name":"Benjamin ROCHE","author_inst":"IRD"},{"author_name":"Jason M Wood","author_inst":"California Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Arman Seuylemezian","author_inst":"California Polytechnic University of Pomona"},{"author_name":"Parag Vaishampayan","author_inst":"Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Camilla Urbaniak","author_inst":"NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Ryan Hendrickson","author_inst":"Jet Propulsion Lab"},{"author_name":"Pheobe Laaguiby","author_inst":"University of Vermont"},{"author_name":"Kevin Clark","author_inst":"Jet Propulsion Laboratory-NASA"},{"author_name":"Brian G Clement","author_inst":"NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Niamh B O'Hara","author_inst":"Biotia"},{"author_name":"Mara Couto-Rodriguez","author_inst":"Biotia"},{"author_name":"Daniela Bezdan","author_inst":"Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG), The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Chris Mason","author_inst":"Cornell University"},{"author_name":"Kasthuri Venkateswaran","author_inst":"California Institute of Technology"},{"author_name":"Jan Petersen","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Jamie Rossjohn","author_inst":"Monash University"},{"author_name":"Adam K Wheatley","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Stephen Kent","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Louise Rowntree","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Katherine Kedzierska","author_inst":"University of Melbourne"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.17.20176552","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in children with MIS-C and mild and severe COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-08-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.17.20176552","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in children remain poorly characterized.

As the mask covers the eyes, mouth and nose, it acts as a full-face shield, providing additional protection to healthcare workers. The filtration efficiency of different medical filters is measured for particles below 300 nm to cover the size of the SARS-CoV-2 and small virus-laden droplets. The filtration performance of the adapted full-face mask is characterized using NaCl particles below 500 nm and different fitting scenarios. The mask is compared to a commercial respirator and characterized according to the EN 149 standard, demonstrating that the protection fulfills the requirements for the FFP2 level (filtering face-piece 2, stopping at least 94% of airborne particles). The device shows a good resistance to several cycles of decontamination (autoclaving and ethanol immersion), is easy to be produced locally at low cost and helps addressing the shortage in FFP2 masks and face shields by providing adequate protection to healthcare workers against particles below 500 nm.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jean Schmitt","author_inst":"ETH Zurich"},{"author_name":"Lewis S.

Here we present results from a large serosurveillance study of 10,019 asymptomatic HCW conducted during April-May 2020, in eight hospital medical centers across the state of Oregon, USA during the initial peak of the pandemic. Free and voluntary testing was performed at 14 +\/- 3 day intervals, over a 4-week window at each site, utilizing a lab-developed ELISA based on the Epitope Diagnostics COVID-19 nucleocapsid IgG detection Kit. We identified 253 SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositive individuals among 10,019 total participants, representing a cross-sectional seroprevalence of 2.53%. Subgroup analysis identified differential seropositivity by job role, ranging from 8.03% among housekeepers, odds ratio 3.17 (95% CI 1.59-5.71), to 0.00% among anesthesiologists, odds ratio 0.00 (95% CI 0-0.26), both of which were significant. Over the course of the study, 17 seroconversions (0.25%) and 101 seroreversions (1.50%) were identified. Self-reported SARS-CoV-2 swab qPCR testing, when compared with subsequent serology on study, showed only modest agreement, {kappa} = 0.47 (95% CI 0.32-0.62). Overall, these findings demonstrate relatively low seroprevalence and very low seroconversion rates among HCW in Oregon, USA, over a period in which aggressive social distancing measures were in place. The high rate of seroreversion observed in this cohort, and the relatively high discordance between SARS-CoV-2 serology and swab qPCR, highlight limitations of current detection methods, and stress the need for development of novel assessment methodologies to more accurately identify exposure (and\/or immunity) to SARS-CoV-2 in this population.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rom Leidner","author_inst":"Earle A.

To this aim, it is necessary to establish reliable, fast and cheap tools to detect viral particles in biological material so to identify the people capable to spread the infection. We demonstrate that a colorimetric biosensor based on gold nanoparticle (AuNP) interaction induced by SARS-CoV-2 lends itself as an outstanding tool for detecting viral particles in nasal and throat swabs. The extinction spectrum of a colloidal solution of multiple viral-target gold nanoparticles - AuNPs functionalized with antibodies targeting three surface proteins of SARS-CoV-2 (spike, envelope and membrane) - is redshifted in few minutes when mixed to a solution containing the viral particle. The optical density of the mixed solution measured at 560 nm was compared to the threshold cycle (Ct) of a Real Time-PCR (gold standard for detecting the presence of viruses) finding that the colorimetric method is able to detect very low viral load with a detection limit approaching that of RT-PCR. Since the method is sensitive to the infecting viral particle rather than to its RNA, the achievements reported here open new perspective not only in the context of the current and possible future pandemics, but also in microbiology as the biosensor proves itself to be a powerful though simple tool for measuring the viral particle concentration.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bartolomeo Della Ventura","author_inst":"University of Naples \"Federico II\""},{"author_name":"Michele Cennamo","author_inst":"University of Naples \"Federico II\""},{"author_name":"Antonio Minopoli","author_inst":"University of Naples \"Federico II\""},{"author_name":"Raffaele Campanile","author_inst":"University of Naples \"Federico II\""},{"author_name":"Sergio Bolletti Censi","author_inst":"Cosvitec scarl"},{"author_name":"Daniela Terracciano","author_inst":"University of Naples \"Federico II\""},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Portella","author_inst":"University of Naples \"Federico II\""},{"author_name":"Raffaele Velotta","author_inst":"University of Naples \"Federico II\""},{"author_name":"Alec Saitman","author_inst":"Providence St. Joseph Health"},{"author_name":"Jeffrey A.

An abnormal LUS is associated with increased risk for ICU admission in COVID-19. Previously described LUS manifestations for COVID-19 include B-lines, consolidations, and pleural thickening. The interrater reliability (IRR) of these findings for COVID-19 is unknown. Research Question: What is the interrater reliability of lung ultrasound findings in patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19? Study Design and Methods: This study was conducted at conducted at two academic medical centers between 03\/2020-06\/2020. Nine physicians (hospitalists: n=4; emergency medicine: n=5) independently evaluated n=20 LUS scans (n=180 independent observations) collected from RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients. These studies were randomly selected from an image database consisting of COVID-19 patients evaluated in the emergency department with portable ultrasound devices. Physicians were blinded to any patient information or previous LUS interpretation. Kappa values were used to calculate IRR. Results: There was substantial IRR on the following items: normal LUS scan (K=0.79 [95% CI: 0.72-0.87]), presence of B-lines (K=0.79 [95% CI: 0.72-0.87]), >=3 B-lines observed (K=0.72 [95% CI: 0.64-0.79]). Moderate IRR was observed for the presence of any consolidation (K=0.57 [95% CI: 0.50-0.64]), subpleural consolidation (K=0.49 [95% CI: 0.42-0.56]), and presence of effusion (K=0.49 [95% CI: 0.41-0.56]). Fair IRR was observed for pleural thickening (K=0.23 [95% CI: 0.15-0.30]). Interpretation: Many LUS manifestations for COVID-19 appear to have moderate to substantial IRR across providers from multiple specialties utilizing differing portable devices. The most reliable LUS findings with COVID-19 may include the presence\/count of B-lines or determining if a scan is normal. Clinical protocols for LUS with COVID-19 may require additional observers for the confirmation of less reliable findings such as consolidations.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Andre Kumar","author_inst":"Stanford Unviersity"},{"author_name":"Yingjie Weng","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Sally Graglia","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Sukyung Chung","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Youyou Duanmu","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Farhan Lalani","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Kavita Gandhi","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"Viveta Lobo","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Trevor Jensen","author_inst":"University of California, San Francisco"},{"author_name":"John Kugler","author_inst":"Stanford University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David Leidner","author_inst":"Scientific Literacy Association"},{"author_name":"Kendall Sawa","author_inst":"Providence St. Joseph Health"},{"author_name":"Scott Marsal","author_inst":"Providence St. Joseph Health"},{"author_name":"Kevin Olson","author_inst":"Providence St. Joseph Health"},{"author_name":"Nancy Frisco","author_inst":"Providence St. Joseph Health"},{"author_name":"Amy Compton-Phillips","author_inst":"Providence St. Joseph Health"},{"author_name":"Walter Urba","author_inst":"Earle A.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) triggers distinct patterns of pneumonia progression with multiorgan disease, calling for cell- and\/or tissue-type specific host injury markers. METHODS. An integrated hypothesis-free single biomarker analysis framework was performed on nasal swabs (n=484) from patients with COVID-19 in GSE152075. The origin of candidate biomarker was assessed in single-cell RNA data (GSE145926). The candidate biomarker was validated in a cross-sectional cohort (n=564) at both nucletide and protein levels. RESULTS. Phospholipase A2 group VII (PLA2G7) was identified as a candidate biomarker in COVID-19. PLA2G7 was predominantly expressed by proinflammatory macrophages in lungs emerging with progression of COVID-19. In the validation stage, PLA2G7 was found in patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia, especially in severe pneumonia, rather than patients suffered mild H1N1 influenza infection. The positive rates of PLA2G7 ranging from 29.37% to 100.00% were positively correlated with not only viral loads in patients with COVID-19 but also severity of pneumonia in non COVID-19 patients. Although Ct values of PLA2G7 in severe pneumonia was siginificantly lower than that in moderate pneumonia (P=7.2e-11), no differences were observed in moderate pneumonia with COVID-19 between severe pneumonia without COVID-19 (P=0.81). Serum protein levels of PLA2G7, also known as lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2), were further found to be elevated and beyond the upper limit of normal in patients with COVID-19, especially among the re-positive patients. CONCLUSIONS. We firstly identified and validated PLA2G7, a biomarker for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), was abnormally enhanced in COVID-19 patients at both nucletide and protein aspects. These findings provided indications into the prevalence of cardiovascular involvements seen in COVID-19 patients. PLA2G7 could be a hallmark of COVID-19 for monitoring disease progress and therapeutic response.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yang LI","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Yongzhong JIANG","author_inst":"Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Wuhan 430065, China"},{"author_name":"Yi ZHANG","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Naizhe LI","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Qiangling YIN","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Linlin LIU","author_inst":"Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Wuhan 430065, China"},{"author_name":"Xin LV","author_inst":"Qilu Children's Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University & Jinan Children's Hospital, Jinan 250022, China"},{"author_name":"Yan LIU","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, School of Basic Medical Science, Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230032, China"},{"author_name":"Aqian LI","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Bin FANG","author_inst":"Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Wuhan 430065, China"},{"author_name":"Jiajia LI","author_inst":"The Center for Scientific Research of the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230022, China"},{"author_name":"Hengping YE","author_inst":"Xiantao Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Xiantao 433000, China"},{"author_name":"Gang YANG","author_inst":"Xiangyang Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Xiangyang 441000, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoxian CUI","author_inst":"Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shanghai 200336, China"},{"author_name":"Yang LIU","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Yuanyuan QU","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Chuan LI","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Jiandong LI","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Dexin LI","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Shiwen WANG","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Zhongtao GAI","author_inst":"Qilu Children's Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University & Jinan Children's Hospital, Jinan 250022, China"},{"author_name":"Faxian ZHAN","author_inst":"Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Wuhan 430065, China"},{"author_name":"Mifang LIANG","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Scott Hensley","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.16.20035691","rel_title":"COVID-19 ICU and mechanical ventilation patient characteristics and outcomes - A systematic review and meta-analysis","rel_date":"2020-08-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.16.20035691","rel_abs":"Background Insight into COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) patient characteristics, rates and risks of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and associated outcomes as well as any regional discrepancies is critical in this pandemic for individual case management and overall resource planning. Methods and Findings Electronic searches were performed for reports through May 1 2020 and reports on COVID-19 ICU admissions and outcomes were included using predefined search terms. Relevant data was subsequently extracted and pooled using fixed or random effects meta-analysis depending on heterogeneity. Study quality was assessed by the NIH tool and heterogeneity was assessed by I2 and Q tests. Baseline patient characteristics, ICU and IMV outcomes were pooled and meta-analyzed. Pooled odds ratios (pOR) were calculated for clinical features against ICU, IMV mortality. Subgroup analysis was carried out based on patient regions. A total of twenty-eight studies comprising 12,437 COVID-19 ICU admissions from seven countries were meta-analyzed. Pooled ICU admission rate was 21% [95% CI 0.12-0.34] and 69% of cases needed IMV [95% CI 0.61-0.75]. ICU and IMV mortality were 28.3% [95% CI 0.25-0.32], 43% [95% CI 0.29-0.58] and ICU, IMV duration was 7.78 [95% CI 6.99-8.63] and 10.12 [95% CI 7.08-13.16] days respectively. Besides confirming the significance of comorbidities and clinical findings of COVID-19 previously reported, we found the major correlates with ICU mortality were IMV [pOR 16.46, 95% CI 4.37-61.96], acute kidney injury (AKI) [pOR 12.47, 95% CI 1.52-102.7], and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [pOR 6.52, 95% CI 2.66-16.01]. Subgroup analyses confirm significant regional discrepancies in outcomes. Conclusions This is the most comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of COVID-19 ICU and IMV cases and associated outcomes to date and the only analysis to implicate IMV's associtaion with COVID-19 ICU mortality. The significant association of AKI, ARDS and IMV with mortality has implications for ICU resource planning for AKI and ARDS as well as research into optimal ventilation strategies for patients. Regional differences in outcome implies a need to develop region specific protocols for ventilatory support as well as overall treatment.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Raymond Chang","author_inst":"Institute of East West Medicine"},{"author_name":"Khaled Mossad Elhusseiny","author_inst":"Al-Azhar University"},{"author_name":"Yu-Chang Yeh","author_inst":"National Taiwan University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Wei-zen Sun","author_inst":"National Taiwan University Hospial"},{"author_name":"Qiangling YIN","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Linlin LIU","author_inst":"Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Wuhan 430065, China"},{"author_name":"Xin LV","author_inst":"Qilu Children's Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University & Jinan Children's Hospital, Jinan 250022, China"},{"author_name":"Yan LIU","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, School of Basic Medical Science, Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230032, China"},{"author_name":"Aqian LI","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Bin FANG","author_inst":"Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Wuhan 430065, China"},{"author_name":"Jiajia LI","author_inst":"The Center for Scientific Research of the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230022, China"},{"author_name":"Hengping YE","author_inst":"Xiantao Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Xiantao 433000, China"},{"author_name":"Gang YANG","author_inst":"Xiangyang Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Xiangyang 441000, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoxian CUI","author_inst":"Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shanghai 200336, China"},{"author_name":"Yang LIU","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Yuanyuan QU","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Chuan LI","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Jiandong LI","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Dexin LI","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Shiwen WANG","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Zhongtao GAI","author_inst":"Qilu Children's Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University & Jinan Children's Hospital, Jinan 250022, China"},{"author_name":"Faxian ZHAN","author_inst":"Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Wuhan 430065, China"},{"author_name":"Mifang LIANG","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Scott Hensley","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.16.20176073","rel_title":"Impacts on Surgery Resident Education at a first wave COVID-19 epicenter","rel_date":"2020-08-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.16.20176073","rel_abs":"Background: This study aims to identify the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on surgical resident training and education at Danbury Hospital. Methods: We conducted an observational study at a Western Connecticut hospital heavily affected by the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic to assess its effects on surgical residents, focusing on surgical education, clinical experience, and operative skills development. Objective data was available through recorded work hours, case logs, and formal didactics. In addition, we created an anonymous survey to assess resident perception of their residency experience during the pandemic. Results: There are 22 surgical residents at our institution; all were included in the study. Resident weekly duty hours decreased by 23.9 hours with the majority of clinical time redirected to caring for COVID-19 patients. Independent studying increased by 1.6 hours (26.2%) while weekly didactics decreased by 2.1 hours (35.6%). The operative volume per resident decreased by 65.7% from 35.0 to 12.0 cases for the period of interest, with a disproportionately high effect on junior residents, who experienced a 76.2% decrease. Unsurprisingly, 70% of residents reported a negative effect of the pandemic on their surgical skills. Conclusions: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, surgical residents' usual workflows changed dramatically, as much of their time was dedicated to the critical care of patients with COVID-19. However, the consequent opportunity cost was to surgery-specific training; there was a significant decrease in operative cases and time spent in surgical didactics, along with elevated concern about overall preparedness for their intended career.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexander Ostapenko","author_inst":"Danbury Hospital"},{"author_name":"Samantha McPeck","author_inst":"University of Connecticut"},{"author_name":"Shawn Liechty","author_inst":"Danbury Hospital"},{"author_name":"Daniel Kleiner","author_inst":"Danbury Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qiangling YIN","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Linlin LIU","author_inst":"Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Wuhan 430065, China"},{"author_name":"Xin LV","author_inst":"Qilu Children's Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University & Jinan Children's Hospital, Jinan 250022, China"},{"author_name":"Yan LIU","author_inst":"Department of Microbiology, School of Basic Medical Science, Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230032, China"},{"author_name":"Aqian LI","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Bin FANG","author_inst":"Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Wuhan 430065, China"},{"author_name":"Jiajia LI","author_inst":"The Center for Scientific Research of the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230022, China"},{"author_name":"Hengping YE","author_inst":"Xiantao Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Xiantao 433000, China"},{"author_name":"Gang YANG","author_inst":"Xiangyang Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Xiangyang 441000, China"},{"author_name":"Xiaoxian CUI","author_inst":"Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shanghai 200336, China"},{"author_name":"Yang LIU","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Yuanyuan QU","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Chuan LI","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Jiandong LI","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Dexin LI","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Shiwen WANG","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Zhongtao GAI","author_inst":"Qilu Children's Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University & Jinan Children's Hospital, Jinan 250022, China"},{"author_name":"Faxian ZHAN","author_inst":"Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Wuhan 430065, China"},{"author_name":"Mifang LIANG","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Scott Hensley","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"surgery"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.16.20176057","rel_title":"On the use of growth models for forecasting epidemic outbreaks with application to COVID-19 data","rel_date":"2020-08-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.16.20176057","rel_abs":"The initial phase dynamics of an epidemic without containment measures is commonly well modeled using exponential growth models.

Under the implementation of an isolation measure for detected infectives, we propose to model epidemic dynamics by fitting a flexible growth model curve to reported positive cases and to infer the overall epidemic dynamics by introducing information on the detection\/testing effort and recovery and death rates. The resulting modeling approach is close to the SIQR (Susceptible- Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered) model framework. We focused on predicting the peaks (time and size) in positive cases, actives cases and new infections. We applied the approach to data from the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. Fits on limited data before the observed peaks illustrate the ability of the flexible growth model to approach the estimates from the whole data.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chenangnon F.

Although practitioners focused on the pulmonary devastation, resources for the provision of dialysis proved to be more constrained. To deal with these shortfalls, NYC Health and Hospitals\/Bellevue, NYU Brooklyn, NYU Medical Center and the New York Harbor VA Healthcare System, put together a plan to offset the anticipated increased needs for kidney replacement therapy. Prior to the pandemic, peritoneal dialysis was not used for acute kidney injury at Bellevue Hospital. We were able to rapidly establish an acute peritoneal dialysis program at Bellevue Hospital for acute kidney injury patients in the intensive care unit. A dedicated surgery team was assembled to work with the nephrologists for bedside placement of the peritoneal dialysis catheters. A multi-disciplinary team was trained by the lead nephrologist to deliver peritoneal dialysis in the intensive care unit. Between April 8, 2020 and May 8, 2020, 39 peritoneal dialysis catheters were placed at Bellevue Hospital. 38 patients were successfully started on peritoneal dialysis. As of June 10, 2020, 16 patients recovered renal function. One end stage kidney disease patient was converted to peritoneal dialysis and was discharged. One catheter was poorly functioning, and the patient was changed to hemodialysis before recovering renal function. There were no episodes of peritonitis and nine incidents of minor leaking, which resolved. Some patients received successful peritoneal dialysis while being ventilated in the prone position. In summary, despite severe shortages of staff, supplies and dialysis machines during the COVID-19 pandemic, we were able to rapidly implement a de novo peritoneal dialysis program which enabled provision of adequate kidney replacement therapy to all admitted patients who needed it. Our experience is a model for the use of acute peritoneal dialysis in crisis situations.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nina J Caplin","author_inst":"NYU MedicalCenter and School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Olga Zhdanova","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Manish Tandon","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Nathan Thompson","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Dhwanil Patel","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Qandeel Somroo","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Fny Ranjeeta","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Leian Joseph","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Scherer","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shivam Joshi","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Betty Dyal","author_inst":"Lower Manhattan Dialysis Center, New York, NY 10016"},{"author_name":"Harminder Chawla","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Sita Lakshmi","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Doug Bails","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Judith Benstein","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David S Goldfarb","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Bruce Gelb","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Richard Amerling","author_inst":"St. George's University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David M Charytan","author_inst":"NYU School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shiwen WANG","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Zhongtao GAI","author_inst":"Qilu Children's Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University & Jinan Children's Hospital, Jinan 250022, China"},{"author_name":"Faxian ZHAN","author_inst":"Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Wuhan 430065, China"},{"author_name":"Mifang LIANG","author_inst":"NHC Key Laboratory of Medical Virology and Viral Diseases, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and P"},{"author_name":"Scott Hensley","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"nephrology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.17.254375","rel_title":"Equine hyperimmune globulin raised against the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein has extremely high neutralizing titers","rel_date":"2020-08-18","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.17.254375","rel_abs":"COVID-19 pandemic caused approximately 750,000 deaths and over 20 million confirmed cases of infection by SARS-CoV-2 within 8 months since the emergence of the virus. While there are no vaccines approved and considering the difficulty in meeting the large vaccination demand worldwide, the potential use of passive immunization should be considered based on existing successful therapies against many diseases. Here we demonstrate that hyperimmune globulin preparations raised in horses against the recombinant trimeric spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 in the prefusion conformation provide very high ELISA titers as well as highly potent neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2. Five horses were subcutaneously inoculated for 6 weeks with the recombinant S protein (ectodomain, residues 1-1208). Four out of the 5 horses presented a strong immune response. Considering the average of all 5 horses, ELISA titers above 1:1,000,000 and neutralizing titers (PRNT90) reaching 1:14,604 were observed. When compared with the plasma of three convalescent COVID-19 patients, sera of immunized horses displayed approximately 140-fold higher neutralizing titers measured as PRNT90. To prevent eventual side effects caused by horse antiserum, IgG was digested with pepsin and purified by fractional salt precipitation to eliminate Fc fragments, a process that is industrially used for the production of passive immunization F(ab)2 concentrates against rabies, tetanus and snake venoms. The high neutralizing titers against SARS-CoV-2 obtained for the unprocessed sera were confirmed for the F(ab)2 fragments and were 150-fold higher than the PRNT90 neutralizing titers of plasma of three COVID-19 convalescent patients. The great advantage of using the recombinant trimeric S glycoprotein is that it is safe and provides quick adaptive immunity in horses. Our data show the perspective of using hyperimmune anti-SARS-CoV-2 F(ab)2 preparations as a passive immunization therapy in humans, similar to therapies that have been safely used for decades against rabies, tetanus and snake venoms.","rel_num_authors":23,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luis Eduardo R.

These three compounds have not been previously reported to have anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities, although their antiviral activities against SARS-CoV and Ebola virus have been reported. These results demonstrate that this comprehensive data set of drug repurposing screen for SARS-CoV-2 is useful for drug repurposing efforts including design of new drug combinations for clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":19,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Catherine Z Chen","author_inst":"NCATS, NIH"},{"author_name":"Paul Shinn","author_inst":"NCATS, NIH"},{"author_name":"Zina Itkin","author_inst":"NCATS, NIH"},{"author_name":"Rich Eastman","author_inst":"National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NIH"},{"author_name":"Robert Bostwick","author_inst":"Southern Research"},{"author_name":"Lynn Rasmussen","author_inst":"Southern Research"},{"author_name":"Ruili Huang","author_inst":"NCATS, NIH"},{"author_name":"Min Shen","author_inst":"NIH"},{"author_name":"Xin Hu","author_inst":"NCATS, NIH"},{"author_name":"Kelli M Wilson","author_inst":"NCATS, NIH"},{"author_name":"Brianna Brooks","author_inst":"NCATS, NIH"},{"author_name":"Hui Guo","author_inst":"NCATS, NIH"},{"author_name":"Tongan Zhao","author_inst":"NCATS, NIH"},{"author_name":"Carleen Klumpp-Thomas","author_inst":"NCATS, NIH"},{"author_name":"Anton Simeonov","author_inst":"NCATS, NIH"},{"author_name":"Samuel G.
