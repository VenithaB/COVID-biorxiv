Resulting uncertainty is reflected in very different decisions on school closures and reopenings across countries. The aim of this longitudinal cohort study is to assess the extent and patterns of seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in school-attending children repeatedly. It will examine risk factors for infection, relationship between seropositivity and symptoms, and temporal persistence of antibodies. Additionally, it will include testing of school personnel and parents. Methods and analysis The study (Ciao Corona) will enroll a regionally representative, random sample of schools in the canton of Zurich, where 18% of the Swiss population live. Children aged 5 to 16 years, attending classes in primary and secondary schools are invited. Venous blood and saliva samples are collected for SARS-CoV-2 serological testing after the first wave of infections (June\/July 2020), in fall (October\/November 2020), and after winter (March\/April 2021). Venous blood is also collected for serological testing of parents and school personnel. Bi-monthly questionnaires to children, parents and school personnel cover SARS-CoV-2 symptoms and tests, health, preventive behavior, lifestyle and quality of life information. Total seroprevalence and cumulative incidence will be calculated. Hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression models will account for sensitivity and specificity of the serological test in the analyses and for the complex sampling structure, i.e., clustering within classes and schools. Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland (2020-01336). The results of this study will be published in peer-reviewed journals and will be made available to study participants and participating schools, the Federal Office of Public Health, and the Educational Department of the canton of Zurich.

We ask the following questions: (1) How many COVID-19 cases are expected to be detected by entry screening? (2) Will this initial bump in cases be containable using the mitigation steps being undertaken at UIUC? Our answers are: (1) Assuming that there are approximately 45,000 students returning to campus in the week beginning August 15, 2020, our most conservative estimate predicts that a median of 270 {+\/-} 90 (minimum-maximum range) COVID-19 positive cases will be detected by entry screening. The earliest estimate for entry screening that we report was made on July 24th and predicted 198 {+\/-} 90 (68% CI) positive cases. (2) If the number of returning students is less, then our estimate just needs to be scaled proportionately. (3) This initial bump will be contained by entry screening initiated isolation and contact tracing, and once the semester is underway, by universal masking, a hybrid teaching model, twice-weekly testing, isolation, contact tracing, quarantining and the use of the Safer Illinois exposure notification app.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ahmed Elbanna","author_inst":"University of Illinois Urbana Champaign"},{"author_name":"George N.

For statistical analysis, we have considered the total number of cases for 60 consecutive days, from June 23 to August 21. We have seen that instead of taking data of all 60 days together, a better picture of uncertainty can be observed if we consider the data separately in three equal parts from June 23 to July 12, from July 13 to August 1, and from August 2 to August 21. For that we would first need to ascertain that the current spread pattern in India is almost exponential. Thereafter we shall show that the data regarding the total number of cases in India are not really behaving in an expected way, making forecasting the time to peak very difficult. We have found that the pandemic would perhaps change its pattern of growth from nearly exponential to nearly logarithmic, which we have earlier observed in the case of Italy, in less than 78 days starting from August 2.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hemanta Kumar Baruah","author_inst":"The Assam Royal Global University, Guwahati, Assam, India"},{"author_name":"George N.

The aim of this study was to formalize indicators for measuring the fulfillment of assumptions for appropriate proximity tracing app functioning. Six indicators were developed to monitor the SwissCovid app functioning and effectiveness in the Swiss population. Using official statistics and survey data, we calculated indicator values and examined socio-demographic factors associated with the SwissCovid app utilization. Indicators show that 1 in 3 adults in Switzerland have downloaded the app. However, only 15% of new cases also triggered DPT-app notifications, and indicators also reveal ignored app notifications. In the full survey sample (n=2098), higher monthly household income or being a non-smoker were associated with higher SwissCovid app uptake; older age or having a non-Swiss nationality with a lower uptake. In a subsample including more detailed information (n=701), high trust in health authorities was associated with higher SwissCovid app uptake. The indicators help to monitor key drivers of DPT-apps effectiveness and hint to non-compliance issues. Streamlining procedures, removing technical hurdles, and communicating the usefulness of DPT-apps are crucial to promote uptake, compliance, and ultimately effectiveness of DPT-apps for pandemic mitigation.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Viktor von Wyl","author_inst":"University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Marc Hoeglinger","author_inst":"Zurich University of Applied Sciences"},{"author_name":"Chloe Sieber","author_inst":"University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Marco Kaufmann","author_inst":"University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Andre Moser","author_inst":"University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Miquel Serra-Burriel","author_inst":"University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Tala Ballouz","author_inst":"University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Dominik Menges","author_inst":"University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Anja Frei","author_inst":"University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Milo Puhan","author_inst":"University of Zurich"},{"author_name":"Susi Kriemler","author_inst":"University of Zurich"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.29.20184283","rel_title":"Relation of Doubling Time and Reproduction Number with Testing Rate for Corona Infections in India","rel_date":"2020-09-02","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.29.20184283","rel_abs":"There is a general feeling that increased testing has a salutary effect on the course of the current coronavirus epidemic.

This study aims to assess COVID-19 and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS C) in Latin American children, in order to appropriately plan and allocate resources to face the pandemic on a local and International lever Methods Ambispective multicentre cohort study from five Latin American countries. Children aged 18 years or younger with microbiologically confirmed SARS CoV 2 infection were included. Findings 409 children were included, with a median age of 53.0 years (IQR 0.6 9.0). Of these, 95 191 (23.2%) were diagnosed with MIS C. 191 (46.7%) children were admitted to hospital and 52 (12.7%) required admission to a Pediatric Intensive Care Unite (PICU). 92 (22.5%) patients required oxygen support: 8 (2%) were started on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and 29 (7%) on mechanical ventilation. 35 (8.5%) patients required inotropic support. The following factors were associated with PICU admission: pre-existing medical condition (P < 0.0001), immunodeficiency (P = 0.01), lower respiratory tract infection (P< 0.0001), gastrointestinal symptoms (P = 0.006), radiological changes suggestive of pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (P< 0.0001), low socioeconomic conditions (P 0.009). Conclusions This study shows a generally more severe form of COVID 19 and a high number of MIS C in Latin American children, compared with studies from China, Europe and North America, and support current evidence of a more severe disease in Latin\/Hyspanic children or in people of lower socioeconomic level. The findings highlight an urgent need of more data of COVID 19 in South America.","rel_num_authors":26,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Omar Yassef Antunez-Montes","author_inst":"Instituto Latinoamericano de Ecografia en Medicina, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico."},{"author_name":"Maria Isabel Escamilla","author_inst":"Fundacion Neumologica Colombiana, Bogota, Colombia."},{"author_name":"Augusto Flavio Figueroa-Uribe","author_inst":"Hospital Pediatrico Peralvillo.

It is unknown whether these measures are associated with depression and anxiety. Objectives: To investigate meta-analytic global levels of depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic and how implementation of mitigation strategies (i.e. public transportation closures, stay-at-home orders, etc.) impacted such disorders. Data sources: Pubmed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, BIOSIS Citation Index, Current Content Connect, PsycINFO, CINAHL, medRxiv, and PsyArXiv databases for depression and anxiety prevalences; Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker for the containment and closure policies indexes; Global Burden of Disease Study for previous levels of depression and anxiety. Study eligibility criteria: Original studies conducted during COVID-19 pandemic, which assessed categorical depression and anxiety, using PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scales (cutoff [&ge;] 10). Participants and interventions: General population, healthcare providers, students, and patients. National physical distancing measures. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Meta-analysis and meta-regresssion. Results: In total, 226,638 individuals were assessed within the 60 included studies. Global prevalence of both depression and anxiety during COVID-19 pandemic were 24.0% and 21.3%, respectively. There was a wide variance in the prevalence of both anxiety and depression reported in different regions of the world and countries. Asia, and China particularly, had the lowest prevalence of both disorders. Regarding the impact of mitigation strategies on mental health, only public transportation closures increased anxiety prevalence. Limitations: Country-level data on physical distancing measures and previous anxiety\/depression may not necessarily reflect local (i.e., city-specific) contexts. Conclusions and implications of key findings: Mental health concerns should not be viewed only as a delayed consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, but also as a concurrent epidemic. Our data provides support for policy-makers to consider real-time enhanced mental health services, and increase initiatives to foster positive mental health outcomes.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joao M.

Little also is known about the effects on-campus students may have on local higher-risk communities. We aimed to estimate potential community and campus Covid-19 exposures, infections, and mortality due to various university reopening and precaution plans under current ranges of assumptions and uncertainties. Methods: We developed and calibrated campus-only, community-only, and campus-x-community epidemic differential equation and agent-based models. Input parameters for campus and surrounding communities were estimated via published and grey literature, scenario development, expert opinion, accuracy optimization algorithms, and Monte Carlo simulation; models were cross-validated against each other using February-June 2020 data from heterogeneous U.S. counties and states. Campus opening plans (spanning various fully open, hybrid, and fully virtual approaches) were identified from websites and publications. All scenarios were simulated assuming 16-week semesters and estimated ranges for Covid-19 prevalence among community residents and arriving students, precaution compliance, contact frequency, virus attack rates, and tracing and isolation effectiveness. Additional student and community exposures, infections, and mortality were estimated under each scenario, with 10% trimmed medians, standard deviations, and probability intervals computed to omit extreme outlier scenarios. Factorial analyses were conducted to identify intervention inputs with largest and smallest effects. Results: As a base case with no precautions (or no compliance), predicted 16-week student infections and mortality under normal operations ranged significantly from 471 to 9,495 (median: 2,286, SD: 2,627) and 0 to 123 (median: 9, SD: 14) per 10,000 students, respectively. The maximum active exposures across a semester was 15.76% of all students warranting tracing. Total additional community exposures, infections, and mortality ranged from 1 to 187, 13 to 820, and 1 to 21 per 10,000 residents, respectively. 1% and 5% of on-campus students were infected after a mean (SD) of 11 (3) and 76 (17) days, respectively; >10% students infected by the end of a semester in 34.8% of scenarios, with the greatest increase (first inflection point) occurring on aver-age on day 84 (SD: 10.2 days). Common reopening precautions reduced infections by 24% to 26% and mortality by 36% to 50% in both populations. Uncertainties in many factors, however, produced tremendous variability in all results, ranging from medians by -67% to +342%. Conclusions: Consequences on community and student Covid-19 exposures, infections, and mortality of reopening physical campuses are very highly unpredictable, depending on a combination of random chance, controllable (e.g. physical layouts), and uncontrollable (e.g. human behavior) factors. Implications include needs for criteria to adapt campus operations mid-semester, methods to detect when necessary, and contingency plans for doing so.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"James C Benneyan","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Christopher Gehrke","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Iulian Ilies","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Nicole Nehls","author_inst":"Northeastern University"},{"author_name":"Gro Jamtvedt","author_inst":"Oslo Metropolitan University"},{"author_name":"Borghild Loyland","author_inst":"Oslo Metropolitan University"},{"author_name":"Ida Hellum Sandbekken","author_inst":"Oslo Metropolitan University"},{"author_name":"Alexander Schjoll","author_inst":"Oslo Metropolitan University"},{"author_name":"Kjetil Telle","author_inst":"Norwegian Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Sara Sofie Viksmoen Watle","author_inst":"Norwegian Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Laura Vanessa Montes Fontalvo","author_inst":"Hospital Infantil Napoleon Franco Pareja, Botota, Colombia"},{"author_name":"Roger Hernandez","author_inst":"Peruvian University Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Peru"},{"author_name":"Carolin Chavez","author_inst":"Unidad de Investigacion de Pediatria, Hospital Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Peru"},{"author_name":"Francisco Eduardo Campos","author_inst":"Unidad de Infectologia Pediatric; Hospital San Bartolome"},{"author_name":"Fadia Uribe","author_inst":"Hospital San Bartolome, Lima.

The isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from patients feces on human cell line raised concerns of possible transmission through human feces including exposure to aerosols generated by toilet flushing and through the indoor drainage system. Currently, routes of transmission, other than the close contact droplet transmission, are still not well understood. A quantitative microbial risk assessment was conducted to estimate the health risks associated with two aerosol exposure scenarios: 1) toilet flushing, and 2) faulty connection of a floor drain with the building main sewer pipe. SARS-CoV-2 data were collected from the emerging literature. The infectivity of the virus in feces was estimated based on a range of assumption between viral genome equivalence and infectious unit. The human exposure dose was calculated using Monte Carlo simulation of viral concentrations in aerosols under each scenario and human breathing rates. The probability of COVID-19 illness was generated using the dose-response model for SARS-CoV-1, a close relative of SARS-CoV-2, that was responsible for the SARS outbreak in 2003. The results indicate the median risks of developing COVID-19 for a single day exposure is 1.11 x 10-10 and 3.52 x 10-11 for toilet flushing and faulty drain scenario, respectively. The worst case scenario predicted the high end of COVID-19 risk for the toilet flushing scenario was 5.78 x 10-4 (at 95th percentile). The infectious viral loads in human feces are the most sensitive input parameter and contribute significantly to model uncertainty.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kuang-wei Shi","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Yen-Hsiang Huang","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Hunter Quon","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Zi-Lu Ou-Yang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Chengwen Wang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Sunny Jiang","author_inst":"University of California, Irvine"},{"author_name":"Ida Hellum Sandbekken","author_inst":"Oslo Metropolitan University"},{"author_name":"Alexander Schjoll","author_inst":"Oslo Metropolitan University"},{"author_name":"Kjetil Telle","author_inst":"Norwegian Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Sara Sofie Viksmoen Watle","author_inst":"Norwegian Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Laura Vanessa Montes Fontalvo","author_inst":"Hospital Infantil Napoleon Franco Pareja, Botota, Colombia"},{"author_name":"Roger Hernandez","author_inst":"Peruvian University Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Peru"},{"author_name":"Carolin Chavez","author_inst":"Unidad de Investigacion de Pediatria, Hospital Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Peru"},{"author_name":"Francisco Eduardo Campos","author_inst":"Unidad de Infectologia Pediatric; Hospital San Bartolome"},{"author_name":"Fadia Uribe","author_inst":"Hospital San Bartolome, Lima.

At the same time, bleeding complications have been observed in some patients. Better understanding the balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis will help inform optimal approaches to thrombosis prophylaxis and potential utility of fibrinolytic-targeted therapies. Methods: 118 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 30 healthy controls were included in the study. We measured plasma antigen levels of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and performed spontaneous clot lysis assays. Findings: We found markedly elevated levels of tPA and PAI-1 among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Both factors demonstrated a strong correlation with neutrophil counts and markers of neutrophil activation. High levels of tPA and PAI-1 were associated with worse respiratory status. High levels of tPA, in particular, were also strongly correlated with mortality and with a significant enhancement in spontaneous ex vivo clot lysis. Interpretation: While both tPA and PAI-1 are elevated among COVID-19 patients, extremely high levels of tPA enhance spontaneous fibrinolysis and are significantly associated with mortality in some patients. These data indicate that fibrinolytic homeostasis in COVID-19 is complex with a subset of patients expressing a balance of factors that may favor fibrinolysis, and suggest that further study of tPA as a potential biomarker is warranted.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yu Zuo","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Mark Warnock","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Alyssa Harbaugh","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Srilakshmi Yalavarthi","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Kelsey Gockman","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Melanie Zuo","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline A.

Reagent shortages may limit the expansion of testing required to scale back isolation measures. AIM To investigate the viability of sample pooling as a strategy for increasing test throughput and conserving PCR reagents; to report our early experience with pooling of clinical samples. METHODS A pre-implementation study was performed to assess the sensitivity and theoretical efficiency of two, four, and eight-sample pools in a real-time reverse transcription PCR-based workflow. A standard operating procedure was developed and implemented in two laboratories during periods of peak demand, inclusive of over 29,000 clinical samples processed in our laboratory. RESULTS Sensitivity decreased (mean absolute increase in cycle threshold value of 0.6, 2.3, and 3.0 for pools of two, four, and eight samples respectively) and efficiency increased as pool size increased. Gains from pooling diminished at high disease prevalence. Our standard operating procedure was successfully implemented across two laboratories. Increased workflow complexity imparts a higher risk of errors, and requires risk mitigation strategies. Turnaround time for individual samples increased, hence urgent samples should not be pooled. CONCLUSIONS Pooling is a viable strategy for high-throughput testing of SARS-CoV-2 in low-prevalence settings.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brian SW Chong","author_inst":"Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Thomas Tran","author_inst":"Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Julian Druce","author_inst":"Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Susan A Ballard","author_inst":"The University of Melbourne at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity"},{"author_name":"Julie A Simpson","author_inst":"Centre for Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Mike Catton","author_inst":"Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline A.

Objective To assess the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on CVD-related hospitalizations and mortality. Design Community-based prospective cohort study. Setting the UK Biobank population. Participants 421,717 UK Biobank participants who were registered in England and alive on December 1st 2019. Main outcomes and measures The primary outcome of interest was CVD death, as deaths with CVD as a cause of death according to the death registers. We retrieved information on hospitalizations with CVD as the primary diagnosis based on the UK Biobank hospital inpatient data. The study period was between December 1st 2019 and May 30th 2020, and we used the same calendar period of the three preceding years as the reference period. Standardized mortality\/incidence ratios (SMRs\/SIRs) with 95% confidence intervals were used to estimate the relative risk of CVD outcomes during the study period, compared with the reference period, to control for seasonal variations and aging of the study population. Results We observed a distinct increase in CVD-related deaths in March and April 2020 as compared to the corresponding months of the three preceding years. The observed number of CVD death (n=217) was almost doubled in April, compared with the expected number (n=120), corresponding to an SMR of 1.81 (95% CI 1.58-2.06). We observed a sharp decline of CVD hospitalization in March (n=841) and April (n=454), compared with the expected number (n=1208 for March and 1026 for April), leading to an SIR of 0.70 (95% CI 0.65-0.74) for March and 0.44 (95% CI 0.40-0.48) for April. There was also a clear increase of death, but a clear decrease of hospitalization, in March and April for all the five major subtypes of CVD. Conclusions We observed a distinct excess in CVD deaths in the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in the UK Biobank population. In addition to CVD complications of SARS-CoV-2 infections, the reduced hospital capacity might have contributed to the observed excess CVD deaths.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Junren Wang","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Jianwei Zhu","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Huazhen Yang","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yao Hu","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yajing Sun","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Zhiye Ying","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Yuanyuan Qu","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Unnur A Valdimarsdottir","author_inst":"University of Iceland"},{"author_name":"Fang Fang","author_inst":"Karolinska Institutet"},{"author_name":"Huan Song","author_inst":"Sichuan University"},{"author_name":"Laura Vanessa Montes Fontalvo","author_inst":"Hospital Infantil Napoleon Franco Pareja, Botota, Colombia"},{"author_name":"Roger Hernandez","author_inst":"Peruvian University Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Peru"},{"author_name":"Carolin Chavez","author_inst":"Unidad de Investigacion de Pediatria, Hospital Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Peru"},{"author_name":"Francisco Eduardo Campos","author_inst":"Unidad de Infectologia Pediatric; Hospital San Bartolome"},{"author_name":"Fadia Uribe","author_inst":"Hospital San Bartolome, Lima.

We define a MIS-C transcriptional signature partially shared with the transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and with the signature of Kawasaki disease, a clinically similar condition. By projecting the MIS-C signature onto a co-expression network, we identified disease gene modules and found genes downregulated in MIS-C clustered in a module enriched for the transcriptional signatures of exhausted CD8+ T-cells and CD56dimCD57+ NK cells. Bayesian network analyses revealed nine key regulators of this module, including TBX21, a central coordinator of exhausted CD8+ T-cell differentiation.

Although the viral infection originates in the respiratory system, it is unclear how the virus can overcome the alveolar barrier, which is observed in severe COVID-19 disease courses.\n\nTo elucidate the viral effects on the barrier integrity and immune reactions, we used mono-cell culture systems and a complex human alveolus-on-a-chip model composed of epithelial, endothelial, and mononuclear cells.\n\nOur data show that SARS-CoV-2 efficiently infected epithelial cells with high viral loads and inflammatory response, including the interferon expression. By contrast, the adjacent endothelial layer was no infected and did neither show productive virus replication or interferon release. With prolonged infection, both cell types are damaged, and the barrier function is deteriorated, allowing the viral particles to overbear.\n\nIn our study, we demonstrate that although SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on the epithelium for efficient replication, the neighboring endothelial cells are affected, e.g., by the epithelial cytokine release, which results in the damage of the alveolar barrier function and viral dissemination.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stefanie Deinhardt-Emmer","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sarah B\u00f6ttcher","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Clio H\u00e4ring","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Liane Giebeler","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Andreas Henke","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Roland Zell","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital, Friedrich Schiller University"},{"author_name":"Franziska Hornung","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Christian Brandt","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mike Marquet","author_inst":"Jena University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alexander S.

To understand the continuing spread of the virus, to detect those who are and were infected, and to follow the immune response longitudinally, reliable and robust assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection and immunological monitoring are needed and have been setup around the world. We quantified immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgG and IgA antibodies recognizing the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) or the Spike (S) protein over a period of five months following COVID-19 disease onset or in previously SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive volunteers. We report the detailed setup to monitor the humoral immune response from over 300 COVID-19 hospital patients and healthcare workers, 2500 University staff and 187 post-COVID19 volunteers, and assessing titres for IgM, IgG and IgA. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses followed a classic pattern with a rapid increase within the first three weeks after symptoms. Although titres reduce from approximately four weeks, the ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies remained robust for five months in a large proportion of previously virus-positive screened subjects. Our work provides detailed information for the assays used, facilitating further and longitudinal analysis of protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, it highlights a continued level of circulating neutralising antibodies in most people with confirmed SARS-CoV-2, at least up to five months after infection.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patricia Figueiredo-Campos","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Birte Blankenhaus","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Catarina Mota","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa; Centro Hospitalar Universitario Lisboa Norte EPE"},{"author_name":"Andreia Gomes","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Marta Serrano","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Silvia Ariotti","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Catarina Costa","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Helena Nunes-Cabaco","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Antonio M Mendes","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Pedro Gaspar","author_inst":"Centro Hospitalar Universitario Lisboa Norte EPE"},{"author_name":"Conceicao M Pereira-Santos","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Fabiana Rodrigues","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Jorge Condeco","author_inst":"Instituto Portugues do Sangue e Transplantacao"},{"author_name":"Antonia M Escoval","author_inst":"Instituto Portugues do Sangue e Transplantacao"},{"author_name":"Matilde Santos","author_inst":"Instituto Portugues do Sangue e Transplantacao"},{"author_name":"Mario Ramirez","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Jose Melo-Cristino","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Pedro J Simas","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto de Ciencias de Saude, Universidade Catolica Port"},{"author_name":"Eugenia Vasconcelos","author_inst":"Instituto Portugues do Sangue e Transplantacao"},{"author_name":"Angela Afonso","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Marc Veldhoen","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Matthew Harnett","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Melody Eaton","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sandra Hatem","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Hajra Jamal","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alara Akyatan","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Tabachnikova","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Lora E.

The reproduction number R of the virus could be counted directly, and was roughly, but not precisely, exponentially distributed. The number of secondary infections was greater for an infection which was itself one of many secondary infections because of environmental heterogeneity, which created variance of R among sites and could drive the spread of infection, even when global R < 1. Different kinds of intervention were deployed to curtail the spread of infection. Measures applied to the general population, such as closing down sites and services or regulating individual behaviour, did not reduce the total number of individuals infected during the epidemic unless they were maintained until the virus became extinct. This was primarily because measures taken to reduce indirect transmission tended to increase direct transmission, and vice versa. Consequently, the overall effect of any combination of interventions was much less than the sum of their separate effects.

The most convenient explanation is that some, external factor changed the value of the basic reproduction number, r0; and there certainly are arguments for this. Other factors could, nonetheless, have played a role. This research attempts to reconcile the observed peak with the thresholds predicted by lockdown regimes similar to the one in force at the time. It contemplates the effect of two, different, hypothetical errors in the data: The first is that the true level of infection has been underestimated by a multiplicative factor, while the second is that of an imperceptible, pre-existing, immune fraction of the population. While it is shown that it certainly is possible to manufacture the perception of an early peak as extreme as the one observed, solely by way of these two phenomena, the values need to be fairly high. The phenomena would not, by any measure, be insignificant. It also remains an inescapable fact that the early peak in infections coincided with a fairly profound change in r0; in all the contemplated scenarios of data-deficiency.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Simon John Childs","author_inst":"University of Fort Hare"},{"author_name":"Birte Blankenhaus","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Catarina Mota","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa; Centro Hospitalar Universitario Lisboa Norte EPE"},{"author_name":"Andreia Gomes","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Marta Serrano","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Silvia Ariotti","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Catarina Costa","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Helena Nunes-Cabaco","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Antonio M Mendes","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Pedro Gaspar","author_inst":"Centro Hospitalar Universitario Lisboa Norte EPE"},{"author_name":"Conceicao M Pereira-Santos","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Fabiana Rodrigues","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Jorge Condeco","author_inst":"Instituto Portugues do Sangue e Transplantacao"},{"author_name":"Antonia M Escoval","author_inst":"Instituto Portugues do Sangue e Transplantacao"},{"author_name":"Matilde Santos","author_inst":"Instituto Portugues do Sangue e Transplantacao"},{"author_name":"Mario Ramirez","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Jose Melo-Cristino","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Pedro J Simas","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto de Ciencias de Saude, Universidade Catolica Port"},{"author_name":"Eugenia Vasconcelos","author_inst":"Instituto Portugues do Sangue e Transplantacao"},{"author_name":"Angela Afonso","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Marc Veldhoen","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Matthew Harnett","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Melody Eaton","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sandra Hatem","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Hajra Jamal","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alara Akyatan","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Tabachnikova","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Lora E.

The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) releases weekly numbers of deaths attributed to a set of 'select causes', including deaths from COVID-19 in the entire United States (US), by state, and cumulatively for individual counties. Comparing US and state level deaths from select causes recorded in 2020 with values from 2014-2019 identifies a number of differences that exceeded 95% confidence limits on historical mean values, including three states with deaths possibly from COVID-19 in December 2019. Comparing county-level NCHS datasets with county-level data on deaths from COVID-19 compiled by four public pandemic tracking sites suggests that a large number of COVID-19 deaths have not yet been reported to the NCHS. Dividing the numbers of COVID-19 deaths counted by the public tracking sites by the percentage of COVID-19 deaths reported to the NCHS suggests that approximately 20% of all US deaths from Natural Causes, as many as 200,000, may not yet have been reported to the NCHS. Evaluating changes in the fractions of deaths attributed to COVID-19 and other specific causes or nonspecific outcomes during the epidemic, relative to 2020 totals or historical mean values, can provide a valuable perspective on the public health consequences of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Benjamin Stear","author_inst":"The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"},{"author_name":"Kyle Hernandez","author_inst":"University of Chicago,"},{"author_name":"Vidya Manian","author_inst":"University of Puerto Rico"},{"author_name":"Deanne Taylor","author_inst":"University of Pennsylvania Perelman Medical School"},{"author_name":"Catharine Conley","author_inst":"NASA Ames Research Center"},{"author_name":"Silvia Ariotti","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Catarina Costa","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Helena Nunes-Cabaco","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Antonio M Mendes","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Pedro Gaspar","author_inst":"Centro Hospitalar Universitario Lisboa Norte EPE"},{"author_name":"Conceicao M Pereira-Santos","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Fabiana Rodrigues","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Jorge Condeco","author_inst":"Instituto Portugues do Sangue e Transplantacao"},{"author_name":"Antonia M Escoval","author_inst":"Instituto Portugues do Sangue e Transplantacao"},{"author_name":"Matilde Santos","author_inst":"Instituto Portugues do Sangue e Transplantacao"},{"author_name":"Mario Ramirez","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Jose Melo-Cristino","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Pedro J Simas","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto de Ciencias de Saude, Universidade Catolica Port"},{"author_name":"Eugenia Vasconcelos","author_inst":"Instituto Portugues do Sangue e Transplantacao"},{"author_name":"Angela Afonso","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Marc Veldhoen","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Matthew Harnett","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Melody Eaton","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sandra Hatem","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Hajra Jamal","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alara Akyatan","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Tabachnikova","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Lora E.

Neither vaccines nor therapeutic drugs are currently available for this novel coronavirus. All measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 are thus based on reducing contact between infected and susceptible individuals. Most of these measures such as quarantine and self-isolation require voluntary compliance by the population. However, humans may act in their (perceived) self-interest only. We construct a mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission with quarantine and hospitalization coupled with a dynamic game model of adaptive human behavior. Susceptible and infected individuals adopt various behavioral strategies based on perceived prevalence and burden of the disease and sensitivity to isolation measures, and they evolve their strategies using a social learning algorithm (imitation dynamics). This results in complex interplay between the epidemiological model, which affects success of different strategies, and the game-theoretic behavioral model, which in turn affects the spread of the disease. We found that the second wave of the pandemic, which has been observed in the US, can be attributed to rational behavior of susceptible individuals, and that multiple waves of the pandemic are possible if the rate of social learning of infected individuals is sufficiently high. To reduce the burden of the disease on the society, it is necessary to incentivize such altruistic behavior by infected individuals as voluntary self-isolation.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Folashade B.

The objective of this study was to report the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, consistent with previous infection, and to report the symptomatology of infection in children. Design This multicentre observational cohort study, conducted between 16th April - 3rd July 2020 at 5 UK sites, aimed to recruit 900 children aged 2 to 15 years of age. Participants provided blood samples for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing and data were gathered regarding unwell contacts and symptoms. Results 1007 participants were enrolled, and 992 were included in the final analysis. The median age of participants was 10.1 years. There were 68 (6.9%) participants with positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests indicative of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of these, 34\/68 (50%) reported no symptoms. The presence of antibodies and the mean antibody titre was not influenced by age. Following multivariate analysis 4 independent variables were identified as significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. These were: known infected household contact; fatigue; gastrointestinal symptoms; and changes in sense of smell or taste. Discussion In this study children demonstrated similar antibody titres in response to SARS-CoV-2 irrespective of age. The symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children were subtle but of those reported, fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms and changes in sense of smell or taste were most strongly associated with antibody positivity.

We, the people, have already started to live in a new-normal way, such as wearing masks, keeping a safe distance from others and maintaining higher level of health & hygiene standards. However, because of this pandemic, the global economy has taken a major blow. Many people have lost their livelihood, and now facing challenges in getting better healthcare facilities and food for survival. Given the serious challenges to the problem, this paper analyzes demographic data to predict vulnerable areas in Kolkata metropolitan city that houses nearly one-third of its population in slums and one-fifth below poverty level, under compromised living conditions. The analysis revealed that the highest risk areas are located in the east and west of the city, the area to a great extent overlapped with wards containing larger share of population below poverty level and are also living in slums. The analysis of publicly accessible Covid-19 case records and containment zones data indicate the hardest hit areas lies in the central Kolkata and several wards along the eastern and northeastern border of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation. The data further revealed that the virus infections have extended to the south Kolkata with increasing number of broad-based containment zones with heightened cases. The analysis of demographic characteristics of the hardest hit wards revealed that not a single variables are directly associated with the increase in the number of containment for a particular ward. The ranking of wards based on four intervention criterion have suggested that the lack of social awareness along with lack of social distancing have dominantly contributed to the increasing number of containment of Covid-19 cases in Kolkata. Determination of optimized ranking and Spearmans rank correlation coefficient of the wards based on four intervention criterion provided a basis for the policy makers to assess ward-based interventions criterion to control further spread of the disease and\/or prevent second wave of infections. Given that the effective antiviral drugs is far away from common publics reach, the application of our study approach would benefit saving lives of many vulnerable populations.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bibhash Nath","author_inst":"Hunter College of the City University of New York"},{"author_name":"Santanu Majumder","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Mahmudur Rahman","author_inst":"The University of Newcastle"},{"author_name":"Jayanta Sen","author_inst":"West Bengal State University"},{"author_name":"Claire Tonry","author_inst":"Queen's University Belfast"},{"author_name":"Alison P Watt","author_inst":"Belfast Health and Social Care Trust"},{"author_name":"Claire McGinn","author_inst":"Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children"},{"author_name":"Steven Foster","author_inst":"Royal Hospital for Children Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Evans","author_inst":"Cardiff and Vale University Health Board"},{"author_name":"Mark D Lyttle","author_inst":"University of the West of England"},{"author_name":"Shazaad Ahmad","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Shamez Ladhani","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Michael Corr","author_inst":"Belfast Health and Social Care Trust"},{"author_name":"Lisa McFetridge","author_inst":"Queen's University Belfast"},{"author_name":"Hannah Mitchell","author_inst":"Queen's University Belfast"},{"author_name":"Kevin Brown","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Gayatric Amirthalingam","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Julie-Ann Maney","author_inst":"Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children"},{"author_name":"Sharon Christie","author_inst":"Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children"},{"author_name":"Angela Afonso","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Marc Veldhoen","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Matthew Harnett","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Melody Eaton","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sandra Hatem","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Hajra Jamal","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alara Akyatan","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Tabachnikova","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Lora E.

Utilizing month-level suicide records covering the entire Japanese population (126 million) in 1,861 administrative units, we assessed if suicide mortality changed during the pandemic. We employed difference-in-difference estimation and found that overall suicide rate declined by 14.8% (95% CI: -18.9% to -10.8%) after the outbreak and the subsequent measures (school closure and the state of emergency). The decline is larger among males than females and among adults than children and older adults. The government's generous subsidies, reduced working hours, and fewer school sessions potentially account for its sizable decline.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Takanao Tanaka","author_inst":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Shohei Okamoto","author_inst":"Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology"},{"author_name":"Mohammad Mahmudur Rahman","author_inst":"The University of Newcastle"},{"author_name":"Jayanta Sen","author_inst":"West Bengal State University"},{"author_name":"Claire Tonry","author_inst":"Queen's University Belfast"},{"author_name":"Alison P Watt","author_inst":"Belfast Health and Social Care Trust"},{"author_name":"Claire McGinn","author_inst":"Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children"},{"author_name":"Steven Foster","author_inst":"Royal Hospital for Children Glasgow"},{"author_name":"Jennifer Evans","author_inst":"Cardiff and Vale University Health Board"},{"author_name":"Mark D Lyttle","author_inst":"University of the West of England"},{"author_name":"Shazaad Ahmad","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Shamez Ladhani","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Michael Corr","author_inst":"Belfast Health and Social Care Trust"},{"author_name":"Lisa McFetridge","author_inst":"Queen's University Belfast"},{"author_name":"Hannah Mitchell","author_inst":"Queen's University Belfast"},{"author_name":"Kevin Brown","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Gayatric Amirthalingam","author_inst":"Public Health England"},{"author_name":"Julie-Ann Maney","author_inst":"Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children"},{"author_name":"Sharon Christie","author_inst":"Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children"},{"author_name":"Angela Afonso","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Marc Veldhoen","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular | Joao Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa"},{"author_name":"Matthew Harnett","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Melody Eaton","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Sandra Hatem","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Hajra Jamal","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alara Akyatan","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Alexandra Tabachnikova","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Lora E.

These symptoms have been considered the best predictor of coronavirus infection, for this reason, it was decided to evaluate the predictive value of the smell and taste test and its association with the results of SARS-CoV-2 PCR-RT and rapid diagnostic tests. in the diagnosis of pathology. Methodology: 248 patients divided into 3 groups: asymptomatic, symptomatic without chemosensory disorders, and chemosensory disorders alone. All of them underwent SARS-CoV-2 PCR-RT, a rapid diagnostic test and a test of Venezuelan smell and basic taste at the beginning. Weekly follow-up with smell and taste test and SARS-CoV-2 PCR-RT until recovery. Results: 20.56% of patients had smell and taste disorders to a variable degree and were positive by SARS-CoV-PCR-RT. 2.15.3% of patients with chemosensory disorders were negative for COVID-19. The positive predictive value of the smell and taste test was 57.3; Sensitivity 41.13% and specificity 69.35%. There were no statistically significant differences by age, sex and chemosensory disorders. The predominant chemosensory disorder was the combination of mild hyposmia and hypogeusia and appeared in the company of other symptoms. Recovery occurred in an average of 8.5 days, asynchronously with the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negativization, which occurred up to more than 15 days after the senses recovered. Maximum time of negativization of the RT-PCR of 34 days. Conclusion: chemosensory disorders are a symptom and \/ or sign of coronavirus disease but cannot be considered as predictors of said disease in this population studied. The gold standard remains the SARS-CoV-2 PCR-RT test. Rapid diagnostic tests should be used for follow-up. Recommendations: it is necessary to expand the sample, include routine psychophysical smell and taste tests to screen cases and take race and virus mutations into consideration to explain behavior in certain populations. Key words: Smell, taste, coronavirus, test, diagnosis.","rel_num_authors":18,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rosalinda Pieruzzini","author_inst":"Departament of Otolaryngology of the Hospital Military University Dr. Carlos Arvelo.

However, even the gold-standard COVID-19 test, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, suffers from a high false negative rate and a turnaround time of up to one week, preventing the infected from accessing the timely care they require, and impeding efforts to isolate positive cases. To address these shortcomings, this study develops a machine learning model based on the DenseNet-201 deep convolutional neural network, that can classify COVID-19 from chest radiographs in less than one minute and far more accurately than conventional tests (F1-score: 0.96; precision: 0.95; recall: 0.98). It uses a significantly larger dataset and more control classes than previously published models, demonstrating the promise of a machine learning approach for accurate and efficient COVID-19 screening.

Acquired immunity still remains a dilemma. The aim of our study included a comprehensive analysis of patient characteristics, evaluation of antibody response, and its trend over a period of three months in recovered patients. Methods: Monocentric investigator-initiated pilot longitudinal observational study conducted by the Association Naso Sano, on a cohort of 30 COVID recovered patients based in the Umbria region, followed up from April to June 2020 for baseline blood counts, IgM and IgG trends using two different serological assays-ELISA and CLIA. The demographics, blood group, co-morbidities and treatment modalities were recorded from each patient along with an analysis of clinical profile, dates concerning symptom onset, first positive and two consecutive negative swabs using an online questionnaire followed by serological testing. Descriptive and Bivariate (Pearson correlation coefficient) statistics were conducted to detect statistically significant correlations. Findings: The study involved 30 patients with a M:F ratio of 0.57 and a distribution of mild (67%), moderate (30%) and critical (3%). Majority of the patients were healthcare workers (40%) and the mean viral shedding duration was 20.13 +\/- 6.17 days. The IgG levels offered long-standing protection as long as 3 months in some cases. A statistically significant, directly proportional correlation (Pearson) exists between ELISA and CLIA values for IgM. Some patients also expressed titers lower than the detection threshold and therefore a positive RT-PCR test does not necessarily guarantee a high IgG response in the recovery period. Interpretation: The data presented in our study provides a relative long-term analysis and possible explanation regarding the protection developed by patients recovered from COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Puya Dehgani-Mobaraki","author_inst":"Associazione Naso Sano, Umbria region, Italy."},{"author_name":"Asiya Kamber Zaidi","author_inst":"Associazione Naso Sano, Umbria region, Italy."},{"author_name":"Alessandro Floridi","author_inst":"Laboratory of Nuclear Lipid BioPathology, Centro Ricerche Analisi Biochimico Specialistiche, Perugia, Italy."},{"author_name":"Alessandro Lepri","author_inst":"Associazione Naso Sano"},{"author_name":"Emanuela Floridi","author_inst":"Laboratory of Nuclear Lipid BioPathology, Centro Ricerche Analisi Biochimico Specialistiche, Perugia, Italy."},{"author_name":"Alessia Gherardi","author_inst":"Centro Ricerche Analisi Biochimico Specialistiche, Perugia, Italy."},{"author_name":"Enrico Bernini-Carri","author_inst":"President of European Centre for Disaster and Emergency Medicine of Council of Europe, Strasbourg, Saint Marino"},{"author_name":"Eleonora Durzo","author_inst":"Independant"},{"author_name":"Massoud Dehgani-Mobaraki","author_inst":"Associazione Naso Sano, Umbria region, Italy."},{"author_name":"Angeline Grullon","author_inst":"Otorhinolaryngology Department of the Hospital Military University Dr. Carlos Arvelo.

We carried out proteomic profiling of plasma from cross-sectional and longitudinal cohorts of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and analyzed clinical data from our health system database of over 3,300 patients. Using a machine learning algorithm, we identified a prominent signature of neutrophil activation, including resistin, lipocalin-2, HGF, IL-8, and G-CSF, as the strongest predictors of critical illness. Neutrophil activation was present on the first day of hospitalization in patients who would only later require transfer to the intensive care unit, thus preceding the onset of critical illness and predicting increased mortality. In the health system database, early elevations in developing and mature neutrophil counts also predicted higher mortality rates. Altogether, we define an essential role for neutrophil activation in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and identify molecular neutrophil markers that distinguish patients at risk of future clinical decompensation.","rel_num_authors":30,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Matthew L.

Objective: In this study, we undertake a meta-analysis to estimate the global and regional anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence rates in humans and assess whether seroprevalence associates with geographical, climatic and socio-demographic factors. Data sources: We systematically reviewed PubMed, Scopus, Embase, medRxiv and bioRxiv for peer-reviewed articles or preprints (up to 14 August 2020). Study eligibility criteria: Population-based studies describing prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum antibodies in general people. Participants: general people who were tested for prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum antibodies. Interventions: There were no interventions. Methods: We used random-effects model to estimate pooled seroprevalence, and then extrapolated these findings to the global population (for 2020). Sub-group and meta-regression analyses explored potential sources of heterogeneity in the data and relationships between seroprevalence and socio-demographic, geographical and climatic factors. Results: In total, 47 serological studies involving 399,265 people from 23 countries met the inclusion criteria. The pooled seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in general people was estimated at 3.38% (95% CI, 3.05%-3.72%; 15,879\/399,265). On a regional basis, we determined seroprevalence estimates of 5.27% (3.97-6.57%) in Northern Europe; 4.41% (2.20-6.61%) in Southern Europe; 4.41% (3.03-5.79%) in North America; 3.17% (1.96-4.38%) in Western Europe; 2.02% (1.56-2.49%) in the Eastern Asia; and 1.45% (0.95-1.94%) in South America. Extrapolating to the 2020 world population, we estimated that 263,565,606 individuals had been exposed or infected with SARS-CoV-2 at the first wave of the pandemic. A significantly higher seroprevalence was related to higher income levels and human development indices, higher geographical latitudes and lower mean environmental temperatures. Interpretation This study reinforces that SARS-CoV-2 infection is a very rapidly-spreading communicable disease and calls for routine surveys to constantly monitor temporal changes in seroprevalence around the globe.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ali Rostami","author_inst":"Babol University of Medical Science"},{"author_name":"Mahdi Sepidarkish","author_inst":"Babol University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mariska Leeflang","author_inst":"University of Amsterdam"},{"author_name":"Seyed Mohammad Riahi","author_inst":"Birjand University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Malihe Nourollahpour Shiadeh","author_inst":"Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sahar Esfandyari","author_inst":"University of Illinois at Chicago"},{"author_name":"Ali H Mokdad","author_inst":"University of Washington"},{"author_name":"Peter J.
