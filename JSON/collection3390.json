Such NPIs include social distancing, school closures, limiting international travel and complete lockdown. Worldwide the NPIs enforced to limit the spread of COVID-19 are now being lifted. Understanding how the risk increases when NPIs are lifted is important for decision making. Treating NPIs equally across countries and regions limits the possibility for modelling differences in epidemic response, as the response to the NPIs influences can vary between regions and this can affect the epidemic outcome, so do the strength and speed of lifting these. Our solution to this is to measure mobility changes from mobile phone data and their impacts on the basic reproductive number. We model the epidemic in all US states to compare the difference in outcome if NPIs are lifted or retained. We show that keeping NPIs just a few weeks longer has a substantial impact on the epidemic outcome.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Patrick Bryant","author_inst":"Stockholm University\/Science for Life Laboratory"},{"author_name":"Arne Elofsson","author_inst":"Stockholm University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.03.20145672","rel_title":"A Novel Approach for Estimating the Final Outcome of Global Diseases Like COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-07-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.03.20145672","rel_abs":"The existence of a universal law which maps the bell curve of daily cases to a sigmoid curve for cumulative ones is used for making robust estimations about the final outcome of a disease.

We aimed to estimate the serial interval and basic reproduction number for Jodhpur, India and to use it for prediction of epidemic size for next one month. Methods: Contact tracing of SARSCoV2 infected individuals was done to obtain the serial intervals. Aggregate and instantaneous R0 values were derived and epidemic projection was done using R software v4.0.0. Results: From among 79 infector infectee pairs, the estimated median and 95 percentile values of serial interval were 5.98 days (95% CI 5.39 to 6.65) and 13.17 days (95% CI 11.27 to 15.57), respectively. The overall R0 value in the first 30 days of outbreak was 1.64 (95% CI 1.12 to 2.25) which subsequently decreased to 1.07 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.09). The instantaneous R0 value over 14 days window ranged from a peak of 3.71 (95% CI 1.85 -2.08) to 0.88 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.96) as on 24 June 2020. The projected COVID-19 case-load over next one month was 1881 individuals. Reduction of R0 from 1.17 to 1.085 could result in 23% reduction in projected epidemic size over the next one month. Conclusion: Aggressive testing, contact-tracing and isolation of infected individuals in Jodhpur district resulted in reduction of R0. Further strengthening of control measures could lead to substantial reduction of COVID19 epidemic size. A data-driven strategy was found useful in surge capacity planning and guiding the public health strategy at local level.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Suman Saurabh","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Jodhpur"},{"author_name":"Mahendra Kumar Verma","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Jodhpur, India"},{"author_name":"Vaishali Gautam","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Jodhpur, India"},{"author_name":"Akhil Goel","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Jodhpur, India"},{"author_name":"Manoj Kumar Gupta","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Jodhpur, India"},{"author_name":"Pankaj Bhardwaj","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Jodhpur, India"},{"author_name":"Sanjeev Misra","author_inst":"All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Jodhpur, India"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.03.20145060","rel_title":"Health literacy in the general population in the context of epidemic or pandemic coronavirus outbreak situations: rapid scoping review","rel_date":"2020-07-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.03.20145060","rel_abs":"BACKGROUND: Authorities responded with contact restrictions and other measures to the global spread of SARS-CoV-2. Health literacy (HL) has been linked to health outcomes and refers to the ability to access, understand, appraise and apply health information in order to make good health decisions. When restrictions are gradually lifted, individual HL becomes essential to control the pandemic and to prevent the resumption of these restriction, should infection numbers surge again. The aim of this rapid scoping review, for which only studies from the general population were considered, was to describe the extent of existing research on HL in the context of previous coronavirus outbreaks (SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2). Facets of HL that were of particular interest were: type of assessment of HL (theory-based versus proxy assessment; validated instrument versus ad hoc assessment), domains of HL, interventions aiming to improve HL during outbreak situations, and HL surveillance during outbreak. METHODS: We searched two major databases and included publications of quantitative and qualitative studies in English and German on any type of research on the functional, critical and communicative domains of HL conducted in the context of the three outbreaks in the general population. We extracted and tabulated relevant data and narratively reported where and when the study was conducted, the design and method used, and how HL was measured. FINDINGS: 72 studies were included. Three investigated HL or explicitly referred to the concept of HL, 14 were guided by health behaviour theory. We did not find any study designed to develop or psychometrically evaluate pandemic HL instruments, or relate pandemic or general HL to a pandemic outcome, or any controlled intervention study. Type of assessment of the domains of HL varied widely. INTERPRETATION: Theory-driven observational studies as well as interventions, examining whether pandemic-related HL can be improved are needed. In addition, the development and validation of instruments that measure pandemic-related HL is desirable.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Uwe Matterne","author_inst":"Otto von Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Nina Egger","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Health Education, Freiburg University of Education, Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jana Tempes","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Health Education, Freiburg University of Education, Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Christina Tischer","author_inst":"Institute of Social Medicine and Health Systems Research, Medical Faculty, Otto von Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Jonas Lander","author_inst":"Institute for Epidemiology, Social Medicine and Health Systems Research, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany"},{"author_name":"Marie-Luise Dierks","author_inst":"Institute for Epidemiology, Social Medicine and Health Systems Research, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany"},{"author_name":"Eva-Maria Bitzer","author_inst":"Department of Public Health and Health Education, Freiburg University of Education, Freiburg, Germany"},{"author_name":"Christian Apfelbacher","author_inst":"Institute of Social Medicine and Health Systems Research, Medical Faculty, Otto von Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.02.20145367","rel_title":"Early COVID-19 Interventions Failed to Replicate St. Louis vs. Philadelphia Outcomes in the United States","rel_date":"2020-07-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.02.20145367","rel_abs":"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has elicited an abrupt pause in the United States in multiple sectors of commerce and social activity. As the US faces this health crisis, the magnitude, and rigor of their initial public health response was unprecedented. As a response, the entire nation shutdown at the state-level for the duration of approximately one to three months. These public health interventions, however, were not arbitrarily decided, but rather, implemented as a result of evidence-based practices. These practices were a result of lessons learned during the 1918 influenza pandemic and the city-level non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) taken across the US. During the 1918 pandemic, two model cities, St. Louis, MO, and Philadelphia, PA, carried out two different approaches to address the spreading disease, which resulted in two distinctly different outcomes. Our group has evaluated the state-level public health response adopted by states across the US, with a focus on New York, California, Florida, and Texas, and compared the effectiveness of reducing the spread of COVID-19. Our assessments show that while the states mentioned above benefited from the implementations of early preventative measures, they inadequately replicated the desired outcomes observed in St. Louis during the 1918 crisis. Our study indicates that there are other factors, including health disparities that may influence the effectiveness of public health interventions applied. Identifying more specific health determinants may help implement targeted interventions aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19 and improving health equity.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Aliea M.

Healthcare workers are not only at heightened risk of infection, but also of adverse mental health outcomes. Identification of organizational, collegial and individual risk and resilience factors impacting the mental health of healthcare workers are needed to inform preparedness planning and sustainable response. Methods: We performed a rapid systematic review to identify, assess and summarize available research on the mental health impact of the covid-19 pandemic on healthcare workers. On 11 May 2020, we utilized the Norwegian Institute of Public Health's Live map of covid-19 evidence, the visualization of a database of 20,738 screened studies, to identify studies for inclusion. We included studies reporting on any type of mental health outcome in any type of healthcare workers during the pandemic. We described interventions reported by the studies, and narratively summarized mental health-related outcomes, as study heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis. We assessed study quality using design-specific instruments. Results: We included 59 studies, reporting on a total of 54,707 healthcare workers. The prevalence of general psychological distress across the studies ranged from 7-97% (median 37%), anxiety 9-90% (median 24%), depression 5-51% (median 21%), and sleeping problems 34-65% (median 37%). Seven studies reported on implementing mental health interventions, and most focused on individual symptom reduction, but none reported on effects of the interventions. In most studies, healthcare workers reported low interest in and use of professional help, and greater reliance on social support and contact with family and friends. Exposure to covid-19 was the most commonly reported correlate of mental health problems, followed by female gender, and worry about infection or about infecting others. Social support correlated with less mental health problems. Discussion: Healthcare workers in a variety of fields, positions, and exposure risks are reporting anxiety, depression, sleep problems, and distress during the covid-19 pandemic, but most studies do not report comparative data on mental health symptoms. before the pandemic. There seems to be a mismatch between risk factors for adverse mental health outcomes among healthcare workers in the current pandemic and their needs and preferences, and the individual psychopathology focus of current interventions. Efforts to help healthcare workers sustain healthy relationships to colleagues, family and friends over time may be paramount to safeguard what is already an important source of support during the prolonged crisis. Expanding interventions' focus to incorporate organizational, collegial and family factors to support healthcare workers responding to the pandemic could improve acceptability and efficacy of interventions.

No funding was received.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ashley Elizabeth Muller","author_inst":"Norwegian Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Elisabet Vivianne Hafstad","author_inst":"Norwegian Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Jan Peter William Himmels","author_inst":"Norwegian Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Geir Smedslund","author_inst":"Norwegian Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Signe Flottorp","author_inst":"Norwegian Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Synne Stensland","author_inst":"Norwegian Centre for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies, Oslo, Norway, and Research and Communication Unit for Musculoskeletal Health (FORMI), Division of Cl"},{"author_name":"Stijn Stroobants","author_inst":"Humanitarian Services, Belgian Red Cross, Mechelen, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Stijn Van de Velde","author_inst":"Norwegian Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Gunn Elisabeth Vist","author_inst":"Norwegian Institute of Public Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"occupational and environmental health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.03.20145664","rel_title":"Battle with COVID-19 Under Partial to Zero Lockdowns in India","rel_date":"2020-07-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.03.20145664","rel_abs":"The cumulative records of COVID-19 are rapidly increasing day by day in India. The key question prevailing in minds of all is when will it get over? There have been several attempts in literature to address this question using time series, Machine learning, epidemiological and statistical models. However due to high level of uncertainty in the domain and lack of big historical data, the performance of these models suffer. In this work, we present an intuitive model that uses a combination of epidemiological model (SEIR) and mathematical curve fitting method to forecast spread of COVID-19 in India in future. By using the combination model, we get characteristics benefits of these models under limited knowledge and historical data about the novel Coronavirus. Instead of fixing parameters of the standard SEIR model before simulation, we propose to learn them from the real data set consisting of progression of Corona spread in India. The learning of model is carefully designed by understanding that available data set consist of records of cases under full, partial to zero lockdown phases in India. Hence, we make two separate predictions by our propose model. One under the situation of full lockdown in India and, other with partial to zero restrictions in India. With continued strict lockdown after May 03, 2020, our model predicted May 14, 2020 as the date of peak of Coronavirus in India. However, in current scenario of partial to zero lockdown phase in India, the peak of Coronavirus cases is predicted to be July 31, 2020. These two predictions presented in this work provide awareness among citizens of India on importance of control measures such as full, partial and zero lockdown and the spread of Corona disease infection rate. In addition to this, it is a beneficial study for the government of India to plan the things ahead.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sakshi Babbar","author_inst":"UNIVO, Edutech"},{"author_name":"Elisabet Vivianne Hafstad","author_inst":"Norwegian Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Jan Peter William Himmels","author_inst":"Norwegian Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Geir Smedslund","author_inst":"Norwegian Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Signe Flottorp","author_inst":"Norwegian Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Synne Stensland","author_inst":"Norwegian Centre for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies, Oslo, Norway, and Research and Communication Unit for Musculoskeletal Health (FORMI), Division of Cl"},{"author_name":"Stijn Stroobants","author_inst":"Humanitarian Services, Belgian Red Cross, Mechelen, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Stijn Van de Velde","author_inst":"Norwegian Institute of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Gunn Elisabeth Vist","author_inst":"Norwegian Institute of Public Health"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health informatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.02.20144956","rel_title":"Increasing Virus Test Capacity via Recursive Pool Testing with an Application to SARS-CoV-2 Testing","rel_date":"2020-07-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.02.20144956","rel_abs":"In the context of adequate reactions to the current Covid-19 pandemic, Seifried, Ciesek et al.

The extent of the spread of COVID-19 within populations is uncertain since diagnostic tests have not been carried out on all eligible persons and doing such diagnostic tests on everyone is much less feasible in developing countries such as Nigeria. Tests for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, are more affordable, readily available, and require minimal training than current diagnostic tests. Employing a seroepidemiological strategy, serological tests were conducted on 66 volunteering staff and patients at the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital (UCTH), a Federal Government owned tertiary healthcare facility, to determine the extent of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, from 17th to 25th June 2020. Using a COVID-19 IgG\/IgM Rapid Test Cassette with emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States, it was observed that of the 66 samples tested, 5 (7.6%) were both IgG and IgM positive and 17 (26%) were IgG positive. Moreover, for 44 of the 66 participants, simultaneous tests were carried out using a rapid test kit from a different manufacturer but without FDA-EUA and all the results completely matched with the FDA-EUA kit, except one case where the FDA-EUA kit showed positive for both IgG and IgM while the other kit was positive only for IgM. The 26% positive IgG indicates a high exposure rate for the hospital staff and patients and points to community transmission where the facility is situated. Hence, immediate activation of WHO guidelines for controlling community transmission is called for. These results can further serve as a pilot study to guide public health policies in response to COVID-19 pandemic in both the general population and in healthcare settings.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Marcus Inyama Asuquo","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, College of Medical Sciences, University of Calabar, Calabar, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Emmanuel Effa","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, College of Medical Sciences, University of Calabar, Calabar, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Akaninyene Otu","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, College of Medical Sciences, University of Calabar, Calabar, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Okokon Ita","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, College of Medical Sciences, University of Calabar, Calabar, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Ubong Udoh","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, College of Medical Sciences, University of Calabar, Calabar, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Victor Umoh","author_inst":"Department of Internal Medicine, College of Health Sciences, University of Uyo, Uyo, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Oluwabukola Gbotosho","author_inst":"Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, 45229, USA"},{"author_name":"Anthonia Ikpeme","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, College of Medical Sciences, University of Calabar, Calabar, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Soter Ameh","author_inst":"Biostatistics Unit, Department of Community Medicine, University of Calabar, Calabar, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"William Egbe","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, College of Medical Sciences, University of Calabar, Calabar, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Margaret Etok","author_inst":"Joseph Ukpo Hospitals and Research Institutes (JUHRI), Afua Site, Ibiono Ibom, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Jochen Guck","author_inst":"Max-Planck-Zentrum f&uumlr Physik und Medizin, Staudtstr. 2, 91058 Erlangen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andrew Ekpenyong","author_inst":"Department of Physics, Creighton University, Omaha, NE, 68178, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.03.20144949","rel_title":"The projected impact of mitigation and suppression strategies on the COVID-19 epidemic in Senegal: A modelling study","rel_date":"2020-07-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.03.20144949","rel_abs":"Background: Physical distancing measures that reduce social contacts have formed a key part of national COVID-19 containment and mitigation strategies. Many Sub-Saharan African nations are now facing increasing numbers of cases of COVID-19 and there is a need to understand what levels of measures may be required to successfully reduce transmission. Methods: We collated epidemiological data along with information on key COVID-19 specific response policies and health system capacity estimates for services needed to treat COVID-19 patients in Senegal. We calibrated an age-structured SEIR model to these data to capture transmission dynamics accounting for demography, contact patterns, hospital capacity and disease severity. We simulated the impact of mitigation and suppression strategies focussed on reducing social contact rates. Results: Senegal acted promptly to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and as a result has reduced the reproduction number from 1.9 (95% CI 1.7-2.2) to 1.3 (95% CI 1.2-1.5), which has slowed but not fully interrupted transmission. We estimate that continued spread is likely to peak in October, and to overwhelm the healthcare system with an estimated 77,400 deaths(95% CI 55,270-100,700). Further reductions in contact rates to suppress transmission (Rt<1) could significantly reduce this burden on healthcare services and improve overall health outcomes. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that Senegal has already significantly reduced transmission. Enhanced physical distancing measures and rapid scale up of hospital capacity is likely to be needed to reduce mortality and protect healthcare infrastructure from high levels of demand.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hayley A Thompson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Aminata Mboup","author_inst":"IRESSEF: Institut de Recherche en Sante de Surveillance Epidemiologique et de Formations"},{"author_name":"Badara Cisse","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shevanthi Nayagam","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Oliver J Watson","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Charles Whittaker","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Patrick G T Walker","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Azra C Ghani","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Souleymane Mboup","author_inst":"IRESSEF: Institut de Recherche en Sante de Surveillance Epidemiologique et de Formations"},{"author_name":"William Egbe","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, College of Medical Sciences, University of Calabar, Calabar, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Margaret Etok","author_inst":"Joseph Ukpo Hospitals and Research Institutes (JUHRI), Afua Site, Ibiono Ibom, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Jochen Guck","author_inst":"Max-Planck-Zentrum f&uumlr Physik und Medizin, Staudtstr. 2, 91058 Erlangen, Germany"},{"author_name":"Andrew Ekpenyong","author_inst":"Department of Physics, Creighton University, Omaha, NE, 68178, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.03.20144931","rel_title":"Psychiatric symptoms, risk, and protective factors among university students in quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic in China","rel_date":"2020-07-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.03.20144931","rel_abs":"This study investigated psychiatric symptoms (depression, anxiety, and traumatic stress) during state-enforced quarantine among university students in China. We conducted a cross-sectional survey with 1,912 university students during March and April 2020. Psychiatric symptoms in the mild or higher range based on clinical cut-offs were alarmingly prevalent: 67.05% reported traumatic stress symptoms, 46.55% had depressive symptoms, and 34.73% reported anxiety symptoms. Further, 19.56% endorsed some degree of suicidal ideation. We explored factors that may contribute to poor psychological health as well as those that may function as protective factors. Risk and protective factors examined included demographic variables, two known protective factors for mental health (mindfulness, perceived social support), four COVID-specific factors (COVID-19 related efficacy, perceived COVID-19 threat, perceived COVID-19 societal stigma, COVID-19 prosocial behavior) and screen media usage. Across psychiatric symptom domains, mindfulness was associated with lower symptom severity, while COVID-19 related financial stress, perceived COVID-19 societal stigma, and perceived COVID-19 threat were associated with higher symptom severity. COVID-19 threat and COVID-19 stigma showed main and interactive effects in predicting all mental health outcomes, with their combination associated with highest symptom severity.

Hyper-inflammation occurs in Covid-19 and is associated with worse outcomes. The efficacy of dexamethasone in preventing mortality in critical Covid-19 suggests that inflammation has a causal role in death. Whether this deleterious inflammation is primarily a direct response to the presence of SARS-CoV-2 requiring enhanced resistance, or an independent immunopathologic process necessitating enhanced tolerance, is unknown. Here we report an aberrant immune response in fatal Covid-19, principally involving the lung and reticuloendothelial system, that is not clearly topologically associated with the virus, indicating tissue-specific tolerance of SARS-CoV-2. We found that inflammation and organ dysfunction in fatal Covid-19 did not map to the widespread tissue and cellular distribution of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and protein, both between and within tissues. A monocyte\/myeloid-rich vasculitis was identified in the lung, along with an influx of macrophages\/monocytes into the parenchyma. In addition, stereotyped abnormal reticulo-endothelial responses (reactive plasmacytosis and iron-laden macrophages) were present and dissociated from the presence of virus in lymphoid tissues. Our results support virus-independent immunopathology being one of the primary mechanisms underlying fatal Covid-19. This supports prioritising pathogen tolerance as a therapeutic strategy in Covid-19, by better understanding non-injurious organ-specific viral tolerance mechanisms and targeting aberrant macrophage and plasma cell responses.","rel_num_authors":28,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David A Dorward","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Clark D Russell","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"In Hwa Um","author_inst":"University of St Andrews"},{"author_name":"Mustafa Elshani","author_inst":"University of St Andrews"},{"author_name":"Stuart D Armstrong","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Rebekah Penrice-Randal","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Tracey Millar","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Chris EB Lerpiniere","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Giulia Tagliavini","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Catherine S Hartley","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Nadine P Randall","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Naomi N Gachanja","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Philippe MD Potey","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Alison M Anderson","author_inst":"Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Victoria L Campbell","author_inst":"Western General Hospital Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Alasdair J Duguid","author_inst":"Western General Hospital Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Wael Al Qsous","author_inst":"Western General Hospital Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ralph BouHaidar","author_inst":"Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"J Kenneth Baillie","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Kevin Dhaliwal","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"William A Wallace","author_inst":"Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Christopher OC Bellamy","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Sandrine Prost","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Colin Smith","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Julian A Hiscox","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"David J Harrison","author_inst":"University of St Andrews"},{"author_name":"Christopher D Lucas","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"- ICECAP","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.02.20144964","rel_title":"A systematic review of the smartphone applications available for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) and their assessment using the mobile app rating scale (MARS)","rel_date":"2020-07-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.02.20144964","rel_abs":"The global impact of COVID-19 pandemic has increased the need to rapidly develop and improve utilization of mobile applications across the healthcare continuum to address rising barriers of access to care due to social distancing challenges and allow continuity in sharing of health information, assist with COVID-19 activities including contact tracing, and providing useful information as needed. Here we provide an overview of mobile applications being currently utilized for COVID-19 related activities. We performed a systematic review of the literature and mobile platforms to assess mobile applications been currently utilized for COVID-19, and quality assessment of these applications using the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS) for overall quality, Engagement, Functionality, Aesthetics, and Information. Finally, we provide an overview of the key salient features that should be included in mobile applications being developed for future use. Our search identified 63 apps that are currently being used for COVID-19. Of these, 25 were selected from the Google play store and Apple App store in India, and 19 each from the UK and US. 18 apps were developed for sharing up to date information on COVID-19, and 8 were used for contact tracing while 9 apps showed features of both. On MARS Scale, overall scores ranged from 2.4 to 4.8 with apps scoring high in areas of functionality and lower in Engagement. Future steps should involve developing and testing of mobile applications using assessment tools like the MARS scale and the study of their impact on health behaviors and outcomes.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samira Davalbhakta","author_inst":"BJGMC Pune and Sassoon General Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Shailesh Advani","author_inst":"Social Behavioural Research Unit, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA"},{"author_name":"Shobhit Kumar","author_inst":"King George's Medical University Lucknow, India"},{"author_name":"Vishwesh Agarwal","author_inst":"Mahatma Gandhi Missions Medical College"},{"author_name":"Samruddhi Bhoyar","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Massachusetts, USA"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth Fedirko","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Massachusetts, USA"},{"author_name":"Durga Misra","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, India"},{"author_name":"Ashish Goel","author_inst":"Department of Medicine, University College of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India"},{"author_name":"Latika Gupta","author_inst":"SGPGI"},{"author_name":"Vikas Agarwal","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Immunology, Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, India"},{"author_name":"Nadine P Randall","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Naomi N Gachanja","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Philippe MD Potey","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Alison M Anderson","author_inst":"Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Victoria L Campbell","author_inst":"Western General Hospital Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Alasdair J Duguid","author_inst":"Western General Hospital Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Wael Al Qsous","author_inst":"Western General Hospital Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Ralph BouHaidar","author_inst":"Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"J Kenneth Baillie","author_inst":"Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Kevin Dhaliwal","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"William A Wallace","author_inst":"Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Christopher OC Bellamy","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Sandrine Prost","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Colin Smith","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"Julian A Hiscox","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"David J Harrison","author_inst":"University of St Andrews"},{"author_name":"Christopher D Lucas","author_inst":"University of Edinburgh"},{"author_name":"- ICECAP","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.02.20144873","rel_title":"Clinical Characteristics of Recurrent-positive Coronavirus Disease 2019 after Curative Discharge: a retrospective analysis of 15 cases in Wuhan China","rel_date":"2020-07-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.02.20144873","rel_abs":"In China, the patients with previously negative RT-PCR results again test positive during the post-discharge isolation period.

Clinical data and laboratory results were comparatively analyzed. We found that recurrent-positive patients had moderate disease. The rate of recurrent-positive disease in our hospital was 1.87%. Recurrent-positive patients were significantly younger (43(35-54) years) than control patients (60(43-69) years) (P=0.011).

Here we show the influence of gender, parenthood and race in academics productivity during the pandemic period, based on a survey answered by 3,345 Brazilian academics from various knowledge areas and research institutions. Findings revealed that male academics - especially childless ones - were the least affected group, whereas female academics, especially Black women and mothers, were the most impacted group. This scenario will leave long-term effects on the career progression of the most affected groups. The results presented here are crucial for the development of actions and policies that aim to avoid further deepening the gender gap in science. This particular situation we are facing during the pandemic demands institutional flexibility and academia should foster the discussion about actions to benefit Black scientists and academics with families in the post-pandemic scenario.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fernanda Staniscuaski","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"Livia Kmetzsch","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"Eugenia Zandona","author_inst":"Universidade Estadual do Rio de Janeiro"},{"author_name":"Fernanda Reichert","author_inst":"Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul"},{"author_name":"Rossana C.

Patients with severe asthma may have a greater risk of dying from COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and enzyme proteases, transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and furin are needed for the attachment and invasion of the virus into host cells. We determined whether their expression in the airways of severe asthma patients is increased. Method. We examined the microarray mRNA expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and furin in the sputum, bronchial brush and bronchial biopsies of participants in the European U-BIOPRED cohort. Results. ACE2 and furin sputum gene expression was significantly increased in severe non-smoking asthma compared to mild-moderate asthma and healthy volunteers. By contrast, TMPRSS2 expression in bronchial biopsy and bronchial brushings was increased in severe smoking and ex-smoking asthmatics, and so was furin expression in bronchial brushings. Several clinical parameters including male gender, oral steroid use and nasal polyps were positively associated with ACE2, TMPRSS2 and furin expression levels. There was a higher expression of ACE2 and furin in the sputum neutrophilic molecular phenotype with inflammasome activation compared to the eosinophilic Type2-high or paucigranulocytic phenotypes.

We first show that public attention depends strongly on whether there are cases in own country. We then show that countries with high levels of public attention are more likely to implement non-pharmaceutical interventions, even after controlling for the number of cases and deaths. Finally, we show that the extent to which a government responds to public attention is highly dependent on the country's institutional quality. The positive effect of public attention on policy implementation is driven entirely by countries with good institutions.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cevat G.

Curtailment of aggregate social mobility - through policies such as: social distancing recommendations, shelter in place orders and state-enforced lockdowns - has become a primary strategy to address COVID-19 to limit social contact and reduce disease transmission. In this context, a small number of countries have instituted gender or sex-segregated mobility policies (Panama, Peru, and Bogota, Colombia). Through a retrospective analysis of global geographic positioning (GPS) data, this study presents an overview of aggregate mobility in Panama following the countrys implementation of a sex-segregated social distancing policy. Panama was selected as the nationwide sex-segregated policy was enforced throughout the lockdown period. The paper looks at mobility trends on female- and male-sex mobility days, examining differences by volume of movement and type of community locations visited as compared to pre-COVID trends. We find lower visits to all community location categories on female-mobility days. However, we found no significant difference in visits to workplace locations on male- v. female-mobility days. The paper discusses the implications of these findings in three areas: (1) Informal burden of labor and social reproduction, (2) Implications for womens autonomy and safety in the home, and (3) Womens economic empowerment.

The Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW) has been strongly associated with increased morbidity and mortality in multiple diseases. Objective: To assess if elevated RDW is associated with unfavorable outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19. Methods: We retrospectively studied clinical outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients for their RDW values. In-hospital mortality was defined as primary outcome, while septic shock, need for mechanical ventilation, and length of stay (LOS) were secondary outcomes. Results- A total of 294 COVID-19 patients were finally studied. Overall prevalence of increased RDW was 49.7% (146\/294). RDW was associated with increased risk of in-hospital mortality (aOR, 4.5; 95%CI, 1.4-14.3) and septic shock (aOR, 4.6; 95%CI, 1.4-15.1) after adjusting for anemia, ferritin, and lactate. The association remained unchanged even after adjusting for other clinical confounders such as age, sex, body mass index, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. No association was found instead with mechanical ventilation and median LOS. Conclusion: Elevated RDW in hospitalized COVID-19 patients is associated with a significantly increased risk of mortality and septic shock.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Preethi Ramachandran","author_inst":"Brookdale University Hospital and Medical center"},{"author_name":"Mahesh Gajendran","author_inst":"TTUHSC El Paso"},{"author_name":"Abhilash Perisetti","author_inst":"University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Karim Osama Elkholy","author_inst":"Brookdale University Hospital and Medical center"},{"author_name":"Abhishek Chakraborti","author_inst":"Brookdale University Hospital and Medical center"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe Lippi","author_inst":"UniversityHospital of Verona"},{"author_name":"Hemant Goyal","author_inst":"Wright Center for Graduate Medical Education"},{"author_name":"Pank Bhavsar","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Peter Howarth","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"Sven-Erik Dahlen","author_inst":"Karoilinska Institute"},{"author_name":"Peter Sterk","author_inst":"Amsterdam University"},{"author_name":"Ratko Djukanovic","author_inst":"Southampton University"},{"author_name":"Ian Adcock","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Kian Fan Chung","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Adriana Seixas","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Ciencias da Saude de Porto Alegre"},{"author_name":"Charley C.

Here, we evaluated the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharynx swabs from infected patients in mild conditions and compared the viral RNA load dynamics between patients receiving HCQ and control group without antiviral pharmacological therapy.

A skewed distribution where few individuals or events are responsible for the majority of transmission can result in explosive, superspreading events, which produce rapid and volatile epidemic dynamics, especially early or late in epidemics. Anticipating and preventing superspreading events can produce large reductions in overall transmission rates. Here, we present a compartmental (SEIR) epidemiological model framework for estimating transmission parameters from multiple imperfectly observed data streams, including reported cases, deaths, and mobile phone-based mobility that incorporates individual-level heterogeneity in transmission using previous estimates for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. We parameterize the model for COVID-19 epidemic dynamics by estimating a time-varying transmission rate that incorporates the impact of non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies that change over time, in five epidemiologically distinct settings---Los Angeles and Santa Clara Counties, California; Seattle (King County), Washington; Atlanta (Dekalb and Fulton Counties), Georgia; and Miami (Miami-Dade County), Florida. We find the effective reproduction number RE dropped below 1 rapidly following social distancing orders in mid-March, 2020 and remained there into June in Santa Clara County and Seattle, but climbed above 1 in late May in Los Angeles, Miami, and Atlanta, and has trended upward in all locations since April. With the fitted model, we ask: how does truncating the tail of the individual-level transmission rate distribution affect epidemic dynamics and control? We find interventions that truncate the transmission rate distribution while partially relaxing social distancing are broadly effective, with impacts on epidemic growth on par with the strongest population-wide social distancing observed in April, 2020. Given that social distancing interventions will be needed to maintain epidemic control until a vaccine becomes widely available, \"chopping off the tail\" to reduce the probability of superspreading events presents a promising option to alleviate the need for extreme general social distancing.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Morgan P Kain","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Marissa L Childs","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Alexander D Becker","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Erin A Mordecai","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Svetlana Kudryavtseva","author_inst":"Clinical City Hospital named after I.V.

Medication non-adherence can blur drug efficacy results in clinical trials, lead to substantial financial losses, increase the risk of relapse and hospitalisation, or lead to death. The most common methods measuring adherence are post-treatment measures; that is, adherence is usually measured after the treatment has begun. What the authors are proposing in this multidisciplinary study is a technique for analysing the factors that can cause non-adherence before or during medication treatment. Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), allows system analysts to determine how combinations of simple faults of a system can propagate to cause a total system failure. Monte Carlo simulation is a mathematical algorithm that depends heavily on repeated random sampling to predict the behaviour of a system. In this study, the authors propose the use of Non-Adherence Tree Analysis (NATA), based on the FTA and Monte Carlo simulation techniques, to improve adherence. Firstly, the non-adherence factors of a medication treatment lifecycle are translated into what is referred to as a Non-Adherence Tree (NAT). Secondly, the NAT is coded into a format that is translated into the GoldSim software for performing dynamic system modelling and analysis using Monte Carlo. Finally, the GoldSim model is simulated and analysed to predict the behaviour of the NAT. This study produces a framework for improving adherence by analysing social and non-social adherence barriers. The results reveal that the biggest factor that could contribute to non-adherence to a COVID-19 treatment is a therapy-related factor (the side effects of the medication). This is closely followed by a condition-related factor (asymptomatic nature of the disease) then patient-related factors (forgetfulness and other causes). With this information, clinicians can implement relevant measures and allocate resources appropriately to minimise non-adherence.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ernest E Edifor","author_inst":"Manchester Metropolitan University"},{"author_name":"Regina Brown","author_inst":"University of Massachusetts Medical School"},{"author_name":"Paul Smith","author_inst":"Manchester Metropolitan University"},{"author_name":"Rick Kossik","author_inst":"GoldSim Technology Group"},{"author_name":"Svetlana Kudryavtseva","author_inst":"Clinical City Hospital named after I.V.

Objectives: Our aim was to describe bronchoscopy findings and analyse co-infection through bronchial aspirate (BA) samples in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring ICU admission. Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study, analysing the BA samples collected from intubated patients with COVID-19 to diagnose nosocomial respiratory infection. Results: One-hundred and fifty-five consecutive BA samples were collected from 75 patients. Of them, 90 (58%) were positive cultures for different microorganisms, 11 (7.1%) were polymicrobial, and 37 (23.7%) contained resistant microorganisms. There was a statistically significant association between increased days of orotracheal intubation (OTI) and positive BA (18.9 days versus 10.9 days, p<0.01), polymicrobial infection (22.11 versus 13.54, p<0.01) and isolation of resistant microorganisms (18.88 versus 10.94, p<0.01). In 88% of the cases a change in antibiotic treatment was made. Conclusion: Nosocomial respiratory infection in intubated COVID-19 patients seems to be higher than in non-epidemic periods.

With decreasing Influenza epidemic and upcoming SARS-CoV-2 infections we extended our study to the analysis of patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infections. 51 patients, 23m, 28f, aged 64 +\/- 16 years, were included in this study. Besides RT-PCR analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs all patients underwent MCC-IMS analysis of breath. 16 patients, 7m, 9f, were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. There was no difference in gender or age according to the groups. Stepwise canonical discriminant analysis could correctly classify the infected and non- infected subjects in 98% by cross-validation. Afterwards we combined the Influenza-A sub study and the SARS-CoV-2- sub study for a total of 75 patients, 34m, 41f, aged 64.8 +\/- 1.8 years, 14 positive for Influenza-A, 16 positive for SARS-CoV-2, the remaining 44 patients were used as controls. In one patient RT-PCR was highly suspicious of SARS-CoV-2 but inconclusive. There was no imbalance between the groups for age or gender. 97.3% of the patients could be correctly classified to the respective group by discriminant analysis. Even the inconclusive patient could be mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 group applying the discrimination function. Conclusion: MCC-IMS is able to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection and Influenza-A infection in breath. As this method provides exact, fast non-invasive diagnosis it should be further developed for screening of communicable viral diseases.

Methods: We conducted a population cohort study using linked data from adults attending public sector health facilities in the Western Cape, South Africa. We used Cox-proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, location and comorbidities to examine the association between HIV and COVID-19 death among (i) public sector 'active patients' (at least 1 health visit in the 3 years before March 2020), (ii) laboratory-diagnosed COVID-19 cases and (iii) hospitalized COVID-19 cases. COVID-19 was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests. We calculated the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for COVID-19 comparing HIV positive vs. negative adults using modelled population estimates. Results: Among 3,460,932 public sector patients (16% HIV positive), 22,308 were diagnosed with COVID-19, of whom 625 died. In adjusted analysis, HIV increased risk of COVID-19 mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]:2.14; 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.70; 2.70), with similar risks across strata of viral load and immunosuppression. increased HIV-associated risk of COVID-19 death remained when restricting to COVID-19 cases (aHR:1.70; 95%CI:132; 2.18) or hospitalized cases (aHR:1.45; 95%CI:1.14; 1.84). Current and previous tuberculosis also increased COVID-19 mortality risk (aHR [95%CI]:2.70 [1.81; 4.04] and 1.51 [1.18; 1.93] respectively). The SMR for COVID-19 death associated with HIV was 2.39 (95% CI:1.96; 2.86); population attributable fraction 8.5% (95%CI:6.1; 11.1). Conclusion: HIV was associated with a doubling of COVID-19 mortality risk. While our findings may over-estimate the HIV-associated risk COVID-19 death due to residual confounding, people with HIV should be considered a high-risk group for COVID-19 management.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"- Western Cape Department of Health with National Institute for Communicable Diseases, South Africa","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Mary-Ann Davies","author_inst":"University of Cape Town"},{"author_name":"Moataz Fathhy","author_inst":"Kasr-Alainy University Hospitals"},{"author_name":"Thomas Bollinger","author_inst":"Institute for Microbiology and Laboratory Medicine, Bayreuth General Hospital, Bayreuth, Germany"},{"author_name":"Maria Casadella Fontdevila","author_inst":"IrsiCaixa AIDS Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Rachid Tazi Mezalek","author_inst":"Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol"},{"author_name":"Fernando Armestar","author_inst":"Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol"},{"author_name":"Esther Fernandez Araujo","author_inst":"Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol"},{"author_name":"Felipe Andreo Garcia","author_inst":"Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol"},{"author_name":"Antoni Rosell Gratacos","author_inst":"Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol"},{"author_name":"Peter Sterk","author_inst":"Amsterdam University"},{"author_name":"Ratko Djukanovic","author_inst":"Southampton University"},{"author_name":"Ian Adcock","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Kian Fan Chung","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Adriana Seixas","author_inst":"Universidade Federal de Ciencias da Saude de Porto Alegre"},{"author_name":"Charley C.

Their convalescent plasma could be an inexpensive and widely available treatment for COVID-19. Methods The Convalescent-plasma-for-COVID (ConCOVID) study was a randomized trial comparing convalescent plasma with standard of care therapy in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in the Netherlands. Patients were randomized 1:1 and received 300ml of plasma with anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers of at least 1:80. The primary endpoint was day-60 mortality and key secondary endpoints were hospital stay and WHO 8-point disease severity scale improvement on day 15. Results The trial was halted prematurely after 86 patients were enrolled. Although symptomatic for only 10 days (IQR 6-15) at the time of inclusion, 53 of 66 patients tested had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at baseline. A SARS-CoV-2 plaque reduction neutralization test showed neutralizing antibodies in 44 of the 56 (79%) patients tested with median titers comparable to the 115 donors (1:160 vs 1:160, p=0.40). These observations caused concerns about the potential benefit of convalescent plasma in the study population and after discussion with the data safety monitoring board, the study was discontinued. No difference in mortality (p=0.95), hospital stay (p=0.68) or day-15 disease severity (p=0.58) was observed between plasma treated patients and patients on standard of care. Conclusion Most COVID-19 patients already have high neutralizing antibody titers at hospital admission. Screening for antibodies and prioritizing convalescent plasma to risk groups with recent symptom onset will be key to identify patients that may benefit from convalescent plasma.
