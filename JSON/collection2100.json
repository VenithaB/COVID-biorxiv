Researchers across the globe has been working in devising the strategies to combat this dreadful disease. Studies focused on genetic variability helps design effective drugs and vaccines. Considering this, the present study entails the information regarding the genome-wide mutations detected in the 108 SARS CoV-2 genomes worldwide. We identified a few hypervariable regions localized in orf1ab, spike, and nucleocapsid gene. These nucleotide polymorphisms demonstrated their effect on both codon usage as well as amino acid usage pattern. Altogether the present study provides valuable information that would be helpful to ongoing research on 2019-nCoV vaccine development.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Suruchi Gupta","author_inst":"CSIR- Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ravail Singh","author_inst":"CSIR- Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine"},{"author_name":"Prosenjit Paul","author_inst":"Negenome Bio Solutions"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"confirmatory results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.04.20168112","rel_title":"Seroprevalence of COVID-19 in Niger State","rel_date":"2020-08-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.04.20168112","rel_abs":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic is ongoing, and to know how far the virus has spread in Niger State, Nigeria, a pilot study was carried out to determine the COVID-19 seroprevalence, patterns, dynamics, and risk factors in the state. A cross sectional study design and clustered-stratified-Random sampling strategy were used. COVID-19 IgG and IgM Rapid Test Kits (Colloidal gold immunochromatography lateral flow system) were used to determine the presence or absence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in the blood of sampled participants across Niger State as from 26th June 2020 to 30th June 2020. The test kits were validated using the blood samples of some of the NCDC confirmed positive and negative COVID-19 cases in the State. COVID-19 IgG and IgM Test results were entered into the EPIINFO questionnaire administered simultaneously with each test. EPIINFO was then used for both the descriptive and inferential statistical analyses of the data generated. The seroprevalence of COVID-19 in Niger State was found to be 25.41% and 2.16% for the positive IgG and IgM respectively. Seroprevalence among age groups, gender and by occupation varied widely. A seroprevalence of 37.21% was recorded among health care workers in Niger State. Among age groups, COVID-19 seroprevalence was found to be in order of 30-41 years (33.33%) > 42-53 years (32.42%) > 54-65 years (30%) > 66 years and above (25%) > 6-17 years (19.20%) > 18-29 years (17.65%) > 5 years and below (6.66%). A seroprevalence of 27.18% was recorded for males and 23.17% for females in the state. COVID-19 asymptomatic rate in the state was found to be 46.81%. The risk analyses showed that the chances of infection are almost the same for both urban and rural dwellers in the state. However, health care workers and those that have had contact with person (s) that travelled out of Nigeria in the last six (6) months are twice ( 2 times) at risk of being infected with the virus. More than half (54.59%) of the participants in this study did not practice social distancing at any time since the pandemic started. Discussions about knowledge, practice and attitude of the participants are included. The observed Niger State COVID-19 seroprevalence means that the herd immunity for COVID-19 is yet to be achieved and the population is still susceptible for more infection and transmission of the virus. If the prevalence stays as reported here, the population will definitely need COVID-19 vaccines when they become available. Niger State should fully enforce the use of face\/nose masks and observation of social\/physical distancing in gatherings including religious gatherings in order to stop or slow the spread of the virus.","rel_num_authors":30,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hussaini Majiya","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Aliyu-Paiko","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Vincent Tochukwu Balogu","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Dickson Achimugu Musa","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Ibrahim Maikudi Salihu","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Abdullahi Abubakar Kawu","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Ishaq Yakubu Bashir","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Aishat Rabiu Sani","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"John Baba","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Amina Tako Muhammad","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Fatima Ladidi Jibril","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Ezekiel Bala","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Nuhu George Obaje","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Yahaya Badeggi Aliyu","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Ramatu Gogo Muhammad","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Hadiza Mohammed","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Usman Naji Gimba","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Abduljaleel Uthman","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Hadiza Muhammad Liman","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Sule Alfa Alhaji","author_inst":"General Hospital, Minna, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Joseph Kolo James","author_inst":"Niger State Ministry of Health, Minna, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Muhammad Muhammad Makusidi","author_inst":"Niger State Ministry of Health, Minna, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Danasabe Isah","author_inst":"General Hospital, Minna, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Ibrahim Abdullahi","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Umar Ndagi","author_inst":"IBB Specialised Hospital, Minna, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Bala Waziri","author_inst":"IBB Specialised Hospital, Minna, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Chindo Ibrahim Bisallah","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Naomi John Dadi-Mamud","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Kolo Ibrahim","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"},{"author_name":"Abu Kasim Adamu","author_inst":"Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, Nigeria"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.08.04.20167643","rel_title":"Comparative Evaluation of Three Serologic Assays for the Identification of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies","rel_date":"2020-08-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.08.04.20167643","rel_abs":"Background and aims Serologic assays for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies are being developed and approved rapidly with limited external validation. Accurate diagnostics are an essential component to pandemic management and public health. Materials and methods Residual serum samples (N=113) from patients who were evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 infection status by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were retrospectively tested in parallel across three automated SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays: Liaison SARS-CoV-2 S1\/S2 IgG, Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibody, and Access SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Results Testing of 51 PCR-positive and 62 PCR-negative patients demonstrated qualitative inter-test agreement of 96% overall, 100% in PCR-negative patients, 88% in early positive samples (0-13 days post positive PCR), and 100% in convalescent samples (14+ days post positive PCR). Calculated kappa values for paired inter-test agreement ranged 0.93-0.96. Compared to PCR, overall percent positive agreement ranged from 82-86% (100% for convalescent samples) and percent negative agreement was 100% for each assay. Conclusion This study demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy and inter-test agreement for three automated SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays. External validation of serologic assays is critical to ensure diagnostic accuracy and appropriate utilization of critical resources.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Keenan O.

Distinct clinical features in these patients have led to speculation that the immune response to virus in the SARS-CoV-2-infected alveolus differs from other types of pneumonia [2]. We collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from 86 patients with SARS-CoV-2-induced respiratory failure and 252 patients with known or suspected pneumonia from other pathogens and subjected them to flow cytometry and bulk transcriptomic profiling. We performed single cell RNA-Seq in 5 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples collected from patients with severe COVID-19 within 48 hours of intubation. In the majority of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection at the onset of mechanical ventilation, the alveolar space is persistently enriched in alveolar macrophages and T cells without neutrophilia. Bulk and single cell transcriptomic profiling suggest SARS-CoV-2 infects alveolar macrophages that respond by recruiting T cells. These T cells release interferon-gamma to induce inflammatory cytokine release from alveolar macrophages and further promote T cell recruitment. Our results suggest SARS-CoV-2 causes a slowly unfolding, spatially-limited alveolitis in which alveolar macrophages harboring SARS-CoV-2 transcripts and T cells form a positive feedback loop that drives progressive alveolar inflammation.\n\nThis manuscript is accompanied by an online resource: https:\/\/www.nupulmonary.org\/covid-19\/\n\nOne sentence summarySARS-CoV-2-infected alveolar macrophages form positive feedback loops with T cells in patients with severe COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":35,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rogan A Grant","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Luisa Morales-Nebreda","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Nikolay S Markov","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Suchitra Swaminathan","author_inst":"Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University;

Aim To evaluate a nurse-led Enhanced Care Home Team (ECHT) enhanced SARS-CoV-2 testing strategy. Design and setting Service evaluation in care homes in Norfolk UK. Method Residents and staff received nose and throat swab tests (7 April to 29 June 2020). Resident test results were linked with symptoms on days 0-14 after test and mortality to 13 July 2020. Results Residents (n=518) in 44 homes and staff (n=340) in 10 care homes were tested. SARS-CoV-2 positivity was identified in 103 residents in 14 homes and 49 staff in seven homes. Of 103 SARS-CoV-2+ residents, just 38 had typical symptom(s) at time of test (new cough and\/or fever). Amongst 54 residents who were completely asymptomatic when tested, 12 (22%) developed symptoms within 14 days. Compared to SARS-CoV-2 negative residents, SARS-CoV-2+ residents were more likely to exhibit typical symptoms (new cough (n=26, p=0.001); fever (n=24, p=<0.001)) or as generally-unwell (n=18, p=0.001). Of 38 resident deaths, 21 (55%) were initially attributed to SARS-CoV-2, all of whom tested SARS-CoV-2+. One death not initially attributed to SARS-CoV-2 also tested positive. Conclusion Testing identified asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2+ residents and staff. Being generally-unwell was common amongst symptomatic residents and may indicate SARS-CoV-2 infection in older people in the absence of more typical symptoms. Where a resident appears generally unwell SARS-CoV-2-infection should be suspected. Protocols for testing involved integrated health and social care teams.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emma Smith","author_inst":"NHS North Norfolk Primary Care"},{"author_name":"Clare F Aldus","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Julii Brainard","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Sharon Dunham","author_inst":"NHS North Norfolk Primary Care"},{"author_name":"Paul R Hunter","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Nicholas Steel","author_inst":"University of East Anglia"},{"author_name":"Paul Everden","author_inst":"NHS North Norfolk Primary Care"},{"author_name":"Alvaro Donayre","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Isaac A Goldberg","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Zasu M Klug","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Nicole Borkowski","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Ziyan Lu","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Hermon Kihshen","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Yuliya Politanska","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Lango Sichizya","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Mengjia Kang","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Ali Shilatifard","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University;

Although the capacity for recombination among Betacoronaviruses is well documented, SARS-CoV-2 has only been circulating in humans for approximately 8 months and thus has had a relatively short window of opportunity for the occurrence of recombination. The ability to detect recombination has further been limited by the relatively low levels of genetic diversity in SARS-CoV-2. Despite this, two studies have reported recombinants among SARS-CoV-2 strains. Here we first revisit these findings with a new analysis approach, arguing that neither presents a clear case of within-SARS-CoV-2 recombination. Applying this same approach to available SARS-CoV-2 sequences, we then identify five recombinant genomes. Each of these genomes contain phylogenetic markers of two distinct SARS-CoV-2 clades. Further, the predicted parent clades of these recombinant genomes were, with one exception, documented to be co-circulating in the country of infection in the two weeks prior to the sample being collected. Our results indicate that recombination among SARS-CoV-2 strains is occurring, but is either not widespread or often remains undetectable given current levels of viral genetic diversity.

Molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) forms the mainstay in screening, diagnosis and epidemiology of disease. The virus has been evolving through base substitutions. The recent availability of genomes of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from different countries including India motivated us to assess the presence and potential impact of variations in target sites for the oligonucleotide primers and probes used in molecular diagnosis. We catalogued a total of 132 primers or probes sequences from the literature and the public domain. Our analysis revealed a total of 125 unique genetic variants in 80 either primers or probes binding sites. A total of 13 unique variants had allele frequency of [&ge;] 1% in Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes mapped to the primers or probes binding sites. A total of 15 primers or probes binding sites had cumulative variant frequency of [&ge;] 1% in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes. These included primers or probes sites which are widely used in India and across the world for molecular diagnosis as well as approved by national and international agencies. This highlights the need for sequencing genomes of emerging pathogens to make evidence based policies for development and approval of diagnostics. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the most comprehensive analysis of genomic variants in genomes of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from India and their potential impact on efficacy of molecular diagnostics.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Abhinav Jain","author_inst":"CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB), Mathura Road, Delhi 110025, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Mercy Rophina","author_inst":"CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB), Mathura Road, Delhi 110025, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Saurabh Mahajan","author_inst":"St. Josephs College, Langford Gardens, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560027 INDIA"},{"author_name":"Bhavya Balaji Krishnan","author_inst":"Imperial College London, South Kensington, London SW7 2BU, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Manasa Sharma","author_inst":"Ramaiah University of Applied Sciences, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560054 INDIA"},{"author_name":"Sreya Mandal","author_inst":"St. Josephs College, Langford Gardens, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560027 INDIA"},{"author_name":"Teresa Fernandez","author_inst":"St. Josephs College, Langford Gardens, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560027 INDIA"},{"author_name":"Sumayra Sultanji","author_inst":"St. Josephs College, Langford Gardens, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560027 INDIA"},{"author_name":"Samatha Mathew","author_inst":"CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB), Mathura Road, Delhi 110025, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Sridhar Sivasubbu","author_inst":"CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB), Mathura Road, Delhi 110025, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Vinod Scaria","author_inst":"CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB), Mathura Road, Delhi 110025, INDIA"},{"author_name":"Ziyan Lu","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Hermon Kihshen","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Yuliya Politanska","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Lango Sichizya","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Mengjia Kang","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Ali Shilatifard","author_inst":"Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University;

Here, we describe the anti-COVID-19 potential of PTC299, an orally available compound that is a potent inhibitor of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), the rate-limiting enzyme of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway. In tissue culture, PTC299 manifests robust, dose-dependent, and DHODH-dependent inhibition of SARS CoV-2 replication (EC50 range, 2.0 to 31.6 nM) with a selectivity index >3,800. PTC299 also blocked replication of other RNA viruses, including Ebola virus. Consistent with known DHODH requirements for immunomodulatory cytokine production, PTC299 inhibited the production of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17A (also called IL-17), IL-17F, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in tissue culture models. The combination of anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, cytokine inhibitory activity, and previously established favorable pharmacokinetic and human safety profiles render PTC299 a promising therapeutic for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jeremy Luban","author_inst":"Program in Molecular Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA"},{"author_name":"Rachel Sattler","author_inst":"Department of Pathology, University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, Galveston, TX, 77555, USA"},{"author_name":"Elke Muhlberger","author_inst":"Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogen Readiness, Boston, MA, 02115, USA"},{"author_name":"Jason D.

Using an integrative strategy, we built a reference by meta-analyzing > 300,000 immune cells from COVID-19 and 5 inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohns disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), lupus, and interstitial lung disease. Our cross-disease analysis revealed that an FCN1+ inflammatory macrophage state is common to COVID-19 bronchoalveolar lavage samples, RA synovium, CD ileum, and UC colon. We also observed that a CXCL10+ CCL2+ inflammatory macrophage state is abundant in severe COVID-19, inflamed CD and RA, and expresses inflammatory genes such as GBP1, STAT1, and IL1B. We found that the CXCL10+ CCL2+ macrophages are transcriptionally similar to blood-derived macrophages stimulated with TNF- and IFN-{gamma} ex vivo. Our findings suggest that IFN-{gamma}, alongside TNF-, might be a key driver of this abundant inflammatory macrophage phenotype in severe COVID-19 and other inflammatory diseases, which may be targeted by existing immunomodulatory therapies.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lorien Shakib","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Sara Shanaj","author_inst":"Hospital for Special Surgery"},{"author_name":"Aparna Nathan","author_inst":"Harvard Medical School"},{"author_name":"- Accelerating Medicines Partnership Rheumatoid Arthritis and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus","author_inst":"-"},{"author_name":"Laura T.

Disease progressed in 16 patients, 11 (3.15%) were in intervention group as compared to 5 (3.35%) in control group, (P value = 0.865). PCR negativity in intervention and control groups were (day 7, 182 (52.1%) vs. 54 (35.7%) (P value = 0.001), (day 14, 244 (69.9%) vs. 110 (72.8%) (P value = 0.508). Consecutive PCR negativity at day 7 and 14 was observed in 240 (68.8%) in intervention group compared to 108 (71.5%) in control group. (P value = 0.231). Conclusion: Addition of HCQ to SOC in Mild COVID-19 neither stops disease progression nor help in early and sustained viral clearance.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"sultan mehmood kamran","author_inst":"Pak Emirates Military Hospital (PEMH) Rawalpindi"},{"author_name":"Zill e Humayun Mirza","author_inst":"Pak Emirates Military Hospital Rawalpindi, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Arshad Naseem","author_inst":"Pak Emirates Military Hospital Rawalpindi, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Farrukh Saeed","author_inst":"Pak Emirates Military Hospital Rawalpindi, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Rizwan Azam","author_inst":"Pak Emirates Military Hospital Rawalpindi, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Naqeeb Ullah","author_inst":"Pak Emirates Military Hospital Rawalpindi, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Wazir Ahmad","author_inst":"Pak Emirates Military Hospital Rawalpindi, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Salman Saleem","author_inst":"Pak Emirates Military Hospital Rawalpindi, Pakistan"},{"author_name":"Sinjini Sengupta","author_inst":"Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, Kolkata, India"},{"author_name":"Sandipan Roychaowdhary","author_inst":"Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, Kolkata, India"},{"author_name":"Jibak Bhattacharya","author_inst":"Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, Kolkata, India"},{"author_name":"Mahasin Gazi","author_inst":"Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, Kolkata, India"},{"author_name":"Arundhati De","author_inst":"Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, Kolkata, India"},{"author_name":"Kirubha George","author_inst":"Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, Kolkata, India"},{"author_name":"Tanmay Ghosh","author_inst":"Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, Kolkata, India"},{"author_name":"Jawade Akhter","author_inst":"Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, Kolkata, India"},{"author_name":"Sourav Mandal","author_inst":"Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, Kolkata, India"},{"author_name":"Rosalima Gupta","author_inst":"Woman Scientist C,  Patient Information Centre, Kolkata, India"},{"author_name":"Soumya Roy","author_inst":"AMRI Hospitals, Kolkata, India"},{"author_name":"Kanan Jassal","author_inst":"Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurgaon Haryana, India"},{"author_name":"Khushboo Rastogi","author_inst":"Manipal Hospitals, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Kanika Bansal","author_inst":"Manipal Hospitals, New Delhi"},{"author_name":"Prasanjit Chaterjee","author_inst":"Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, Kolkata, India"},{"author_name":"Litan Naha Biswas","author_inst":"Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, Kolkata, India"},{"author_name":"Shymasish Bondopadhay","author_inst":"Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, Kolkata, India"},{"author_name":"Anirudh Pradhan","author_inst":"GLA University, Mathura, UP, India"},{"author_name":"Bidhu Kalyan Mohanti","author_inst":"Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India"},{"author_name":"Hiam Abdala-Valencia","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Ankit Bharat","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University; Division of Thoracic Surgery, De"},{"author_name":"Cara J Gottardi","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"GR Scott Budinger","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Alexander V Misharin","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin D Singer","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University; Department of Biochemistry and M"},{"author_name":"Richard G Wunderink","author_inst":"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University; Simpson Querrey Center for Epige"},{"author_name":"- The NU SCRIPT Study Investigators","author_inst":"-"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.26.20154724","rel_title":"Interim Results of a Phase II\/III Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of AVIFAVIR in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-08-04","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.26.20154724","rel_abs":"In May 2020 the Russian Ministry of Health granted fast-track marketing authorization to RNA polymerase inhibitor AVIFAVIR (favipiravir) for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.

A previous report in 814 patients COVID-19 positive in Cuba provided preliminary therapeutic efficacy evidence with interferon alpha-2b (IFN alpha-2b) from March 11 to April 14, 2020. This study, re-evaluates the contribution of IFN-2b on the evolution of all patients, after 98 days of the epidemic, in a period from March 11 to June 17, 2020. Method A prospective observational study was implemented to monitor a therapeutic intervention with IFN alpha-2b used in the national protocol for COVID-19 attending in Cuba. Were included patients with positive throat swab specimens by real time RT-PCR who gave informed consent and had no contraindications for IFN treatment. Patients received therapy as per the Cuban COVID protocol that included a combination of oral antivirals (lopinavir\/ritonavir and chloroquine) with intramuscular or subcutaneous administration of IFN alpha-2b The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients discharged from hospital, secondary was the case fatality rate and several outcomes related to time variables were also evaluated. Results From March 11th until June 17th, 2295 patients had been confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive in Cuba, 2165 were treated with Heberon Alpha R and 130 received the approved protocol without IFN. The proportion of fully recovered patients was higher in the IFN-treated compared with non-IFN treated group. Prior IFN treatment decreases the likelihood of intensive care and increases the survival after severe or critical diseases. The benefits of IFN were significantly supported by time variables analyzed. Conclusions This second report confirm the preliminary evidences from first for the therapeutic effectiveness of IFN alpha-2b for SARS-Cov-2 infection and postulated that Heberon Alpha R is the main component within the antiviral triad used as a therapeutic intervention in the Cuban protocol COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ricardo Pereda","author_inst":"Medical college of Havana.

It posed a significant impact on different health services, including dermatology. Methods and objectives: Two online surveys were conducted to determine the prevalence of personal protective equipment-related skin complications (200 healthcare providers were included) and to demonstrate the outbreak s impact on dermatology practice (100 dermatologists were included). Results: In the first survey, the response rate was 72.46%. PPE- related dermatoses were reported by 147 (73%) participants, including frictional dermatitis (51.9%), mechanical acne (33.1%), contact dermatitis (29.9%), nonspecific rash (17.5%), urticaria (9.1%) and skin infections (3.2%). The response rate of the second survey was 64%. COVID-19 emerging cutaneous manifestations were recognized by 20% of dermatologists, including maculopapular rash (41.67%), urticaria (37.50%), chilblain (25%) and vasculitis (16.67). Telemedicine was provided by 73% of the dermatologists. The relapse rates of psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, rosacea, vitiligo and alopecia areata were noticeably increased as observed by 62%, 50%, 20%, and 4% of dermatologists, respectively. Most dermatologists (89%) reported minimal use of immunosuppressive drugs amid the pandemic. Conclusions: This article highlights the pivotal role of dermatologists in the leading edge during the current health crisis and how they adapt to these unfamiliar circumstances to meet the challenges. It documents the emergence of PPE-related dermatoses among healthcare providers and the impact of COVID-19 on different aspects of dermatology practice.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mohammed Shanshal","author_inst":"Baghdad Teaching Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hayder Saad Ahmed","author_inst":"University of Tikrit, College of Medicine, Department of Dermatology and Venereology"},{"author_name":"Hayder Asfoor","author_inst":"University of Kerbala, College of Medicine, Department of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Raad Ibrahim Salih","author_inst":"University of Tikrit, College of Medicine, Department of Dermatology and Venereology"},{"author_name":"Shehab Ahmed Ali","author_inst":"Al- iskandria Hospital, Department of Dermatology and Venereology"},{"author_name":"Yusif k.

However, the reasons behind this dichotomy have not been explained based on data or evidence, although some of the factors for the susceptibility of populations to SARS-CoV-2 infections have been proposed. We have taken into consideration all publicly available data and mined for the possible explanations in order to understand the reasons for this phenomenon. The data included many parameters including demography of nations, prevalence of communicable and non-communicable diseases, sanitation parameters etc. Results of our analyses suggest that demography, improved sanitation and hygiene, and higher incidence of autoimmune disorders as the most plausible factors to explain higher death rates in the richer countries Thus, the much debated hygiene hypothesis appears to lend credence to the Case Fatality Rate dichotomy between the rich and the poor countries.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Bithika Chatterjee","author_inst":"National Centre For Cell Sciences"},{"author_name":"Rajeeva Laxman Karandikar","author_inst":"Chennai Mathematical Institute"},{"author_name":"Shekhar C.

An age-structured multi-compartmental Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model was used to estimate infection spreads under parametric variation of lockdown intensity and duration from the data of SARS-CoV2 cases in India between January to July, 2020. The resulting parameter values were used to simulate lockdown outcomes for a wide range of start times and durations. Lockdowns were simulated as intervention strategies that modified weights assigned to social contact matrices for work, school and other places. Lockdown efficacy was assessed by the maximum number of infections recorded during a simulation run. Our analysis shows that lockdown outcomes depend sensitively on the timing of imposition and that it is possible to minimize lockdown durations while limiting case loads to numbers below the hospitalization thresholds. Such timing based effects arise naturally from the non-linear nature of SIR dynamics.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anagh Pathak","author_inst":"National Brain Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Varun Madan Mohan","author_inst":"National Brain Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Arpan Banerjee","author_inst":"National Brain Research Centre"},{"author_name":"Raad Ibrahim Salih","author_inst":"University of Tikrit, College of Medicine, Department of Dermatology and Venereology"},{"author_name":"Shehab Ahmed Ali","author_inst":"Al- iskandria Hospital, Department of Dermatology and Venereology"},{"author_name":"Yusif k.

Little is known about public knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors in relation to the pandemic in Nepal. This study aims to assess knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) towards COVID 19 among the general public and to identify associated factors. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between May to June 2020 with a sample of 645, recruited from 26 hospitals across Nepal. We conducted telephone interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire related to KAP regarding COVID 19. T-test and one-way ANOVA was conducted to determine group differences for socio-demographic variables. Linear regression and correlational analysis were performed to identify associated factors and measure the strength and direction of relationships. Results: Overall mean scores for knowledge, attitude and practice were 11.6 (SD 4.5), 2.7 (SD 1.8), and 9.9 (SD 1.93) respectively but differed by socio-demographic characteristics. Positive but weak linear correlations were observed between knowledge-practice (r=0.19, p<0.01) and attitude-practice (r=0.08, p<0.05). The relationship between knowledge and education was fairly strong (r = 0.34, p< 0.01). Province, place of residence, ecological area, age, gender, and caste\/ethnicity were also significantly associated with the KAP score of participants. Conclusion: The study found varying degrees of correlation between Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice that may increase as the pandemic evolves in Nepal. Knowledge and level of education had positive associations with attitude and adherence to precautionary measures. The findings suggest a need for targeted community awareness interventions for the most vulnerable populations, men, those with no school education, the elderly, and people living in rural areas.

We investigated the early transmission patterns of the virus and the outcomes of mitigation measures in the country. Methods We collected information from epidemiological surveillance, including contact tracing, and genetic data from SARS-CoV-2 whole genomes, of the first five weeks of the outbreak. These data were used to estimate the exponential growth rate, doubling time and the time-varying effective reproductive number (Rt) using date of symptom onset in a Bayesian framework. The time of most recent ancestor for the introduced and circulating lineages was estimated by Bayesian analysis. Findings A total of 4210 subjects were SARS-CoV-2 positive during the period evaluated, of them we sequenced 313 cases, detecting the circulation of 10 SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Whole genomes analysis identified the local transmission of one cryptic lineage as early as 2 weeks before it was detected by surveillance systems. Analysis of transmission dynamics showed that lockdown reduced Rt and increased the doubling time, however, these measures did not stop the circulation of this lineage in the country. Interpretation These results demonstrate the value of epidemiological modeling and genome surveillance to assess mitigation strategies. At the same time, an active search for cryptic transmission clusters is crucial to interrupt local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a region.","rel_num_authors":27,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Danilo Franco","author_inst":"Gorgas Memorial Institute of Health Studies, Panama City, Panama"},{"author_name":"Claudia Gonzalez","author_inst":"Gorgas Memorial Institute of Health Studies, Panama City, Panama"},{"author_name":"Leyda E Abrego","author_inst":"Gorgas Memorial Institute of Health Studies, Panama City, Panama"},{"author_name":"Jean P Carrera","author_inst":"Gorgas Memorial Institute of Health Studies, Panama City, Panama"},{"author_name":"Yamilka Diaz","author_inst":"Gorgas Memorial Institute of Health Studies, Panama City, Panama"},{"author_name":"Yaset Caisedo","author_inst":"Fundacion Valle del Lili.

At the time this clinical trial was planned, there were no available vaccine or therapeutic agents with proven efficacy, but the severity of the condition prompted the use of several pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. It has long been hypothesized that the use of convalescent plasma (CP) from infected patients who have developed an effective immune response is likely to be an option for the treatment of patients with a variety of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) of viral etiology. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma in adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods\/Design: The ConPlas-19 study is a multicenter, randomized, open-label controlled trial. The protocol has been prepared in accordance with the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) guidelines. The study has been planned to include 278 adult patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 infection not requiring mechanical ventilation (invasive or non-invasive). Subjects are randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio (139 per treatment arm), stratified by center, to receive intravenously administered CP (single infusion) plus SOC or SOC alone, and are to be followed for 30 days. The primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of patients that progress to categories 5, 6 or 7 (on the 7-point ordinal scale proposed by the WHO) at day 15. Interim analyses for efficacy and\/or futility will be conducted once 20%, 40%, and 60% of the planned sample size are enrolled and complete D15 assessment. Discussion: This clinical trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of passive immunotherapy with convalescent plasma for the treatment of adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The results of this study are expected to contribute to establishing the potential place of CP in the therapeutics for a new viral disease.

Prior data on seroprevalence have been subject to variations in selection of individuals and nature as well as timing of testing in relation to exposures. Objective: We sought to determine the extent of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalance and the factors associated with seroprevelance across a diverse cohort of healthcare workers. Design: Observational cohort study of healthcare workers, including SARS-CoV-2 serology testing and participant questionaires. Participants: A diverse and unselected population of adults (n=6,062) employed in a multi-site healthcare delivery system located in Los Angeles County, including individuals with direct patient contact and others with non-patient-oriented work functions. Exposure: Exposure and infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as determined by seropositivity. Main Outcomes: Using Bayesian and multi-variate analyses, we estimated seroprevalence and factors associated with seropositivity and antibody titers, including pre-existing demographic and clinical characteristics; potential Covid-19 illness related exposures; and, symptoms consistent with Covid-19 infection. Results: We observed a seroprevalence rate of 4.1%, with anosmia as the most prominently associated self-reported symptom in addition to fever, dry cough, anorexia, and myalgias. After adjusting for potential confounders, pre-existing medical conditions were not associated with antibody positivity. However, seroprevalence was associated with younger age, Hispanic ethnicity, and African-American race, as well as presence of either a personal or household member having a prior diagnosis of Covid-19. Importantly, African American race and Hispanic ethnicity were associated with antibody positivity even after adjusting for personal Covid-19 diagnosis status, suggesting the contribution of unmeasured structural or societally factors. Notably, number of people, or children, in the home was not associated with antibody positivity. Conclusion and Relevance: The demographic factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among our healthcare workers underscore the importance of exposure sources beyond the workplace. The size and diversity of our study population, combined with robust survey and modeling techniques, provide a vibrant picture of the demographic factors, exposures, and symptoms that can identify individuals with susceptibility as well as potential to mount an immune response to Covid-19.","rel_num_authors":39,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joseph Ebinger","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Gregory J.

Accurate clinical characterisation studies are essential to informing research, diagnosis and clinical management efforts, particularly early in a pandemic. In this scoping review we identify the clinical characteristics of patients admitted to hospital in the early months of the pandemic, focusing on symptoms, laboratory and imaging findings, and clinical outcomes. Methods: A scoping review. MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global Health databases were searched studies published from January 1st 2020 to April 28th 2020. Studies which reported on at least 100 hospitalised patients with covid-19 of any age were included. Results: Of 1,249 studies identified through the search 78 studies were eligible for inclusion; one randomized control trial and 77 observational studies presenting data on 77,443 patients admitted with covid-19. Most studies were conducted in China (82%), 9% in the US and 10% in Europe and two studies were set in more than one country. No studies included patients from low and middle income countries. Coagulopathy was underrecognised as a complication in the early months of the pandemic. Use of corticosteroids varied widely, and the use of anticoagulants was reported in only one study. Fever, cough and dyspnoea are less common in older adults; gastrointestinal symptoms, as the only presenting feature may be underrecognised. The most common laboratory finding was lymphocytopenia. Inflammatory biomarkers were commonly elevated, including C-reactive protein and interleukin-6. Typical computed tomography findings include bilateral infiltrates however imaging may be normal in early disease. Data on clinical characteristics in children and vulnerable populations were limited. Conclusions: Clinical characterisation studies from early in the pandemic indicated that covid-19 is a multisystem disease, with biomarkers indicating inflammation and coagulopathy. However, early data collection on symptoms and clinical outcomes did not consistently reflect this wide spectrum. Corticosteroid use varied widely, and anticoagulants were rarely used. Clinicians should remain vigilant to the possibility of covid-19 in patients presenting without fever, cough and dyspnoea, particularly in older adults. Further characterisation studies in different at-risk populations is needed.

Group testing could be a promising candidate for screening to save time and resources. However, due to the high false-negative rate (FNR) of the RT-PCR diagnostic test, we should be cautious about using group testing because a group's false-negative result identifies all the individuals in a group as uninfected. Repeating the test is the best solution to reduce the FNR, and repeats should be integrated with the group-testing method to increase the sensitivity of the test. The simplest way is to replicate the test twice for each group (the 2Rgt method). In this paper, we present a new method for group testing (the groupMix method), which integrates two repeats in the test. Then we introduce the adaptive version of both the groupMix and the 2Rgt methods. We compare these methods analytically regarding the sensitivity and the average number of tests. The tradeoff between the sensitivity and the average number of tests should be considered when choosing the best method for the screening strategy. We applied the non-adaptive groupMix method to screening 263 people and identified 2 infected individuals by performing 98 tests. This method achieved a 63% saving in the number of tests compared to individual testing. This method is currently applied to COVID-19 screening in the Clinical Genetic Laboratory at the Royan Institute, Tehran, Iran. Our experimental results show that in COVID-19 screening, the viral load can be low, and the group size should not be more than 6; otherwise, the FNR increases significantly. A web interface of the non-adaptive groupMix method is publicly available for laboratories to implement this method.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amir Reza Alizad-Rahvar","author_inst":"School of Biological Sciences, The Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences (IPM), Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Safar Vafadar","author_inst":"Laboratory of Biological Complex Systems and Bioinformatics (CBB), Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Mehdi Totonchi","author_inst":"Department of Genetics, Royan Institute for Reproductive Biomedicine, ACECR, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Mehdi Sadeghi","author_inst":"National Institute for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Tehran, Iran"},{"author_name":"Blake Thomson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Mark G Pritchard","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Peter G Bannister","author_inst":"Brighton and Sussex Medical School"},{"author_name":"Louise Sigfrid","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Tom Solomon","author_inst":"University of Liverpool"},{"author_name":"Peter W Horby","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Gail Carson","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Piero L Olliaro","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Mir Henglin","author_inst":"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Shehnaz K.

This central role for T cells makes them a desirable target for assessing the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we combined two high-throughput immune profiling methods to create a quantitative picture of the T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2. First, at the individual level, we deeply characterized 3 acutely infected and 58 recovered COVID-19 subjects by experimentally mapping their CD8 T-cell response through antigen stimulation to 545 Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class I presented viral peptides (class II data in a forthcoming study). Then, at the population level, we performed T-cell repertoire sequencing on 1,815 samples (from 1,521 COVID-19 subjects) as well as 3,500 controls to identify shared \"public\" T-cell receptors (TCRs) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection from both CD8 and CD4 T cells. Collectively, our data reveal that CD8 T-cell responses are often driven by a few immunodominant, HLA-restricted epitopes. As expected, the T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 peaks about one to two weeks after infection and is detectable for at least several months after recovery. As an application of these data, we trained a classifier to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection based solely on TCR sequencing from blood samples, and observed, at 99.8% specificity, high early sensitivity soon after diagnosis (Day 3-7 = 85.1% [95% CI = 79.9-89.7]; Day 8-14 = 94.8% [90.7-98.4]) as well as lasting sensitivity after recovery (Day 29+\/convalescent = 95.4% [92.1-98.3]). These results demonstrate an approach to reliably assess the adaptive immune response both soon after viral antigenic exposure (before antibodies are typically detectable) as well as at later time points. This blood-based molecular approach to characterizing the cellular immune response has applications in clinical diagnostics as well as in vaccine development and monitoring.","rel_num_authors":56,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thomas M Snyder","author_inst":"Adaptive Biotechnologies"},{"author_name":"Rachel M Gittelman","author_inst":"Adaptive

spread of COVID-19 in community is use of face mask. Though the debate is going on regarding the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 it makes reasonable point for universal use of face masks. A large variety of face masks are available in the market or people can make their own using household items. The efficacy of masks depends upon the type of cloth and number of layers of the cloth. Material and methods: We have created an innovative mask with two layers of cotton and an impervious layer. The impervious layer made from polypropylene coated with polyurethane was applied on the outer side in the middle half of the mask in front of mouth and nose. The efficacy of this test mask was measured against N95FFR (reference standard), triple layer surgical masks and single layer cotton mask. A manikin was used wearing these masks\/respirator and aerosols\/droplets of diluted red colored carbol fuchsin and fluorescent Auramine O were sprayed from distance of 1m and 2m. We also tested use of face shield. Both macroscopic and microscopic examination of the dissected masks and respirator was performed. Results: The N95FFR was able to block the aerosols\/droplets by its front layer. One triple layer surgical mask showed microscopic presence of stain in its innermost layer while the other blocked it with middle layer. The single layer cotton mask was not able to protect as we observed stain on the face itself. The test mask blocked most of the stain on impervious layer and also on the front cotton layer on lateral sides, where impervious layer was absent. When fluorescent stain was used, ultraviolet examination demonstrated that the whole area covered by test mask was clean while the other non covered area was fluorescent. Conclusion: We believe that our innovation can be used in the community as well as in general areas of the hospital like, offices, labs, etc. and can be a better alternative to single use triple layer surgical masks. Further testing may be done by other organizations to rule out bias in our study.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Priyanka L Shahane-Kapse","author_inst":"Mahatma Gandhi Institute

occurred in late February 2020, with subsequent outbreaks occurring in the populous Portland metro area but also with significant outbreaks in less-populous and rural areas. Here we report viral sequences from 188 patients across the hospitals and associated clinics in the Providence Health System in the State of Oregon dating back to the early days of the outbreak. We show a significant shift in dominant clade lineages over time in Oregon, with the rapid emergence and dominance of Spike D614G-positive variants. We also highlight significant diversity in SARS-CoV-2 sequences in Oregon, including a large number of rare mutations, indicative that these genomes could be utilized for outbreak tracing. Lastly, we show that SARS-CoV-2 genomic information may offer additional utility in combination with clinical covariates in the prediction of acute disease phenotypes.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Alexa K.

The quality and acceptability of self-collected nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) is unknown. Objective: To estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and to assess the acceptability of self-collected NPS among HCW. Design: Cross-sectional convenience sample enrolled between April 20th and June 24th, 2020. We had >95% power to detect at least one positive test if the true underlying prevalence of SARS-CoV2 was > 1%. Setting: The metropolitan area surrounding Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota. Participants: HCW free of self-reported upper respiratory symptoms were recruited. Exposures: Participants completed questionnaires regarding demographics, household characteristics, personal protective equipment (PPE) utilization and comorbidities. Outcomes: A participant self-collected nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) was obtained. SARS-CoV-2 infection was assessed via polymerase chain reaction. NPS discomfort was assessed on a scale of 1 (no discomfort) - 10 (extreme discomfort). NPS duration and depth into the nasopharynx, and willingness to perform future self-collections were assessed. Results: Among n=489 participants 80% were female and mean age+\/-SD was 41+\/-11. Participants reported being physicians (14%), nurse practitioners (8%), physicians assistants (4%), nurses (51%), medics (3%), or other which predominantly included laboratory technicians and administrative roles (22%). Exposure to a known\/suspected COVID-19 case in the 14 days prior to enrollment was reported in 40% of participants. SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in any participant. The mean+\/-SD discomfort level of the NPS was 4.5+\/-2.0. 95% of participants reported that their self-swab was longer than or equal to the duration of patient swabs they had previously performed, and 89% reported the depth to be deeper than or equal to the depth of previous patient swabs. Over 95% of participants reported a willingness to repeat a self-collected NP swab in the future. Conclusions and Relevance: The point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was likely very low in symptom-free Minnesota healthcare workers from April 20th and June 24th, 2020. Self-collected NP swabs are well-tolerated and a viable alternative to provider-collected swabs to preserve PPE.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ryan T.
