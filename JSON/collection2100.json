Design: Retrospective cohort study, enrollment from March 24 to May 26, 2020 with follow-up calls until hospitalization or clinical improvement (final calls until June 19, 2020) Setting: Single center telemedicine program managing outpatients from a large medical system in Atlanta, Georgia Participants: 496 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in isolation at home. Exclusion criteria included: (1) hospitalization prior to telemedicine program enrollment, (2) immediate discharge with no follow-up calls due to resolution. Exposure: Acute COVID-19 illness Main Outcome and Measures: Hospitalization was the outcome. Days to hospitalization was the metric. Survival analysis using Cox regression was used to determine factors associated with hospitalization. Results: The risk-assessment rubric assigned 496 outpatients to risk tiers as follows: Tier 1, 237 (47.8%); Tier 2, 185 (37.3%); Tier 3, 74 (14.9%). Subsequent hospitalizations numbered 3 (1%), 15 (7%), and 17 (23%) and for Tiers 1-3, respectively. From a Cox regression model with age [&ge;] 60, gender, and self-reported obesity as covariates, the adjusted hazard ratios using Tier 1 as reference were: Tier 2 HR=3.74 (95% CI, 1.06-13.27; P=0.041); Tier 3 HR=10.87 (95% CI, 3.09-38.27; P<0.001). Tier was the strongest predictor of time to hospitalization. Conclusions and Relevance: A telemedicine risk assessment tool prospectively applied to an outpatient population with COVID-19 identified both low-risk and high-risk patients with better performance than individual risk factors alone. This approach may be appropriate for optimum allocation of resources.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"James B O'Keefe","author_inst":"Emory University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Elizabeth J Tong","author_inst":"Emory University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Thomas H Taylor Jr.","author_inst":"Taylor Engineering, Inc."},{"author_name":"Ghazala D Datoo O'Keefe","author_inst":"Emory University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"David C Tong","author_inst":"Emory University School of Medicine"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.21.20159335","rel_title":"Model-free estimation of COVID-19 transmission dynamics from a complete outbreak","rel_date":"2020-07-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.21.20159335","rel_abs":"Background New Zealand had 1499 cases of COVID-19 before eliminating transmission of the virus. Extensive contract tracing during the outbreak has resulted in a dataset of epidemiologically linked cases. This data contains useful information about the transmission dynamics of the virus, its dependence on factors such as age, and its response to different control measures. Method We use Monte-Carlo network construction techniques to provide an estimate of the number of secondary cases for every individual infected during the outbreak. We then apply standard statistical techniques to quantify differences between groups of individuals. Findings Children under 10 years old are significantly under-represented in the case data. Children infected fewer people on average and had a lower secondary attack rate in comparison to adults and the elderly. Imported cases infected fewer people on average and had a lower secondary attack rate than domestically acquired cases. Superspreading is a significant contributor to the epidemic dynamics, with 20% of cases among adults responsible for 65-85% of transmission. Asymptomatic cases infected fewer individuals than clinical cases. Serial intervals are approximately normally distributed (=5.0 days, {sigma}=5.7 days). Early isolation and quarantine of cases reduced secondary transmission rates. Interpretation Border controls and strong social distancing measures, particularly when targeted at superspreading, play a significant role in reducing the spread of COVID-19.

Potential explanations (e.g., warmer environments [1], younger populations [2,3,4]) have yet to be framed within a comprehensive analysis accounting for factors that may offset the effects of climate and demography. Here, we synthesize factors hypothesized to shape the pace of this pandemic and its burden as it moves across SSA, encompassing demographic, comorbidity, climatic, healthcare and intervention capacity, and human mobility dimensions of risk. We find large scale diversity in probable drivers, such that outcomes are likely to be highly variable among SSA countries. While simulation shows that extensive climatic variation among SSA population centers has little effect on early outbreak trajectories, heterogeneity in connectivity is likely to play a large role in shaping the pace of viral spread. The prolonged, asynchronous outbreaks expected in weakly connected settings may result in extended stress to health systems. In addition, the observed variability in comorbidities and access to care will likely modulate the severity of infection: We show that even small shifts in the infection fatality ratio towards younger ages, which are likely in high risk settings, can eliminate the protective effect of younger populations. We highlight countries with elevated risk of slow pace, high burden outbreaks. Empirical data on the spatial extent of outbreaks within SSA countries, their patterns in severity over age, and the relationship between epidemic pace and health system disruptions are urgently needed to guide efforts to mitigate the high burden scenarios explored here.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Benjamin L Rice","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Akshaya V Annapragada","author_inst":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rachel E.

However, the factors determining whether or not pneumonia develops remain to be fully uncovered. We therefore explored the associations of several lifestyle factors with signs of pneumonia in COVID-19. Methods Between May and July 2020, we conducted an online survey of 201 adults in Germany who had recently gone through COVID-19, predominantly as outpatients. Of these, 165 had a PCR-based diagnosis and 36 had a retrospective diagnosis by antibody testing. The survey covered demographic information, eight lifestyle factors, comorbidities and medication use. We defined the main outcome as the presence vs. the absence of signs of pneumonia, represented by dyspnea, the requirement for oxygen therapy or intubation. Results Signs of pneumonia occurred in 39 of the 165 individuals with a PCR-based diagnosis of COVID-19 (23.6%). Among the lifestyle factors examined, only overweight\/obesity associated with signs of pneumonia (odds ratio 2.68 (1.29 - 5.59) p=0.008). The observed association remained significant after multivariate adjustment, with BMI as a metric variable, and also after including the antibody-positive individuals into the analysis. Conclusions This exploratory study finds an association of overweight\/obesity with signs of pneumonia in COVID-19. This finding suggests that a signal proportional to body fat mass, such as the hormone leptin, impairs the body's ability to clear SARS-CoV-2 before pneumonia develops. This hypothesis concurs with previous work and should be investigated further to possibly reduce the proportion of severe cases of COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vanessa Sacco","author_inst":"LMU Klinikum"},{"author_name":"Barbara Rauch","author_inst":"LMU Klinikum"},{"author_name":"Christina Gar","author_inst":"LMU Klinikum"},{"author_name":"Stefanie Haschka","author_inst":"LMU Klinikum"},{"author_name":"Anne L Potzel","author_inst":"LMU Klinikum"},{"author_name":"Stefanie Kern-Matschilles","author_inst":"LMU Klinikum"},{"author_name":"Friederike Banning","author_inst":"LMU Klinikum"},{"author_name":"Irina Benz","author_inst":"LMU Klinikum"},{"author_name":"Mandy Meisel","author_inst":"LMU Klinikum"},{"author_name":"Jochen Seissler","author_inst":"LMU Klinikum"},{"author_name":"Andreas Lechner","author_inst":"LMU Klinikum"},{"author_name":"Tanjona Ramiadantsoa","author_inst":"University of Fianarantsoa"},{"author_name":"Fidisoa Rasambainarivo","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Weiyu Yu","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"B.T.

Many scientists have struggled to make forecasts about its impact. Especially, appropriate preparations for a second wave are needed not to move in a costly panic mode again. It is necessary to get ideas about worst case scenarios regarding incidences, hospitalization, or use of ICU resources. They can be described in terms of extreme quantiles (95%, 99%, 99.9%) of specific distributions that supposedly formalize the data mechanism behind future observations. Therefore, distributional issues do matter. Cirillo and Taleb argue that a natural and empirically correct framework for assessing and managing real risk in pandemics is provided by extreme value theory dealing with extrema and not averages. We explore this idea in more detail. In this paper we discuss the fat-tail patterns in the distribution of the global COVID-19 data by analyzing data from 66 countries worldwide. We also explore their relevance at a lower, regional scale perspective (national, federal state), which is in our opinion more relevant for planning measures against the epidemic spread. For this we analyze data from the German federal state of Bavaria. We conclude that fat-tail patterns are seen in global data, possibly reflecting the respective heterogeneity between different countries regarding incidences and fatalities during the ongoing epidemic. However, the disease activity at regional level seems to be better described by classical Poisson based models. To bridge the gap between regional and global phenomena we refer to mixtures of slim-tail distributions that may create fat-tail features. Especially in the beginning of a pandemic acting according to the \"better safe than sorry\" principle and taking extreme forecasts as the basis for the decisions might be justified. However, as the pandemic continues and control measures are partially lifted, there is a need for a careful discussion how to choose relevant distributions and their respective quantiles for future resource planning in order not to cause more harm as the pandemic itself.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kirsi Manz","author_inst":"Ludwig Maximilians University Munich"},{"author_name":"Ulrich Mansmann","author_inst":"Ludwig Maximilians University Munich"},{"author_name":"Christina Gar","author_inst":"LMU Klinikum"},{"author_name":"Stefanie Haschka","author_inst":"LMU Klinikum"},{"author_name":"Anne L Potzel","author_inst":"LMU Klinikum"},{"author_name":"Stefanie Kern-Matschilles","author_inst":"LMU Klinikum"},{"author_name":"Friederike Banning","author_inst":"LMU Klinikum"},{"author_name":"Irina Benz","author_inst":"LMU Klinikum"},{"author_name":"Mandy Meisel","author_inst":"LMU Klinikum"},{"author_name":"Jochen Seissler","author_inst":"LMU Klinikum"},{"author_name":"Andreas Lechner","author_inst":"LMU Klinikum"},{"author_name":"Tanjona Ramiadantsoa","author_inst":"University of Fianarantsoa"},{"author_name":"Fidisoa Rasambainarivo","author_inst":"Princeton University"},{"author_name":"Weiyu Yu","author_inst":"University of Southampton"},{"author_name":"B.T.

In extreme situations, patients develop a dysregulated inflammatory lung injury called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that causes progressive respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilatory support. Recent studies have demonstrated immunologic dysfunction in severely ill COVID-19 patients. To further delineate the dysregulated immune response driving more severe clinical course from SARS-CoV-2 infection, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to analyze the transcriptome of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from hospitalized COVID-19 patients having mild disease (n = 5), developing ARDS (n = 6), and recovering from ARDS (n = 6). Our data demonstrated an overwhelming inflammatory response with select immunodeficiencies within various immune populations in ARDS patients. Specifically, their monocytes had defects in antigen presentation and deficiencies in interferon responsiveness that contrasted the higher interferon signals in lymphocytes. Furthermore, cytotoxic activity was suppressed in both NK and CD8 lymphocytes whereas B cell activation was deficient, which is consistent with the delayed viral clearance in severely ill COVID-19 patients. Finally, we identified altered signaling pathways in the severe group that suggests immunosenescence and immunometabolic changes could be contributing to the dysfunctional immune response. Our study demonstrates that COVID-19 patients with ARDS have an immunologically distinct response when compared to those with a more innocuous disease course and show a state of immune imbalance in which deficiencies in both the innate and adaptive immune response may be contributing to a more severe disease course in COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Changfu Yao","author_inst":"Cedars Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Stephanie A Bora","author_inst":"Cedars Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Tanyalak Parimon","author_inst":"Cedars Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Tanzira Zaman","author_inst":"Cedars Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Oren A Friedman","author_inst":"Cedars Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Joseph A Palatinus","author_inst":"Cedars Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Nirmala S Surapaneni","author_inst":"Cedars Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yuri P Matusov","author_inst":"Cedars Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Giuliana Cerro Chiang","author_inst":"Cedars Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Alexander G Kassar","author_inst":"Cedars Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Nayan Patel","author_inst":"Cedars Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Chelsi ER Green","author_inst":"Cedars Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Adam W Aziz","author_inst":"Cedars Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Harshpreet Suri","author_inst":"Cedars Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jo Suda","author_inst":"Cedars Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Andres A Lopez","author_inst":"Cedars Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Gislaine A Martins","author_inst":"Cedars Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Barry R Stripp","author_inst":"Cedars Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Sina A Gharib","author_inst":"University of Washington Seattle"},{"author_name":"Helen S Goodridge","author_inst":"Cedars Sinai Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Peter Chen","author_inst":"Cedars Sinai Medical Center"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.23.217083","rel_title":"An in-silico study on SARS-CoV-2: Its compatibility with human tRNA pool, and the polymorphism arising in a single lineage over a month","rel_date":"2020-07-24","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.23.217083","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic that has costed enormous human lives in the recent past. The present study is an investigation of the viral codon adaptation, ORFs stability and tRNA co-adaptation with humans. We observed that for the codon usage bias in viral ssRNA, ORFs have near values of folding free energies and codon adaptation index with mRNAs of the human housekeeping CDS. However, the correlation between the stability of the ORFs in ssRNA and CAI is stronger than the mRNA stability and CAI of HKG, suggesting a greater expression capacity of SARS-CoV-2. Mutational analysis reflects polymorphism in the virus for ORF1ab, surface glycoprotein and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein ORFs. Non-synonymous mutations have shown non-polar substitutions. Out of the twelve mutations nine are for a higher t-RNA copy number. Viruses in general have high mutation rates. To understand the chances of survival for the mutated SARS-CoV-2 we did simulation for synonymous mutations. It resulted in 50% ORFs with higher stability than their native equivalents. Thus, considering only the synonymous mutations the virus can exhibit a lot of polymorphism. Collectively our data provides new insights for SARS-CoV-2 mutations and the human t-RNA compatibility.\n\nSignificanceSurvivability of SARS-CoV-2 in humans is essential for its spread. It has overlapping genes exhibiting a high codon optimization with humans even after a higher codon usage bias. They seem to possess cognizance for high copy number t-RNA (cognate or near-cognate) in humans, while mutating. Even though, it has been well established that native transcripts posses the highest stability, our in-silico studies show that SARS-CoV-2 under mutations give rise to ORFs with higher stability. These results significantly present the viruss ability and the credibility of survival for the mutants. Despite its focus on a geographical location it explains the ongoing behavior of SARS-CoV-2 for a steady existence in humans as all the different lineages have a common origin.

We undertook a literature review of published studies\/data on detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in contacts of COVID-19 cases, as well as serological studies, and studies of infections in the school setting to examine those issues. Results: Our literature review presents evidence for significantly lower susceptibility to infection for children aged under 10 years compared to adults given the same exposure, for elevated susceptibility to infection in adults aged over 60y compared to younger\/middle aged adults, and for the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection associated with sleeping close to an infected individual. Published serological studies also suggest that younger adults (particularly those aged under 35y) often have high cumulative rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community. Additionally, there is some evidence of robust spread of SARS-CoV-2 in secondary\/high schools, and there appears to be more limited spread in primary schools. Some countries with relatively large class sizes in primary schools (e.g. Chile and Israel) reported sizeable outbreaks in some of those schools, though routes of transmission of infection to both students and staff are not clear from current reports. Conclusions: Opening secondary\/high schools is likely to contribute to the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and, if implemented, it should require both lower levels of community transmission and greater safeguards to reduce transmission. Compared to secondary\/high schools, opening primary schools and daycare facilities may have a more limited effect on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the community, particularly under smaller class sizes and in the presence of mitigation measures.

By using several experimental approaches, we investigated the potential association between SARS-CoV-2 IgGs recognizing the spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), neutralizing antibodies (NtAb) targeting S, and COVID-19 severity. Patients and Methods: This unicenter, retrospective, observational study included 51 hospitalized patients (24 at the intensive care unit; ICU). A total of 93 sera from these patients collected at different time points from the onset of symptoms were analyzed. SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgGs were quantitated by ELISA and NtAb50 titers were measured in a GFP reporter-based pseudotyped virus platform. Demographic and clinical data, complete blood counts, as well as serum levels of ferritin, Dimer-D, C reactive protein (CRP), lactose dehydrogenase (LDH), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were retrieved from clinical charts. Results: The overall correlation between levels of both antibody measurements was good (Rho=0.79; P=0<0.001). SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG and NtAb50 levels in sera collected up to day 30 after the onset of symptoms were comparable between ICU and non-ICU patients (P=>0.1). The percentage of patients who exhibited high NtAb50 titers ([&ge;]160) was similar (P=0.20) in ICU (79%) and non-ICU (60%) patients. Four ICU patients died; two of these achieved NtAb50 titers [&ge;]1\/160 while the other two exhibited a 1\/80 titer. Very weak (Rho=>0.0-<0.2) or weak (Rho=>0.2-<0.4) correlations were observed between anti-RBD IgGs, NtAb50, and serum levels pro-inflammatory biomarkers.

Cytotoxic T-cell, helper T-cell, and B-cell epitopes were computationally predicted from six conserved protein sequences among four viral strains isolated across the world. The T-cell epitopes, overlapping with the B-cell epitopes, were included in the vaccine construct to assure the humoral and cell-mediated immune response. The beta-subunit of cholera toxin was added as an adjuvant at the N-terminal of the construct to increase immunogenicity. Interferon-gamma inducing epitopes were even predicted in the vaccine. Molecular docking and binding energetics studies revealed strong interactions of the vaccine with immune-stimulatory toll-like receptors (TLR) -2, 3, 4. Molecular dynamics simulation of the vaccine ensured in vivo stability in the biological system. The immune simulation of vaccine evinced elevated immune response. The efficient translation of the vaccine in an expression vector was assured utilizing in silico cloning approach.

Through determining the transcriptional profiles of immune cells, coupled with assembled T cell receptor and B cell receptor sequences, we analyzed the functional properties of immune cells. Most cell types in COVID-19 patients showed a strong interferon-alpha response, and an overall acute inflammatory response. Moreover, intensive expansion of highly cytotoxic effector T cell subsets, such as CD4+ Effector-GNLY (Granulysin), CD8+ Effector-GNLY and NKT CD160, was associated with convalescence in moderate patients. In severe patients, the immune landscape featured a deranged interferon response, profound immune exhaustion with skewed T cell receptor repertoire and broad T cell expansion. These findings illustrate the dynamic nature of immune responses during the disease progression.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fu-Sheng Wang","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ji-Yuan Zhang","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiangming Wang","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Xudong Xing","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Zhe Xu","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chao Zhang","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jin-Wen Song","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xing Fan","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Peng Xia","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jun-Liang Fu","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Si-Yu Wang","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ruo-Nan Xu","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Peng Dai","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Shi","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Huang","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tian-Jun Jiang","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ming Shi","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuxia Zhang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Alimuddin Zumla","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Markus Maeurer","author_inst":"Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown"},{"author_name":"Fan Bai","author_inst":"Peking University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"immunology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.24.217570","rel_title":"Adopting STING agonist cyclic dinucleotides as a potential adjuvant for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine","rel_date":"2020-07-24","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.24.217570","rel_abs":"A novel STING agonist CDGSF unilaterally modified with phosphorothioate and fluorine was synthesized.

Thanks to the scientific communitys unprecedented efforts, the atomic structure of several viral proteins has been promptly resolved. As the crucial mediator of host cell infection, the heavily glycosylated trimeric viral Spike protein (S) has been attracting the most attention and is at the center of efforts to develop antivirals, vaccines, and diagnostic solutions.\n\nHerein, we use an energy-decomposition approach to identify antigenic domains and antibody binding sites on the fully glycosylated S protein. Crucially, all that is required by our method are unbiased atomistic molecular dynamics simulations; no prior knowledge of binding properties or ad hoc combinations of parameters\/measures extracted from simulations is needed. Our method simply exploits the analysis of energy interactions between all intra-protomer aminoacid and monosaccharide residue pairs, and cross-compares them with structural information (i.e., residueresidue proximity), identifying potential immunogenic regions as those groups of spatially contiguous residues with poor energetic coupling to the rest of the protein.\n\nOur results are validated by several experimentally confirmed structures of the S protein in complex with anti- or nanobodies. We identify poorly coupled sub-domains: on the one hand this indicates their role in hosting (several) epitopes, and on the other hand indicates their involvement in large functional conformational transitions. Finally, we detect two distinct behaviors of the glycan shield: glycans with stronger energetic coupling are structurally relevant and protect underlying peptidic epitopes; those with weaker coupling could themselves be poised for antibody recognition. Predicted Immunoreactive regions can be used to develop optimized antigens (recombinant subdomains, synthetic (glyco)peptidomimetics) for therapeutic applications.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stefano Serapian","author_inst":"University of Pavia, Department of Chemistry"},{"author_name":"Filippo Marchetti","author_inst":"University of Pavia"},{"author_name":"Alice Triveri","author_inst":"University of Pavia"},{"author_name":"Giulia Morra","author_inst":"SCITEC-CNR"},{"author_name":"Massimiliano Meli","author_inst":"SCITEC-CNR"},{"author_name":"Elisabetta Moroni","author_inst":"SCITEC-CNR"},{"author_name":"Giuseppe A Sautto","author_inst":"University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Andrea Rasola","author_inst":"University of Padova"},{"author_name":"Giorgio Colombo","author_inst":"University of Pavia"},{"author_name":"Jun-Liang Fu","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Si-Yu Wang","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ruo-Nan Xu","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Peng Dai","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Shi","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Huang","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tian-Jun Jiang","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ming Shi","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuxia Zhang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Alimuddin Zumla","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Markus Maeurer","author_inst":"Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown"},{"author_name":"Fan Bai","author_inst":"Peking University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.24.217562","rel_title":"Identification, Mapping and Relative Quantitation of SARS-Cov2 Spike Glycopeptides by Mass-Retention Time Fingerprinting","rel_date":"2020-07-24","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.24.217562","rel_abs":"We describe a novel analytical method for rapid and robust identification, mapping and relative quantitation of glycopeptides from SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein.

While this separation technique resolves peptides with high efficiency, glycans are resolved poorly, if at all. Consequently, glycopeptides consisting of the same peptide bearing different glycan structures will all possess very similar retention times and co-elute. While this has previously been viewed as a disadvantage, we show that shared retention time can be used to map multiple glycan species to the same peptide and location. In combination with MSMS and pseudo MS3, we have constructed a detailed mass-retention time database for Spike. This database allows any ESI-TOF equipped lab to reliably identify and quantify spike glycans from a single overnight elastase protein digest in less than 90 minutes.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Rod Chalk","author_inst":"Centre for Medicines Discovery, ORCRB, Oxford University, OX3 7DQ, UK"},{"author_name":"William Greenland","author_inst":"Agilent Technologies, Lakeside, Cheadle Royal Business Park, Cheadle, Cheshire, SK8 3GR, UK"},{"author_name":"Tiago Moreira","author_inst":"Centre for Medicines Discovery, ORCRB, Oxford University, OX3 7DQ, UK"},{"author_name":"Jesse Coker","author_inst":"Centre for Medicines Discovery, ORCRB, Oxford University, OX3 7DQ, UK"},{"author_name":"Shubhashish Mukhopadhyay","author_inst":"Centre for Medicines Discovery, ORCRB, Oxford University, OX3 7DQ, UK"},{"author_name":"Eleanor Williams","author_inst":"Centre for Medicines Discovery, ORCRB, Oxford University, OX3 7DQ, UK"},{"author_name":"Charlotte Manning","author_inst":"Centre for Medicines Discovery, ORCRB, Oxford University, OX3 7DQ, UK"},{"author_name":"Tina Bohstedt","author_inst":"Centre for Medicines Discovery, ORCRB, Oxford University, OX3 7DQ, UK"},{"author_name":"Rama McCrorie","author_inst":"Centre for Medicines Discovery, ORCRB, Oxford University, OX3 7DQ, UK"},{"author_name":"Alejandra Fernandez-Cid","author_inst":"Centre for Medicines Discovery, ORCRB, Oxford University, OX3 7DQ, UK"},{"author_name":"Nicola A Burgess-Brown","author_inst":"Centre for Medicines Discovery, ORCRB, Oxford University, OX3 7DQ, UK"},{"author_name":"Ruo-Nan Xu","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Peng Dai","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Shi","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Huang","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tian-Jun Jiang","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ming Shi","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuxia Zhang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Alimuddin Zumla","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Markus Maeurer","author_inst":"Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown"},{"author_name":"Fan Bai","author_inst":"Peking University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"biochemistry"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.24.219139","rel_title":"Tissue-specific and interferon-inducible expression of non-functional ACE2 through endogenous retrovirus co-option","rel_date":"2020-07-24","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.24.219139","rel_abs":"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an entry receptor for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as well as a regulator of several physiological processes.

Using a recent de novo transcript assembly that captured previously unannotated transcripts, we describe a novel isoform of ACE2, generated by co-option of an intronic long terminal repeat (LTR) retroelement promoter. The novel transcript, termed LTR16A1-ACE2, exhibits specific expression patterns across the aerodigestive and gastrointestinal tracts and, importantly, is highly responsive to interferon stimulation. In stark contrast, expression of canonical ACE2 is completely unresponsive to interferon stimulation. Moreover, the LTR16A1-ACE2 translation product is a truncated, unstable ACE2 form, lacking domains required for SARS-CoV-2 binding and therefore unlikely to contribute to or enhance viral infection.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kevin Ng","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Jan Attig","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"William Bolland","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"George Young","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Jack Major","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Andreas Wack","author_inst":"Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"George Kassiotis","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Tina Bohstedt","author_inst":"Centre for Medicines Discovery, ORCRB, Oxford University, OX3 7DQ, UK"},{"author_name":"Rama McCrorie","author_inst":"Centre for Medicines Discovery, ORCRB, Oxford University, OX3 7DQ, UK"},{"author_name":"Alejandra Fernandez-Cid","author_inst":"Centre for Medicines Discovery, ORCRB, Oxford University, OX3 7DQ, UK"},{"author_name":"Nicola A Burgess-Brown","author_inst":"Centre for Medicines Discovery, ORCRB, Oxford University, OX3 7DQ, UK"},{"author_name":"Ruo-Nan Xu","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Peng Dai","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Shi","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Huang","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tian-Jun Jiang","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ming Shi","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuxia Zhang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Alimuddin Zumla","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Markus Maeurer","author_inst":"Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown"},{"author_name":"Fan Bai","author_inst":"Peking University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.24.219857","rel_title":"High Affinity Nanobodies Block SARS-CoV-2 Spike Receptor Binding Domain Interaction with Human Angiotensin Converting Enzyme","rel_date":"2020-07-24","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.24.219857","rel_abs":"There are currently no approved effective treatments for SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.

In the absence of effective vaccine, different countries have employed various other types of non-pharmaceutical interventions to contain the spread of this disease, including quarantines and lockdowns, tracking, tracing and isolation of infected individuals, and social distancing measures. Effectiveness of these and other measures of disease containment and prevention to a large degree depends on good understanding of disease dynamics, and robust mathematical models play an important role for forecasting its future dynamics. In this paper we focus on Ukraine, one of Europe's largest countries, and develop a mathematical model of COVID-19 dynamics, using latest data on parameters characterising clinical features of disease. For improved accuracy, our model includes age-stratified disease parameters, as well as age- and location-specific contact matrices to represent contacts. We show that the model is able to provide an accurate short-term forecast for the numbers and age distribution of cases and deaths. We also simulated different lockdown scenarios, and the results suggest that reducing work contacts is more efficient at reducing the disease burden than reducing school contacts, or implementing shielding for people over 60.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yuliya Kyrychko","author_inst":"University of Sussex"},{"author_name":"Konstantin Blyuss","author_inst":"University of Sussex"},{"author_name":"Igor Brovchenko","author_inst":"Institute of Mathematical Machine and System Problems"},{"author_name":"Eduardo Eyras","author_inst":"Australian National University"},{"author_name":"Hardip R.

Variation in individual susceptibility or exposure to infection exacerbates this effect. Individuals that are more susceptible or more exposed tend to be infected and removed from the susceptible subpopulation earlier. This selective depletion of susceptibles intensifies the deceleration in incidence. Eventually, susceptible numbers become low enough to prevent epidemic growth or, in other words, the herd immunity threshold is reached. Here we fit epidemiological models with inbuilt distributions of susceptibility or exposure to SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks to estimate basic reproduction numbers (R0) alongside coefficients of individual variation (CV) and the effects of containment strategies. Herd immunity thresholds are then calculated as 1-(1\/R0)1\/(1+CV2) or 1-(1\/R0)1\/(1+2CV2), depending on whether variation is on susceptibility or exposure. Our inferences result in herd immunity thresholds around 10-20%, considerably lower than the minimum coverage needed to interrupt transmission by random vaccination, which for R0 higher than 2.5 is estimated above 60%. We emphasize that the classical formula, 1-(1\/R0), remains applicable to describe herd immunity thresholds for random vaccination, but not for immunity induced by infection which is naturally selective. These findings have profound consequences for the governance of the current pandemic given that some populations may be close to achieving herd immunity despite being under more or less strict social distancing measures.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ricardo Aguas","author_inst":"Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Rodrigo M.

Due to high transmission levels, many governments implemented social-distancing measures and confinement with different levels of required compliance to mitigate the COVID-19 epidemic. In several countries, these measures were effective, and it was possible to flatten the epidemic curve and control it. In others, this objective was not or has not been achieved. In far to many cities around the world rebounds of the epidemic are occurring or, in others, plateau-like states have appeared where high incidence rates remain constant for relatively long periods of time. Nonetheless, faced with the challenge of urgent social need to reactivate their economies, many countries have decided to lift mitigation measures at times of high incidence. In this paper, we use a mathematical model to characterize the impact of short duration transmission events within the confinement period previous but close to the epidemic peak. The model describes too, the possible consequences on the disease dynamics after mitigation measures are lifted. We use Mexico City as a case study. The results show that events of high mobility may produce either a later higher peak, a long plateau with relatively constant but high incidence or the same peak as in the original baseline epidemic curve, but with a post-peak interval of slower decay. Finally, we also show the importance of carefully timing the lifting of mitigation measures. If this occurs during a period of high incidence, then the disease transmission will rapidly increase, unless the effective contact rate keeps decreasing, which will be very difficult to achieve once the population is released.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Mario Santana-Cibrian","author_inst":"Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico"},{"author_name":"Manuel A.

We used a simulation model of air travellers arriving to the UK from the EU or the USA and the timing of their stages of infection to evaluate the ability of these strategies to reduce the risk of seeding community transmission. We find that a quarantine period of 8 days on arrival with a PCR test on day 7 (with a 1-day delay for test results) can reduce the number of infectious arrivals released into the community by a median 94% compared to a no quarantine, no test scenario. This reduction is similar to that achieved by a 14-day quarantine period (median 99% reduction). Shorter quarantine periods still can prevent a substantial amount of transmission; all strategies in which travellers spend at least 5 days (the mean incubation period) in quarantine and have at least one negative test before release are highly effective (e.g. a test on day 5 with release on day 6 results in a median 88% reduction in transmission potential). Without intervention, the current high prevalence in the US (40 per 10,000) results in a higher expected number of infectious arrivals per week (up to 23) compared to the EU (up to 12), despite an estimated 8 times lower volume of travel in July 2020. Requiring a 14-day quarantine period likely results in less than 1 infectious traveller each entering the UK per week from the EU and the USA (97.5th percentile). We also find that on arrival the transmission risk is highest from pre-symptomatic travellers; quarantine policies will shift this risk increasingly towards asymptomatic infections if eventually-symptomatic individuals self-isolate after the onset of symptoms. As passenger numbers recover, strategies to reduce the risk of re-introduction should be evaluated in the context of domestic SARS-CoV-2 incidence, preparedness to manage new outbreaks, and the economic and psychological impacts of quarantine.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Samuel Clifford","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Billy J Quilty","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Timothy W Russell","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yang Liu","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yung-Wai Desmond Chan","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Carl A B Pearson","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Akira Endo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"- CMMID COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Stefan Flasche","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"W John Edmunds","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ruo-Nan Xu","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Peng Dai","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Shi","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Huang","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tian-Jun Jiang","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ming Shi","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuxia Zhang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Alimuddin Zumla","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Markus Maeurer","author_inst":"Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown"},{"author_name":"Fan Bai","author_inst":"Peking University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.24.20160994","rel_title":"Country distancing reveals the effectiveness of travel restrictions during COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-07-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.24.20160994","rel_abs":"Travel restrictions are the current central strategy to globally stop the transmission of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Despite remarkably successful approaches in predicting the spatiotemporal patterns of the ongoing pandemic, we lack an intrinsic understanding of the travel restriction's effectiveness. We fill this gap by developing a surprisingly simple measure, country distancing, that is analogical to the effective resistance in series and parallel circuits and captures the propagation backbone tree from the outbreak locations globally. This approach enables us to map the effectiveness of travel restrictions to arrival time delay (ATD) or infected case reduction (ICR) systematically. Our method estimates that 50.8\\% of travel restrictions as of Apr-4 are ineffective, resulting in zero ATD or ICR worldwide. Instead, by imposing Hubei's lockdown on Jan-23 and national lockdown on Feb-8, mainland China alone leads to 11.66 [95\\% credible interval (CI), 9.71 to 13.92] days of ATD per geographic area and 1,012,233 (95\\% CI, 208,210 -4,959,094) ICR in total as of Apr-4.

Conclusion: In our study, patients with gastrointestinal symptoms had no significant differences in disease severity, admission to ICU or death compared to those who did not have such symptoms.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"ALEJANDRO CONCHA-MEJIA","author_inst":"FUNDACION CLINICA SHAIO"},{"author_name":"REINALDO ANDRES RINCON-SANCHEZ","author_inst":"FUNDACION CLINICA SHAIO"},{"author_name":"Weiping Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Jianxi Gao","author_inst":"Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"},{"author_name":"Yung-Wai Desmond Chan","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Carl A B Pearson","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Akira Endo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"- CMMID COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Stefan Flasche","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"W John Edmunds","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ruo-Nan Xu","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Peng Dai","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Shi","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Huang","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tian-Jun Jiang","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ming Shi","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuxia Zhang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Alimuddin Zumla","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Markus Maeurer","author_inst":"Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown"},{"author_name":"Fan Bai","author_inst":"Peking University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"gastroenterology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.23.20160879","rel_title":"Factors associated with psychological distress in health-care workers during an infectious disease outbreak: A rapid living systematic review","rel_date":"2020-07-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.23.20160879","rel_abs":"Background: Health-care workers (HCW) are at risk for psychological distress during an infectious disease outbreak due to the demands of dealing with a public health emergency. Aims: To examine the factors associated with psychological distress among HCW during an outbreak. Method: We conducted a rapid review of the factors associated with psychological distress (demographic characteristics, occupational, social, psychological, and infection-related factors) in HCW during an outbreak (COVID-19, SARS, MERS, H1N1, H7N9, Ebola). Four electronic databases (Medline, PsychInfo, Web of Science, and the first 10 pages of Google Scholar) were searched (2000 to 10 July 2020) for relevant peer-reviewed research with a sample size >80. Results: From the 3335 records identified, 52 with data from 54,800 HCW were included. All but two studies were cross-sectional. Consistent evidence indicated that being female, a nurse, experiencing stigma, maladaptive coping, having contact or risk for contact with infected patients, and being quarantined, were risk factors for psychological distress among HCW. Personal and organisational social support, perceiving control, positive work attitudes, sufficient information about the outbreak and proper protection, training and resources, were associated with less psychological distress. Conclusions: This review highlighted the profiles of HCW who may be most at risk for psychological distress during an outbreak as well as several potential targets for interventions to reduce distress. More research is needed to track the associations of these factors with distress over time and the extent to which certain factors are inter-related and linked to sustained or transient distress.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fuschia M Sirois","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Janine Owens","author_inst":"University of Sheffield"},{"author_name":"Weiping Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Jiaotong University"},{"author_name":"Jianxi Gao","author_inst":"Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"},{"author_name":"Yung-Wai Desmond Chan","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Carl A B Pearson","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Akira Endo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"- CMMID COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Stefan Flasche","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"W John Edmunds","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ruo-Nan Xu","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Peng Dai","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Shi","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Huang","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tian-Jun Jiang","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ming Shi","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuxia Zhang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Alimuddin Zumla","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Markus Maeurer","author_inst":"Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown"},{"author_name":"Fan Bai","author_inst":"Peking University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"psychiatry and clinical psychology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.24.20161422","rel_title":"Adherence to protective measures among health care workers in the UK; a cross-sectional study","rel_date":"2020-07-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.24.20161422","rel_abs":"Healthcare workers (HCWs) are frontline responders to emergency infectious disease outbreaks such as COVID-19. We investigated factors associated with adherence to personal protective behaviours in UK HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic using an online cross-sectional survey of 1035 healthcare professionals in the UK. Data were collected between 12th and 16th June 2020. Adjusted logistic regressions were used to separately investigate factors associated with adherence to use of personal protective equipment, maintaining good hand hygiene, and physical distancing from colleagues. Adherence to personal protective measures was suboptimal (PPE use: 80.0%, 95% CI [77.3 to 82.8], hand hygiene: 67.8%, 95% CI [64.6 to 71.0], coming into close contact with colleagues: 74.7%, 95% CI [71.7 to 77.7]). Adherence to PPE use was associated with having adequate PPE resources, receiving training during the pandemic, lower perceived fatalism from COVID-19, higher perceived social norms and higher perceived effectiveness of PPE. Adherence to physical distancing was associated with one's workplace being designed, using markings to facilitate physical distancing and receiving training during the pandemic. There were few associations with adherence to hand hygiene. Findings indicate HCWs should receive training on personal protective behaviours to decrease fatalism over contracting COVID-19 and increase perceived effectiveness of protective measures.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Louise E.

While blanket measures are slowly being lifted and infection numbers are monitored, a systematic strategy for balancing contact restrictions and the freedom necessary for a functioning society long-term in the absence of a vaccine is currently lacking. Here, we propose a regional strategy with locally triggered containment measures that can largely circumvent this trade-off and substantially lower the magnitude of restrictions the average individual will have to endure in the near future. For the simulation of future disease dynamics and its control, we use current data on the spread of COVID-19 in Germany, Italy, England, New York State and Florida, taking into account the regional structure of each country and their past lockdown efficiency. Overall, our analysis shows that tight regional control in the short term can lead to long-term net benefits due to small-number effects which are amplified by the regional subdivision and crucially depend on the rate of cross-regional contacts. We outline the mechanisms and parameters responsible for these benefits and suggest possible was to gain access to them, simultaneously achieving more freedom for the population and successfully containing the epidemic. Our open-source simulation code is freely available and can be readily adapted to other countries. We hope that our analysis will help create sustainable, theory-driven long-term strategies for the management of the COVID-19 epidemic until therapy or immunization options are available.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Philip Bittihn","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization"},{"author_name":"Lukas Hupe","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization"},{"author_name":"Jonas Isensee","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization"},{"author_name":"Ramin Golestanian","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization"},{"author_name":"G James Rubin","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Carl A B Pearson","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Akira Endo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"- CMMID COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Stefan Flasche","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"W John Edmunds","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ruo-Nan Xu","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Peng Dai","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Shi","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Huang","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tian-Jun Jiang","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ming Shi","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuxia Zhang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Alimuddin Zumla","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Markus Maeurer","author_inst":"Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown"},{"author_name":"Fan Bai","author_inst":"Peking University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.07.24.20161554","rel_title":"Concerns, quality of life, access to care and productivity of the general population during the first 8 weeks of the coronavirus lockdown in Belgium and the Netherlands","rel_date":"2020-07-24","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.07.24.20161554","rel_abs":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has a disruptive impact on our society.

Methods: An online survey was conducted in a representative sample after 8 weeks of the coronavirus lockdown in Belgium and the Netherlands. The survey included questions about stress, concerns, quality of life delayed\/cancelled medical care and productivity loss using validated questionnaires. Results: In total, 2099 Belgian and 2058 Dutch respondents completed the survey with a mean age of 46.4 and 42.0 years, respectively. Half of the respondents were female in both countries. A small proportion tested positive for COVID-19, 1.4% vs 4.7%, respectively. The majority of respondents with a medical condition was worried about their current health state due to the pandemic (53%) vs (63%), respectively. Respondents experienced postponed\/cancelled care (26%) and were concerned about the availability of medication (32%) for both countries. Productivity losses due to the COVID-19 restrictions were calculated in absenteeism (36%) and presenteeism (30%) for Belgium, and (19%) and (35%) for the Netherlands. Most concerns and productivity losses were reported by respondents with children <12 years, respondents aged 18-35 and respondents with an (expected) COVID-19 infection. Conclusions: This study describes stress, quality of life, medical resource loss and productivity losses in Belgium and the Netherlands after 8 weeks of coronavirus lockdown. The results underline the burden on society.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hanne van Ballegooijen","author_inst":"IQVIA"},{"author_name":"Lucas Goossens","author_inst":"Erasmus University Rotterdam, Erasmus School of Health Policy & Management"},{"author_name":"Ralph H Bruin","author_inst":"IQVIA"},{"author_name":"Renee Michels","author_inst":"IQVIA"},{"author_name":"Marieke Krol","author_inst":"IQVIA"},{"author_name":"Carl A B Pearson","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Rosalind M Eggo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Akira Endo","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"- CMMID COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Stefan Flasche","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"W John Edmunds","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ruo-Nan Xu","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xiao-Peng Dai","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Shi","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lei Huang","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Tian-Jun Jiang","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ming Shi","author_inst":"Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yuxia Zhang","author_inst":"Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Alimuddin Zumla","author_inst":"University College London"},{"author_name":"Markus Maeurer","author_inst":"Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown"},{"author_name":"Fan Bai","author_inst":"Peking University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"}]}
