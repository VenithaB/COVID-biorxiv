In an effort to bring mass-testing to as many as possible, multiple diagnostic tests including molecular, antigen detection and serological assays have been rapidly developed. However, there is very little information on positive test agreement across modalities, especially for lower viral loads. Thirty-five nasopharyngeal samples that had cycle threshold (Ct) values greater than 30.0 from the Roche cobas 6800 assay were run on the Cepheid GeneXpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay. Ct values ranged from 30.1 to 37.9 (mean 36.7 {+\/-} 1.9) on the Roche cobas 6800 assay and 24.6 to 42.4 (mean 32.8{+\/-}4.1) on the Cepheid assay. There was a bias of 0.33 {+\/-} 3.21, (mean difference -1.59, 95% limits of agreement -5.97, 6.63) signifying close agreement between the 2 instruments with a high standard deviation. The close test agreement between the cobas 6800 and GeneXpert at high Ct values allows for utilization of both assays interchangeable in accordance with testing algorithms.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kari J Broder","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Ahmed Babiker","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Charles Myers","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Terri White","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Heather Jones","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"John Cardella","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Eileen M Burd","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Charles E Hill","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Colleen S Kraft","author_inst":"Emory University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.05.078238","rel_title":"Translation-associated mutational U-pressure in the first ORF of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses","rel_date":"2020-05-05","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.05.078238","rel_abs":"Within four months of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, more than 250 nucleotide mutations have been detected in the ORF1 of the virus isolated from different parts of the globe. These observations open up an obvious question about the rate and direction of mutational pressure for further vaccine and therapeutics designing. In this study, we did a comparative analysis of ORF1a and ORF1b by using the first isolate (Wuhan strain) as the parent sequence. We observed that most of the nucleotide mutations are C to U transitions. The rate of synonymous C to U transitions is significantly higher than the rate of nonsynonymous ones, indicating negative selection on amino acid substitutions. Further, trends in nucleotide usage bias have been investigated in 49 coronaviruses species. A strong bias in nucleotide usage in fourfold degenerated sites towards uracil residues is seen in ORF1 of all the studied coronaviruses. A more substantial mutational U pressure is observed in ORF1a than in ORF1b owing to the translation of ORF1ab via programmed ribosomal frameshifting. Unlike other nucleotide mutations, mutational U pressure caused by cytosine deamination, mostly occurring in the RNA-plus strand, cannot be corrected by the proof-reading machinery of coronaviruses. The knowledge generated on the direction of mutational pressure during translation of viral RNA-plus strands has implications for vaccine and nucleoside analogue development for treating covid-19 and other coronavirus infections.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vladislav Victorovich Khrustalev","author_inst":"Belarusian State Medical University"},{"author_name":"Rajanish Giri","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Mandi"},{"author_name":"Tatyana Aleksandrovna Khrustaleva","author_inst":"Institute of Physiology of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus"},{"author_name":"Shivani Krishna Kapuganti","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Mandi"},{"author_name":"Aleksander Nicolaevich Stojarov","author_inst":"Belarusian State Medical University"},{"author_name":"Victor Vitoldovich Poboinev","author_inst":"Belarusian State Medical University"},{"author_name":"Eileen M Burd","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Charles E Hill","author_inst":"Emory University"},{"author_name":"Colleen S Kraft","author_inst":"Emory University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"bioinformatics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.05.078956","rel_title":"Selectomic and Evolvability Analyses of the Highly Pathogenic Betacoronaviruses SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV","rel_date":"2020-05-05","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.05.078956","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, is widespread in several countries around the world following its late-2019 emergence in the human population. Rapid development of molecular diagnostic tests and subunit vaccines have been prioritized, and as such evaluating the SARS-CoV-2 genomic plasticity and evolutionary dynamics is an urgent need. We determined the SARS-CoV-2 selectome by calculating rates of pervasive and episodic diversifying selection for every amino acid coding position in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. To provide context for evolutionary dynamics of a highly pathogenic betacoronavirus following a zoonotic spillover into human hosts, we also determined the selectomes of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and performed evolvability calculations for SARS-CoV-2 based on SARS-CoV. These analyses identify the amino acid sites within each coding sequence that have been subjected to pervasive diversifying selection or episodic diversifying selection, and report significantly evolvable sites in the ORF1a polyprotein, the spike protein, and the membrane protein of SARS-CoV-2. These findings provide a comprehensive view of zoonotic, highly pathogenic betacoronavirus evolutionary dynamics that can be directly applied to diagnostic assay and vaccine design for SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Meghan May","author_inst":"University of New England"},{"author_name":"Bahman Rostama","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences University of New England"},{"author_name":"Ryan F.

Worldwide, SARS-CoV-2 has already infected over 3 million and has killed about 230,000 people. SARS-CoV-2 originated in China and, within three months, has evolved to an additional 10 subtypes. One particular subtype with a non-silent (Aspartate to Glycine) mutation at 614th position of the Spike protein (D614G) rapidly outcompeted other pre-existing subtypes, including the ancestral. We assessed that D614G mutation generates an additional serine protease (Elastase) cleavage site near the S1-S2 junction of the Spike protein. We also identified that a single nucleotide deletion (delC) at a known variant site (rs35074065) in a cis-eQTL of TMPRSS2, is extremely rare in East Asians but is common in Europeans and North Americans. The delC allele facilitates entry of the 614G subtype into host cells, thus accelerating the spread of 614G subtype in Europe and North America where the delC allele is common. The delC allele at the cis-eQTL locus rs35074065 of TMPRSS2 leads to overexpression of both TMPRSS2 and a nearby gene MX1. The cis-eQTL site, rs35074065 overlaps with a transcription factor binding site of an activator (IRF1) and a repressor (IRF2). IRF1 activator can bind to variant delC allele, but IRF2 repressor fails to bind. Thus, in an individual carrying the delC allele, there is only activation, but no repression. On viral entry, IRF1 mediated upregulation of MX1 leads to neutrophil infiltration and processing of 614G mutated Spike protein by neutrophil Elastase. The simultaneous processing of 614G spike protein by TMPRSS2 and Elastase serine proteases facilitates the entry of the 614G subtype into host cells. Thus, SARS-CoV-2, particularly the 614G subtype, has spread more easily and with higher frequency to Europe and North America where the delC allele regulating expression of TMPRSS2 and MX1 host proteins is common, but not to East Asia where this allele is rare.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chandrika Bhattacharyya","author_inst":"National Institute of Biomedical Genomics, Kalyani, West Bengal, India"},{"author_name":"Chitrarpita Das","author_inst":"National Institute of Biomedical Genomics, Kalyani, West Bengal, India"},{"author_name":"Arnab Ghosh","author_inst":"National Institute of Biomedical Genomics, Kalyani, West Bengal, India"},{"author_name":"Animesh K Singh","author_inst":"National Institute of Biomedical Genomics, Kalyani, West Bengal, India"},{"author_name":"Souvik Mukherjee","author_inst":"National Institute of Biomedical Genomics, Kalyani, West Bengal, India"},{"author_name":"Partha P Majumder","author_inst":"National Institute of Biomedical Genomics, Kalyani, West Bengal, India"},{"author_name":"Analabha Basu","author_inst":"National Institute of Biomedical Genomics, Kalyani, West Bengal, India"},{"author_name":"Nidhan K Biswas","author_inst":"National Institute of Biomedical Genomics, Kalyani, West Bengal, India"},{"author_name":"Colleen S Kraft","author_inst":"Emory University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"genomics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.04.077842","rel_title":"SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein Receptor Binding Domain is Subject to Negative Selection with Predicted Positive Selection Mutations","rel_date":"2020-05-05","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.04.077842","rel_abs":"COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the host cell surface receptor ACE2 is responsible for mediating SARS-CoV-2 infection. By analyzing the spike-hACE2 interacting surface, we predicted many hot spot residues that make major contributions to the binding affinity. Mutations on most of these residues are likely to be deleterious, leading to less infectious virus strains that may suffer from negative selection. Meanwhile, several residues with mostly advantageous mutations have been predicted. It is more probable that mutations on these residues increase the transmission ability of the virus by enhancing spike-hACE2 interaction. So far, only a limited number of mutations has been reported in this region. However, the list of hot spot residues with predicted downstream effects from this study can still serve as a tracking list for SARS-CoV-2 evolution studies.

At the time of writing this manuscript, the unprecedented public health crisis caused more than 2.5 million cases with a mortality range of 5-7%. The SARS-CoV-2, also called novel Coronavirus, is related to both SARS-CoV and bat SARS. Great efforts have been spent to control the pandemic that has become a significant burden on the health systems in a short time. Since the emergence of the crisis, a great number of researchers started to use the AI tools to identify drugs, diagnosing using CT scan images, scanning body temperature, and classifying the severity of the disease. The emergence of variants of the SARS-CoV-2 genome is a challenging problem with expected serious consequences on the management of the disease. Here, we introduce COVIDier, a deep learning-based software that is enabled to classify the different genomes of Alpha coronavirus, Beta coronavirus, MERS, SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and bronchitis-CoV. COVIDier was trained on 1925 genomes, belonging to the three families of SARS retrieved from NCBI Database to propose a new method to train deep learning model trained on genome data using Multi-layer Perceptron Classifier (MLPClassifier), a deep learning algorithm, that could blindly predict the virus family name from the genome of by predicting the statistically similar genome from training data to the given genome. COVIDier able to predict how close the emerging novel genomes of SARS to the known genomes with accuracy 99%. COVIDier can replace tools like BLAST that consume higher CPU and time.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peter Habib","author_inst":"Department of Biodiversity and Crop Improvement, International Center for Agriculture Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA), Giza, Egypt."},{"author_name":"Alsamman M Alsamman","author_inst":"Molecular Genetics and genome Mapping"},{"author_name":"Maha Saber-Ayad","author_inst":"College of Medicine, University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Sameh E.

Anti-cytokine treatments are being evaluated but optimal patient selection remains unclear, and the aim of our study is to address this point. Methods Between February 29 to April 6, 2020, 111 consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated in a single centre retrospective study. Patients were divided in two groups: 42 severe cases (TOCI) with adverse prognostic features including raised CRP and IL-6 levels, who underwent anti-cytokine treatments, mostly tocilizumab, and 69 standard of care patients (SOC). Results In the TOCI group, all received anti-viral therapy and 40% also received glucocorticoids. In TOCI, 62% of cases were ventilated and there were 3 deaths (17.8+\/-10.6 days, mean follow up) with 7\/26 cases remaining on ventilators, without improvement, and 17\/26 developed bacterial superinfection. One fatality occurred in the 15 TOCI cases treated on noninvasive ventilation and 1 serious bacterial superinfection. Of the 69 cases in SOC, there was no fatalities and no bacterial complications. The TOCI group had higher baseline CRP and IL-6 elevations (p<0.0001 for both) and higher neutrophils and lower lymphocyte levels (p= 0.04 and p=0.001, respectively) with the TOCI ventilated patients having higher markers than non-ventilated TOCI patients. Conclusion Higher inflammatory markers, more infections and worse outcomes characterized ventilated TOCI cases compared to ward based TOCI. Despite the confounding factors, this suggests that therapy time in anti-cytokine randomized trials will be key.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Luca Quartuccio","author_inst":"University of Udine"},{"author_name":"Arianna Sonaglia","author_inst":"University of Udine"},{"author_name":"Dennis McGonagle","author_inst":"National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Leeds Biomedical Research Centre (BRC), Leeds Teaching Hospitals, Leeds, UK"},{"author_name":"Martina Fabris","author_inst":"Institute of Pathology, ASUFC, DAME, Udine, Italy"},{"author_name":"Maddalena Peghin","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Unit, ASUFC, Udine, Italy"},{"author_name":"Davide Pecori","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Unit, ASUFC, Udine, Italy"},{"author_name":"Amato De Monte","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, ASUFC, Udine, Italy"},{"author_name":"Tiziana Bove","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, ASUFC, Udine, Italy; Anesthesia and Intensive Care Clinic, University of Udine, Udine, Italy."},{"author_name":"Francesco Curcio","author_inst":"Institute of Pathology, ASUFC, DAME, University of Udine, Udine, Italy"},{"author_name":"Flavio Bassi","author_inst":"Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, ASUFC, Udine, Italy"},{"author_name":"Salvatore De Vita","author_inst":"Clinic of Rheumatology, ASUFC, DAME, University of Udine, Udine, Italy"},{"author_name":"Carlo Tascini","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Unit, ASUFC, Udine, Italy"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.01.20079376","rel_title":"Vitamin D deficiency as risk factor for severe COVID-19: a convergence of two pandemics","rel_date":"2020-05-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.01.20079376","rel_abs":"Context.

Objective. To investigate the level of vitamin D deficiency in West Flanders, Belgium and its correlation to severity of COVID-19 as staged by CT Design. Retrospective observational study Setting. Central network hospital Participants. 186 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients hospitalized from March 1, 2020 to April 7, 2020 Main outcome measure. Analysis of 25(OH)D in COVID-19 patients versus season\/age\/sex-matched diseased controls Results. The rate of vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D<20 ng\/mL) in West Flanders varies with age, sex and season but is overall very high (39.9%) based on analysis of 16274 control samples. We measured 25(OH)D levels in 186 COVID-19 patients (109 males (median age 68 years, IQR 53-79) and 77 females (median age 71 years, IQR 65-74)) and 2717 age\/season-matched controls (999 males (median age 69 years, IQR 53-81) and 1718 females (median age 68 years, IQR 43-83)). COVID-19 patients showed lower median 25(OH)D (18.6 ng\/mL, IQR 12.6-25.3, versus 21.5 ng\/mL, IQR 13.9-30.8; P=0.0016) and higher vitamin D deficiency rates (58.6% versus 45.2%, P=0.0005). Surprisingly, this difference was restricted to male COVID-19 patients who had markedly higher deficiency rates than male controls (67.0% versus 49.2%, P=0.0006) that increased with advancing radiological stage and were not confounded vitamin D-impacted comorbidities. Conclusions: vitamin D deficiency is a prevalent risk factor for severe COVID-19.

The disease progression associated with the pro-inflammatory host response prompted us to examine the role of early corticosteroid therapy in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a single pre-test, single post-test quasi-experiment in a multi-center health system in Michigan from March 12 to March 27, 2020. Adult patients with confirmed moderate to severe COVID were included. A protocol was implemented on March 20, 2020 using early, short-course, methylprednisolone 0.5 to 1 mg\/kg\/day divided in 2 intravenous doses for 3 days. Outcomes of pre- and post-corticosteroid groups were evaluated. A composite endpoint of escalation of care from ward to ICU, new requirement for mechanical ventilation, and mortality was the primary outcome measure. All patients had at least 14 days of follow-up. Results: We analyzed 213 eligible subjects, 81 (38%) and 132 (62%) in pre-and post-corticosteroid groups, respectively. The composite endpoint occurred at a significantly lower rate in post-corticosteroid group compared to pre-corticosteroid group (34.9% vs. 54.3%, p=0.005). This treatment effect was observed within each individual component of the composite endpoint. Significant reduction in median hospital length of stay was observed in the post-corticosteroid group (8 vs. 5 days, p < 0.001). Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated an independent reduction in the composite endpoint at 14-days controlling for other factors (aOR: 0.45; 95% CI [0.25-0.81]).

We find that mass-testing is much less effective than testing the symptomatic and contact tracing, and some blend of these with social distancing is required to get suppression. We also find that the fat tail of the degree distribution matters a lot for epidemic growth, and many standard models do not account for this. Additionally, the average reproduction number for individuals is not an upper bound for the effective reproduction number, R.

The daily trend in reported cases has been rapidly rising in Latin America since March 2020 with the great majority of the cases reported in Brazil followed by Peru as of April 15th, 2020. Although Peru implemented a range of social distancing measures soon after the confirmation of its first case on March 6th, 2020, the daily number of new COVID-19 cases continues to accumulate in this country. We assessed the early COVID-19 transmission dynamics and the effect of social distancing interventions in Lima, Peru. We estimated the reproduction number, R, during the early transmission phase in Lima from the daily series of imported and autochthonous cases by the date of symptoms onset as of March 30th, 2020. We also assessed the effect of social distancing interventions in Lima by generating short-term forecasts grounded on the early transmission dynamics before interventions were put in place. Prior to the implementation of the social distancing measures in Lima, the local incidence curve by the date of symptoms onset displays near exponential growth dynamics with the mean scaling of growth parameter, p, estimated at 0.9 (95%CI: 0.9,1.0) and the reproduction number at 2.3 (95% CI: 2.0, 2.5). Our analysis indicates that school closures and other social distancing interventions have helped slow down the spread of the novel coronavirus, with the nearly exponential growth trend shifting to an approximately linear growth trend soon after the broad scale social distancing interventions were put in place by the government. While the interventions appear to have slowed the transmission rate in Lima, the number of new COVID-19 cases continue to accumulate, highlighting the need to strengthen social distancing and active case finding efforts to mitigate disease transmission in the region.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Cesar V.

We report thromboelastography (TEG) testing on a cohort of patients with suspected COVID-19 infection at the time of admission to the intensive care unit. Methods: TEG testing was performed using the TEG 6s analyzer near or at the time of ICU admission. We also report the results of other coagulation or inflammatory related indices such as platelet count, prothrombin time, fibrinogen, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and procalcitonin. All laboratory testing was performed at the discretion of the attending physician in the course of normal patient care and retrospectively reviewed. Results: We found that maximum clot strength was consistently elevated in COVID-19 patients while normal in all patients found to be negative. We did not encounter significant prolongations of coagulation assays outside of those expectedly prolonged by heparin therapy nor was meeting the criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation encountered. Conclusions: We postulate that elevated maximum clot strength by TEG testing is predictive of COVID-19 status as within our cohort this perfectly predicted patients COVID-19 status despite a high level of suspicion in negative patients with normal TEG results. While these results require a larger cohort for confirmation, we feel that TEG testing could improve confidence in negative COVID-19 testing results in suspected patients possibly allowing for earlier de-escalation of infectious precautions and personal protective equipment utilization.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Shaun D Lawicki","author_inst":"LSUHSC"},{"author_name":"Katherine V Wang","author_inst":"LSUHSC"},{"author_name":"Bing Han","author_inst":"LSUHSC"},{"author_name":"Gordon L Love","author_inst":"LSUHSC"},{"author_name":"Mary F.

Early detection of affected patients within the huge population of patients with common cold symptoms is an important element of this effort but often hindered by limited testing resources. We aimed to identify predictive risk profiles for a positive PCR result in primary care. Methods: Multi-center cross-sectional cohort study on predictive characteristics over a period of 4 weeks in primary care patients in Germany. We evaluated age, sex, reason for testing, risk factors, symptoms, and expected PCR result for their impact on the test result. Results: In total, 374 patients in 14 primary care centers received SARS-CoV-2 PCR swab testing and were included in this analysis. A fraction of 10.7% (n=40) tested positive for COVID-19. Patients who reported anosmia had a higher odds ratio (OR: 4.54; 95%-CI: 1.51-13.67) for a positive test result while patients with a sore throat had a lower OR (OR: 0.33; 95%-CI: 0.11-0.97). Patients who had a first grade contact with an infected persons and showed symptoms themselves also had an increased OR for positive testing (OR: 5.16; 95% CI: 1.72-15.51). This correlation was also present when they themselves were still asymptomatic (OR: 12.55; 95% CI: 3.97-39.67). Conclusion: The reported contact to an infected person is the most important factor for a positive PCR result, independent of any symptoms of illness in the tested patient. Those persons with contact to an infected person should always get a PCR test. If no contact is reported and testing material is scarce, anosmia should increase the likelihood of performing a test, while a sore throat should decrease it.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Johannes Just","author_inst":"Witten\/Herdecke University, Institute of General Practice and Interprofessional Care"},{"author_name":"Marie-Therese Puth","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biometry, Informatics and Epidemiology (IMBIE), University Hospital Bonn"},{"author_name":"Felix Regenold","author_inst":"Witten\/Herdecke University, Institute of General Practice and Interprofessional Care"},{"author_name":"Klaus Weckbecker","author_inst":"Witten\/Herdecke University, Institute of General Practice and Interprofessional Care"},{"author_name":"Markus Bleckwenn","author_inst":"Leipzig University, Department of General Practice"},{"author_name":"Andree Valle","author_inst":"Centro Nacional de Epidemiologia, Prevencion y Control de Enfermedades, Peruvian Ministry of Health, Lima, Peru"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Rojas-Mezarina","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud, Peruvian Ministry of Health, Lima, Peru"},{"author_name":"Cesar Cabezas","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud, Peruvian Ministry of Health, Lima, Peru"},{"author_name":"Manuel Loayza","author_inst":"Centro Nacional de Epidemiologia, Prevencion y Control de Enfermedades, Peruvian Ministry of Health, Lima, Peru."},{"author_name":"- COVID-19 Peru COVID-19 working group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Gerardo Chowell","author_inst":"Georgia State University"},{"author_name":"Carlo Tascini","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Unit, ASUFC, Udine, Italy"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"primary care research"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.28.20082990","rel_title":"A simple model to show the relative risk of viral aerosol infection and the benefit of  wearing masks in different settings with implications for Covid-19 .","rel_date":"2020-05-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.28.20082990","rel_abs":"Background. Widespread use of masks in the general population is being used in many countries for control of Covid-19. There has been reluctance on the part of the WHO and some governments to recommend this. Methodology. A basic model has been constructed to show the relative risk of aerosol from normal breathing in various situations together with the relative benefit from use of different masks. Results. The benefit from mask use between individuals is multiplicative not additive and although social distancing at 2 meters appears beneficial with regards to aerosol infectivity, in confined areas this is time limited requiring additional measures such as masks. The model shows the relative benefit of masks when social distancing is not possible at all times, or when in confined areas which can also be aided by efficient ventilation. Where a person is in one place for a prolonged period there is more risk requiring protection. Conclusions. Masks should be used in the above situations especially at an early stage of an outbreak. Public health planning requires stockpiling of masks and encouraging everyone to have suitable masks in their household when supplies are normalised. In the absence of widely available good quality masks the use of a cloth mask will be better than no protection at all.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gerald D Barr","author_inst":"Independent Health Research"},{"author_name":"Marie-Therese Puth","author_inst":"Department of Medical Biometry, Informatics and Epidemiology (IMBIE), University Hospital Bonn"},{"author_name":"Felix Regenold","author_inst":"Witten\/Herdecke University, Institute of General Practice and Interprofessional Care"},{"author_name":"Klaus Weckbecker","author_inst":"Witten\/Herdecke University, Institute of General Practice and Interprofessional Care"},{"author_name":"Markus Bleckwenn","author_inst":"Leipzig University, Department of General Practice"},{"author_name":"Andree Valle","author_inst":"Centro Nacional de Epidemiologia, Prevencion y Control de Enfermedades, Peruvian Ministry of Health, Lima, Peru"},{"author_name":"Leonardo Rojas-Mezarina","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud, Peruvian Ministry of Health, Lima, Peru"},{"author_name":"Cesar Cabezas","author_inst":"Instituto Nacional de Salud, Peruvian Ministry of Health, Lima, Peru"},{"author_name":"Manuel Loayza","author_inst":"Centro Nacional de Epidemiologia, Prevencion y Control de Enfermedades, Peruvian Ministry of Health, Lima, Peru."},{"author_name":"- COVID-19 Peru COVID-19 working group","author_inst":""},{"author_name":"Gerardo Chowell","author_inst":"Georgia State University"},{"author_name":"Carlo Tascini","author_inst":"Infectious Disease Unit, ASUFC, Udine, Italy"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.30.20079657","rel_title":"Geospatial Correlation Between COVID-19 Health Misinformation on Social Media and Poisoning with Household Cleaners","rel_date":"2020-05-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.30.20079657","rel_abs":"Prolific social media activity has accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic.

In England, 32% of colorectal cancer (CRC) is diagnosed via urgent symptomatic referral from primary care, the \"2-week-wait\" (2WW) pathway. Access to routine endoscopy is likely to be a critical bottleneck causing delays in CRC management due to chronic limitation in capacity, acute competition for physician time, and safety concerns. Methods: We used age-specific, stage-specific 10 year CRC survival for England 2007-2017 and 2WW CRC cases volumes. We used per-day hazard ratios of CRC survival generated from observational studies of CRC diagnosis-to-treatment interval to model the effect of different durations of per-patient delay. We utilised data from a large London observational study of faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) in symptomatic patients to model FIT-triage to mitigate delay to colonoscopy. Findings: Modest delays result in significant reduction in survival from CRC with a 4-month delay resulting across age groups in [&ge;]20% reduction in survival in Stage 3 disease and in total over a year, 1,419 attributable deaths across the 11,266 CRC patients diagnosed via the 2WW pathway. FIT triage of >10 ug Hb\/g would salvage 1,292\/1,419 of the attributable deaths and reduce colonoscopy requirements by >80%. Diagnostic colonoscopy offers net survival in all age groups, providing nosocomial COVID-19 infection rates are kept low (<2.5%). Interpretation To avoid significant numbers of avoidable deaths from CRC, normal diagnostic and surgical throughput must be maintained. An accrued backlog of cases will present to primary care following release of lockdown, supranormal endoscopy capacity will be required to manage this without undue delays. FIT-triage of symptomatic cases provides a rational approach by which to avoid patient delay and mitigate pressure on capacity in endoscopy. This would also reduce exposure to nosocomial COVID-19 infection, relevant in particular to older patient groups.

Recently, the advent of deep learning in medical diagnosis has been well proven. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can be used to detect the COVID-19 infection imaging features in a chest CT scan. We introduce ai-corona, a radiologist-assistant deep learning framework for COVID-19 infection diagnosis using the chest CT scans. Method: Our dataset comprises 2121 cases of axial spiral chest CT scans in three classes; COVID-19 abnormal, non COVID-19 abnormal, and normal, from which 1764 cases were used for training and 357 cases for validation. The training set was annotated using the reports of two experienced radiologists. The COVID-19 abnormal class validation set was annotated using the general consensus of a collective of criteria that indicate COVID-19 infection. Moreover, the validation sets for the non COVID-19 abnormal and the normal classes were annotated by a different experienced radiologist. ai-corona constitutes a CNN-based feature extractor conjoined with an average pooling and a fully-connected layer to classify a given chest CT scan into the three aforementioned classes. Results: We compare the diagnosis performance of ai-corona, radiologists, and model-assisted radiologists for six combinations of distinguishing between the three mentioned classes, including COVID-19 abnormal vs. others, COVID-19 abnormal vs. normal, COVID-19 abnormal vs. non COVID-19 abnormal, non COVID-19 abnormal vs. others, normal vs. others, and normal vs. abnormal. ai-corona achieves an AUC score of 0.989 (95% CI: 0.984, 0.994), 0.997 (95% CI: 0.995, 0.999), 0.986 (95% CI: 0.981, 0.991), 0.959 (95% CI: 0.944, 0.974), 0.978 (95% CI: 0.968, 0.988), and 0.961 (95% CI: 0.951, 0.971) in each combination, respectively. By employing Bayesian statistics to calculate the accuracies at a 95% confidence interval, ai-corona surpasses the radiologists in distinguishing between the COVID-19 abnormal class and the other two classes (especially the non COVID-19 abnormal class). Our results show that radiologists diagnostic performance improves when incorporating ai-coronas prediction. In addition, we also show that RT-PCRs diagnosis has a much lower sensitivity compared to all the other methods. Conclusion: ai-corona is a radiologist-assistant deep learning framework for fast and accurate COVID19 diagnosis in chest CT scans. Our results ascertain that our framework, as a reliable detection tool, also improves experts diagnosis performance and helps especially in diagnosing non-typical COVID-19 cases or non COVID-19 abnormal cases that manifest COVID-19 imaging features in chest CT scan.

In absence of effective vaccines, infection prevention and control through diagnostic testing and quarantine is critical. Early detection and differential diagnosis of respiratory infections increases the chances for successful control of COVID-19 disease. The nucleic acid RT-PCR test is regarded as the current standard for molecular diagnosis with high sensitivity. However, the highest specificity confirmation target ORF1ab gene is considered to be less sensitive than other targets in clinical application. In addition, a large amount of recent evidence indicates that the initial missed diagnosis of asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 and discharged patients with \"re-examination positive\" may be due to low viral load, and the ability of rapid mutation of coronavirus also increases the rate of false negative results. We aimed to evaluate the sensitivity of different nucleic acid detection kits so as to make recommendations for the selection of validation kit, and amplify the suspicious result to be reportable positive by means of simple continuous amplification, which is of great significance for the prevention and control of the current epidemic and the discharge criteria of low viral load patients.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"yunying zhou","author_inst":"Jinan Central Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Fengyan Pei","author_inst":"Jinan Central Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Li Wang","author_inst":"inan Infectious Disease Hospital, Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Huailong Zhao","author_inst":"Jinan Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Huanjie Li","author_inst":"Jinan Central Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Mingyu Ji","author_inst":"Jinan Central Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Weihua Yang","author_inst":"Jinan Central Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Qingxi Wang","author_inst":"Jinan Central Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Qianqian Zhao","author_inst":"Jinan Central Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Yunshan Wang","author_inst":"Jinan Central Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University"},{"author_name":"Meisam Hoseinyazdi","author_inst":"Shiraz University of Medical Sciences"},{"author_name":"Jafar Roshandel","author_inst":"National Research Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases (NRITLD), Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences and Health Services"},{"author_name":"Negar Bandegani","author_inst":"National Research Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases (NRITLD), Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences and Health Services"},{"author_name":"Abbas Danesh","author_inst":"National Research Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases (NRITLD), Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences and Health Services"},{"author_name":"Mehrdad Bakhshayesh Karam","author_inst":"National Research Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases (NRITLD), Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences and Health Services"},{"author_name":"Atefeh Abedini","author_inst":"National Research Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases (NRITLD), Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences and Health Services"},{"author_name":"Mark Lawler","author_inst":"Queen's University Belfast"},{"author_name":"David C.

We investigated whether individualized tidal volume and positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) delivery is possible to lungs of different compliances that are being simultaneously ventilated from one anesthesia ventilator. Methods: We performed a controlled experiment in an operating room environment without animal or human participants. Two test lungs were connected to distinct modified Y-pieces that were ventilated in parallel from a single anesthesia ventilator. Results: Ventilation can be manipulated to qualitatively deliver individually tailored tidal volumes in the setting of varying PEEP and compliance requirements in pressure control mode. Conclusions: Splitting ventilators, or multi-ventilation, is a viable alternative to acute ventilator shortage during a pandemic. Ventilators can be split for individualized tidal volume and positive end-expiratory pressure delivery in multiple subjects of differing compliances and demographics.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Albert Lee","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Soban Umar","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"Nir Hoftman","author_inst":"UCLA"},{"author_name":"David J Clark","author_inst":"St Georges University of London"},{"author_name":"Michael Cocozza","author_inst":"Mologic"},{"author_name":"Ana I Cubas-Atienzar","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Luis E Cuevas","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Martina Cusinato","author_inst":"St Georges University of London"},{"author_name":"Benedict M.

We developed a strategy for overcoming this bias to obtain more plausible estimates of the true values of key epidemiological variables. We fit mechanistic Bayesian latent-variable SIR models to confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries, for all regions (countries and US states) independently. Bayesian averaging over models, we find that the raw infection incidence rate underestimates the true rate by a factor, the case ascertainment ratio CARt that depends upon region, and show how CARt changes over time. At the regional onset of COVID-19, the predicted global median for each case confirmed was 13 infections unreported (CARt = 0.07 C.I. (0.02, 0.4)). As the infection spread, the median CARt rose to 9 unreported cases for every one diagnosed as of April 15, 2020 (CARt = 0.1 C.I. (0.02, 0.5)). We also estimate that the median global initial reproduction number R0 is 3.3 (C.I (1.5, 8.3)) and the total infection fatality rate near the onset is 0.17% (C.I. (0.05%, 0.9%)). However the time-dependent reproduction number Rt and infection fatality rate as of April 15 were 1.2 (C.I. (0.6, 2.5)) and 0.8% (C.I. (0.2%,4%)), respectively. We find that there is great variability between country- and state-level values. Our estimates are consistent with recent serological estimates of cumulative infections for the state of New York, but inconsistent with claims that very large fractions of the population have already been infected in most other regions. For most regions, our estimates imply a great deal of uncertainty about the current state and trajectory of the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Carson C Chow","author_inst":"NIDDK, National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Joshua C Chang","author_inst":"National Institutes of Health"},{"author_name":"Richard C Gerkin","author_inst":"Arizona State University"},{"author_name":"Shashaank Vattikuti","author_inst":"NIDDK, National Institutes of Healthj"},{"author_name":"Michael Cocozza","author_inst":"Mologic"},{"author_name":"Ana I Cubas-Atienzar","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Luis E Cuevas","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Martina Cusinato","author_inst":"St Georges University of London"},{"author_name":"Benedict M.

The Poisson autoregressive model that allows to capture both short and long term memory effects performs best under all criterions.

Design: Online cross-sectional survey. Setting: UK. Participants: 53,002 men and women aged [&ge;]18y. Main outcome measures: Confirmed and suspected COVID-19, worry about catching and becoming seriously ill from COVID-19, and adherence to protective behaviours. Socioeconomic position was defined according to highest level of education (post-16 qualifications: yes\/no). Results: Compared with never smokers (0.3% [95%CI 0.2-0.3%]), prevalence of confirmed COVID-19 was higher among current (0.6% [0.4-0.8%]) but not ex-smokers (0.2% [0.2-0.3%]). The associations were similar before (current: OR 2.14 [1.49-3.08]; ex-smokers: OR 0.73 [0.47-1.14]) and after (current: OR 1.79 [1.22-2.62]; ex-smokers: OR 0.85 [0.54-1.33]) adjustment for potential confounders. For current smokers, this was moderated by socioeconomic position, with higher rates relative to never smokers only seen in those without post-16 qualifications (OR 3.53 [2.04-6.10]). After including suspected cases, prevalence was higher among current smokers (11.2% [10.6-11.9%], OR 1.11 [1.03-1.20]) and ex-smokers (10.9% [10.4-11.5%], OR 1.07 [1.01-1.15]) than never smokers (10.2% [9.9-10.6%]), but remained higher only among ex-smokers after adjustment (OR 1.21 [1.13-1.29]). Current and ex-smokers had higher odds than never smokers of reporting significant stress about catching (current: OR 1.43 [1.35-1.52]; ex-smokers: OR 1.15 [1.09-1.22]) or becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 (current: OR 1.34 [1.27-1.43]; ex-smokers: OR 1.22 [1.16-1.28]). Adherence to recommendations to prevent the spread of COVID-19 was generally high (96.3% [96.1-96.4%]), but lower among current than never smokers (OR 0.70 [0.62-0.78]). Conclusions: When assessed by self-report in a population sample, current smoking was independently associated with confirmed COVID-19 infection. There were socioeconomic disparities, with the association only apparent among those without post-16 qualifications. Smokers reported lower adherence to guidelines despite being more worried than non-smokers about catching or becoming seriously ill from COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sarah E Jackson","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Jamie Brown","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Lion Shahab","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Andrew Steptoe","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Daisy Fancourt","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Ana I Cubas-Atienzar","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Luis E Cuevas","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Martina Cusinato","author_inst":"St Georges University of London"},{"author_name":"Benedict M.

In response, severely affected countries have had to consider a range of public health strategies achieved by implementing non-pharmaceutical interventions. Broadly, these strategies have fallen into two categories: i) \"mitigation\", which aims to achieve herd immunity by allowing the SARS-CoV-2 virus to spread through the population while mitigating disease burden, and ii) \"suppression\", aiming to drastically reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates and halt endogenous transmission in the target population. Using an age-structured transmission model, parameterised to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the UK, we assessed the prospects of success using both of these approaches. We simulated a range of different non-pharmaceutical intervention scenarios incorporating social distancing applied to differing age groups. We found that it is possible to suppress SARS-CoV-2 transmission if social distancing measures are sustained at a sufficient level for a period of months. Our modelling did not support achieving herd immunity as a practical objective, requiring an unlikely balancing of multiple poorly-defined forces. Specifically, we found that: i) social distancing must initially reduce the transmission rate to within a narrow range, ii) to compensate for susceptible depletion, the extent of social distancing must be vary over time in a precise but unfeasible way, and iii) social distancing must be maintained for a long duration (over 6 months).","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tobias Brett","author_inst":"Odum School of Ecology, University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Pejman Rohani","author_inst":"Odum School of Ecology, University of Georgia"},{"author_name":"Lion Shahab","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Andrew Steptoe","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Daisy Fancourt","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Ana I Cubas-Atienzar","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Luis E Cuevas","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Martina Cusinato","author_inst":"St Georges University of London"},{"author_name":"Benedict M.

There is an urgent need to create novel models to study SARS-CoV-2 using human disease-relevant cells to understand key features of virus biology and facilitate drug screening. As primary SARS-CoV-2 infection is respiratory-based, we developed a lung organoid model using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) that could be adapted for drug screens. The lung organoids, particularly aveolar type II cells, express ACE2 and are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Transcriptomic analysis following SARS-CoV-2 infection revealed a robust induction of chemokines and cytokines with little type I\/III interferon signaling, similar to that observed amongst human COVID-19 pulmonary infections. We performed a high throughput screen using hPSC-derived lung organoids and identified FDA-approved drug candidates, including imatinib and mycophenolic acid, as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 entry. Pre- or post-treatment with these drugs at physiologically relevant levels decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection of hPSC-derived lung organoids. Together, these data demonstrate that hPSC-derived lung cells infected by SARS-CoV-2 can model human COVID-19 disease and provide a valuable resource to screen for FDA-approved drugs that might be repurposed and should be considered for COVID-19 clinical trials.","rel_num_authors":29,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yuling Han","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Liuliu Yang","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Xiaohua Duan","author_inst":"Weill Cornell Medical College"},{"author_name":"Fuyu Duan","author_inst":"University of Chicago"},{"author_name":"Benjamin E.
