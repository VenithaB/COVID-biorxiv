Methods: We studied the changes in R0 on the DP from January 21 to February 19, 2020 based on chain-binomial models under two scenarios: no quarantine assuming a random mixing condition, and quarantine of passengers in cabins -- passengers may get infected either by an infectious case in a shared cabin or by asymptomatic crew who continued to work. Results: Estimates of R0 at the beginning of the epidemic were 3.27 (95% CI, 3.02-3.54) and 3.78 (95% CI, 3.49-4.09) respectively for serial intervals of 5 and 6 days; and when quarantine started, with the reported asymptomatic ratio 0.505, R0 rose to 4.18 (95%CI, 3.86-4.52) and 4.73 (95%CI, 4.37-5.12) respectively for passengers who might be exposed to the virus due to contacts with asymptomatic crew. The overall R0 for both crew and passengers was decreased to 2.55 (95%CI, 2.36-2.76) and 2.90 (95% CI, 2.67-3.13). Results show that the higher the asymptomatic ratio is, the more infectious contacts would happen. Conclusions: We find evidence to support a US CDC report that \"a high proportion of asymptomatic infections could partially explain the high attack rate among cruise ship passengers and crew.\" Our study suggests that the effects of quarantine may be limited if the asymptomatic ratio is high, implying that a combination of preventive measures is needed to stop the spread of virus.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Li-Shan Huang","author_inst":"National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan"},{"author_name":"Li Li","author_inst":"AT&T, Bedminster, NJ"},{"author_name":"Lucia Dunn","author_inst":"Ohio State University"},{"author_name":"Mai He","author_inst":"Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.21.20074443","rel_title":"COVID-19 Epidemic in Algeria: Assessment of the implemented preventive strategy","rel_date":"2020-04-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.21.20074443","rel_abs":"Abstract Since the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic in China, several preventive strategies have been implemented worldwide to fight against the spread of the virus, in Algeria the control actions have been mainly social distancing, movement restriction, quarantine and lockdown. In order to assess the preventive strategy adopted in Algeria, we studied three zones whole Algeria, Blida region, and whole Algeria except Blida, we used as a indicator the basic reproduction number R0, we compared the mean R0-before and R0-after the implementation of the mitigation measures using bivariate analysis, then we used the results we found to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases avoided by these measures, then after, we predicted the peak of the first wave of the epidemic. We note that the decrease in R0 after the preventive measures implementation was statistically significant, p value < 10-4, in the three areas, thus, the preventive strategy in Algeria has been effective in its entirety. Our projection revealed that 15613 cases of COVID-19 were avoided in 14 days, from April 6, to April 19, 2020, in the whole country, and 1747 cases were prevented in Blida during the same period. We estimate that the peak of the first wave of the epidemic in Algeria will be reached with herd immunity of 15.93% as of November 2020, however, at least 56% of people with protective immunity would be needed to be sufficient to avoid a second wave. The used method to carry out the evaluation has given us a good overview, but, R0 is not the only factor to consider when estimating the burden of the epidemic, to do that, the number of daily admissions to intensive care units and hospitalizations remain good indicators. In order to better the epidemic control in Algeria, it is possible to act on contact efficacy rate by adding an instruction to wear medical mask by ordinary population outside, this measure has been reported to be effective in some countries. To conclude, it is good to keep in mind that a new way of life based on good hygiene habits and social distancing must therefore be in place and adopted by the population for at least several months, otherwise the demand for health care will exceed the availability.

To this end, phylogenomic approaches leverage accumulating genomic mutations as barcodes to track the evolutionary history of the virus and can benefit from the surge of sequences deposited in public databases. Yet, such methods typically rely on consensus sequences representing the dominant virus lineage, whereas a complex sublineage architecture is often observed within single hosts. Furthermore, most approaches do not account for variants accumulation processes and might produce inaccurate results in condition of limited sampling, as witnessed in most countries affected by the epidemics.\n\nWe introduce VERSO (Viral Evolution ReconStructiOn), a new comprehensive framework for the characterization of viral evolution and transmission from sequencing data of viral genomes. our approach accounts for accumulation of clonal mutations and uncertainty in the data, by taking advantage of the achievements of research in cancer evolution, to deliver robust phylogenomic lineage models, and exploits intra-host variant frequency profiles to characterize the sublineage similarity among samples, which may derive from uncovered infection events.\n\nThe application of our approach to RNA-sequencing data of 162 SARS-CoV-2 samples generates a high-resolution model of evolution and spread, which improves recent findings on viral types and highlights the existence of patterns of co-occurrence of minor variants, revealing likely infection paths among hosts harboring the same viral lineage. The in-depth analysis of the mutational landscape of SARS-CoV-2 confirms a statistically significant increase of genomic diversity in time and identifies a number of variants that are transiting from minor to clonal state in the population. We also show that standard phylogenetic methods can produce unreliable results when handling datasets with noise and sampling limitations, as proven by the further application of VERSO to 12419 consensus sequences included in GISAID database.\n\nNotably, VERSO allows to pinpoint minor variants that might be positively or negatively selected across distinct lineages, thus driving the design of treatments and vaccines. In particular, minor variant g.29039A>U, detected in multiple viral lineages and validated on independent samples, shows that SARS-CoV-2 can lose its main Nucleocapsid immunogenic epitopes, raising concerns about the effectiveness of vaccines targeting the C-terminus of this protein. Finally, we here release the likely SARS-CoV-2 ancestral genome, obtained by resolving ambiguous SNPs that distinguish two widely-used reference genomes from human samples, by employing the Pangolin-CoV and the Bat-CoV-RaTG13 genomes.\n\nOur results show that the joint application of our framework and data-driven epidemiological models might allow to deliver a high-resolution platform for pathogen surveillance and analysis.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniele Ramazzotti","author_inst":"Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano-Bicocca, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Fabrizio Angaroni","author_inst":"Department of Informatics, Systems and Communication, University of Milano-Bicocca, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Davide Maspero","author_inst":"Department of Informatics, Systems and Communication, University of Milano-Bicocca, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Carlo Gambacorti-Passerini","author_inst":"Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano-Bicocca, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Marco Antoniotti","author_inst":"Department of Informatics, Systems and Communication, University of Milano-Bicocca, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Alex Graudenzi","author_inst":"Institute of Molecular Bioimaging and Physiology, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (IBFM-CNR), Segrate, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Rocco Piazza","author_inst":"Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano-Bicocca, Milan, Italy"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"evolutionary biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.23.057307","rel_title":"Open Access and Altmetrics in the pandemic age: Forescast analysis on COVID-19 related literature","rel_date":"2020-04-26","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.23.057307","rel_abs":"We present an analysis on the uptake of open access on COVID-19 related literature as well as the social media attention they gather when compared with non OA papers.

We reveal large conformational changes associated with substrate binding as the enzyme transitions from a binary to a ternary state.

Suppression of the inflammatory response with immunomodulatory therapies may be a potential therapeutic strategy. We systematically review and assess the effectiveness of specific interleukin-1 and -6 inhibitors for the treatment of coronavirus-related infections. Methods Electronic databases, pre-print servers and clinical trial registries were searched to identify current and ongoing studies of immunomodulatory agents (anakinra, sarilumab, siltuximab and tocilizumab) for the treatment of Covid-19 and other coronavirus related super infections. The co-primary outcome was time to hospital discharge (days) and severity on an ordinal scale measured at day 15. Results Five retrospective studies (tocilizumab, two case series and two case reports; siltuximab, one case series) were shortlisted for inclusion, totalling 59 patients. All studies had a moderate or high risk of bias, with multiple limitations. Insufficient data and inter-study heterogeneity prevented meta-analysis. Primary outcomes were inconsistently reported but suggest many patients experienced an improvement in status seven days following therapy. The case fatality ratio (CFR) of patients with severe Covid-19 included in our review was 6.8%, a figure substantially lower than that estimated in non-interventional case series. Of the studies measuring IL-6, all reported elevated baseline levels. Twenty-five ongoing registered clinical trials exploring immunomodulatory agents in Covid-19 were identified, although inconsistency in participants and endpoints are noted. Conclusion Inhibition of IL-6 with tocilizumab and siltuximab requires further evaluation in managing the assumed hyperinflammatory response associated with severe Covid-19. These early data are considered hypothesis generating and justify the need for well-designed randomised clinical studies.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Fasihul Khan","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Laura Fabbri","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Iain Stewart","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Karen Robinson","author_inst":"John Hopkins University"},{"author_name":"Alan R Smyth","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Gisli Jenkins","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Lalit Kumar Sharma","author_inst":"Zoological Survey of India, Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Kailash Chandra","author_inst":"Zoological Survey of India, Kolkata"},{"author_name":"Luis Martinez-Sobrido","author_inst":"Texas Biomedical Research Institute, San Antonio, TX, USA"},{"author_name":"Yogesh K Gupta","author_inst":"University of Texas Health San Antonio, TX, USA"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.23.20076737","rel_title":"ICU and ventilator mortality among critically ill adults with COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-04-26","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.23.20076737","rel_abs":"We report preliminary data from a cohort of adults admitted to COVID-designated intensive care units from March 6 through April 17, 2020 across an academic healthcare system.

Here, we report an in-house built biosensor device (eCovSens) and compare it with a commercial potentiostat for the detection of nCovid-19 spike antigen (nCovid-19Ag) in spiked saliva samples. A potentiostat based sensor was fabricated using fluorine doped tin oxide electrode (FTO) with gold nanoparticle (AuNPs) and immobilized with nCovid-19 monoclonal antibody (nCovid-19Ab) to measure change in the electrical conductivity. Similarly, eCovSens was used to measure change in electrical conductivity by immobilizing nCovid-19 Ab on screen printed carbon electrode (SPCE). The performances of both sensors were recorded upon interaction of nCovid-19Ab with its specific nCovid-19Ag. Under optimum conditions, the FTO based immunosensor and eCovSens displayed high sensitivity for detection of nCovid-19Ag, ranging from 1 fM to 1 M. Our in-house developed device can successfully detect nCovid-19Ag at 10 fM concentration in standard buffer that is in close agreement with FTO\/AuNPs sensor. The limit of detection (LOD) was found to be 90 fM with eCovSens and 120 fM with potentiostst in case of spiked saliva samples. The proposed portable eCovSens device can be used as a diagnostic tool for the rapid (within 10-30 s) detection of nCovid-19Ag traces directly in patient saliva in a non-invasive manner.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Subhasis Mahari","author_inst":"National Institute of Animal Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Akanksha Roberts","author_inst":"National Institute of Animal Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Deepshikha Shahdeo","author_inst":"National Institute of Animal Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Sonu Gandhi","author_inst":"National Institute of Animal Biotechnology"},{"author_name":"Colleen S.

RNA recombination is required during normal CoV replication for subgenomic mRNA (sgmRNA) synthesis and generates defective viral genomes (DVGs) of unknown function. However, the determinants and patterns of CoV recombination are unknown. Here, we show that divergent {beta}-CoVs SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) perform extensive RNA recombination in culture, generating similar patterns of recombination junctions and diverse populations of DVGs and sgmRNAs. We demonstrate that the CoV proofreading nonstructural protein (nsp14) 3-to-5 exoribonuclease (nsp14-ExoN) is required for normal CoV recombination and that its genetic inactivation causes significantly decreased frequency and altered patterns of recombination in both infected cells and released virions. Thus, nsp14-ExoN is a key determinant of both high fidelity CoV replication and recombination, and thereby represents a highly-conserved and vulnerable target for virus inhibition and attenuation.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jennifer Gribble","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Andrea J Pruijssers","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Maria L Agostini","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Jordan Anderson-Daniels","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"James D Chappell","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Xiaotao Lu","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Laura J Stevens","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Andrew Laurence Routh","author_inst":"University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston"},{"author_name":"Mark R Denison","author_inst":"Vanderbilt University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Alfonso C.

Analyzing the genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from clinical samples is crucial for the understanding of viral spread and viral evolution, as well as for vaccine development. Existing sample preparation methods for viral genome sequencing are demanding on user technique and time, and thus not ideal for time-sensitive clinical samples; these methods are also not optimized for high performance on viral genomes. We have developed MetagenomIc RNA EnRichment VirAl sequencing (MINERVA), a facile, practical, and robust approach for metagenomic and deep viral sequencing from clinical samples. This approach uses direct tagmentation of RNA\/DNA hybrids using Tn5 transposase to greatly simplify the sequencing library construction process, while subsequent targeted enrichment can generate viral genomes with high sensitivity, coverage, and depth. We demonstrate the utility of MINERVA on pharyngeal, sputum and stool samples collected from COVID-19 patients, successfully obtaining both whole metatranscriptomes and complete high-depth high-coverage SARS-CoV-2 genomes from these clinical samples, with high yield and robustness. MINERVA is compatible with clinical nucleic extracts containing carrier RNA. With a shortened hands-on time from sample to virus-enriched sequencing-ready library, this rapid, versatile, and clinic-friendly approach will facilitate monitoring of viral genetic variations during outbreaks, both current and future.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chen Chen","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jizhou Li","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Lin Di","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Qiuyu Jing","author_inst":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Pengcheng Du","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chuan Song","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jiarui Li","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Qiong Li","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Yunlong Cao","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Sunney Xie","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Angela Ruohao Wu","author_inst":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Hui Zeng","author_inst":"Beijing Ditan Hospital"},{"author_name":"Yanyi Huang","author_inst":"Peking University"},{"author_name":"Jianbin Wang","author_inst":"Tsinghua University"},{"author_name":"Emory COVID-19 Quality and Clinical Research Collaborative","author_inst":""}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"new results","category":"molecular biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.21.050633","rel_title":"Rapid SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing for informed public health decision making in the Netherlands","rel_date":"2020-04-25","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.21.050633","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that has rapidly spread across the globe.

Here, we introduce a low-cost, high-throughput method for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, dubbed Pathogen-Oriented Low-Cost Assembly & Re-Sequencing (POLAR), that enhances sensitivity by aiming to amplify the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome rather than targeting particular viral loci, as in typical RT-PCR assays. To achieve this goal, we combine a SARS-CoV-2 enrichment method developed by the ARTIC Network (https:\/\/artic.network\/) with short-read DNA sequencing and de novo genome assembly. We are able to reliably (>95% accuracy) detect SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations of 84 genome equivalents per milliliter, better than the reported limits of detection of almost all diagnostic methods currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. At higher concentrations, we are able to reliably assemble the SARS-CoV-2 genome in the sample, often with no gaps and perfect accuracy. Such genome assemblies enable the spread of the disease to be analyzed much more effectively than would be possible with an ordinary yes\/no diagnostic, and can help identify vaccine and drug targets. Finally, we show that POLAR diagnoses on 10 of 10 clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples (half positive, half negative) match those obtained in a CLIA-certified lab using the Center for Disease Controls 2019-Novel Coronavirus test. Using POLAR, a single person can process 192 samples over the course of an 8-hour experiment, at a cost of [~]$30\/patient, enabling a 24-hour turnaround with sequencing and data analysis time included. Further testing and refinement will likely enable greater enhancements in the sensitivity of the above approach.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brian Glenn St Hilaire","author_inst":"Baylor College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Neva C.

Spike (S) protein of coronavirus is the primary determinant of its entry into the host as it consists of both receptor binding and fusion domain. While tissue tropism, host range, and pathogenesis of coronavirus are primarily controlled by the interaction of S protein with the cell receptor, it is possible that proteolytic activation of S protein by host cell proteases also plays a decisive role. The host-cell proteases have shown to be involved in the proteolysis of S protein and cleaving it into two functional subunits, S1 and S2, during the maturation process. In the present study, the interaction of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 with different host proteases like furin, cathepsin B, and plasmin has been analyzed. Incorporation of the furin cleavage site (R-R-A-R) in the S protein in SARS-CoV-2 has been studied by mutating the individual amino acid. Our results suggest the polytropic nature of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2. Our analysis indicated that a single amino acid substitution in the polybasic cleavage site of S protein perturb the binding of cellular proteases. This mutation study might help to generate an attenuated SARS-CoV-2. Besides, targeting of host proteases by inhibitors may result in a practical approach to stop the cellular spread of SARS-CoV-2 and to develop its antiviral.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kamal Shokeen","author_inst":"IIT Guwahati"},{"author_name":"Shambhavi Pandey","author_inst":"IIT Guwahati"},{"author_name":"Manisha Shah","author_inst":"IIT Guwahati"},{"author_name":"Sachin Kumar","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati"},{"author_name":"Ragini Mahajan","author_inst":"University of Houston"},{"author_name":"Alyssa Blackburn","author_inst":"Baylor College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Zane L.

We previously demonstrated that five nucleotide analogues inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), including the active triphosphate forms of Sofosbuvir, Alovudine, Zidovudine, Tenofovir alafenamide and Emtricitabine. We report here the evaluation of a library of additional nucleoside triphosphate analogues with a variety of structural and chemical features as inhibitors of the RdRps of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. These features include modifications on the sugar (2 or 3 modifications, carbocyclic, acyclic, or dideoxynucleotides) or on the base. The goal is to identify nucleotide analogues that not only terminate RNA synthesis catalyzed by these coronavirus RdRps, but also have the potential to resist the viruses exonuclease activity. We examined these nucleotide analogues with regard to their ability to be incorporated by the RdRps in the polymerase reaction and then prevent further incorporation. While all 11 molecules tested displayed incorporation, 6 exhibited immediate termination of the polymerase reaction (Carbovir triphosphate, Ganciclovir triphosphate, Stavudine triphosphate, Entecavir triphosphate, 3-O-methyl UTP and Biotin-16-dUTP), 2 showed delayed termination (Cidofovir diphosphate and 2-O-methyl UTP), and 3 did not terminate the polymerase reaction (2-fluoro-dUTP, 2-amino-dUTP and Desthiobiotin-16-UTP). The coronavirus genomes encode an exonuclease that apparently requires a 2 -OH group to excise mismatched bases at the 3-terminus. In this study, all of the nucleoside triphosphate analogues we evaluated form Watson-Cricklike base pairs. All the nucleotide analogues which demonstrated termination either lack a 2-OH, have a blocked 2-OH, or show delayed termination. These nucleotides may thus have the potential to resist exonuclease activity, a property that we will investigate in the future. Furthermore, prodrugs of five of these nucleotide analogues (Brincidofovir\/Cidofovir, Abacavir, Valganciclovir\/Ganciclovir, Stavudine and Entecavir) are FDA approved for other viral infections, and their safety profile is well known. Thus, they can be evaluated rapidly as potential therapies for COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Steffen Jockusch","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Chuanjuan Tao","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoxu Li","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Thomas K Anderson","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Minchen Chien","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Shiv Kumar","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"James J Russo","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Robert N Kirchdoerfer","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Jingyue Ju","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Olga Dudchenko","author_inst":"Baylor College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andreas Gnirke","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Suhas S.P.

In this paper, we present a deterministic model to model the impact of social distancing on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in South Africa. The model is fitted to the currently available data on the cumulative number of infected cases and a scenario analysis on different levels of social distancing are presented. The results show a continued rise in the number of cases in the lock down period with the current levels of social distancing albeit at a lower rate. The model shows that the number of cases will rise to above 4000 cases by the end of the lockdown. The model also looks at the impact of relaxing the social distancing measures after the initial announcement of the lock down measures. A relaxation of the social distancing by 2% can result in a 23% rise in the number of cumulative cases while on the other hand increasing the levels of social distancing by 2% would reduce the number of cumulative cases by about 18%. These results have implications on the management and policy direction in the early phases of the epidemic.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Farai Nyabadza","author_inst":"University of Johannesburg"},{"author_name":"Faraimunashe Chirove","author_inst":"University of KwaZulu Natal"},{"author_name":"Williams Chidozie Chukwu","author_inst":"University of Johannesburg"},{"author_name":"Maria Vivien Visaya","author_inst":"University of Johannesburg"},{"author_name":"Minchen Chien","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Shiv Kumar","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"James J Russo","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Robert N Kirchdoerfer","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Jingyue Ju","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Olga Dudchenko","author_inst":"Baylor College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andreas Gnirke","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Suhas S.P.

The Italian government adopted urgent measures to hold its spread. Enforcing compliance to such measures is crucial in order to enhance their effectiveness. Engaging citizens' in the COVID-19 preventive process is today urgent in Italy and around the world. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have investigated the role of health engagement in predicting citizens compliance to health emergency containment measures. Method: An online survey was administered between February 28th and March 4th 2020 on a representative sample of 1000 Italians. The questionnaire included a measure of Health Engagement (PHE-S) and a series of ad hoc items intended to measure both affective and behavioral responses of the citizens to the emergency in terms of perceived susceptibility to and severity of the disease, orientation towards health management, change in habits and in purchases. To investigate the relationship between Health Engagement and these variables, a series of ANOVAs, Logistic regressions and crosstabs have been carried out. Results: Less engaged people show higher levels of perceived susceptibility to the virus and of severity of the disease; they trust less scientific and healthcare authorities, they feel less self-effective in managing their own health - both in normal conditions and under stress - and are less prone to cooperate with healthcare professionals. Low levels of Health Engagement are also associated with a change in the usual purchase behavior. Conclusions: The Patient Health Engagement Model (PHE) provides a useful framework for understanding how people will respond to health threats such as pandemics. Therefore, intervention studies should focus on particular groups and on raising their levels of engagement to increase the effectiveness of educational initiatives devoted to promote preventive behaviors.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guendalina Graffigna","author_inst":"Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore"},{"author_name":"Serena Barello","author_inst":"Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore"},{"author_name":"Mariarosaria Savarese","author_inst":"Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Palamenghi","author_inst":"Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore"},{"author_name":"Greta Castellini","author_inst":"Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore"},{"author_name":"Andrea Bonanomi","author_inst":"Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore"},{"author_name":"Edoardo Lozza","author_inst":"Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore"},{"author_name":"Robert N Kirchdoerfer","author_inst":"University of Wisconsin-Madison"},{"author_name":"Jingyue Ju","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Olga Dudchenko","author_inst":"Baylor College of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andreas Gnirke","author_inst":"Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"},{"author_name":"Suhas S.P.

Among multiple factors possibly involved in such geographical differences, a role has been hypothesized for atmospheric pollution. Objectives: We provide additional evidence on the possible influence of air quality, particularly in terms of chronicity of exposure on the spread viral infection in Italian regions. Methods: Actual data on to COVID-19 outbreak in Italian provinces and corresponding long-term air quality evaluations, were obtained from Italian and European agencies, elaborated and tested for possible interactions. Discussion: Our elaborations reveal that, beside concentrations, the chronicity of exposure may influence the anomalous variability of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy. Data on distribution of atmospheric pollutants (NO2, O3, PM2.5 and PM10) in Italian regions during the last 4 years, days exceeding regulatory limits, and years of the last decade (2010-2019) in which the limits have been exceeded for at least 35 days, confirmed that Northern Italy has been constantly exposed to chronic air pollution. Long-term air-quality data significantly correlated with cases of Covid-19 in up to 71 Italian provinces (updated 27 April) providing further evidence that chronic exposure to atmospheric contamination may represent a favourable context for the spread of the virus. Pro-inflammatory responses and high incidence of respiratory and cardiac affections are well known, while the capability of this coronavirus to bind particulate matters remains to be established.

Identification of the key underlying factors for this disparity is highly warranted. Here we describe constructing a proteomic risk score based on 20 blood proteomic biomarkers which predict the progression to severe COVID-19. We demonstrate that in our own cohort of 990 individuals without infection, this proteomic risk score is positively associated with proinflammatory cytokines mainly among older, but not younger, individuals. We further discovered that a core set of gut microbiota could accurately predict the above proteomic biomarkers among 301 individuals using a machine learning model, and that these gut microbiota features are highly correlated with proinflammatory cytokines in another set of 366 individuals. Fecal metabolomic analysis suggested potential amino acid-related pathways linking gut microbiota to inflammation. This study suggests that gut microbiota may underlie the predisposition of normal individuals to severe COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":22,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Wanglong Gou","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Yuanqing Fu","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Liang Yue","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Geng-dong Chen","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xue Cai","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Menglei Shuai","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Fengzhe Xu","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Xiao Yi","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Hao Chen","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Yi Judy Zhu","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Mian-li Xiao","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Zengliang Jiang","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Zelei Miao","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Congmei Xiao","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Bo Shen","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xiaomai Wu","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Haihong Zhao","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wenhua Ling","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yu-ming Chen","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Tiannan Guo","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Ju-Sheng Zheng","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Aura Timen","author_inst":"Centre for Infectious Disease Control, National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, Bilthoven, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Marion Koopmans","author_inst":"ErasmusMC, Department of Viroscience, WHO collaborating centre for arbovirus and viral hemorrhagic fever Reference and Research, Rotterdam, the Netherlands"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.22.20074989","rel_title":"Heat treatment for reuse of disposable respirators during Covid-19 pandemic: Is filtration and fit adversely affected?","rel_date":"2020-04-25","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.22.20074989","rel_abs":"A number of methods for decontaminating disposable filtering face piece respirators have been explored for use in health care settings during epidemics where respirators are in short supply, such as the current Covid-19 pandemic. Heating to temperatures above 65 degrees C has been shown to successfully inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 virus on various surfaces. Ovens or similar heating devices are likely already widely available in hospitals globally. We did a quantitative fit test on nine models of FFP2 and FFP3 respirators before and after heat treatment in an oven. These included both flat fold and moulded cup styles. All passed the initial fit test, and all but two passed the post-treatment fit test. This study demonstrates that FFP respirators can still retain both filtration efficiency and fit after wear and heat treatment, but that it is necessary to understand the probability for failure of fit after decontamination. Heat shows promise as a simple and effective way of treating FFP respirators. Further evaluation of longer-term wear and disinfection effectiveness of heat treatment should be done before widespread use.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Miranda Loh","author_inst":"Institute of Occupational Medicine"},{"author_name":"Ross Clark","author_inst":"Institute of Occupational Medicine"},{"author_name":"John W Cherrie","author_inst":"Institute of Occupational Medicine"},{"author_name":"Geng-dong Chen","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Xue Cai","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Menglei Shuai","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Fengzhe Xu","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Xiao Yi","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Hao Chen","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Yi Judy Zhu","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Mian-li Xiao","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Zengliang Jiang","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Zelei Miao","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Congmei Xiao","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Bo Shen","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Xiaomai Wu","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Haihong Zhao","author_inst":"Taizhou Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wenhua Ling","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Jun Wang","author_inst":"Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Yu-ming Chen","author_inst":"Sun Yat-sen University"},{"author_name":"Tiannan Guo","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Ju-Sheng Zheng","author_inst":"Westlake University"},{"author_name":"Aura Timen","author_inst":"Centre for Infectious Disease Control, National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, Bilthoven, the Netherlands"},{"author_name":"Marion Koopmans","author_inst":"ErasmusMC, Department of Viroscience, WHO collaborating centre for arbovirus and viral hemorrhagic fever Reference and Research, Rotterdam, the Netherlands"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"occupational and environmental health"}]}
