Proposed mechanisms involve host cell membrane-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs), such as transmembrane serine protease isoform 2 (TMPRSS2). The distribution of expression of these genes across cell types representing multiple organ systems in healthy individuals has been recently demonstrated. However, comorbidities such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease are highly prevalent in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated with worse outcomes. Whether these conditions contribute directly to SARS-CoV-2 virulence remain unclear. Here we show that the expression levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and other viral entry-related genes are modulated in target organs of select disease states. In tissues such as heart, which normally express ACE2 but minimal TMPRSS2, we found that TMPRSS2 as well as other TTSPs are elevated in individuals with comorbidities vs healthy individuals. Additionally, we found increased expression of viral entry-related genes in the settings of hypertension, cancer or smoking across target organ systems. Our results demonstrate that common comorbidities may contribute directly to SARS-CoV-2 virulence and suggest new therapeutic targets to improve outcomes in vulnerable patient populations.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Joshua D Breidenbach","author_inst":"University of Toledo"},{"author_name":"Prabhatchandra Dube","author_inst":"University of Toledo, College of Medicine and Life Sciences, Toledo, Ohio"},{"author_name":"Subhanwita Ghosh","author_inst":"University of Toledo, College of Medicine and Life Sciences, Toledo, Ohio"},{"author_name":"Nikolai N Modyanov","author_inst":"University of Toledo, College of Medicine and Life Sciences, Toledo, Ohio"},{"author_name":"Deepak Malhotra","author_inst":"University of Toledo, College of Medicine and Life Sciences, Toledo, Ohio"},{"author_name":"Lance D Dworkin","author_inst":"University of Toledo, College of Medicine and Life Sciences, Toledo, Ohio"},{"author_name":"Steven T Haller","author_inst":"University of Toledo, College of Medicine and Life Sciences, Toledo, Ohio"},{"author_name":"David J Kennedy","author_inst":"University of Toledo, College of Medicine and Life Sciences, Toledo, Ohio"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.26.118133","rel_title":"Assessment of sample pooling for clinical SARS-CoV-2 testing","rel_date":"2020-05-27","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.26.118133","rel_abs":"Accommodating large increases in sample workloads has presented one of the biggest challenges to clinical laboratories during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the implementation of new automated detection systems, and previous efficiencies such as barcoding, electronic data transfer and extensive robotics, throughput capacities have struggled to meet the demand. Sample pooling has been suggested as an additional strategy to further address this need. The greatest concern with this approach in a clinical setting is the potential for reduced sensitivity, particularly the risk of false negative results when weak positive samples are pooled. To investigate this possibility, detection rates in pooled samples were evaluated, with extensive assessment of pools containing weak positive specimens. Additionally, the frequency of occurrence of weak positive samples across ten weeks of the pandemic were reviewed. Weak positive specimens were detected in all five-sample pools but failed to be detected in four of the 24 nine-sample pools tested. Weak positive samples comprised an average 16.5% of the positive specimens tested during the pandemic thus far, slightly increasing in frequency during later weeks. Other aspects of the testing process should be considered, however, such as accessioning and reporting, which are not streamlined and may be complicated by pooling procedures. Therefore, the impact on the entire laboratory process needs to be carefully assessed prior to implementing such a strategy.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Kirsten St. George","author_inst":"Wadsworth Center - NYSDOH"},{"author_name":"Sara B.

As a result, the clinical outcome from previous CQ or HCQ trials were, in fact, the collective manifestation of both R and S- enantiomers with inherent different pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties, and toxicity liabilities. Our data for the first time demonstrated the stereoselective difference of CQ and HCQ against live SARS-CoV-2 virus in a Biosafety Level 3 laboratory. S-chloroquine (S-CQ) and S-hydroxychloroquine (S-HCQ) significantly more active against SARS-CoV-2, as compared to R-CQ and R-HCQ, respectively. In addition, Mpro, as one of the critical enzymes for viral transcription and replication, also exhibited an enantioselective binding affinity toward the S-enantiomers. The most significant finding from this study is the pronounced difference of the two enantiomers of CQ and HCQ observed in hERG inhibition assay. The IC50 value of S-HCQ was higher than 20 M against hERG channel, which was much less active over all tested CQ and HCQ compounds. Moreover, S-HCQ alone did not prolong QT interval in guinea pigs after 3 days and 6 days of administration, indicating a much lower cardiac toxicity potential. With these and previous findings on the enantio-differentiated metabolism, we recommend that future clinical studies should employ S-HCQ, substantially free of the R-enantiomer, to potentially improve the therapeutic index for the treatment of COVID-19 over the racemic CQ and HCQ.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Guanguan Li","author_inst":"Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Jing Sun","author_inst":"GIRH"},{"author_name":"Yi-You Huang","author_inst":"Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Yingjun Li","author_inst":"Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yongjie Shi","author_inst":"Southern University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Zhe Li","author_inst":"Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Xiang Li","author_inst":"Guangdong Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Animals & Cardiovascular Model Research Center, Guangdong Laboratory Animals Monitoring Institute"},{"author_name":"Feng Hua Yang","author_inst":"Guangdong Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Animals & Cardiovascular Model Research Center, Guangdong Laboratory Animals Monitoring Institute"},{"author_name":"Jincun Zhao","author_inst":"GIRH"},{"author_name":"Hai-Bin LUO","author_inst":"Sun Yat-Sen University"},{"author_name":"Tony Y.

This disease is caused by a newly discovered strain of the coronavirus, namely SARS CoV-2. Lung cancer patients are reported to be more susceptible to COVID-19 infection. To evaluate the probable reasons behind the excessive susceptibility and fatality of lung cancer patients to COVID-19 infection, we targeted two most crucial biomarkers of COVID-19, ACE2 and CXCL10. ACE2 plays a vital role in the SARS CoV-2 entry into the host cell while CXCL10 is a cytokine mainly responsible for the lung cell damage involving in a cytokine storm.\n\nMethodsFirstly, we used the TIMER, UALCAN and GEPIA2 databases to analyze the expression and correlation of ACE2 and CXCL10 in LUAD and LUSC. After that, using the cBioPortal database, we performed an analytical study to determine the genetic changes in ACE2 and CXCL10 protein sequences that are responsible for lung cancer development. Finally, we analyzed different functional approaches of ACE2, CXCL10 and their co-expressed genes associated with lung cancer and COVID-19 development by using the PANTHER database.\n\nResultsInitially, we observed that ACE2 and CXCL10 are mostly overexpressed in LUAD and LUSC. We also found the functional significance of ACE2 and CXCL10 in lung cancer development by determining the genetic alteration frequency in their amino acid sequences. Lastly, by doing the functional assessment of the targeted genes, we identified that ACE2 and CXCL10 along with their commonly co-expressed genes are respectively involved in the binding activity and immune responses in case of lung cancer and COVID-19 infection.\n\nConclusionsFinally, on the basis of this systemic analysis, we came to the conclusion that ACE2 and CXCL10 are possible biomarkers responsible for the higher susceptibility and fatality of lung cancer patients towards the COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Tousif Bin Mahmood","author_inst":"Department of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering, Noakhali Science and Technology University, Noakhali-3814, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Afrin Sultana Chowdhury","author_inst":"Department of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering, Noakhali Science and Technology University, Noakhali-3814, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Mehedee Hasan","author_inst":"Department of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering, Noakhali Science and Technology University, Noakhali-3814, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Md.

Methods: Systematic review in five engines, pre-print webpages and RCT registries until May 22, 2020 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies evaluating remdesivir on confirmed, COVID-19 adults with pneumonia and\/or respiratory insufficiency. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, clinical improvement or recovery, need for invasive ventilation, and serious adverse events (SAE). Secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay, progression of pneumonia, and adverse events (AE). Inverse variance random effects meta-analyses were performed. Results: Two placebo-controlled RCTs (n=1300) and two case series (n=88) were included. All studies used remdesivir 200mg IV the first day and 100mg IV for 9 more days, and followed up until 28 days. Wang et al. RCT was stopped early due to AEs; ACTT-1 was preliminary reported at 15-day follow up. Time to clinical improvement was not decreased in Wang et al. RCT, but median time to recovery was decreased by 4 days in ACTT-1. Remdesivir did not decrease all-cause mortality (RR 0.71, 95%CI 0.39 to 1.28) and need for invasive ventilation at 14 days (RR 0.57, 95%CI 0.23 to 1.42), but had fewer SAEs (RR 0.77, 95%CI 0.63 to 0.94). AEs were similar between remdesivir and placebo arms. Risk of bias ranged from some concerns to high risk in RCTs. Interpretation: There is paucity of adequately powered and fully reported RCTs evaluating effects of remdesivir in adult, hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

The Portuguese people complied quickly, reducing their overall mobility by 80% . We estimate the impact of the lockdown in Portugal in terms of reducing burden on the health service. Methods: Using publicly available official data from the Portuguese Directorate-General of Health we forecasted epidemic curves for: Cases, hospital inpatients (overall and in ICU), and deaths without lockdown, assuming that the impact of containment measures would start 14 days after lockdown was implemented. We used exponential smoothing models for deaths, intensive care (ICU) and hospitalizations and an ARIMA model for number of cases. Models were selected considering fitness to the observed data to the 31st of March 2020. We then compared observed(with intervention) and forecasted curves( without intervention). Results: Between April 1 and April 15, there were 146 fewer deaths(-25%), 5568 fewer cases (-23%) and, as of April 15, there were 519 fewer ICU inpatients(-69%) and 508 fewer overall hospital inpatients(-28%) than forecasted without lockdown. On April 15 the number of ICU inpatients could have reached 748, three times higher than the observed value (229) if the intervention had been delayed. Conclusion: If the lockdown had not been implemented in mid-March, Portugal ICU capacity (528 ICU beds) would likely have been breached in the first half of April. The lockdown seems to have been effective in reducing transmission of SARS-Cov-2, serious Covid-19 illness and associated mortality, thereby decreasing demand on health services. Early action allowed time for the National Health Service to acquire protective equipment, to increase capacity to test and cope with the surge in hospital and ICU demand caused by the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Vasco Ricoca Peixoto","author_inst":"NOVA National School of Public Health, Public Health Research Centre, Universidade NOVA de Lisboa, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Andre Vieira","author_inst":"NOVA National School of Public Health, Public Health Research Centre, Universidade NOVA de Lisboa, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Pedro Aguiar","author_inst":"NOVA National School of Public Health, Public Health Research Centre, Universidade NOVA de Lisboa, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Carlos Carvalho","author_inst":"Unit for Multidisciplinary Research in Biomedicine, Abel Salazar Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Universidade do Porto, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Daniel Thomas","author_inst":"Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre, Public Health Wales, Cardiff, UK"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Abrantes","author_inst":"NOVA National School of Public Health, Public Health Research Centre, Universidade NOVA de Lisboa, Portugal"},{"author_name":"Priyaleela Thota","author_inst":"Hemex Health Inc."},{"author_name":"C.

Ethical guidelines consider allocation of limited resources based on likelihood of survival, frailty, co-morbidities and age. However, the association of frailty with clinical outcomes in older COVID-19 patients remains unclear. Objectives: To determine the association between frailty and short-term mortality in older adults hospitalized for COVID-19. Design: Retrospective single-center observational study. Setting and participants: N = 81 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), at the Geriatrics department of Imelda general hospital, Belgium. Measurements: Frailty was graded according to the Rockwood Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). Demographic, biochemical and radiological variables, co-morbidities, symptoms and treatment were extracted from electronic medical records. Results: Participants (N = 48 women, 59%) had a median age of 85 years (range 65 - 97 years), median CFS score of 7 (range 2 - 9), and 42 (52%) were long-term care residents. Within six weeks, eighteen patients died. Mortality was significantly but weakly associated with age (Spearman r = 0.241, P = 0.03) and CFS score (r = 0.282, P = 0.011), baseline lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (r = 0.301, P = 0.009), lymphocyte count (r = -0.262, P = 0.02) and RT-PCR Ct value (r = -0.285, P = 0.015). Mortality was not associated with long-term care residence, dementia, delirium or polypharmacy. In multivariable logistic regression analyses, CFS, LDH and RT-PCR Ct values (but not age) remained independently associated with mortality. Both age and frailty had poor specificity to predict survival. A multivariable model combining age, CFS, LDH and viral load significantly predicted survival. Conclusions and implications: Although their prognosis is worse, even the oldest and most severely frail patients may benefit from hospitalization for COVID-19, if sufficient resources are available.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Robert De Smet","author_inst":"Imelda Hospital, Bonheiden, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Bea Mellaerts","author_inst":"Imelda Hospital, Bonheiden, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Hannelore Vandewinckele","author_inst":"Imelda Hospital, Bonheiden, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Peter Lybeert","author_inst":"Imelda Hospital, Bonheiden, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Eric Frans","author_inst":"Imelda Hospital, Bonheiden, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Sara Ombelet","author_inst":"Imelda Hospital, Bonheiden, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Wim Lemahieu","author_inst":"Imelda Hospital, Bonheiden, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Rolf Symons","author_inst":"Imelda Hospital, Bonheiden, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Erwin Ho","author_inst":"Imelda Hospital, Bonheiden, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Johan Frans","author_inst":"Imelda Hospital, Bonheiden, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Annick Smismans","author_inst":"Imelda Hospital, Bonheiden, Belgium"},{"author_name":"Michael R Laurent","author_inst":"Imelda Hospital, Bonheiden, Belgium"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"geriatric medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.25.20112664","rel_title":"For-profit nursing homes and the risk of COVID-19 outbreaks and resident deaths in Ontario, Canada","rel_date":"2020-05-27","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.25.20112664","rel_abs":"Background: Nursing homes have become the epicentre of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Canada. Previous research demonstrates that for-profit nursing homes deliver inferior care across a variety of outcome and process measures, raising the question of whether for-profit homes have had worse COVID-19 outcomes than non-profit homes. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all nursing homes in Ontario, Canada from March 29-May 20, 2020 using a COVID-19 outbreak database maintained by the Ontario Ministry of Long-Term Care. We used hierarchical logistic and count-based methods to model the associations between nursing home profit status (for-profit, non-profit or municipal) and nursing home COVID-19 outbreaks, COVID-19 outbreak sizes, and COVID-19 resident deaths. Results: The analysis included all 623 Ontario nursing homes, of which 360 (57.7%) were for-profit, 162 (26.0%) were non-profit, and 101 (16.2%) were municipal homes. There were 190 (30.5%) COVID-19 nursing home outbreaks involving 5218 residents (mean of 27.5 +\/- 41.3 residents per home), resulting in 1452 deaths (mean of 7.6 +\/- 12.7 residents per home) with an overall case fatality rate of 27.8%. The odds of a COVID-19 outbreak was associated with the incidence of COVID-19 in the health region surrounding a nursing home (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.94; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-3.09) and number of beds (aOR, 1.40; 95% CI 1.20-1.63), but not profit status. For-profit status was associated with both the size of a nursing home outbreak (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 1.96; 95% CI 1.26-3.05) and the number of resident deaths (aRR, 1.78; 95% CI 1.03-3.07), compared to non-profit homes. These associations were mediated by a higher prevalence of older nursing home design standards in for-profit homes. Interpretation: For-profit status is associated with the size of a COVID-19 nursing home outbreak and the number of resident deaths, but not the likelihood of outbreaks. Differences between for profit and non-profit homes are largely explained by older design standards, which should be a focus of infection control efforts and future policy.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nathan M.

Developing models to quantify the risk of poor outcomes in infected patients could help develop strategies to shield the most vulnerable during de-confinement. Objective To develop and externally validate COVID-19 Estimated Risk (COVER) scores that quantify a patient's risk of hospital admission (COVER-H), requiring intensive services (COVER-I), or fatality (COVER-F) in the 30-days following COVID-19 diagnosis. Design Multinational, distributed network cohorts. Setting We analyzed a federated network of electronic medical records and administrative claims data from 13 data sources and 6 countries, mapped to a common data model. Participants Model development used a patient population consisting of >2 million patients with a general practice (GP), emergency room (ER), or outpatient (OP) visit with diagnosed influenza or flu-like symptoms any time prior to 2020. The model was validated on patients with a GP, ER, or OP visit in 2020 with a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis across four databases from South Korea, Spain and the United States. Outcomes Age, sex, historical conditions, and drug use prior to index date were considered as candidate predictors. Outcomes included i) hospitalization with pneumonia, ii) hospitalization with pneumonia requiring intensive services or death, and iii) death in the 30 days after index date. Results Overall, 43,061 COVID-19 patients were included for model validation, after initial model development and validation using 6,869,127 patients with influenza or flu-like symptoms. We identified 7 predictors (history of cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and kidney disease) which combined with age and sex could discriminate which patients would experience any of our three outcomes. The models achieved high performance in influenza. When transported to COVID-19 cohorts, the AUC ranges were, COVER-H: 0.73-0.81, COVER-I: 0.73-0.91, and COVER-F: 0.82-0.90. Calibration was overall acceptable, with overestimated risk in the most elderly and highest risk strata. Conclusions and relevance A 9-predictor model performs well for COVID-19 patients for predicting hospitalization, intensive services and death. The models could aid in providing reassurance for low risk patients and shield high risk patients from COVID-19 during de-confinement to reduce the virus' impact on morbidity and mortality.","rel_num_authors":48,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ross D.

In order to evaluate the early indicators for true lethality and recovery time, the data where the model is built must be quality checked. Each country sets different procedures and criteria for fatality count due to COVID-19 and the health system is stressed by having insufficient testing, untracked patients and premature discharge. In this paper the dynamics behind such data quality issues are discussed throughout the disease course to support better modeling and decision-making processes in a stressed healthcare system. From 593.291 cases in the sample, and its 7 representative groups, the recovery time and the local CFR are negatively correlated, having the highest fatality rates (21%, Spain) the countries with shorter recovery time (11 days, Spain). Also, CFR can be an indicator of Infection inconsistencies (i.e. South Korea, CFR 1%, Time to recovery 25 days). At the review part, focus is made on the inconsistencies detected in Germany and South Korea datasets as well as the potential misfits on China and Spain. Overall, the Time to Fatality ranges between 4 and 8 days, and the mean is of 6 days (South Korea, 7 days; Japan, 6days). Only Germany and France are detecting earlier than other countries and admit 10 days before fatality occurs. One simple explanation for the local CFR and Recovery time correlation is to define such rate as a measure of the healthcare system overload. Anomalous CFR indexes point to a stressed healthcare system. The higher the overload, the more focus on critical cases and hence the higher local CFR. The COVID-19 intrinsic CFR is unlikely to change by a factor of 10x from countries with similar lifestyle, GDP per capita and health services (i.e. the Mediterranean Basin, Northern Europe, etc.). Because of this fact, early CFR measured before Healthcare system overwhelming (COVID-19 free flow) are considered to be more accurate than the measured CFR while the outbreak is still ongoing, Finally, the synthetic Infection indexes may be a helpful indirect measure of the real population infection rate and also used for data quality audit. Any model built upon inconsistent data will be complex to explain and justify.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Oriol Gallemi Rovira","author_inst":"Universitat Ramon Llull IQS"},{"author_name":"Aniek F.

However, the sensitivity of real time RT-PCR tests is low and it can take up to 8 hours to receive the test results. Radiologic methods can provide higher sensitivity. The aim of this study is to investigate the use of X-ray and convolutional neural networks for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and to differentiate it from viral and\/or bacterial pneumonia, as 2-class (bacterial pneumonia vs COVID-19 and viral pneumonia vs COVID-19) and 3-class (bacterial pneumonia, COVID-19, and healthy group (BCH), and among viral pneumonia, COVID-19, and healthy group (VCH)) experiments. METHODS 225 COVID-19, 1,583 healthy control, 2,780 bacterial pneumonia, and 1,493 viral pneumonia chest X-ray images were used. 2-class- and 3-class-experiments were performed with different convolutional neural network (ConvNet) architectures, with different variations of convolutional layers and fully-connected layers. RESULTS The results showed that bacterial pneumonia vs COVID-19 and viral pneumonia vs COVID-19 reached a mean ROC AUC of 97.32% and 96.80%, respectively. In the 3-class-experiments, macro-average F1 scores of 95.79% and 94.59% were obtained in terms of detecting COVID-19 among BCH and VCH, respectively.

In response to the growing COVID-19 pandemic, Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) have been developed to detect specific antibodies, IgG and IgM, to SARS-CoV-2 virus in human whole blood. We conducted a real-life study to evaluate the performance of two RDTs, COVID-PRESTO and COVID-DUO, compared to the gold standard, RT-PCR. Methods RT-PCR testing of SARS-Cov-2 was performed from nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected in adult patients visiting the infectious disease department at the hospital (Orleans, France). Fingertip whole blood samples taken at different time points after onset of the disease were tested with RDTs. The specificity and sensitivity of the rapid test kits compared to test of reference (RT-PCR) were calculated. Results Among 381 patients with symptoms of COVID-19 who went to the hospital for a diagnostic, 143 patients were RT-PCR negative. Results of test with RDTs were all negative for these patients, indicating a specificity of 100% for both RDTs. In the RT-PCR positive subgroup (n=238), 133 patients were tested with COVID-PRESTO and 129 patients were tested with COVID-DUO (24 patients tested with both). The further the onset of symptoms was from the date of collection, the greater the sensitivity. The sensitivity of COVID-PRESTO test ranged from 10.00% for patients having experienced their 1st symptoms from 0 to 5 days ago to 100% in patients where symptoms had occurred more than 15 days before the date of tests. For COVID-DUO test, the sensitivity ranged from 35.71% [0-5 days] to 100% (> 15 days). Conclusion COVID-PRESTO and DUO RDTs turned out to be very specific (none false positive) and to be sensitive enough after 15 days from onset of symptom. These easy to use IgG\/IgM combined test kits are the first ones allowing a screening with capillary blood sample, by typing from a finger prick. These rapid tests are particularly interesting for screening in low resource settings.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thierry Prazuck","author_inst":"CHR Orleans, Department of infectious and tropical diseases"},{"author_name":"Mathilda Colin","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Susanna Giache","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Camelia Gubavu","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Aymeric Seve","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Vincent Rzepecki","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Marie Chevereau-Choquet","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases"},{"author_name":"Catherine Kiani","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Victor Rodi","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Elsa Lyonnet","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Laura Courtellemont","author_inst":"Department of virology, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Jerome Guinard","author_inst":"Department of virology, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Gilles Pialoux","author_inst":"Department of infectious diseases, Hopital Tenon"},{"author_name":"Laurent Hocqueloux","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Edward Burn","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Young Choi","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Iannis Drakos","author_inst":"Center for Surgical Science, Koege, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Maria Fernandes Abrah\u00e3o","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Sergio Fern\u00e1ndez-Bertol\u00edn","author_inst":"Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol)"},{"author_name":"George Hripcsak","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Kaas-Hansen","author_inst":"Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark  NNF Centre for Protein Research, University of Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Prasanna Kandukuri","author_inst":"Abbvie, Chicago, United States"},{"author_name":"Jan A.

For other respiratory tract infections community hand hygiene interventions are supported by evidence from randomised trials, but information on how effectiveness in reducing transmission scales with achieved changes in hand hygiene behaviour is lacking. This information is of critical importance when considering the potential value of substantially enhancing community hand hygiene frequency to help suppress COVID-19. Here, we developed a simple model-based framework for understanding the key determinants of the effectiveness of changes in hand hygiene behaviour in reducing transmission and use it to explore the potential impact of interventions aimed at achieving large-scale population-wide changes in hand hygiene behaviour. Our analyses show that the effect of hand hygiene is highly dependent on the duration of viral persistence on hands and that hand washing needs to be performed very frequently or immediately after hand contamination events in order to substantially reduce the probability of infection. Hand washing at a lower frequency, such as every 30 minutes or with a delay of 15 minutes after contamination events, may be adequate to reduce the probability of infection when viral survival on hands is longer, such as when hands are contaminated with mucus. Immediate hand washing after contamination is more effective than hand washing at fixed-time intervals even when the total number of hand washing events is similar. This event-prompted hand washing strategy is consistently more effective than fixed-time strategy regardless of hand contamination rates and should be highlighted in hand hygiene campaigns.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Thi Mui Pham","author_inst":"Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care of the UMC Utrecht"},{"author_name":"Yin Mo","author_inst":"Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Ben Cooper","author_inst":"Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"},{"author_name":"Camelia Gubavu","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Aymeric Seve","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Vincent Rzepecki","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Marie Chevereau-Choquet","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases"},{"author_name":"Catherine Kiani","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Victor Rodi","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Elsa Lyonnet","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Laura Courtellemont","author_inst":"Department of virology, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Jerome Guinard","author_inst":"Department of virology, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Gilles Pialoux","author_inst":"Department of infectious diseases, Hopital Tenon"},{"author_name":"Laurent Hocqueloux","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Edward Burn","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Young Choi","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Iannis Drakos","author_inst":"Center for Surgical Science, Koege, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Maria Fernandes Abrah\u00e3o","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Sergio Fern\u00e1ndez-Bertol\u00edn","author_inst":"Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol)"},{"author_name":"George Hripcsak","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Kaas-Hansen","author_inst":"Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark  NNF Centre for Protein Research, University of Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Prasanna Kandukuri","author_inst":"Abbvie, Chicago, United States"},{"author_name":"Jan A.

The situation is even worse for emerging economies like India. WHO recommends mass scale testing as one of the most effective ways to contain its spread and fight the pandemic. But, due to the high cost and shortage of test kits, specifically in India, the testing is restricted to only those who are symptomatic. In this context, pooled testing is recommended by some experts as a partial solution to overcome this problem. In this article, we explain the basic statistical theory behind the pooled testing procedure for screening as well as prevalence estimation. In real world situations, the tests are imperfect, and lead to false positive and false negative results. We provide theoretical explanation of the impact of these diagnostic errors on the performances of individual testing and pooled testing procedures. Finally, we study the effect of misspecification of sensitivity and specificity of tests on the estimate of prevalence, an issue, which is debated a lot among the scientists in the context of COVID-19. Our theoretical investigations lead to some interesting and precise understanding of some of these issues.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pritha Guha","author_inst":"XLRI-Xavier School of Management, Jamshedpur, Jharkhand-831001, India"},{"author_name":"Apratim Guha","author_inst":"XLRI-Xavier School of Management, Jamshedpur, Jharkhand-831001, India"},{"author_name":"Tathagata Bandyopadhyay","author_inst":"Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, Gujarat-380015, India"},{"author_name":"Camelia Gubavu","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Aymeric Seve","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Vincent Rzepecki","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Marie Chevereau-Choquet","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases"},{"author_name":"Catherine Kiani","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Victor Rodi","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Elsa Lyonnet","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Laura Courtellemont","author_inst":"Department of virology, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Jerome Guinard","author_inst":"Department of virology, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Gilles Pialoux","author_inst":"Department of infectious diseases, Hopital Tenon"},{"author_name":"Laurent Hocqueloux","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Edward Burn","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Young Choi","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Iannis Drakos","author_inst":"Center for Surgical Science, Koege, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Maria Fernandes Abrah\u00e3o","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Sergio Fern\u00e1ndez-Bertol\u00edn","author_inst":"Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol)"},{"author_name":"George Hripcsak","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Kaas-Hansen","author_inst":"Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark  NNF Centre for Protein Research, University of Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Prasanna Kandukuri","author_inst":"Abbvie, Chicago, United States"},{"author_name":"Jan A.

Diagnostics which detect active asymptomatic infection, which are suitable for monitoring and surveillance, may be of benefit to the visceral leishmaniasis (VL) elimination campaign on the ISC. Methodology\/Principal Findings: Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), the direct agglutination test (DAT), and the Leishmania antigen ELISA were carried out on blood and urine samples collected from 720 household and neighbouring contacts of 276 VL and post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) index cases, with no symptoms or history of VL and PKDL, in endemic regions of Bangladesh between September 2016 and March 2018. Of the 720 contacts of index cases, asymptomatic infection was detected in 69 (9.6%) participants by a combination of qPCR (1.0%), LAMP (2.1%), DAT (3.9%), and Leishmania antigen ELISA (3.3%). Only 1 (0.1%) participant was detected positive by all 4 diagnostic tests. Poor agreement between tests was calculated using Cohen's kappa statistics, however the Leishmania antigen ELISA and DAT in combination capture all participants positive by more than one test. We find strong evidence for association between the index case being a PKDL case (OR 1.94, p = 0.009), specifically macular PKDL (OR 2.12, p = 0.004) and being positive for at least one of the four tests. Conclusions\/Significance: Leishmania antigen ELISA detects active asymptomatic infection, requires a non-invasive sample, and therefore may be of benefit for monitoring transmission and surveillance in an elimination setting in combination with serology. Development of an antigen detection test in RDT format would be of benefit to the elimination campaign.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sophie I Owen","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Liverpool, UK"},{"author_name":"Faria Hossain","author_inst":"International Centre for Diarrhoeal Diseases Research (icddr,b), Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Prakash Ghosh","author_inst":"International Centre for Diarrhoeal Diseases Research (icddr,b), Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Rajashree Chowdhury","author_inst":"International Centre for Diarrhoeal Diseases Research (icddr,b), Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Md.

A coefficient (slope of the meta-regression line) for COVID-19 prevalence was significantly negative for male sex, education attainment, computer and Internet use, and private health insurance. Whereas, the coefficient was significantly positive for black race, never matrimony, unemployment, and poverty. In the multivariable model, the coefficient was significantly negative for male sex (P = 0.036) and computer use (P = 0.024), and significantly positive for never matrimony (P < 0.001). A coefficient for COVID-19 fatality was significantly negative for no health insurance, and significantly positive for elderly, unemployment, and public coverage. In the multivariable model, the coefficient was significantly positive for only elderly (P = 0.002). In conclusion, a number of socioeconomic factors, e.g. male sex (negatively for prevalence), elderly (positively for fatality), never matrimony (positively for prevalence), and computer use (negatively for prevalence) may be associated with COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Hisato Takagi","author_inst":"Shizuoka Medical Center, Kitasato University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Toshiki Kuno","author_inst":"Mount Sinai Beth Israel Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Yujiro Yokoyama","author_inst":"Easton Hospital"},{"author_name":"Hiroki Ueyama","author_inst":"Mount Sinai Beth Israel Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Takuya Matsushiro","author_inst":"Shizuoka Medical Center, Kitasato University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yosuke Hari","author_inst":"Shizuoka Medical Center, Kitasato University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Tomo Ando","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian Hospital\/Columbia University Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Albert Picado","author_inst":"Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND), Geneva, Switzerland"},{"author_name":"Dinesh Mondal","author_inst":"International Centre for Diarrhoeal Diseases Research (icddr,b), Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"author_name":"Emily R Adams","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Liverpool, UK"},{"author_name":"Laura Courtellemont","author_inst":"Department of virology, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Jerome Guinard","author_inst":"Department of virology, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Gilles Pialoux","author_inst":"Department of infectious diseases, Hopital Tenon"},{"author_name":"Laurent Hocqueloux","author_inst":"Department of infectious and tropical diseases, CHR Orleans"},{"author_name":"Edward Burn","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Young Choi","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Republic of Korea"},{"author_name":"Iannis Drakos","author_inst":"Center for Surgical Science, Koege, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Maria Fernandes Abrah\u00e3o","author_inst":"Faculty of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"},{"author_name":"Sergio Fern\u00e1ndez-Bertol\u00edn","author_inst":"Fundacio Institut Universitari per a la recerca a l'Atencio Primaria de Salut Jordi Gol i Gurina (IDIAPJGol)"},{"author_name":"George Hripcsak","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Kaas-Hansen","author_inst":"Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark  NNF Centre for Protein Research, University of Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Prasanna Kandukuri","author_inst":"Abbvie, Chicago, United States"},{"author_name":"Jan A.

Digital manufacturing, especially 3D printing, has been promulgated as an important approach for the rapid development of new products as well as a replacement manufacturing technique for many traditional manufacturing methods, including injection molding, when supply chains are disrupted. Herein we report the use of Digital Light Synthesis (DLS) for the design and large-scale deployment of nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs for testing of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans. NP swabs have been one of society's essential products hardest hit by the supply chain disruptions caused by COVID-19. A latticed tip NP swab was designed and fabricated by DLS from a liquid resin previously developed and approved for use to make dental night guard devices.

Attention initially focussed on severe presentations, intensive care capacity, and the timely supply of equipment. General practice has seen a rapid take up of technology to allow virtual consultations, enabling the management of mild and moderate community cases. Aim To quantify the prevalence and time-course of suspected COVID-19 presenting to general practices during the London epidemic. To report disease prevalence by ethnic group, and explore how far differences by ethnicity can be explained by data in the electronic health record (EHR). Design and Setting Cross-sectional study using anonymised data from the primary care records of 1.3 million people registered with 157 practices in four adjacent east London clinical commissioning groups (CCGs). The study area includes 48% of people from ethnic minorities and is in the top decile of social deprivation in England. Method Suspected COVID-19 cases were identified using SNOMED codes. Explanatory variables included age, gender, self-reported ethnicity and measures of social deprivation. Clinical factors included 16 long-term conditions, latest body mass index and smoking status. Results There were 8,985 suspected COVID-19 cases. Ethnicity recording was 78% complete. Univariate analysis showed a two-fold increase in odds of infection for South Asian and Black adults compared to White. In a fully adjusted analysis, including clinical factors, the odds were: South Asian OR 1.93 (95% CI = 1.83 to 2.04) Black OR 1.47 (95% CI 1.38 to 1.57) Conclusions Using data in GP records Black and south Asian ethnicity remain as predictors of community cases of COVID-19, with levels of risk similar to hospital admission cases. Further understanding of these differences requires social and occupational data.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sally A Hull","author_inst":"Queen Mary University of London"},{"author_name":"Crystal Williams","author_inst":"Queen Mary University London"},{"author_name":"Mark Ashworth","author_inst":"School of Population Health and Environmental Sciences, King's College London"},{"author_name":"Chris Carvalho","author_inst":"Queen Mary University London"},{"author_name":"Kambiz Boomla","author_inst":"Queen Mary University London"},{"author_name":"Marie Herring","author_inst":"Carbon, Inc."},{"author_name":"Hardik Kabaria","author_inst":"Carbon, Inc"},{"author_name":"Christina Kong","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Blane Larson","author_inst":"Resolution Medical, LLC"},{"author_name":"Owen Lu","author_inst":"Carbon, Inc."},{"author_name":"Arielle Maxner","author_inst":"Carbon, Inc."},{"author_name":"Elle Meyer","author_inst":"Carbon, Inc."},{"author_name":"Shawn Patterson","author_inst":"Resolution Medical, LLC."},{"author_name":"Steve Pollack","author_inst":"Carbon, Inc."},{"author_name":"Jason Rolland","author_inst":"Carbon, Inc."},{"author_name":"Steven Schmidt","author_inst":"Resolution Medical, LLC"},{"author_name":"Sridhar Seshadri","author_inst":"Stanford Health Care"},{"author_name":"Keshav Swarup","author_inst":"Carbon, Inc."},{"author_name":"Chelsey Thomas","author_inst":"Stanford Health Care"},{"author_name":"Ryan Van Wert","author_inst":"Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Kaas-Hansen","author_inst":"Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark  NNF Centre for Protein Research, University of Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"author_name":"Prasanna Kandukuri","author_inst":"Abbvie, Chicago, United States"},{"author_name":"Jan A.

Design: An outbreak investigation. Setting: 4 nursing homes affected by COVID-19 outbreaks in central London. Participants: 394 residents and 70 staff in nursing homes. Interventions: Two point-prevalence surveys one week apart where residents underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing and had relevant symptoms documented. Asymptomatic staff from three of the four homes were also offered SARS-CoV-2 testing. Main outcome measures: All-cause mortality, and mortality attributed to COVID-19 on death certificates. Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptoms in residents and staff. Results: Overall, 26% (95% confidence interval 22 to 31) of residents died over the two-month period. All-cause mortality increased by 203% (95% CI 70 to 336). Systematic testing identified 40% (95% CI 35 to 46) of residents, of whom 43% (95% CI 34 to 52) were asymptomatic and 18% (95% CI 11 to 24) had atypical symptoms, as well as 4% (95% CI -1 to 9) of asymptomatic staff who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions: The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was associated with a very high mortality rate in residents of nursing homes. Systematic testing of all residents and a representative sample of staff identified high rates of SARS-CoV-2 positivity across the four nursing homes, highlighting a potential for regular screening to prevent future outbreaks.","rel_num_authors":21,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Neil SN Graham","author_inst":"UK DRI Centre for Care Research and Technology, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Cornelia Junghans","author_inst":"Department of Primary Care and Public Health, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Rawlda Downes","author_inst":"Department of Elderly Medicine, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, Charing Cross Hospital, London W6 8RF, UK"},{"author_name":"Catherine Sendall","author_inst":"Department of Elderly Medicine, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, Charing Cross Hospital, London W6 8RF, UK"},{"author_name":"Helen Lai","author_inst":"UK DRI Centre for Care Research and Technology, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Annie McKirdy","author_inst":"5.\tNorth West London Health Protection Team, Public Health England, 61 Colindale Avenue, Colindale, London NW9 5EQ"},{"author_name":"Paul Elliott","author_inst":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Robert Howard","author_inst":"Division of Psychiatry, UCL, 149 Tottenham Court Road, London W1T 7NF"},{"author_name":"David Wingfield","author_inst":"Department of Metabolism, Digestion & Reproduction, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Miles Priestman","author_inst":"London Biofoundry, Imperial College Translation & Innovation Hub, White City Campus, 80 Wood Lane, London, W12 0BZ, UK"},{"author_name":"Marta Ciechonska","author_inst":"London Biofoundry, Imperial College Translation & Innovation Hub, White City Campus, 80 Wood Lane, London, W12 0BZ, UK"},{"author_name":"Loren Cameron","author_inst":"Section of Structural and Synthetic Biology, Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, London, SW7 2AZ, UK"},{"author_name":"Marko Storch","author_inst":"London Biofoundry, Imperial College Translation & Innovation Hub, White City Campus, 80 Wood Lane, London, W12 0BZ, UK"},{"author_name":"Michael Crone","author_inst":"London Biofoundry, Imperial College Translation & Innovation Hub, White City Campus, 80 Wood Lane, London, W12 0BZ, UK"},{"author_name":"Paul Freemont","author_inst":"London Biofoundry, Imperial College Translation & Innovation Hub, White City Campus, 80 Wood Lane, London, W12 0BZ, UK"},{"author_name":"Paul Randell","author_inst":"North West London Pathology, Charing Cross Hospital, London W6 8RF, UK"},{"author_name":"Robert McLaren","author_inst":"Park Medical Centre, Hammersmith, London W6 0QG"},{"author_name":"Nicola Lang","author_inst":"Hammersmith & Fulham Council, 3 Shortlands, Hammersmith W6 8DA"},{"author_name":"Shamez Ladhani","author_inst":"Immunisation and Countermeasures Division, Public Health England, 61 Colindale Avenue, London NW9 5EQ, UK"},{"author_name":"Frances Sanderson","author_inst":"Department of Infection, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, Charing Cross Hospital, London W6 8RF, UK"},{"author_name":"David J Sharp","author_inst":"UK Dementia Research Institute Centre for Care Research and Technology, Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Prasanna Kandukuri","author_inst":"Abbvie, Chicago, United States"},{"author_name":"Jan A.

The dynamics of the model are influenced by the number of asymptomatic cases, hospitalization requirements and mortality due to the disease. A locally-informed model was determined using actual hospitalization records. Together with cases and casualty data, optimized estimates for model parameters were obtained within a metaheuristic framework based on Particle Swarm Optimization. Our strategy is supported by a statistical sensitivity analysis on the model parameters, adequate to properly account for the simulated scenarios. First, we evaluated the effect of previously enforced interventions on the transmission rate. Then, we studied its effects on the number of deaths as well as hospitalization requirements, considering the state as a whole. Special attention is given to the impact of asymptomatic individuals on the dynamic of COVID-19 transmission, as these were estimated to contribute to a 68% increase in the basic reproductive number. Finally, we delineated scenarios that can set guides to protect the health care system, particularly by keeping demand below total bed occupancy. Our results underscore the challenges related to maintaining a fully capable health infrastructure during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, specially in a low-resource setting such as the one focused in this work. The evidences produced by our modelling-based analysis show that decreasing the transmission rate is paramount to success in maintaining health resources availability, but that current local efforts, leading to a 38% decrease in the transmission rate, are still insufficient to prevent its collapse at peak demand. Carefully planned and timely applied interventions, that result in stark decreases in transmission rate, were found to be the most effective in preventing hospital bed shortages for the longest periods.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Juliane Fonseca Oliveira","author_inst":"Center of Data and Knowledge Integration for Health, Instituto Goncalo Moniz, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz"},{"author_name":"Daniel C.

Methods: We evaluated the risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among patients living with cancer compared to the general community and whether cancer-related treatments influence this risk. Data were collected from the COVID Symptom Study smartphone application since March 24, 2020 (United Kingdom), March 29 (U.S.), and April 29, 2020 (Sweden) through May 8, 2020. We used multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of a positive COVID-19 test as well as predicted COVID-19 infection using a validated symptom model. Results: Among 23,266 participants with cancer and 1,784,293 without cancer, we documented 10,404 reports of a positive COVID-19 test. Compared to participants without cancer, those living with cancer had 62% increased risk of a positive COVID-19 test (95% CI: 1.37-1.91). Among patients with cancer, current treatment with chemotherapy\/immunotherapy was associated with a nearly 2.5-fold increased risk of a positive test (aOR: 2.42; 95% CI: 1.81-3.25). The association between cancer and COVID-19+ was stronger among participants >65 years (aOR: 1.93; 95%CI: 1.51-2.46) compared to younger participants (aOR: 1.32; 95%CI: 1.06-1.64; Pinteraction<0.001); and among males (aOR: 1.71; 95%CI: 1.36-2.15) compared to females (aOR: 1.43; 95%CI: 1.14-1.79; Pinteraction=0.02). Conclusions: Individuals with cancer had a significantly increased risk of infection compared to the general community. Those treated with chemotherapy or immunotherapy were particularly at-risk of infection.

Early introduction of first measure (significance p=0.048, regression coefficient {beta}=-0.004, 95% confidence interval 0 to -0.008), early international travel restrictions (p=0.042, ({beta}=-0.005, -0.001 to -0.009) and early public information (p=0.021, {beta}=-0.005, -0.001 to -0.009) were associated with reduced LogC. Early introduction of first measure (p=0.003, {beta}=-0.007, -0.003 to -0.011), early international travel restrictions (p=0.003, {beta}=-0.008, -0.004 to-0.012), early public information (p=0.003, {beta}=-0.007, 0.003 to -0.011), early generalised workplace closure (p=0.031, {beta}=-0.012, -0.002 to -0.022) and early generalised school closure (p=0.050, {beta}=-0.012, 0 to -0.024) were associated with reduced LogC. Conclusions At this stage in the pandemic, early institution of public information, international travel restrictions, and workplace closure are associated with reduced COVID-19 mortality and maintaining these policies may help control the pandemic.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dimitris I Papadopoulos","author_inst":"Chelsea and Westminister NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Ivo Donkov","author_inst":"Chelsea and Westminister NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Konstantinos Charitopoulos","author_inst":"Chelsea and Westminister NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Samuel Bishara","author_inst":"Chelsea and Westminister NHS Trust"},{"author_name":"Claire J Steves","author_inst":"Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, Kings College London, London, U.K."},{"author_name":"Tim D Spector","author_inst":"Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology, Kings College London, London, U.K."},{"author_name":"Andrew T Chan","author_inst":"Clinical and Translational Epidemiology Unit and Division of Gastroenterology, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School.

Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells may be instrumental in the resolution of and protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we tested 25 hospitalized patients with either microbiologically documented Covid-19 (n=19) or highly suspected of having the disease (n=6) for the presence of SARS-CoV-2-reactive- CD69+-expressing interferon-gamma;-producing-(IFN-gamma;) CD8+ T cells by a flow-cytometry for intracelular cytokine staining assay. Two sets of overlapping peptides encompassing the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein N-terminal 1-643 amino acid sequence and the entire sequence of SARS-CoV-2 M protein were used simultaneously as antigenic stimulus. Ten patients (40%) had detectable responses, displaying frequencies ranging from 0.15 to 2.7% (median of 0.57 cells\/microlitre; range, 0.43-9.98 cells\/microlitre). The detection rate of SARS-CoV-2-reactive IFN-gamma; CD8+ T cells in patients admitted to intensive care was comparable (P=0.28) to that in patients hospitalized in other medical wards. No correlation was found between SARS-CoV-2-reactive IFN-gamma; CD8+ T-cell counts and SARS-CoV-2 S-specific antibody levels. Likewise, no correlation was observed between either SARS-CoV-2-reactive IFN-gamma; CD8+ T cells or S-specific IgG-antibody titers and blood cell count or levels of inflammatory biomarkers. In summary, in this descriptive, preliminary study we showed that SARS-CoV-2-reactive IFN-gamma; CD8+ T cells can be detected in a non-negligible percentage of patients with moderate to severe forms of Covid-19. Further studies are warranted to determine whether quantitation of these T-cell subsets may provide prognostic information on the clinical course of Covid-19.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Estela Gimenez","author_inst":"Microbiology Service, Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Eliseo Albert","author_inst":"Microbiology Service, Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Ignacio Torres","author_inst":"Microbiology Service, Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Maria Jose Remigia","author_inst":"Hematology Service, Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Maria Jesus Alcaraz","author_inst":"Microbiology Service, Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Maria Jose Galindo","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Maria Luisa Blasco","author_inst":"Medical Intensive Care Unit, Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Carlos Solano","author_inst":"Hematology Service, Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain.Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Val"},{"author_name":"Maria Jose Forner","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain.

This study aimed at investigating the performance of three high-throughput assays and one rapid lateral flow test relative to the recommended criteria defined by regulatory authorities. Methods: A total of 133 samples, including 100 pre-pandemic samples, 20 samples from SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive individuals, and 13 potentially cross-reactive samples were analysed with SARS-CoV-2 IgG (Abbott), Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Roche), LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1\/S2 IgG (DiaSorin) and 2019-nCOV IgG\/IgM Rapid Test (Dynamiker Biotechnology Co). Results: All assays performed with a high level of specificity; however, only Abbott reached 100% (95% CI 96.3-100). The pre-pandemic samples analysed with Roche, DiaSorin and Dynamiker Biotechnology resulted in two to three false-positive results per method (specificity 96.9-98.0%). Sensitivity differed more between the assays, Roche exhibiting the highest sensitivity (100%, CI 83.9-100). The corresponding figures for Abbott, DiaSorin and Dynamiker Biotechnology were 85.0%, 77.8% and 75.0%, respectively. Conclusions: The results of the evaluated SARS-CoV-2 assays vary considerably as well as their ability to fulfil the performance criteria proposed by regulatory authorities. Introduction into clinical use in low-prevalent settings, should therefore, be made with caution.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Oskar Ekelund","author_inst":"Region Kronoberg"},{"author_name":"Kim Ekblom","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Vaxjo Central Hospital, Vaxjo, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Sofia Somajo","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Blekinge County Hospital, Karlskrona, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Johanna Pattison-Granberg","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Vaxjo Central Hospital, Vaxjo, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Karl Olsson","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Microbiology, Blekinge County Hospital, Karlskrona, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Annika Petersson","author_inst":"Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Vaxjo Central Hospital, Vaxjo, Sweden"},{"author_name":"Maria Luisa Blasco","author_inst":"Medical Intensive Care Unit, Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain."},{"author_name":"Carlos Solano","author_inst":"Hematology Service, Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain.Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Val"},{"author_name":"Maria Jose Forner","author_inst":"Internal Medicine Department, Clinic University Hospital, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain.
