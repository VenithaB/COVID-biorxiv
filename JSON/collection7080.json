Here we present a compartmental model for the disease where symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals move separately. We introduced healthcare burden parameters allowing to infer possible containment and suppression strategies. In addition, the model was scaled up to describe different interconnected areas, giving the possibility to trigger regionalized measures. It was specially adjusted to Mendoza-Argentina's parameters, but is easily adaptable for elsewhere. Overall, the simulations we carried out were notably more effective when mitigation measures were not relaxed in between the suppressive actions. Since asymptomatics or very mildly affected patients are the vast majority, we studied the impact of detecting and isolating them. The removal of asymptomatics from the infectious pool remarkably lowered the effective reproduction number, healthcare burden and overall fatality. Furthermore, different suppression triggers regarding ICU occupancy were attempted. The best scenario was found to be the combination of ICU occupancy triggers (on: 50%, off: 30%) with the detection and isolation of asymptomatic individuals. In the ideal assumption that 45% of the asymptomatics could be detected and isolated, there would be no need for quarantine, and Mendoza's healthcare system would not collapse. Our model and its analysis inform that the detection and isolation of all infected individuals, without leaving aside the asymptomatic group is the key to surpass this pandemic.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"L\u00eda Mayorga","author_inst":"Instituto de Histolog\u00eda y Embriolog\u00eda de Mendoza (IHEM, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo, CONICET)"},{"author_name":"Clara Garc\u00eda Samartino","author_inst":"Facultad de Ciencias M\u00e9dicas, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo"},{"author_name":"Gabriel Flores","author_inst":"Eventbrite Company"},{"author_name":"Sof\u00eda Masuelli","author_inst":"Instituto de Histolog\u00eda y Embriolog\u00eda de Mendoza (IHEM, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo, CONICET)"},{"author_name":"Mar\u00eda Victoria S\u00e1nchez","author_inst":"Instituto de Medicina y Biolog\u00eda Experimental de Cuyo (IMBECU), Centro Cient\u00edfico y Tecnol\u00f3gico de Mendoza (CCT-Mendoza), Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Ci"},{"author_name":"Luis S.

To maintain control of infection while also reducing disruption to populations, there is a need to understand what combination of measures - including novel digital tracing approaches and less intensive physical distancing - may be required to reduce transmission. Using a model of individual-level transmission stratified by setting (household, work, school, other) based on BBC Pandemic data from 40,162 UK participants, we simulated the impact of a range of different testing, isolation, tracing and physical distancing scenarios. As well as estimating reduction in effective reproduction number, we estimated, for a given level of COVID-19 incidence, the number of contacts that would be newly quarantined each day under different strategies. Under optimistic but plausible assumptions, we estimated that combined testing and tracing strategies would reduce transmission more than mass testing or self-isolation alone (50-65% compared to 2-30%). If limits are placed on gatherings outside of home\/school\/work (e.g. maximum of 4 daily contacts in other settings), then manual contact tracing of acquaintances only could have a similar effect on transmission reduction as detailed contact tracing. In a scenario where there were 10,000 new symptomatic cases per day, we estimated in most contact tracing strategies, 140,000 to 390,000 contacts would be newly quarantined each day. Consistent with previous modelling studies and country-specific COVID-19 responses to date, our analysis estimates that a high proportion of cases would need to self-isolate and a high proportion of their contacts to be successfully traced to ensure an effective reproduction number that is below one in the absence of other measures. If combined with moderate physical distancing measures, self-isolation and contact tracing would be more likely to achieve control.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Adam J Kucharski","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Petra Klepac","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Andrew Conlan","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Stephen M Kissler","author_inst":"Harvard T.H.

While mathematical models have suggested the efficacy of social distancing to curb the spread of CoV-2, there is a lack of systematic studies to quantify the real-world efficacy of these approaches. Here, we quantify the spread rate of COVID19 before and after national social distancing measures were implemented in 26 nations and compare this to the changes in COVID19 spread rate over equivalent time periods in 27 nations that did not enact social distancing policies. We find that social distancing policies significantly reduced the COVID19 spread rate. Using mixed linear regression models we estimate that social distancing policies reduced the spread of COVID19 by 66%.

Individual-based models (IBM) simulating the spread of infection in a population have a few advantages compared to classical equation-based approach. First, they use individuals as units, which represent the population, and reflect the local variations happening in real life. Second, the simplicity of modelling the interactions between the individuals, which may not be the case when using differential equations. We propose to use freely available population density maps to simulate the infection spread in the human population on the scale of an individual country or a city. We explore the effect of social distancing and show that it can reduce the outbreak when applied before or during peak time, but it can also inflict the second wave when relaxed after the peak. This can be explained by a large proportion of susceptible individuals, even in the large cities, after the first wave. The model can be adapted to any spatial scale from a single hospital to multiple countries.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gregory I Mashanov","author_inst":"The Francis Crick Institute"},{"author_name":"Alla Mashanova","author_inst":"The University of Hertfordshire"},{"author_name":"Efren Murillo-Zamora","author_inst":"Departamento de Epidemiologia, Unidad de Medicina Familiar No. 19,  IMSS"},{"author_name":"Raghu Kalluri","author_inst":"The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Maria Tang","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Hannah Fry","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Julia Gog","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"John Edmunds","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"- CMMID COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":"-"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.23.20077438","rel_title":"Several countries in one: a mathematical modeling analysis for COVID-19 in inner Brazil","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.23.20077438","rel_abs":"Early 2020 and the world experiences its very first pandemic of globalized era. A novel coronavirus, SARS-Cov-2, is the causative agent of severe pneumonia and rapidly spread through many nations, crashing health systems. In Brazil, the emergence of local epidemics in major metropolitan areas is a concern. In a huge and heterogeneous country, with regional disparities and climate diversity, several factors can modulate the dynamics of COVID-19. What should be the scenario for an inner Brazil and what can we do to control infection transmission in each one of these locations? In this paper, a mathematical model was developed to simulate disease transmission among individuals in several scenarios, differing by the intensity and type of control measures. Mitigation strategies rely on social distancing of all individuals, and detection and isolation of infected ones. The model shows that control effort varies among cities. The social distancing is the most efficient method to control disease transmission but improving detection and isolation of infected individuals can help loosening this mitigation strategy.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gabriel Berg de Almeida","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Botucatu"},{"author_name":"Thomas Vilches","author_inst":"University of Campinas, IMECC"},{"author_name":"Claudia Ferreira","author_inst":"Institute of Biosciences Botucatu"},{"author_name":"Carlos Magno Castelo Branco Fortaleza","author_inst":"Faculdade de Medicina de Botucatu"},{"author_name":"Maria Tang","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Hannah Fry","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Julia Gog","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"John Edmunds","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"- CMMID COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":"-"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.23.20077123","rel_title":"Significantly Improved COVID-19 Outcomes in Countries with Higher BCG Vaccination Coverage: A Multivariable Analysis","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.23.20077123","rel_abs":"COVID-19 has spread to 210 countries within 3 months.

The results from multivariable regression tests with 22 economical, demographic, and health-related quantitative properties for each country substantiate the dominant contribution of BCG administration years to the COVID-19 outcomes. Analyzing countries according to an age-group partition reveals that the strongest correlation is attributed to the coverage in BCG vaccination of the young population and mostly to recent years immunization.

This motivates the use of data integration, combining data from diverse sources and eliciting useful information with a unified view of them. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model that integrates global data for real-time prediction of infection trajectory for multiple countries. Because the proposed model takes advantage of borrowing information across multiple countries, it outperforms an existing individual country-based model. As fully Bayesian way has been adopted, the model provides a powerful predictive tool endowed with uncertainty quantification. Additionally, the proposed model uses countrywide covariates to adjust infection trajectories in curve fitting. A joint variable selection technique has been integrated into the proposed modeling scheme, which aimed to identify possible country-level risk factors for severe disease due to COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Se Yoon Lee","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Bowen Lei","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Bani Mallick","author_inst":"Texas A&M University"},{"author_name":"Michal Linial","author_inst":"The Hebrew University of Jerusalem"},{"author_name":"Maria Tang","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"Hannah Fry","author_inst":"UCL"},{"author_name":"Julia Gog","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"John Edmunds","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"- CMMID COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":"-"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.23.20077172","rel_title":"Instantaneous R calculation for COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.23.20077172","rel_abs":"COVID-19 pandemic represents a major challenge to health systems of all countries.

However, these results are more likely to reflect the differences in the timing of and the responding to the outbreak, etc. between European countries, rather than the 'effect' of the distance to Brussels itself.

Despite efforts to carefully monitor the pandemic, the number of confirmed cases may underestimate the total number of infections. We introduce a demographic scaling model to estimate COVID-19 infections using an broadly applicable approach that is based on minimal data requirements: COVID-19 related deaths, infection fatality rates (IFRs), and life tables. As many countries lack reliable estimates of age-specific IFRs, we scale IFRs between countries using remaining life expectancy as a marker to account for differences in age structures, health conditions, and medical services. Across 10 countries with most COVID-19 deaths as of May 13, 2020, the number of infections is estimated to be four [95% prediction interval: 2-11] times higher than the number of confirmed cases. Cross-country variation is high. The estimated number of infections is 1.4 million (six times the number of confirmed cases) for Italy; 3.1 million (2.2 times the number of confirmed cases) for the U.S.; and 1.8 times the number of confirmed cases for Germany, where testing has been comparatively extensive. Our prevalence estimates, however, are markedly lower than most others based on local seroprevalence studies. We introduce formulas for quantifying the bias that is required in our data on deaths in order to reproduce estimates published elsewhere. This bias analysis shows that either COVID-19 deaths are severely underestimated, by a factor of two or more; or alternatively, the seroprevalence based results are overestimates and not representative for the total population.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christina Bohk-Ewald","author_inst":"University of Helsinki"},{"author_name":"Christian Dudel","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research"},{"author_name":"Mikko Myrskyla","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research"},{"author_name":"Emily Chia-Yu Su","author_inst":"Graduate Institute of Biomedical Informatics, College of Medical Science and Technology, TMU"},{"author_name":"Ayman Chit","author_inst":"Sanofi"},{"author_name":"Monica Gabriela Cojocaru","author_inst":"University of Guelph"},{"author_name":"Julia Gog","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"John Edmunds","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"- CMMID COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":"-"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.24.20077776","rel_title":"Development and potential usefulness of the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip diagnostic assay in a pandemic context.","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.24.20077776","rel_abs":"Introduction: COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip, an immunochromatographic (ICT) assay for the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen on nasopharyngeal specimen, has been developed to identify positive COVID-19 patients allowing prompt clinical and quarantine decisions. In this Original Research article, we describe the conception, the analytical and clinical performances as well as the risk management of implementing the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip in a diagnostic decision algorithm. Materials and Methods: Development of the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip resulted in a ready-to-use ICT assay based on a membrane technology with colloidal gold nanoparticles using monoclonal antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 highly conserved nucleoprotein antigen. Four hundred observations were recorded for the analytical performance study and thirty tests were analysed for the cross-reactivity study. The clinical performance study was performed in a retrospective multi-centric evaluation on aliquots of 328 nasopharyngeal samples. COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip results were compared with qRT-PCR as golden standard for COVID-19 diagnostics. Results: In the analytical performance study, the reproducibility showed a between-observer disagreement of 1.7%, a robustness of 98%, an overall satisfying user friendliness and no cross-reactivity with other virus-infected nasopharyngeal samples. In the clinical performance study performed in three different clinical laboratories we found an overall sensitivity and specificity of 57.6% and 99.5% respectively with an accuracy of 82.6%. The cut-off of the assay was found at Ct<22. User-friendliness analysis and risk management assessment through Ishikawa diagram demonstrate that COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip may be implemented in clinical laboratories according to biosafety recommendations. Conclusion: The COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip represents a promising rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen assay for the first-line diagnosis of COVID-19 in 15 minutes. Its role in the proposed diagnostic algorithm is complementary to the currently-used molecular techniques.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Olivier Vandenberg","author_inst":"LHUB-ULB,"},{"author_name":"Christian Dudel","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research"},{"author_name":"Mikko Myrskyla","author_inst":"Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research"},{"author_name":"Emily Chia-Yu Su","author_inst":"Graduate Institute of Biomedical Informatics, College of Medical Science and Technology, TMU"},{"author_name":"Ayman Chit","author_inst":"Sanofi"},{"author_name":"Monica Gabriela Cojocaru","author_inst":"University of Guelph"},{"author_name":"Julia Gog","author_inst":"University of Cambridge"},{"author_name":"John Edmunds","author_inst":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"- CMMID COVID-19 Working Group","author_inst":"-"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.24.20077735","rel_title":"A Novel Protein Drug, Novaferon, as the Potential Antiviral Drug for COVID-19","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.24.20077735","rel_abs":"Abstract Background Novaferon, a novel protein drug approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in China, exhibits potent antiviral activities. We aimed to determine the anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects of Novaferon in vitro, and conducted a randomized, open-label, parallel group study to explore the antiviral effects of Novaferon for COVID-19. Methods In laboratory, the inhibition of Novaferon on viral replication in cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, and on SARS-CoV-2 entry into healthy cells was determined. Antiviral effects of Novaferon were evaluated in COVID-19 patients with treatment of Novaferon, Novaferon plus Lopinavir\/Ritonavir, or Lopinavir\/Ritonavir. The primary endpoint was the SARS-CoV-2 clearance rates on day 6 of treatment, and the secondary endpoint was the time to the SARS-CoV-2 clearance in COVID-19 patients Results Novaferon inhibited the viral replication in infected cells (EC50=1.02 ng\/ml), and protected healthy cells from SARS-CoV-2 infection (EC50=0.1 ng\/ml). Results from the 89 enrolled COVID-19 patients showed that both Novaferon and Novaferon plus Lopinavir\/Ritonavir groups had significantly higher SARS-CoV-2 clearance rates on day 6 than the Lopinavir\/Ritonavir group (50.0% vs.24.1%, p = 0.0400, and 60.0% vs.24.1%, p = 0.0053). Median time to SARS-CoV-2 clearance were 6 days, 6 days, and 9 days for three groups respectively, suggesting a 3-dayreduction of time to SARS-CoV-2 clearance in both Novaferon and Novaferon plus Lopinavir\/Ritonavir groups compared with Lopinavir\/Ritonavir group. Conclusions Novaferon exhibited anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects in vitro and in COVID-19 patients. These data justified the further evaluation of Novaferon.

Africa is still early in this epidemic, therefore the spectrum of disease severity is not yet clear. Methods: We used a mathematical model to fit to the observed cases of COVID-19 in South Africa to estimate the basic reproductive number and critical vaccination coverages to con-trol the disease for different hypothetical vaccine efficacy scenarios. We also estimated the percentage reduction in effective contacts due to the social distancing measures imple-mented. Results: Early model estimates show that COVID-19 outbreak in South Africa had a basic reproductive number of 2.95 (95% credible interval [CrI] 2.83-3.33). A vaccine with 70% effi-cacy had the capacity to contain COVID-19 outbreak but at very higher vaccination cover-age 94.44% (95% Crl 92.44-99.92%) with a vaccine of 100% efficacy requiring 66.10% (95% Crl 64.72-69.95%) coverage. Social distancing measures put in place have so far reduced the number of social contacts by 80.31% (95% Crl 79.76-80.85%). Conclusions: Findings suggest a highly efficacious vaccine would have been required to con-tain COVID-19 in South Africa. Therefore, the current social distancing measures to reduce contacts will remain key in controlling the infection in the absence of vaccines and other therapeutics.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zindoga Mukandavire","author_inst":"Coventry University"},{"author_name":"Farai Nyabadza","author_inst":"University of Johannesburg"},{"author_name":"Noble J Malunguza","author_inst":"National University of Science and Technology, Bulawayo, Zimbabwe"},{"author_name":"Diego F Cuadros","author_inst":"University of Cincinnati"},{"author_name":"Tinevimbo Shiri","author_inst":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"},{"author_name":"Godfrey Musuka","author_inst":"ICAP at Columbia University, Harare, Zimbabwe"},{"author_name":"Jing Ma","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Qi Zuo","author_inst":"the First Hospital of Changsha"},{"author_name":"Xin Tan","author_inst":"the First Hospital of Changsha"},{"author_name":"Jun Xie","author_inst":"the First Hospital of Changsha"},{"author_name":"Peihua Niu","author_inst":"National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Wenlong Wang","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yun Xu","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Feng Peng","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Ning Zhou","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Chunlin Cai","author_inst":"the First Hospital of Changsha"},{"author_name":"Wei Tang","author_inst":"the First Hospital of Changsha"},{"author_name":"Xinqiang Xiao","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yi Li","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Zhiguang Zhou","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Zhiguang Zhou","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yongfang Jiang","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yuanlin Xie","author_inst":"the First Hospital of Changsha"},{"author_name":"Wenjie Tan","author_inst":"National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Guozhong Gong","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.23.20077545","rel_title":"Influence of socio-ecological factors on COVID-19 risk: a cross-sectional study based on 178 countries\/regions worldwide","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.23.20077545","rel_abs":"The initial outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in China in 2019 has been severely tested in other countries worldwide.

In doing so we provide an additional modelling basis for laying out the strategy options for the decision-makers. The main results are illustrated and discussed in Part I. In Part II, we describe the stochastic model that we have developed for modelling this epidemic. As argued in Part II, the developed model is more flexible than the SEIR\/SEIRS models and can be used for modelling the scenarios which may be difficult or impossible to model with the SEIR\/SEIRS models. To compare different scenarios for exiting from the lock-down, in Part III we provide our previous report on the same topic where similar (although not as detailed) scenarios were considered. As the possible exit dates, we have chosen May 4, May 11, May 18 and May 25. We model differently the regions with high initial reproductive number chosen to be R0=2.5, medium R0=2.3 and low R0=2.The numbers for the whole of the UK can be obtained by appropriate averaging of the numbers given in the report. Typical figures are given in Section 4. For each scenario considered, we plot the expected proportion of infected at time t and the expected number of deaths at time t. To compute the expected numbers of deaths we used the total mortality rate 0.66%. Many recent studies suggest lower values and therefore the numbers in our projections should be considered as rather pessimistic. Our analysis suggests a value around 0.5% for the mortality rate. In the model, we assume that the isolation of older and vulnerable people continues and the public carries on certain level of isolation until the end of 2020; also we assume that immunity is kept for at least a year and there is no international travel influence. Our main conclusions are: In regions with higher initial reproductive number 2.5 the proportion of susceptible at the start of the lock-down should be not smaller than 0.95, the epidemic curve in such regions is in the fast monotonic decline irrespectively of the date of the lock-down lift; In regions with lower initial reproductive number 2.0 the second mild wave can be expected, the difference between the expected mortality rates is very small for all May 2020 lifting lock-down dates; In regions with initial reproductive number 2.3, a mild second wave can be expected in the case of large proportion of susceptible at the start of the lock-down, but its severity and resulting mortality depend very little on the date of lifting the lock-down; For the overall UK epidemic, even for rather pessimistic scenarios considered, the second wave is much less pronounced (in terms of the expected mortality rate) than the first one, and the total numbers of expected deaths are within 2% for all May 2020 dates of lifting the lock-down. Moreover, by keeping R0-value after lifting the lock-down below 1.75 is likely to lead to the avoidance of a UK-wide second wave, see Section 4. We believe that the model build in this work can be considered as an important decision support tool to help decision-makers with the strategy of handling the epidemic. We invite other scholars to participate in an open discussion of the strategy options. We feel that this kind of models should be used in the short and long term management of the disease. We recommend the development of a permanent and modularised modelling suite for COVID-19 management to which additional modules can be added as anti-viral drugs and vaccination are introduced, extending the options. We trust that this work makes a start in that direction and demonstrates the advantages of a heterogeneous demographic refinement, which can only improve targeting role out of treatments.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anatoly Zhigljavsky","author_inst":"Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"Ivan Fesenko","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Henry Wynn","author_inst":"Alan Turing Institute"},{"author_name":"Kobi Kremnitzer","author_inst":"University of Oxford"},{"author_name":"Jack Noonan","author_inst":"Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Gillard","author_inst":"Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"Roger Whitaker","author_inst":"Cardiff University"},{"author_name":"Qi Zuo","author_inst":"the First Hospital of Changsha"},{"author_name":"Xin Tan","author_inst":"the First Hospital of Changsha"},{"author_name":"Jun Xie","author_inst":"the First Hospital of Changsha"},{"author_name":"Peihua Niu","author_inst":"National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Wenlong Wang","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yun Xu","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Feng Peng","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Ning Zhou","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Chunlin Cai","author_inst":"the First Hospital of Changsha"},{"author_name":"Wei Tang","author_inst":"the First Hospital of Changsha"},{"author_name":"Xinqiang Xiao","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yi Li","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Zhiguang Zhou","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Zhiguang Zhou","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yongfang Jiang","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yuanlin Xie","author_inst":"the First Hospital of Changsha"},{"author_name":"Wenjie Tan","author_inst":"National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Guozhong Gong","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.24.20077792","rel_title":"COVID-19 in India: State-wise Analysis and Prediction","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.24.20077792","rel_abs":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a highly infectious disease, was first detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

Most of the research and newspaper articles focus on the number of infected people in the entire country. However, given the size and diversity of India, it may be a good idea to look at the spread of the disease in each state separately, along with the entire country. For example, currently, Maharashtra has more than 10000 confirmed cumulative infected cases, whereas West Bengal has less than 800 confirmed infected cases (1 May 2020). The approaches to address the pandemic in the two states must be different due to limited resources. In this article, we will focus the infected people in each state (restricting to only those states with enough data for prediction) and build three growth models to predict infected people for that state in the next 30 days.

Drugs used in the treatment of hypertension and diabetes influence the risk of development of COVID-19, but, not its severity.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Huadong Yan","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Hwamei Hospital, Ningbo No.2 Hospital,University of Chinese Academy of Sciences; Department of Experimental Medical Science, "},{"author_name":"Ana M Valdes","author_inst":"NIHR Nottingham Biomedical Research Centre Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust and University of Nottingham; Division of Rheumatology, Orthopaedics and De"},{"author_name":"Amrita Vijay","author_inst":"NIHR Nottingham Biomedical Research Centre, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust and University of Nottingham; Nottingham Digestive Diseases Centre, School"},{"author_name":"Shanbo Wang","author_inst":"Department of General Practice, Gulin Township Health Center, Ningbo 315010, China"},{"author_name":"Lili Liang","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Hwamei Hospital, Ningbo No.2 Hospital, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences., Ningbo"},{"author_name":"Shiqing Yang","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Hwamei Hospital, Ningbo No.2 Hospital, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences., Ningbo"},{"author_name":"Hongxia Wang","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Hwamei Hospital, Ningbo No.2 Hospital, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences; Department of Infectious Diseases, Ninghai "},{"author_name":"Xiaoyan Tan","author_inst":"Department of General Practice, Gulin Township Health Center, Ningbo"},{"author_name":"Jingyuan Du","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Hwamei Hospital, Ningbo No.2 Hospital, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences., Ningbo"},{"author_name":"Susu Jin","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Hwamei Hospital, Ningbo No.2 Hospital, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences., Ningbo"},{"author_name":"Kecheng Huang","author_inst":"Department of General Practice, Gulin Township Health Center, Ningbo, China"},{"author_name":"Fanrong Jiang","author_inst":"Department of Pharmacology, Hwamei Hospital, Ningbo No.2 Hospital, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences., Ningbo 315010, China"},{"author_name":"Shun Zhang","author_inst":"Department of Experimental Medical Science, Key Laboratory of Diagnosis and Treatment of Digestive System Tumors of Zhejiang Province, Hwamei Hospital, Ningbo N"},{"author_name":"Nanhong Zheng","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Hwamei Hospital, Ningbo No.2 Hospital, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences., Ningbo"},{"author_name":"Yaoren Hu","author_inst":"Department of Infectious Diseases, Hwamei Hospital, Ningbo No.2 Hospital, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences., Ningbo"},{"author_name":"Ting Cai","author_inst":"Hwa Mei Hospital, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"author_name":"Guruprasad P Aithal","author_inst":"NIHR Nottingham Biomedical Research Centre, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust and University of Nottingham; Nottingham Digestive Diseases Centre, School"},{"author_name":"Xinqiang Xiao","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yi Li","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Zhiguang Zhou","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Zhiguang Zhou","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yongfang Jiang","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"},{"author_name":"Yuanlin Xie","author_inst":"the First Hospital of Changsha"},{"author_name":"Wenjie Tan","author_inst":"National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"},{"author_name":"Guozhong Gong","author_inst":"the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.23.20077156","rel_title":"Towards the next phase: evaluation of serological assays for diagnostics and exposure assessment.","rel_date":"2020-04-29","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.23.20077156","rel_abs":"The world is entering a new era of the COVID-19 pandemic in which there is an increasing call for reliable antibody testing.

Due to the novelty and rapid spread of the virus, an a priori assessment of this strategy was not possible. In this study, we present a model-based systems analysis to assess the effectiveness of social distancing measures in terms of intensity and duration of application. Results show a super-linear scaling between intensity (percent contact reduction) and required duration of application to have an added value (lower fatality rate). This holds true for an effective reproduction of R > 1 and is reverted for R < 1. If R is not reduced below 1, secondary effects of required long-term isolation are likely to unravel the added value of disease mitigation. If an extinction is not feasible, we recommend moderate social-distancing that is well balanced against capability limits of national health-care systems.","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Christian Neuwirth","author_inst":"Interfaculty Department of Geoinformatics - Z_GIS, University of Salzburg"},{"author_name":"Christoph Gruber","author_inst":"Center for Computational Material Science, Institute of Applied Physics, Vienna University of Technology"},{"author_name":"Thomas Murphy","author_inst":"Interfaculty Department of Geoinformatics - Z_GIS, University of Salzburg"},{"author_name":"Carmen W.E.

It controls both the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV-2. In view of this, we propose and analyze a mathematical model for investigating the effect of CTL responses over the viral mutation to control the viral infection when a postinfection immunostimulant drug (pidotimod) is administered at regular intervals.

As of April 20, there have been more than 2.4 million confirmed cases with over 160,000 deaths. Extreme case surges coupled with challenges in forecasting the clinical course of affected patients have necessitated thoughtful resource allocation and early identification of high-risk patients. However, effective methods for achieving this are lacking. In this paper, we present a decision tree-based machine learning model trained on electronic health records from patients with confirmed COVID-19 at a single center within the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City. We then externally validate our model by predicting the likelihood of critical event or death within various time intervals for patients after hospitalization at four other hospitals and achieve strong performance, notably predicting mortality at 1 week with an AUC-ROC of 0.84. Finally, we establish model interpretability by calculating SHAP scores to identify decisive features, including age, inflammatory markers (procalcitonin and LDH), and coagulation parameters (PT, PTT, D-Dimer). To our knowledge, this is one of the first models with external validation to both predict outcomes in COVID-19 patients with strong validation performance and identification of key contributors in outcome prediction that may assist clinicians in making effective patient management decisions.","rel_num_authors":49,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Akhil Vaid","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine

detection of SARS-2. Many clinical diagnostic laboratories rely on commercial platforms that provide integrated end-to-end solutions. While this provides established robust pipelines, there is a clear bottleneck in the supply of reagents given the current situation of extraordinary high demand. Some laboratories resort to implementing kit-free handling procedures, but many other small laboratories will not have the capacity to develop those and\/or will perform manual handling of their samples. In order to provide multiple workflows for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection we compared several commercially available RNA extraction methods: QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAgen), the recently developed RNAdvance Blood (Beckman) and Mag-Bind Viral DNA\/RNA 96 Kit (Omega Bio-tek). We also compared different 1-step RT-qPCR Master Mix brands: TaqMan Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix (ThermoFisher Scientific), qPCRBIO Probe 1-Step Go Lo-ROX (PCR Biosystems) and Luna(R) Universal Probe One-Step RT-qPCR Kit (NEB). We used the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) recommended primers that detect two regions of the viral N gene as well as those that detect the RdRP gene region as per Public Health England (PHE) guidelines (Charite\/WHO\/PHE). Our data show that the RNA extraction methods provide similar results. Amongst the qPCR reagents tested, TaqMan Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix and Luna(R) Universal Probe One-Step RT-qPCR Kit proved most sensitive. The N1 and N2 primer-probes provide a more reliable detection than the RdRP-SARSr primer-probe set, particularly in samples with low viral titres. Importantly, we have implemented a protocol using heat inactivation and demonstrate that it has minimal impact on the sensitivity of the qPCR in clinical samples - potentially making SARS-CoV-2 testing portable to settings that do not have CL-3 facilities.","rel_num_authors":33,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Maria Jose Lista","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Robert Page","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Helin Sertkaya","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Pedro Matos","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Elena Ortiz-Zapater","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Thomas J.A.

Methods: In this retrospective, multicenter cohort study, we consecutively included all adult inpatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and pre-existing cirrhosis that had been discharged or had died by 24 March 2020 from 16 designated hospitals in China. Demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiographic findings on admission, treatment, complications during hospitalization and clinical outcomes were collected and compared between survivors and non-survivors. Findings: Twenty-one patients were included in this study, of whom 16 were cured and 5 died in hospital. Seventeen patients had compensated cirrhosis and hepatitis B virus infection was the most common etiology. Lymphocyte and platelet counts were lower, and direct bilirubin levels were higher in patients who died than those who survived (p= 0.040, 0.032, and 0.006, respectively). Acute respiratory distress syndrome and secondary infection were both the most frequently observed complications. Only one patient developed acute on chronic liver failure. Of the 5 non-survivors, all patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and 2 patients progressed to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Interpretation: Lower lymphocyte and platelet counts, and higher direct bilirubin level might represent poor prognostic indicators in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with pre-existing cirrhosis.","rel_num_authors":41,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xiaolong Qi","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yanna Liu","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Jonathan A.

Little is known regarding how physicians have been affected. We aimed to characterize COVID-19 impact on NYC resident physicians. Methods IRB-exempt and expedited cross-sectional analysis through survey to NYC residency program directors (PDs) April 3-12, 2020, encompassing events from March 2-April 12, 2020. Findings From an estimated 340 residency programs around NYC, recruitment yielded 91 responses, representing 24 specialties and 2,306 residents. 45.1% of programs reported at least one resident with confirmed COVID-19: 101 resident physicians were confirmed COVID-19-positive, with additional 163 residents presumed positive for COVID-19 based on symptoms but awaiting or unable to obtain testing. 56.5% of programs had a resident waiting for, or unable to obtain, COVID-19 testing. Two COVID-19-positive residents were hospitalized, with one in intensive care. Among specialties with >100 residents represented, negative binomial regression indicated that infection risk differed by specialty (p=0.039). Although most programs (80%) reported quarantining a resident, with 16.8% of residents experiencing quarantine, 14.9% of COVID-19-positive residents were not quarantined. 90 programs, encompassing 99.2% of the resident physicians, reported reuse or extended mask use, and 43 programs, encompassing 60.4% of residents, felt that personal protective equipment (PPE) was suboptimal. 65 programs (74.7%) have redeployed residents elsewhere to support COVID-19 efforts. Interpretation Many resident physicians around NYC have been affected by COVID-19 through direct infection, quarantine, or redeployment. Lack of access to testing and concern regarding suboptimal PPE are common among residency programs. Infection risk may differ by specialty.

Knowledge of the incubation period distribution can be used directly to inform decision-making or as inputs into mathematical models. Objectives: The aim of this study was to conduct a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis of estimates of the incubation periods of COVID-19. Design: Rapid systematic review and meta-analysis of observational research Data sources: Publications on the electronic databases PubMed, Google Scholar, MedRxiv and BioRxiv were searched. The search was not limited to peer-reviewed published data, but also included pre-print articles. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Studies were selected for meta-analysis if they reported either the parameters and confidence intervals of the distributions fit to the data, or sufficient information to facilitate calculation of those values. The majority of studies suitable for inclusion in the final analysis modelled incubation period as a lognormal distribution. We conducted a random effects meta-analysis of the parameters of this distribution. Results: The incubation period distribution may be modelled with a lognormal distribution with pooled mu and sigma parameters of 1.63 (1.51, 1.75) and 0.50 (0.45, 0.55) respectively. The corresponding mean was 5.8 (5.01, 6.69 days). It should be noted that uncertainty increases towards the tail of the distribution: the pooled parameter estimates resulted in a median incubation period of 5.1 (4.5, 5.8) days, whereas the 95th percentile was 11.6 (9.5, 14.2) days. Conclusions and implications: The choice of which parameter values are adopted will depend on how the information is used, the associated risks and the perceived consequences of decisions to be taken. These recommendations will need to be revisited once further relevant information becomes available. Finally, we present an RShiny app that facilitates updating these estimates as new data become available.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Conor G McAloon","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Aine Collins","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Kevin Hunt","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Ann Barber","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Andrew Byrne","author_inst":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine"},{"author_name":"Francis Butler","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Miriam Casey","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"John M Griffin","author_inst":"Straffan, Co.

We analyzed socio-demographic factors associated with higher likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection and explore mediating pathways for race disparities in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods: Cross sectional analysis of COVID-19 Surveillance and Outcomes Registry (CURATOR), which captures data for a large healthcare system comprising of one central tertiary care, seven large community hospitals, and an expansive ambulatory \/ emergency care network in the Greater Houston area. Nasopharyngeal samples for individuals inclusive of all ages, races, ethnicities and sex were tested for SARS-CoV-2. We analyzed, socio-demographic (age, sex, race, ethnicity, household income, residence population density) and comorbidity (hypertension, diabetes, obesity, cardiac disease) factors. Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to provide adjusted Odds Ratios (aOR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) for likelihood of positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) framework was utilized to explore three mediation pathways (low income, high population density, high comorbidity burden) for association between African American race and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: Among 4,513 tested individuals, 754 (16.7%) tested positive. Overall mean (SD) age was 50.6 (18.9) years, 62% females and 26% were African American. African American race was associated with lower socio-economic status, higher comorbidity burden, and population density residence. In the fully adjusted model, African American race (vs. White; aOR, CI: 1.84, 1.49-2.27) and Hispanic ethnicity (vs. non-Hispanic; aOR, CI: 1.70, 1.35-2.14) had a higher likelihood of infection. Older individuals and males were also at a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The SEM framework demonstrated a statistically significant (p = 0.008) indirect effect of African American race on SARS-CoV-2 infection mediated via a pathway that included residence in densely populated zip code. Conclusions: There is strong evidence of race and ethnic disparities in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic potentially mediated through unique social determinants of health.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Farhaan S Vahidy","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Juan Carlos Nicolas","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Jennifer R Meeks","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Osman Khan","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Stephen L Jones","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Faisal Masud","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"H Dirk Sostman","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Academic Institute"},{"author_name":"Robert A Phillips","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"Julia D Andrieni","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bita A Kash","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Khurram Nasir","author_inst":"Houston Methodist Hospital"},{"author_name":"Martin J Green","author_inst":"University of Nottingham"},{"author_name":"Simon J More","author_inst":"University College Dublin"},{"author_name":"Mei Mei","author_inst":"Tianjin Haihe Hospital"},{"author_name":"Huiling Liu","author_inst":"Tianjin Haihe Hospital"},{"author_name":"Zhengyan Wang","author_inst":"Suizhou Hospital, Hubei University of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Jinlin Li","author_inst":"Suizhou Hospital, Hubei University of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Hua Yang","author_inst":"Minda Hospital Affiliated to Hubei University for Nationalities"},{"author_name":"Huihua Xiang","author_inst":"Minda Hospital Affiliated to Hubei University for Nationalities"},{"author_name":"Xiaodan Li","author_inst":"The Central Hospital of Enshi Tujia And Miao Autonomous Prefecture"},{"author_name":"Tao Liu","author_inst":"The Central Hospital of Enshi Tujia And Miao Autonomous Prefecture"},{"author_name":"Ming-Hua Zheng","author_inst":"The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chuan Liu","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Yifei Huang","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Dan Xu","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Xiaoguo Li","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Ning Kang","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Qing He","author_inst":"The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen"},{"author_name":"Ye Gu","author_inst":"The Sixth People's Hospital of Shenyang"},{"author_name":"Guo Zhang","author_inst":"The People's Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region"},{"author_name":"Chuxiao Shao","author_inst":"Zhejiang University Lishui Hospital & Lishui Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Dengxiang Liu","author_inst":"Xingtai People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Lin Zhang","author_inst":"Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital"},{"author_name":"Xun Li","author_inst":"The First Hospital of Lanzhou University"},{"author_name":"Norifumi Kawada","author_inst":"Osaka City University"},{"author_name":"Zicheng Jiang","author_inst":"Ankang Central Hospital"},{"author_name":"Fengmei Wang","author_inst":"Tianjin Second People's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Bin Xiong","author_inst":"Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College"},{"author_name":"Tetsuo Takehara","author_inst":"Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Don C.
