All efforts to contain the pathogenesis either using inhibitory drugs or vaccines largely remained futile due to a lack of better understanding of the genomic feature of this virus. In the present study, we compared the 2019-nCoV with other coronaviruses, which indicated that bat-SARS like coronavirus could be a probable ancestor of the novel coronavirus. The protein sequence similarity of pangolin-hCoV and bat-hCoV with human coronavirus was higher as compared to their nucleotide similarity denoting the occurrence of more synonymous mutations in the genome. Phylogenetic and alignment analysis of 591 novel coronaviruses of different clades from Group I to Group V revealed several mutations and concomitant amino acid changes. Detailed investigation on nucleotide substitution unfolded 100 substitutions in the coding region of which 43 were synonymous and 57 were of non-synonymous type. The non-synonymous substitutions resulting into 57 amino acid changes were found to be distributed over different hCoV proteins with maximum on spike protein. An important diamino acid change RG to KR was observed in ORF9 protein. Additionally, several interesting features of the novel coronavirus genome have been highlighted in respect to various other human infecting viruses which may explain extreme pathogenicity, infectivity and simultaneously the reason behind failure of the antiviral therapies.\n\nSummaryThis study presents a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV2 isolates to understand discrete mutations that are occurring between patient samples. This analysis will provide an explanation for varying treatment efficacies of different inhibitory drugs and a future direction towards a combinatorial treatment therapies based on the kind of mutation in the viral genome.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Manish Tiwari","author_inst":"National Institute of Plant Genome Research"},{"author_name":"Divya Mishra","author_inst":"Kansas State University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"new results","category":"genetics"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.17.045161","rel_title":"An in silico map of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA Structurome","rel_date":"2020-04-18","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.17.045161","rel_abs":"SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that has exploded throughout the global human population.

In this report we used a recently-developed bioinformatics approach, ScanFold, to deduce the RNA structural landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome. We recapitulate known elements of RNA structure and provide a model for the folding of an essential frameshift signal. Our results find that the SARS-CoV-2 is greatly enriched in unusually stable and likely evolutionarily ordered RNA structure, which provides a huge reservoir of potential drug targets for RNA-binding small molecules. Our results also predict regions that are accessible for intermolecular interactions, which can aid in the design of antisense therapeutics.

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are positive strand RNA viruses with double-stranded RNA replication intermediates that are recognized by the innate immune system. Upon recognition, infected cells secrete interferon, which induces a set of interferon-stimulated genes that inhibit viral replication. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection strikingly dysregulates the set of genes involved in consumption and biosynthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). Highly induced genes include those encoding noncanonical poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family members known to function as mono ADP-ribosyltransferases but not known to deplete cellular NAD and genes encoding enzymes for salvage NAD synthesis from nicotinamide (NAM) and nicotinamide riboside (NR). We demonstrate that overexpression of PARP10 is sufficient to depress NAD levels and that the enzymatic activities of PARP10, PARP12 and PARP14 are limited by and can be enhanced by pharmacological activation of NAM salvage. We further showed that infection with the \u03b2-coronavirus murine hepatitis virus (MHV) induces a severe attack on host cell NAD+ and NADP+. Finally we show that NAMPT activation, NAM and NR dramatically decrease replication in a MHV infection model that is sensitive to PARP activity. The data show that the antiviral activities of noncanonical PARP isozyme activities are limited by their own consumption of cellular NAD and that nutritional and pharmacological interventions to enhance NAD-based defenses may boost innate immunity.Competing Interest StatementCB is chief scientific adviser of ChromaDex and owns shares of ChromaDex stock.

Age, smoking, obesity, and chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes have been described as risk factors for severe complications and mortality in COVID-19. Obesity and diabetes are usually associated with dysregulated lipid synthesis and clearance which can initiate or aggravate pulmonary inflammation and injury. It has been shown that for viral entry into the host cell, SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors present on the cells. We aimed to characterize how SARS-CoV-2 dysregulates lipid metabolism pathways in the host and the effect of dysregulated lipogenesis on the regulation of ACE2, specifically in obesity. In our study, through the re-analysis of publicly available transcriptomic data, we first found that lung epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed upregulation of genes associated with lipid metabolism, including the SOC3 gene which is involved in regulation of inflammation and inhibition of leptin signaling. This is of interest as viruses may hijack host lipid metabolism to allow completion of their viral replication cycles. Furthermore, a mouse model of diet-induced obesity showed a significant increase in Ace2 expression in the lungs which negatively correlated with the expression of genes that code for sterol response element binding proteins 1 and 2 (SREBP). Suppression of Srebp1 showed a significant increase in Ace2 expression in the lung. Together our results suggest that the dysregulated lipogenesis and the subsequently high ACE2 expression in obese patients might be the mechanism underlying the increased risk for severe complications in those patients when infected by SARS-CoV-2.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Saba Al Heialy","author_inst":"Mohammed bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Mahmood Yaseen Hachim","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Abiola Senok","author_inst":"Mohammed bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Rifat Hamoudi","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Alawi Alsheikh-Ali","author_inst":"Mohammed bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences"},{"author_name":"Qutayba Alheialy","author_inst":"University of Sharjah"},{"author_name":"Stanley Perlman","author_inst":"University of Iowa"},{"author_name":"Michael S Cohen","author_inst":"Oregon Health Sciences University"},{"author_name":"Anthony R.

The S-glycoprotein, which recognized as the key factor for the entry of 2019-nCov into the cell, contains two functional domains: an ACE2 receptor binding domain and a second domain necessary for fusion of the coronavirus and cell membranes. FURIN activity, exposes the binding and fusion domains, is essential for the zoonotic transmission of 2019-nCov. Moreover, it has been reported that ACE2 is likely to be the receptor for 2019-nCoV. In addition, FURIN enzyme and ACE2 receptor were expressed in airway epithelia, cardiac tissue, and enteric canals, which considered as the potential target organ of the virus. However, report about the expression of FURIN and ACE2 in oral tissues was limited.Methods In order to investigate the potential infective channel of new coronavirus in oral cavity, we analyze the expression of ACE2 and FURIN that mediate the new coronavirus entry into host cells in oral mucosa using the public single-cell sequence datasets. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining experiment was performed to confirm the expression of ACE2 and FURIN in the protein level.Results The bioinformatics results indicated the differential expression of ACE2 and FURIN on epithelial cells of different oral mucosal tissues and the proportion of FURIN-positive cells was obviously higher than that of ACE2-positive cells. IHC experiments revealed that both the ACE2-positive and FURIN-positive cells in the target tissues were mainly positioned in the epithelial layers, partly expressed in fibroblasts, which further confirm the bioinformatics results.Conclusions Based on these findings, we speculated that 2019-nCov could effectively invade oral mucosal cells though two possible routes: binding to the ACE2 receptor and fusion with cell membrane activated by FURIN protease. Our results indicated that oral mucosa tissues are susceptible to 2019-nCov, which provides valuable information for virus-prevention strategy in clinical care as well as daily life.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zhong Mei","author_inst":"Stomatology Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Lin Bingpeng","author_inst":"Stomatology Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Gao Hongbin","author_inst":"Guangdong Laboratory Animals Monitoring Institute"},{"author_name":"Wang Xinhong","author_inst":"Stomatology Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Liu Chang","author_inst":"Stomatology school of Jinan University"},{"author_name":"Wu Kaibin","author_inst":"Stomatology Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Liu Mingxiao","author_inst":"Stomatology Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Chen Jianming","author_inst":"Stomatology Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Huang Jiang-yong","author_inst":"Stomatology Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Lee Learn-han","author_inst":"Monash University Malaysia"},{"author_name":"Qi Cuiling","author_inst":"Guangdong Pharmaceutical University"},{"author_name":"Ge Linhu","author_inst":"Stomatology Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"},{"author_name":"Wang Lijing","author_inst":"Vascular Biology Research Institute, School of Life Sciences and Biopharmaceutics, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"new results","category":"pathology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.13.20063784","rel_title":"Comparative dynamic aerosol efficiencies of three emergent coronaviruses and the unusual persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosol suspensions","rel_date":"2020-04-18","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.13.20063784","rel_abs":"The emergent coronavirus, designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a zoonotic pathogen that has demonstrated remarkable transmissibility in the human population and is the etiological agent of a current global pandemic called COVID-19.

DESIGN: This is the protocol of a living systematic review. DATA SOURCES: We will conduct searches in PubMed\/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), grey literature and in a centralised repository in L-OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence). L-OVE is a platform that maps PICO questions to evidence from Epistemonikos database. In response to the COVID-19 emergency, L-OVE was adapted to expand the range of evidence it covers and customised to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place. The search will cover the period until the day before submission to a journal. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES AND METHODS: We adapted an already published common protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews to the specificities of this question. We will include randomised trials evaluating the effect of mesenchymal stromal cells versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. Randomised trials evaluating other coronavirus infections, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and non-randomised studies in COVID-19 will be searched in case we find no direct evidence from randomised trials, or if the direct evidence provides low- or very low-certainty for critical outcomes. Two reviewers will independently screen each study for eligibility, extract data, and assess the risk of bias. We will pool the results using meta-analysis and will apply the GRADE system to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will resubmit it every time the conclusions change or whenever there are substantial updates. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: No ethics approval is considered necessary. The results of this review will be widely disseminated via peer-reviewed publications, social networks and traditional media. PROSPERO Registration Submitted to PROSPERO (awaiting ID allocation).","rel_num_authors":3,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gabriel Rada","author_inst":"Epistemonikos Foundation"},{"author_name":"Javiera Corbalan","author_inst":"Institute of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Austral de Chile"},{"author_name":"Patricio Rojas","author_inst":"Hematology and Oncology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.

In some jurisdictions, over 10% of confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been found among healthcare workers. Aerosol-generating medical procedures (AGMPs) may increase the risk of nosocomial transmission, exacerbated by present global shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE). Improved methods for mitigating risk during AGMPs are therefore urgently needed. Methods The Aerosol Containment Enclosure (ACE) was constructed from acrylic with silicone gaskets for arm port seals and completed with a thin plastic sheet. Hospital wall suction generated negative pressure within the ACE. To evaluate protective capability, differential pressures were recorded under static conditions and during simulated AGMPs. Smoke flow patterns, fluorescence aerosolization, and sodium saccharin aerosolization tests were also conducted. Results Negative pressures of up to -47.7 mmH2O were obtained using the enclosure with two wall suction units (combined outflow of 70 L min-1), with inflow of O2 of 15 L min-1. Negative pressures between -10 and -35 mmH2O were maintained during simulated AGMPs, including oxygen delivery by mask, airway suctioning, bag-mask manual ventilation and endotracheal intubation of a potential COVID-19 patient. The ACE effectively contained smoke, fluorescein aerosol, and sodium saccharin aerosol within the enclosure during use. Conclusions The ACE is capable of maintaining negative pressure during simulated AGMPs. In all cases, containment was improved relative to an identical enclosure with non-occluded ports at ambient pressure. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, the use of such a device may assist in reducing nosocomial infections among healthcare providers.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Anthony M.

A strategy is needed such that both the health system is not overloaded letting people die in an uncontrolled way and also such that the majority of people can get back their social contacts as soon as possible. We investigate the potential effects of a combination of measures such as continuation of hygienic constraints after leaving lockdown, isolation of infectious persons, repeated and adaptive short-term contact reductions and also large-scale use of antibody tests in order to know who can be assumed to be immune and participate at public life without constraints. We apply two commonly used modeling approaches: extended SEIR models formulated both as System Dynamics and Agent-Based Simulation, in order to get insight into the disease dynamics of a complete country like Germany and also into more detailed behavior of smaller regions. We confirm the findings of other models that without intervention the consequences of the pandemic can be catastrophic and we extend such findings with effective strategies to overcome the challenge. Based on the modeling assumptions it can be expected that repeated short-term contact reductions will be necessary in the next years to avoid overload of the health system and that on the other side herd immunity can be achieved and antibody tests are an effective way to mitigate the contact reductions for many.","rel_num_authors":5,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Reinhard German","author_inst":"University of Erlangen-Nuernberg"},{"author_name":"Anatoli Djanatliev","author_inst":"University of Erlangen-Nuernberg"},{"author_name":"Lisa Maile","author_inst":"University of Erlangen-Nuernberg"},{"author_name":"Peter Bazan","author_inst":"University of Erlangen-Nuernberg"},{"author_name":"Holger Hackstein","author_inst":"University Hospital Erlangen"},{"author_name":"Ken S.

Contributors utilized the Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) or Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) platforms to map to a common data model. The group focused on comorbidities and temporal changes in key laboratory test values. Harmonized data were analyzed locally and converted to a shared aggregate form for rapid analysis and visualization of regional differences and global commonalities. Data covered 27,584 COVID-19 cases with 187,802 laboratory tests. Case counts and laboratory trajectories were concordant with existing literature. Laboratory tests at the time of diagnosis showed hospital-level differences equivalent to country-level variation across the consortium partners. Despite the limitations of decentralized data generation, we established a framework to capture the trajectory of COVID-19 disease in patients and their response to interventions.","rel_num_authors":88,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Gabriel A Brat","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Informatics, Harvard Medical School.

In some patients the infection results in moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. High serum levels of IL-6 and an immune hyperresponsiveness referred to as a cytokine storm have been associated with poor clinical outcome. Despite the large numbers of cases and deaths, information on the phenotype of SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cells is scarce. Here, we detected SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in 100% and 80% of COVID-19 patients, respectively. We also detected low levels of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T-cells in 20% of the healthy controls, not previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and indicative of cross-reactivity due to infection with common cold coronaviruses. Strongest T-cell responses were directed to the surface glycoprotein (spike, S), and SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cells predominantly produced effector and Th1 cytokines, although Th2 and Th17 cytokines were also detected. Collectively, these data stimulate further studies into the role of T-cells in COVID-19, support vaccine design and facilitate the evaluation of vaccine candidate immunogenicity.","rel_num_authors":14,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Daniela Weiskopf","author_inst":"Center for Infectious Disease, La Jolla Institute for Immunology, La Jolla, CA92037, USA"},{"author_name":"Katharina S.

This was the first COVID-19 death detected in Italy since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in the Chinese city of Wuhan, Hubei province. In response, the regional authorities imposed the lockdown of the whole municipality for 14 days. We collected information on the demography, clinical presentation, hospitalization, contact network and presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in nasopharyngeal swabs for 85.9% and 71.5% of the population of Vo at two consecutive time points. On the first survey, which was conducted around the time the town lockdown started, we found a prevalence of infection of 2.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1-3.3%). On the second survey, which was conducted at the end of the lockdown, we found a prevalence of 1.2% (95% CI 0.8-1.8%). Notably, 43.2% (95% CI 32.2-54.7%) of the confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections detected across the two surveys were asymptomatic. The mean serial interval was 6.9 days (95% CI 2.6-13.4). We found no statistically significant difference in the viral load (as measured by genome equivalents inferred from cycle threshold data) of symptomatic versus asymptomatic infections (p-values 0.6 and 0.2 for E and RdRp genes, respectively, Exact Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test). Contact tracing of the newly infected cases and transmission chain reconstruction revealed that most new infections in the second survey were infected in the community before the lockdown or from asymptomatic infections living in the same household. This study sheds new light on the frequency of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and their infectivity (as measured by the viral load) and provides new insights into its transmission dynamics, the duration of viral load detectability and the efficacy of the implemented control measures.","rel_num_authors":37,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Enrico Lavezzo","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Elisa Franchin","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Constanze Ciavarella","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Gina Cuomo-Dannenburg","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Luisa Barzon","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Claudia Del Vecchio","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Lucia Rossi","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Riccardo Manganelli","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Arianna Loregian","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Nicol\u00f2 Navarin","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Davide Abate","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Manuela Sciro","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Stefano Merigliano","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Ettore Decanale","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Maria Cristina Vanuzzo","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Francesca Saluzzo","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Francesco Onelia","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Monia Pacenti","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Saverio Parisi","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Carretta","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Daniele Donato","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Luciano Flor","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Silvia Cocchio","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Giulia Masi","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Sperduti","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Cattarino","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Renato Salvador","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Katy A.M.

In the absence of evidence, individual communities had to take timely action to reduce the rate of disease spread and avoid overburdening their healthcare systems. Although a few predictive models have been published to guide these decisions, most have not taken into account spatial differences and have included assumptions that do not match the local realities. Access to reliable information that is adapted to local context is critical for policymakers to make informed decisions during a rapidly evolving pandemic. Objective: The goal of this study was to develop an adapted susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model to predict the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic in North Carolina (NC) and the Charlotte metropolitan region and to incorporate the effect of a public health intervention to reduce disease spread, while accounting for unique regional features and imperfect detection. Methods: Using the software package R, three SIR models were fit to infection prevalence data from the state and the greater Charlotte region and then rigorously compared. One of these models (SIR-Int) accounted for a stay-at-home intervention and imperfect detection of COVID-19 cases. We computed longitudinal total estimates of the susceptible, infected, and removed compartments of both populations, along with other pandemic characteristics (e.g., basic reproduction number). Results: Prior to March 26, disease spread was rapid at the pandemic onset with the Charlotte region doubling time of 2.56 days (95% CI: (2.11, 3.25)) and in NC 2.94 days (95% CI: (2.33, 4.00)). Subsequently, disease spread significantly slowed with doubling times increased in the Charlotte region to 4.70 days (95% CI: (3.77, 6.22)) and in NC to 4.01 days (95% CI: (3.43, 4.83)). Reflecting spatial differences, this deceleration favored the greater Charlotte region compared to NC as a whole. A comparison of the efficacy of intervention, defined as 1 - the hazard ratio of infection, gave 0.25 for NC and 0.43 for the Charlotte region. Also, early in the pandemic, the initial basic SIR model had good fit to the data; however, as the pandemic and local conditions evolved, the SIR-Int model emerged as the model with better fit. Conclusions: Using local data and continuous attention to model adaptation, our findings have enabled policymakers, public health officials and health systems to proactively plan capacity and evaluate the impact of a public health intervention. Our SIR-Int model for estimated latent prevalence was reasonably flexible, highly accurate, and demonstrated the efficacy of a stay-at-home order at both the state and regional level. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating local context into pandemic forecast modeling, as well as the need to remain vigilant and informed by the data as we enter into a critical period of the outbreak.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Philip J.

We use a SEIR model that includes three different compartments of infection: those who can stay at home, those in regular hospital beds and those in need of ICU treatment. The model allows for a time varying transmission rate which we use to incorporate the measures introduced by the government over the period of one semester. The model predicts that by mid October 2020, the city will need 4 524 prevalent ICUs needed and 16 738 regular hospital beds needed. By the third week of July 2020, the number of patients that need ICUs will overpass the capacity set at 1 200 beds for ICU hospital beds in the city. The model predicts that the death toll by the same date will reach 1 752 people and the number of cases will be 30 216 inhabitants by then.

The objective of this paper is to study whether the number of deaths not registered as covid-19-related has increased compared to what would have been expected in the absence of the pandemic. This may be a result of some covid-19 deaths being unreported or spillover effects on other causes of death (or both). Reasons behind this might include covid-19 underreporting, avoiding visits to hospitals or GPs, and the effects of the lockdown. Methods: I used weekly ONS data on the number of deaths in England and Wales that did not officially involve covid-19 over the period 2015-2020. Simply observing trends is not sufficient as spikes in deaths may occasionally occur. I thus followed a differences-in-differences econometric approach to study whether there was a relative increase in deaths not registered as covid-19-related during the pandemic, compared to a control. As an additional approach, an interrupted time series model was also used. Results: Results suggest that there are an additional 968 weekly deaths that officially did not involve covid-19, compared to what would have otherwise been expected. This increase is also confirmed by the interrupted time series analysis. Discussion: The number of deaths not officially involving covid-19 has demonstrated an absolute and relative increase during the pandemic. It is possible that some people are dying from covid-19 without being diagnosed, and that there are excess deaths due to other causes as a result of the pandemic. Analysing the cause of death for any excess non-covid-19 deaths will shed light upon the reasons for the increase in such deaths and will help design appropriate policy responses to save lives.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Sotiris Vandoros","author_inst":"King's College London"},{"author_name":"Beatriz Piedad Urdinola","author_inst":"National University of Colombia"},{"author_name":"Marc A.

Understanding what proportion of these patients require screening, who can be safely screened in community based models of care, and who requires an emergency departments to care for them is critical for workforce and infrastructure planning across the healthcare system, as well as public messaging campaigns. Methods: In this cross-sectional survey, we screened patients presenting to a SARS-CoV-2 screening clinic in a tertiary hospital Emergency Department in Melbourne, Australia. We assessed the proportion of patients who met screening criteria; self-reported symptom severity; reasons why they came to the ED for screening; views on community-based models of care; and sources of information accessed about COVID-19. Results: We included findings from 1846 patients who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) for COVID-19 screening from 18th to 30th March 2020. Most patients (55.3%) did not meet criteria for screening and most (57.6%) had mild or no (13.4%) symptoms. The main reason for coming to the ED was being referred by a telephone health service (31.3%) and 136 (7.4%) said they tried to contact their GP but could not get an appointment. Only 47 (2.6%) said they thought the disease was too specialized for their GP to manage. Patients accessed numerous information sources, commonly government websites (68.4%) and other websites (51.3%) for COVID-19 information. Conclusions: if we are to ensure that emergency departments can cope with the likely surge in presentations requiring resuscitation or inpatient care COVID-19, we should strengthen access to alternative services to triage patients to prevent unnecessary presentations at health services, and to direct those who are well but require screening away from EDs.","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Amanda Rojek","author_inst":"Royal Melbourne Hospital and University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Martin Dutch","author_inst":"Royal Melbourne Hospital and University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Daniel Peyton","author_inst":"Murdoch Children's Research Institute & University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Rachel Pelly","author_inst":"Murdoch Childrens Research Institute"},{"author_name":"Mark Putland","author_inst":"Royal Melbourne Hospital and University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Harriet Hiscock","author_inst":"Murdoch Children's Research Institute, University of Melbourne,and Royal Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Knott","author_inst":"Royal Melbourne Hospital & University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Andrew D.

This study sought to apply meta-analysis to more precisely and accurately estimate the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the isolation policy across countries, and the corresponding public health capability to care for patients. Prior estimates of R0 have varied widely and range from 1.95 to 6.49. Utilizing meta-analysis techniques we determined a more robust estimation of 3.05 for R0, which is substantially larger than that provided by the WHO. We also present the infectious rate standardized to per million population, which has proved to be a good index to determine whether the isolation measures in specific countries are effective. Also, this standardized infection rate can be used to determine whether the current infectious severity status is out of range of the national health capacity. Finally, we utilize our robust estimate of R0 and the standardized infectious rate to illustrate that the early and aggressive isolation measures enforced by the Chinese government were substantially more effective in controlling the negative impact COVID-19 than the more permissive measures enacted early in Italy and the United States.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jianghu Dong","author_inst":"College of Public Health"},{"author_name":"Yongdao Zhou","author_inst":"Nankai University"},{"author_name":"Ying Zhang","author_inst":"University of Nebraska Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Douglas Franz","author_inst":"University of Nebraska Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Mark Putland","author_inst":"Royal Melbourne Hospital and University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Harriet Hiscock","author_inst":"Murdoch Children's Research Institute, University of Melbourne,and Royal Children's Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jonathan Knott","author_inst":"Royal Melbourne Hospital & University of Melbourne"},{"author_name":"Andrew D.

Methodology: This prospective study included 78 ISOA patients who fulfilled a patient-reported outcome questionnaire and underwent a nasopharyngeal swabs. Among these, 46 patients performed psychophysical olfactory evaluation using sniffing tests. Based on the duration of the ISOA, two groups of patients were compared: patients with anosmia duration [&le;]12 days (group 1) and those with duration >12 days (group 2). Results: Among group 1, 42 patients (87.5%) had a positive viral load regarding RT-PCR while 6 patients (12.5%) were negative. In group 2, 7 patients (23%) had a positive viral load and 23 patients (77%) were negative. Among the 46 patients having performed a psychophysical olfactory evaluation, we observed anosmia in 52% (N=24), hyposmia in 24% (N=11) and normosmia in 24% (N=11) of patients. The viral load significantly decreased throughout the 14-days following the onset of the olfactory disorder. Conclusions: Our results support that a high proportion of ISOA patients are Covid+. Our study supports the need to add anosmia to the list of symptoms used in screening tools for possible COVID-19 infection.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"jerome lechien","author_inst":"UMONS"},{"author_name":"pierre cabaraux","author_inst":"CHU Marie-Curie"},{"author_name":"carlos chiesa-estomba","author_inst":"Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery, Hospital Universitario Donostia, San Sebastian, Spain."},{"author_name":"mohammad khalife","author_inst":"Epicura"},{"author_name":"jan plzak","author_inst":"University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic."},{"author_name":"stephane hans","author_inst":"Hopital Foch"},{"author_name":"delphine martiny","author_inst":"Laboratoire Hospitalier Universitaire de Bruxelles - Universitair Laboratorium Brussel (LHUB-ULB), Brussels, Belgium"},{"author_name":"christian Henriquez","author_inst":"Department of otolaryngology-Hospital Complex of Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain."},{"author_name":"Claire hopkins","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"sven saussez","author_inst":"University of Mons"},{"author_name":"Davide Abate","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Manuela Sciro","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Stefano Merigliano","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Ettore Decanale","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Maria Cristina Vanuzzo","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Francesca Saluzzo","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Francesco Onelia","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Monia Pacenti","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Saverio Parisi","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Carretta","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Daniele Donato","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Luciano Flor","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Silvia Cocchio","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Giulia Masi","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Sperduti","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Cattarino","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Renato Salvador","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Katy A.M.

For this response to be most effective, it must reflect an evidence-based, pan-Canadian response. We designed four different prototypical patients with a combination of common COVID-19 symptoms and opportunities for exposure who were made to self-assess using the 10 provincial COVID-19 self-assessment tools on 1 April. These tools were developed to allow individuals to self-triage, allowing health systems direct capacity to testing and care. We assessed the consistency of the self-assessment tools and of the guidance provided to the patients. While the tools generally screen in three areas, the scope of included COVID-19 associated symptoms as well as the opportunities for exposure, and therefore transmission, vary between provinces such that no two provinces screened in the same way. This was, in turn, reflected in the inconsistency in guidance found. A patient with cough who had travelled abroad or had close contact with a confirmed case within 14 days received the most consistent guidance, with remaining patients receiving guidance ranging from mandatory quarantine or self-isolation to being told they did not have COVID-19 symptoms, guidance at odds with medical evidence. Thus, there is not a single, evidence-based Canadian standard of care simply for self-assessment. Without consistency in public health guidance, Canadians cannot appropriately self-isolate to mitigate community transmission, nor can the necessary valid and reliable data be collected to inform critical epidemiological models that help guide pandemic response. If federal and provincial governments are unable to coordinate a response, Parliament must use its available jurisdiction to legislate a duty on both to follow national standards, so as to improve coordination on COVID-19 in coming months.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Brieanne Olibris","author_inst":"University of Ottawa"},{"author_name":"Amir Attaran","author_inst":"University of Ottawa"},{"author_name":"carlos chiesa-estomba","author_inst":"Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery, Hospital Universitario Donostia, San Sebastian, Spain."},{"author_name":"mohammad khalife","author_inst":"Epicura"},{"author_name":"jan plzak","author_inst":"University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic."},{"author_name":"stephane hans","author_inst":"Hopital Foch"},{"author_name":"delphine martiny","author_inst":"Laboratoire Hospitalier Universitaire de Bruxelles - Universitair Laboratorium Brussel (LHUB-ULB), Brussels, Belgium"},{"author_name":"christian Henriquez","author_inst":"Department of otolaryngology-Hospital Complex of Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain."},{"author_name":"Claire hopkins","author_inst":"Guy's and St Thomas NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK"},{"author_name":"sven saussez","author_inst":"University of Mons"},{"author_name":"Davide Abate","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Manuela Sciro","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Stefano Merigliano","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Ettore Decanale","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Maria Cristina Vanuzzo","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Francesca Saluzzo","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Francesco Onelia","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Monia Pacenti","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Saverio Parisi","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Carretta","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Daniele Donato","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Luciano Flor","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Silvia Cocchio","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Giulia Masi","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Sperduti","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Cattarino","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Renato Salvador","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Katy A.M.

In the early phases of a new pandemic, identifying the most relevant evidence and quantifying which studies are shared the most can help researchers and policy makers. The aim of this study is to describe and quantify the impact of early scientific production in response to COVID-19 pandemic. Methods. The study consisted of: 1) review of the scientific literature produced in the first 30 days since the first COVID-19 paper was published; 2) analysis of papers' metrics with the construction of a Computed-Impact-Score (CIS) that represents a unifying score over heterogeneous bibliometric indicators. In this study we use metrics and alternative metrics collected into five separate categories. On top of those categories we compute the CIS. Highest CIS papers are further analyzed. Results. 239 papers have been included in the study. The mean of citations, mentions and social media interactions resulted in 1.63, 10 and 1250, respectively. The paper with highest CIS resulted \"Clinical features of patients[...]\" by Chaolin Huang et al., which rated first also in citations and mentions. This is the first paper describing patients affected by the new disease and reporting data that are clearly of great interest to both the scientific community and the general population. Conclusions. The early response of scientific literature during an epidemic does not follow a pre- established pattern.

In most academic hospitals in the United States, inpatient rotations are designed to deliver optimal patient care by staggering rotations of attendings and house-staff, and much emphasis is placed on HCW burnout, yet during a pandemic preventing further infection is the single most important factor. Our purpose was to model various inpatient rotation schedules of physicians and nurses to determine patterns associated with optimal workforce preservation and lower nosocomial infections in settings in which personal protective equipment is imperfect or unavailable. Summary of Methods: We simulated the spread of COVID-19 in hospital wards using Monte Carlo methods. Universal model parameters for COVID-19 included incubation period distribution and latent period distribution. Situation-dependent COVID-19 model parameters included pre-admission infection probability, team member infection probability, physician-to-patient, nurse-to-patient, patient-to-physician, patient-to-nurse, and HCW-to-HCW transmission probabilities, team member absence after symptom onset, daily SARS-CoV-2 exposure probability of team members (e.g. via exposure to other staff), length of admission after COVID-19 symptoms, and length of simulation time. Model parameters that varied by hospital setting and service type included average patient load per team, average patient hospitalization, and number of physicians and nurses on a team and on duty. Results: The primary outcome measure was probability of team failure, defined as the likelihood that at some point there are insufficient attendings, house-staff or nurses to staff a fully functioning floor. In all of our simulations, physician and nurse rotation lengths of 1-3 days led to higher team failure rates. Nursing shifts of 12 versus 8 hours and avoiding staggering of physician rotations also decreased the chance of team failure. Conclusions: Simple changes in staff scheduling, such as lengthening nursing shifts or avoiding rotations that are either staggered or last fewer than three days, can result in improved workforce preservation. These workforce scheduling changes are easy to implement.","rel_num_authors":10,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Dan M Kluger","author_inst":"Department of Statistics, Stanford University"},{"author_name":"Yariv Aizenbud","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, Yale University"},{"author_name":"Ariel Jaffe","author_inst":"Department of Mathematics, Yale University"},{"author_name":"Lilach Aizenbud","author_inst":"Yale Cancer Center"},{"author_name":"Fabio Parisi","author_inst":"Yale University"},{"author_name":"Eyal Minsky-Fenick","author_inst":"Applied Mathematics Program, Yale University"},{"author_name":"Jonathan M Kluger","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Shelli Farhadian","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Harriet M Kluger","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yuval Kluger","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Davide Abate","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Manuela Sciro","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Stefano Merigliano","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Ettore Decanale","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Maria Cristina Vanuzzo","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Francesca Saluzzo","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Francesco Onelia","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Monia Pacenti","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Saverio Parisi","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Carretta","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Daniele Donato","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Luciano Flor","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Silvia Cocchio","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Giulia Masi","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Sperduti","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Cattarino","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Renato Salvador","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Katy A.M.

The presence of neutralizing antibody was determined with a modified cytopathogenic assay based on live SARS-CoV-2. The dynamics of neutralizing antibody levels at different with different clinical characteristics were analyzed. Results. The seropositivity rate reached up to 100.0% within 20 days since onset, and remained 100.0% till day 41-53. The total GMT was 1:163.7 (95% CI, 128.5 to 208.6), and the antibody level was highest during day 31-40 since onset, and then decreased slightly. Individual differences in changes of antibody levels were observed among 8 representative convalescent patients. In multivariate GEE analysis, patients at age of 31-60 and 61-84 had a higher antibody level than those at age of 16-30 ({beta}=1.0518, P=0.0152; {beta}=1.3718, P=0.0020). Patients with a worse clinical classification had a higher antibody titer ({beta}=0.4639, P=0.0227). Conclusions.

A third virus, the H5N1, responsible for avian influenza, has caused infection with some clinical similarities to those in COVID-19 infections. Cytokines, small proteins that modulate immune responses, have been directly implicated in some of the severe responses seen in COVID-19 patients, e.g. cytokine storms. Understanding the immune processes related to COVID-19, and other similar infections, could help identify diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets. Here we examine data of cytokine, immune cell types, and disease associations captured from biomedical literature associated with coronavirus, SARS, and H5N1 influenza, with the objective of identifying potentially useful relationships and areas for future research. Cytokine and cell-type associations captured from MeSH terms linked to thousands of PubMed abstracts, has identified differing patterns of associations between the three corpuses of abstracts (coronavirus, SARS, or H5N1 influenza). Clustering of cytokine-disease co-occurrences in the context of coronavirus has identified compelling clusters of co-morbidities and symptoms, some of which already known to be linked to COVID-19. Finally, network analysis identified sub-networks of cytokines and immune cell types associated with different manifestations, co-morbidities and symptoms of coronavirus, SARS, and H5N1. Systematic review of research in medicine is essential to facilitate evidence-based choices about health interventions. In a fast moving pandemic the approach taken here will identify trends and enable rapid comparison to the literature of related diseases.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nophar Geifman","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Anthony D Whetton","author_inst":"University of Manchester"},{"author_name":"Qianqian Xin","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Co., Ltd., Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Yang Pan","author_inst":"Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Beijing, China;School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Jing Li","author_inst":"Sinovac Biotech Co., Ltd., Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Yanhui Chu","author_inst":"Xicheng District Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Yingmei Feng","author_inst":"Beijing YouAn hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Quanyi Wang","author_inst":"Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Beijing, China;School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China"},{"author_name":"Harriet M Kluger","author_inst":"Yale School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Yuval Kluger","author_inst":"Yale University School of Medicine"},{"author_name":"Davide Abate","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Manuela Sciro","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Stefano Merigliano","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Ettore Decanale","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Maria Cristina Vanuzzo","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Francesca Saluzzo","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Francesco Onelia","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Monia Pacenti","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Saverio Parisi","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Carretta","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Daniele Donato","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Luciano Flor","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Silvia Cocchio","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Giulia Masi","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Sperduti","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Cattarino","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Renato Salvador","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Katy A.M.

Here, we present the first results of the analyses that we have performed on 34 PM10 samples of outdoor\/airborne PM10 from an industrial site of Bergamo Province, collected with two different air samplers over a continuous 3-weeks period, from February 21st to March 13th. We can confirm to have reasonably demonstrated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA by detecting highly specific RtDR gene on 8 filters in two parallel PCR analyses. This is the first preliminary evidence that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be present on outdoor particulate matter, thus suggesting that, in conditions of atmospheric stability and high concentrations of PM, SARS-CoV-2 could create clusters with outdoor PM and, by reducing their diffusion coefficient, enhance the persistence of the virus in the atmosphere. Further confirmations of this preliminary evidence are ongoing, and should include real-time assessment about the vitality of the SARS-CoV-2 as well as its virulence when adsorbed on particulate matter. At the present, no assumptions can be made concerning the correlation between the presence of the virus on PM and COVID-19 outbreak progression. Other issues to be specifically addressed are the average concentrations of PM eventually required for a potential boost effect of the contagion (in case it is confirmed that PM might act as a carrier for the viral droplet nuclei), or even the theoretic possibility of immunization consequent to minimal dose exposures at lower thresholds of PM.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Leonardo Setti","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Fabrizio Passarini","author_inst":"University of Bologna"},{"author_name":"Gianluigi De Gennaro","author_inst":"University of Bari, Italy"},{"author_name":"Pierluigi Baribieri","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Maria Grazia Perrone","author_inst":"Environmental Research Division, TCR TECORA, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Massimo Borelli","author_inst":"University of Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"Jolanda Palmisani","author_inst":"University of Bari"},{"author_name":"Alessia Di Gilio","author_inst":"University of Bari"},{"author_name":"Valentina Torboli","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Alberto Pallavicini","author_inst":"University of Trieste"},{"author_name":"Maurizio Ruscio","author_inst":"Division of Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital Giuliano Isontina (ASU GI), Trieste, Italy"},{"author_name":"PRISCO PISCITELLI","author_inst":"ISBEM"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Miani","author_inst":"Italian Society of Environmental Medicine, SIMA, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Ettore Decanale","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Maria Cristina Vanuzzo","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Francesca Saluzzo","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Francesco Onelia","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Monia Pacenti","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Saverio Parisi","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Giovanni Carretta","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Daniele Donato","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Luciano Flor","author_inst":"Azienda Ospedaliera Padova"},{"author_name":"Silvia Cocchio","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Giulia Masi","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Alessandro Sperduti","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Cattarino","author_inst":"Imperial College London"},{"author_name":"Renato Salvador","author_inst":"University of Padua"},{"author_name":"Katy A.M.
