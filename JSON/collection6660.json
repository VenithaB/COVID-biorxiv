Leptin produced in visceral fat might play a role in the deterioration to mechanical ventilation. A cross sectional study was performed. The mean BMI was 31 kg\/m2 (range 24.8-48.4) for the 31 SARS-CoV-2 ventilated patients and 26 kg\/m2 (range 22.4-33.5) for the 8 controls. SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with a similar BMI as control patients appear to have significantly higher levels of serum leptin. The mean leptin level was 21.2 (6.0-85.2) vs 5.6 (2.4-8.2) ug\/L for SARS-CoV-2 and controls respectively (p=0.0007). With these findings we designed a clinical and biological framework that explains clinical observations. The ACE2 utilization by the virus leads to local pulmonary inflammation due to ACE2-ATII disbalance. This is enhanced by an increase in leptin production induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection of visceral fat. Leptin receptors in the lungs are now more activated to enhance local pulmonary inflammation. This adds to the pre-existent chronic inflammation in obese patients. Visceral fat, lung tissue and leptin production play an interconnecting role. This insight can lead the way to further research and treatment.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Peter van der Voort","author_inst":"UMCG"},{"author_name":"Jill Moser","author_inst":"UMCG"},{"author_name":"Durk F Zandstra","author_inst":"None"},{"author_name":"Anneke C Muller Kobold","author_inst":"UMCG"},{"author_name":"Marjolein Knoester","author_inst":"UMCG"},{"author_name":"Cornelis F Calkhoven","author_inst":"UMCG"},{"author_name":"Inge Hamming","author_inst":"None"},{"author_name":"Matijs van Meurs","author_inst":"UMCG"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"intensive care and critical care medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.29.20085407","rel_title":"Elevated D-Dimer Levels are Associated with Increased Risk of Mortality in COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","rel_date":"2020-05-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.29.20085407","rel_abs":"Introduction. The 2019 novel Coronavirus (2019 nCoV), now declared a pandemic has an overall case fatality of 2 to 3% but it is as high as 50% in critically ill patients. D-dimer is an important prognostic tool, often elevated in patients with severe COVID-19 infection and in those who suffered death. In this systematic review, we aimed to investigate the prognostic role of D-dimer in COVID-19 infected patients. Methods. We searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, Ovid, and Cochrane for studies reporting admission D-dimer levels in COVID-19 patients and its effect on mortality. Results. 18 studies (16 retrospective and 2 prospective) with a total of 3,682 patients met the inclusion criteria. The pooled mean difference (MD) suggested significantly elevated D-dimer levels in patients who died versus those survived (MD 6.13 mg\/L, 95% CI 4.16 to 8.11, p <0.001). Similarly, the pooled mean D-dimer levels were significantly elevated in patients with severe COVID-19 infection (MD 0.54 mg\/L, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.8, p< 0.001). In addition, the risk of mortality was four-fold higher in patients with positive D-dimer vs negative D-dimer (RR 4.11, 95% CI 2.48 to 6.84, p< 0.001) and the risk of developing the severe disease was two-fold higher in patients with positive D-dimer levels vs negative D-dimer (RR 2.04, 95% CI 1.34 to 3.11, p < 0.001). Conclusion. Our meta-analysis demonstrates that patients with COVID-19 presenting with elevated D-dimer levels have an increased risk of severe disease and mortality.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Siddharth Shah","author_inst":"State University of New York, Upstate Medical University"},{"author_name":"Kuldeep Shah","author_inst":"West Virginia University"},{"author_name":"Siddharth B Patel","author_inst":"University of Alabama"},{"author_name":"Forman S Patel","author_inst":"University of Alabama"},{"author_name":"Mohammed Osman","author_inst":"West Virginia University"},{"author_name":"Poonam Velagapudi","author_inst":"University of Nebraska Medical Center"},{"author_name":"Mohit K Turagam","author_inst":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"},{"author_name":"Dhanunjaya Lakkireddy","author_inst":"Kansas City Heart Rhythm Institute and Research Foundation"},{"author_name":"Jalaj Garg","author_inst":"Medical College of Wisconsin"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"cardiovascular medicine"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.30.20086611","rel_title":"Mathematical Model with Social Distancing Parameter for Early Estimation of COVID-19 Spread","rel_date":"2020-05-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.30.20086611","rel_abs":"COVID-19 is well known to everyone in the world.

We conducted a primary survey of 521 adults on April 1-10, 2020 in Iran, where the official infection rate was 0.08%. In our sample, 3% reported being COVID-19 positive and 15% were unsure of their status. This relatively high positive rate enabled us to conduct the analysis at the 5% significance level. At the time of the survey, 44% of the adults worked from home; 26% still went to work in their workplaces; 27% had stopped working due to the COVID-19 pandemic; and 3% were unemployed. Adults who exercised more were more likely to be COVID-19 negative. Each additional hour of exercise per day predicted a 78% increase in the likelihood of being COVID-19 negative. Adults with chronic medical illnesses were 48% more likely to be COVID-19 negative. In terms of work situation, those who worked from home were the most likely to be COVID-19 negative, and those who had stopped working were the most likely to be COVID-19 positive. Individuals in larger organizations were less likely to be COVID-19 positive. Given the testing shortage in many countries, we identify a novel approach to predict the likelihood of COVID-19 infection by a set of personal and work situation characteristics, in order to help to identify individuals with more or less risk of contracting the virus. We hope this research opens a new research avenue to identify the individual risk factors of COVID-19 infection to enable more targeted infectious disease prevention, communication, testing, and control to complement the effort to expand testing capacity.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Stephen X.

We model the global pattern of trajectories of reported COVID-19 cases during the primary response period, with the aim of learning from the past to prepare for the future. Methods: Using Bayesian methods, we analyse the response to the COVID-19 outbreak for 158 countries for the period 22 January to 9 June 2020. This encompasses the period in which many countries imposed a variety of response measures and initial relaxation strategies. Instead of modelling specific intervention types and timings for each country explicitly, we adopt a stochastic epidemiological model including a feedback mechanism on virus transmission to capture complex nonlinear dynamics arising from continuous changes in community behaviour in response to rising case numbers. We analyse the overall effect of interventions and community responses across diverse regions. This approach mitigates explicit consideration of issues such as period of infectivity and public adherence to government restrictions. Results: Countries with the largest cumulative case tallies are characterised by a delayed response, whereas countries that avoid substantial community transmission during the period of study responded quickly. Countries that recovered rapidly also have a higher case identification rate and small numbers of undocumented community transmission at the early stages of the outbreak. We also demonstrate that uncertainty in numbers of undocumented infections dramatically impacts the risk of second waves. Our approach is also effective at pre-empting potential second waves and flare-ups. Conclusions: We demonstrate the utility of modelling to interpret community behaviour in the early epidemic stages. Two lessons learnt that are important for the future are: i) countries that imposed strict containment measures early in the epidemic fared better with respect to numbers of reported cases; and ii) broader testing is required early in the epidemic to understand the magnitude of undocumented infections and recover rapidly. We conclude that clear patterns of containment are essential prior to relaxation of restrictions and show that modelling can provide insights to this end.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"David J.

Design: On-line cross-sectional survey. Setting: Data were collected between 20th and 22nd April. Participants: 6149 participants living in the UK aged 18 years or over. Main outcome measures: Perceived immunity to COVID-19, self-reported adherence to social distancing measures (going out for essential shopping, nonessential shopping, and meeting up with friends\/family; total out-of-home activity), worry about COVID-19 and perceived risk of COVID-19 to oneself and people in the UK. Knowledge that cough and high temperature \/ fever are the main symptoms of COVID-19. Results: In this sample, 1493 people (24.3%) thought they had had COVID-19. Only 245 (4.0%) reported receiving a test result saying they had COVID-19. Reported test results were often incongruent with participants' belief that they had had COVID-19. People who believed that they had had COVID-19 were: more likely to agree that they had some immunity to COVID-19; less likely to report adhering to social distancing measures; less worried about COVID-19; and less likely to know that cough and high temperature \/ fever are two of the most common symptoms of COVID-19. Conclusions: The number of people in the UK who think they have already had COVID-19 is about twice the rate of current prevalence estimates. People who think that they have had COVID-19 may contribute to transmission of the virus through non-adherence to social distancing measures. Clear communications to this growing group are needed to explain why protective measures continue to be important and to encourage sustained adherence.","rel_num_authors":6,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Louise E.

However, assuming that population immunity will build up through the epidemic, it is likely to rebound once these measures are relaxed, possibly leading to a second or multiple repeated lockdowns. In this report, we present results of epidemiological modelling that has helped inform policy making in France. We used a stochastic agent-based microsimulation model of the COVID-19 epidemic in France, and examined the potential impact of post-quarantine measures, including social distancing, mask-wearing, and shielding of the population the most vulnerable to severe COVID-19 infection, on the disease's cumulative incidence and mortality, and on ICU-bed occupancy. The model calibrated well and variation of model parameter values had little impact on outcome estimates. While quarantine is effective in containing the viral spread, it would be unlikely to prevent a rebound of the epidemic once lifted, regardless of its duration. Both social distancing and mask-wearing, although effective in slowing the epidemic and in reducing mortality, would also be ineffective in ultimately preventing the overwhelming of ICUs and a second lockdown. However, these measures coupled with shielding of vulnerable people would be associated with better outcomes, including lower cumulative incidence, mortality, and maintaining an adequate number of ICU beds to prevent a second lockdown. Benefits would nonetheless be markedly reduced if these measures were not applied by most people or not maintained for a sufficiently long period, as herd immunity progressively establishes in the less vulnerable population.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Nicolas Hoertel","author_inst":"AP-HP.Centre and Paris University"},{"author_name":"Martin Blachier","author_inst":"Public Health Expertise"},{"author_name":"Carlos Blanco","author_inst":"National Institute on Drug Abuse"},{"author_name":"Mark Olfson","author_inst":"Columbia University"},{"author_name":"Marc Massetti","author_inst":"Public Health Expertise"},{"author_name":"Marina Sanchez Rico","author_inst":"Universidad Complutense de Madrid"},{"author_name":"Frederic Limosin","author_inst":"AP-HP.Centre and Paris University"},{"author_name":"Henri Leleu","author_inst":"Public Health Expertise"},{"author_name":"Jalaj Garg","author_inst":"Medical College of Wisconsin"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"public and global health"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.29.20085795","rel_title":"Does weather affect the growth rate of COVID-19, a study to comprehend transmission dynamics on human health","rel_date":"2020-05-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.29.20085795","rel_abs":"The undefendable outbreak of novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) lead to a global health emergency due to its higher transmission rate and longer symptomatic duration, created a health surge in a short time.

There is a need for a reproducible and objective method to provide quantitative information for those scores. Purpose - Towards this goal, we present a retrospective study testing the ability of a deep learning algorithm at extracting features from chest x-rays (CXR) to track and predict radiological evolution. Materials and Methods - We trained a repurposed deep learning algorithm on the CheXnet open dataset (224,316 chest X-ray images of 65,240 unique patients) to extract features that mapped to radiological labels. We collected CXRs of COVID-19-positive patients from two open-source datasets (last accessed on April 9, 2020)(Italian Society for Medical and Interventional Radiology and MILA). Data collected form 60 pairs of sequential CXRs from 40 COVID patients (mean age +\/- standard deviation: 56 +\/- 13 years; 23 men, 10 women, seven not reported) and were categorized in three categories: Worse, Stable, or Improved on the basis of radiological evolution ascertained from images and reports. Receiver operating characteristic analyses, Mann-Whitney tests were performed. Results - On patients from the CheXnet dataset, the area under ROC curves ranged from 0.71 to 0.93 for seven imaging features and one diagnosis. Deep learning features between Worse and Improved outcome categories were significantly different for three radiological signs and one diagnostic (Consolidation, Lung Lesion, Pleural Effusion and Pneumonia; all P < 0.05). Features from the first CXR of each pair could correctly predict the outcome category between Worse and Improved cases with 82.7% accuracy. Conclusion - CXR deep learning features show promise for classifying the disease trajectory. Once validated in studies incorporating clinical data and with larger sample sizes, this information may be considered to inform triage decisions.","rel_num_authors":17,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Simon Duchesne","author_inst":"Universite Laval"},{"author_name":"Daniel Gourdeau","author_inst":"Universite Laval"},{"author_name":"Patrick Archambault","author_inst":"Universite Laval"},{"author_name":"Carl Chartrand-Lefebvre","author_inst":"Universite de Montreal"},{"author_name":"Louis Dieumegarde","author_inst":"CERVO Brain Research Center"},{"author_name":"Reza Forghani","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Christian Gagne","author_inst":"Universite Laval"},{"author_name":"Alexandre Hains","author_inst":"Universite Laval"},{"author_name":"David Hornstein","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Huy Le","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Simon Lemieux","author_inst":"Universite Laval"},{"author_name":"Marie-Helene Levesque","author_inst":"Universite Laval"},{"author_name":"Diego Martin","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"Lorne Rosenbloom","author_inst":"McGill University"},{"author_name":"An Tang","author_inst":"Universite de Montreal"},{"author_name":"Fabrizio Vecchio","author_inst":"IRCCS San Raffaele Pisana"},{"author_name":"Nathalie Duchesne","author_inst":"Universite Laval"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"radiology and imaging"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.30.20086090","rel_title":"Incidence of COVID-19 in a cohort of adult and paediatric patients with rheumatic diseases treated with targeted biologic and synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs","rel_date":"2020-05-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.30.20086090","rel_abs":"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the incidence of COVID-19 in a cohort of adult and paediatric patients with rheumatic diseases receiving targeted biologic and synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (tDMARDs) and to explore the possible effect of these treatments in the clinical expression of COVID-19. METHODS: A cross-sectional study comprising of a telephone survey and electronic health records review was performed including all adult and paediatric patients with rheumatic diseases treated with tDMARDs in a large rheumatology tertiary centre in Barcelona, Spain. Demographics, disease activity, COVID-19 related symptoms and contact history data were obtained from the start of the 2020 pandemic. Cumulative incidence of confirmed cases (SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR test) was compared to the population estimates for the same city districts from a governmental COVID-19 health database. Suspected cases were defined following WHO criteria and compared to those without compatible symptoms. RESULTS: 959 patients with rheumatic diseases treated with tDMARDs were included. We identified 11 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in the adult cohort and no confirmed positive cases in the paediatric cohort. All patients had a successful recovery and only one patient required admission in the intensive care unit. When using the same classification criteria (only COVID-19 positive cases with pneumonia), COVID-19 incidence rates of the rheumatic patient cohort were very similar to that of the general population [(0.48% (95% CI 0.09 to 8.65%)] and [0.58% (95% CI 5.62 to 5.99%)], respectively. We found significant differences in tDMARDs proportions between the suspected and non-suspected cases (p=0.002). CONCLUSION: Adult and paediatric patients with rheumatic diseases on tDMARDs do not seem to present a higher risk of COVID-19 or a more severe disease outcome when compared to general population. Our exploratory analysis suggests that the proportion of COVID-19 suspected cases differs between tDMARDs.","rel_num_authors":20,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Xabier Michelena","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Helena Borrell","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mireia Lopez-Corbeto","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maria Lopez-Lasanta","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Estefania Moreno","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Maria Pascual-Pastor","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Alba Erra","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mayte Serrat","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Esther Espartal","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Susana Anton","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Gustavo A Anez","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Raquel Caparros-Ruiz","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Andrea Pluma","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Ernesto Trallero-Araguas","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Mireia Barcelo-Bru","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Miriam Almirall","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Juan Jose De Agustin","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jordi Llados","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Antonio Julia","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sara Marsal","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"rheumatology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.30.20086462","rel_title":"Kidney Allograft Recipients Diagnosed with Coronavirus Disease-2019: A Single Center Report","rel_date":"2020-05-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.30.20086462","rel_abs":"Background: Organ graft recipients receiving immunosuppressive therapy are likely to be at heighted risk for the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) and adverse outcomes including death. It is therefore important to characterize the clinical course and outcome of Covid-19 in this vulnerable population and identify therapeutic strategies that are safe. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of 54 adult kidney transplant patients diagnosed with Covid-19 and managed in New York State, the epicenter of Covid-19 pandemic. The patients were evaluated by video visits, phone interviews, or in the Emergency Room for respiratory illness symptoms consistent with Covid-19 from March 13, 2020 to April 20, 2020. Characteristics of the patients were stratified by hospitalization status and disease severity. Clinical course including alterations in immunosuppressive therapy were retrieved from their electronic medical records. Primary outcomes included recovery from Covid-19 symptoms, acute kidney injury, graft failure, and case fatality rate. Results: Of the 54 SARS-Cov-2 positive kidney transplant recipients, 39 with moderate to severe symptoms were admitted and 15 with mild symptoms were managed at home. Hospitalized patients compared to non-hospitalized patients were more likely to be male, of Hispanic ethnicity, and to have cardiovascular disease. At baseline, all but 2 were receiving tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and 32 were on a steroid free immunosuppression regimen. Tacrolimus dosage was reduced in 46% of hospitalized patients and maintained at baseline level in the non-hospitalized cohort. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) dosage was maintained at the baseline dosage in 11% of hospitalized patients and 64% of non-hospitalized patients, and was stopped in 61% hospitalized patients and 0% in the non-hospitalized cohort. Azithromycin or doxycycline were prescribed at a similar rate among hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients (38% vs. 40%). Hydroxychloroquine was prescribed in 79% of hospitalized patients and only one of 15 non-hospitalized patients. Acute kidney injury occurred in 51% of hospitalized patients. Patients with severe disease were more likely to have elevations in inflammatory biomarkers at presentation. At a median of 21 days follow up, 67% of patients have had their symptoms resolved or improved and 33% have persistent symptoms. Graft failure requiring hemodialysis occurred in 3 of 39 hospitalized patients (8%). Three of 39 (8%) hospitalized patients expired and none of the 15 non-hospitalized patients expired. Conclusions: Clinical presentation of Covid-19 in kidney transplant recipients was similar to what has been described in the general population. The case fatality rate in our entire cohort of 54 kidney transplant recipients was reassuringly low and patients with mild symptomology could be successfully managed at home. Data from the pilot study suggest that a strategy of systematic screening and triage to inpatient or outpatient care, close monitoring, and judicious use of immunosuppressive drugs rather than cessation is beneficial.","rel_num_authors":15,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Michelle Lubetzky","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian, Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Meredith Aull","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Rebecca Craig-Shapiro","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Jun Lee","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian"},{"author_name":"John Lee","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Samuel Sultan","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Jehon Marku-Podvorica","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Laura Gingras","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Rosy Priya Kodiyanplakkal","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Choli Hartono","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian"},{"author_name":"Stuart Saal","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian"},{"author_name":"Thangamani Muthukumar","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Sandip Kapur","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Manikkam Suthanthiran","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Darshana Dadhania","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Miriam Almirall","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Juan Jose De Agustin","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jordi Llados","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Antonio Julia","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sara Marsal","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"transplantation"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.30.20086447","rel_title":"Evaluation of effects of public health interventions on COVID-19 transmission for Pakistan: A mathematical simulation study","rel_date":"2020-05-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.30.20086447","rel_abs":"Background: In an effort to contain the COVID-19 epidemic, many governments across the world have enforced lockdown or social distancing measures. Several outbreak models have been developed to investigate the effects of different public health strategies for COVID-19, but they have not been developed for Pakistan and other South East Asian countries, where a large proportion of global population resides. Methods: We developed a stochastic individual contact model by extending the widely-used Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) compartment model with additional compartments to model both anticipated mitigating effects of public health intervention strategies for Pakistan. We estimated the projected spread, number of hospitalizations, and case fatalities under no intervention and four increasingly stringent public health strategies of social distancing and self-isolation at the national and provincial levels of Pakistan. Results: Our analysis shows that without any public health interventions the expected number of cumulative case fatalities is 671,596 in Pakistan with the virus is expected to peak in terms of the number of required ICU-hospitalizations at 198,593 persons by the end of the June 2020. The estimated total numbers of cumulative case fatalities are lower for other public health strategies with strict social distancing showing the lowest number of deaths at 1,588 (Self-isolation: n=341,359; Flexible social distancing strategy: n=3,995; and Exit strategy: n=28,214). The lowest number of required ICU-hospitalization is also estimated for strict social distancing strategy (n=266 persons at the end of May 2020). Generally, the simulated effects of the different public health strategies at the provincial-level were similar to the national-level with strict social distancing showing the fewest number of case fatalities and ICU-hospitalizations. Conclusion: Our results indicate that case fatalities and ICU-hospitalizations for Pakistan will be high without any public health interventions. While strict social distancing can potentially prevent a large number of deaths and ICU-hospitalizations, the government faces an important dilemma of potentially severe economic downfall. Consideration of a temporary strict social distancing strategy with gradual return of the lower-risk Pakistani population, as simulated in our exit strategy scenario, may an effective compromise between public health and economy of Pakistani population.","rel_num_authors":8,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Zulfiqar A Bhutta","author_inst":"Aga Khan University"},{"author_name":"Ofir Harari","author_inst":"Cytel Inc"},{"author_name":"Jay JH Park","author_inst":"University of British Columbia"},{"author_name":"Noor Zannat","author_inst":"Cytel Inc"},{"author_name":"Michael Zoratti","author_inst":"McMaster University"},{"author_name":"Timothy Churches","author_inst":"South Western Sydney Clinical School, UNSW Medicine"},{"author_name":"Kristian Thorlund","author_inst":"Cytel Inc"},{"author_name":"Edward J Mills","author_inst":"Cytel Inc"},{"author_name":"Rosy Priya Kodiyanplakkal","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Choli Hartono","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian"},{"author_name":"Stuart Saal","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian"},{"author_name":"Thangamani Muthukumar","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Sandip Kapur","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Manikkam Suthanthiran","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Darshana Dadhania","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Miriam Almirall","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Juan Jose De Agustin","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jordi Llados","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Antonio Julia","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sara Marsal","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"health policy"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.30.20086553","rel_title":"Social Media Platforms for Health Communication and Research in the Face of COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross Sectional Survey in Uganda.","rel_date":"2020-05-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.30.20086553","rel_abs":"Objectives: (1) To examine the usage of social media and other forms of media among medical students (MS) and healthcare professionals (HCPs) in Uganda. (2) To assess the perceived usefulness of social media and other forms of media for COVID-19 public health campaigns. Design: A descriptive WhatsApp messenger-based cross-sectional survey in April 2020. Setting: Makerere University Teaching Hospitals (MUTH) and 9 of the 10 medical schools in Uganda. Participants: HCPs at MUTH and MS in the 9 medical schools in Uganda. Main outcome measures: We collected data on sociodemographic characteristics, sources of information on COVID-19, preferences of social media platform and perceived usefulness of the different media platforms for acquisition of knowledge on COVID-19. Results: Overall, response rate was 21.5% for both MS and HCPs. In total, 877 (HCPS [136, 15.5%], MS [741, 85.5%]) were studied. Majority (n=555, 63.3%) were male with a median age of 24 (range: 18-66) years. Social media was a source of information for 665 (75.8%) participants. Usage was similar among MS and HCPs (565\/741 (76.2%) vs. 100\/136 (73.5%), p=0.5). Among the MS, commonly used social media were: WhatsApp (n=705, 95.1%) Facebook (n=405, 54.8%), Twitter (n=290, 39.1%), Instagram (n=178, 24.0) and Telegram (n=80, 10.8%). Except for WhatsApp, male MS we more likely to use the other social media platforms (p= <0.001 to 0.01). Mass media (television and radio) and social media were preferred the most useful tools for dissemination of COVID-19 related information. Conclusion: More than two-thirds of MS and HCPs are routinely using social media in Uganda. Social media platforms may be used for dissemination of information as well as a research tool among MS and HCPs. Social media alongside other media platforms can also be used as sources of reliable information on COVID-19 as well as for dissemination of research findings and guidelines.","rel_num_authors":2,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Ronald Olum","author_inst":"College of Health Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda."},{"author_name":"Felix Bongomin","author_inst":"1.

This increase was observed in patients with mild symptoms and not further augmented in patients with severe symptoms. In patients who recovered, CEPs decreased, but were in a range still significantly higher than normal controls. Regarding mature CECs, in Covid-19 patients their absolute number was similar to those observed in healthy controls, but the viable\/apoptotic CEC ratio was significantly different. Both mild and severe Covid-19 patients had significantly more viable CECs compared to healthy controls. Patients who recovered had significantly less CECs\/mL when compared to controls as well as to mild and severe Covid-19 patients. A positive correlation was found between the copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the cellular fraction and apoptotic CEPs\/mL in severe Covid-19 patients.

A report from April 29 revealed 1.26 million confirmed cases and 125 928 deaths in Europe. This study proposed a novel deep neural network framework, COVID-19Net, which parallelly combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) and bidirectional gated recurrent units (GRUs). Three European countries with severe outbreaks were studied Germany, Italy, and Spain to extract spatiotemporal feature and predict the number of confirmed cases. The prediction results acquired from COVID-19Net were compared to those obtained using a CNN, GRU, and CNN-GRU. The mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, and root mean square error, which are commonly used model assessment indices, were used to compare the accuracy of the models. The results verified that COVID-19Net was notably more accurate than the other models. The mean absolute percentage error generated by COVID-19Net was 1.447 for Germany, 1.801 for Italy, and 2.828 for Spain, which were considerably lower than those of the other models. This indicated that the proposed framework can accurately predict the accumulated number of confirmed cases in the three countries and serve as a crucial reference for devising public health strategies.","rel_num_authors":4,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Chiou-Jye Huang","author_inst":"Jiangxi University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Yamin Shen","author_inst":"Jiangxi University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Ping-Huan Kuo","author_inst":"National Pingtung University"},{"author_name":"Yung-Hsiang Chen","author_inst":"National Pingtung University of Science and Technology"},{"author_name":"Paola Cremonesi","author_inst":"European Institute of Oncology"},{"author_name":"Jessica Quarna","author_inst":"European Institute of Oncology"},{"author_name":"Sonia Caccia","author_inst":"Sacco Hospital"},{"author_name":"Chiara Cogliati","author_inst":"Sacco Hospital"},{"author_name":"Francesco Bertolini","author_inst":"European Institute of Oncology"},{"author_name":"Choli Hartono","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian"},{"author_name":"Stuart Saal","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian"},{"author_name":"Thangamani Muthukumar","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Sandip Kapur","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Manikkam Suthanthiran","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Darshana Dadhania","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Miriam Almirall","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Juan Jose De Agustin","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jordi Llados","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Antonio Julia","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sara Marsal","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"infectious diseases"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.05.20075507","rel_title":"Clinical and Genetic Characteristics of Covid-19 Patients from UK Biobank","rel_date":"2020-05-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.05.20075507","rel_abs":"We conducted an analysis of 669 Covid-19 positive patients within the UK Biobank cohort, a prospective cohort including over 500,000 participants.

METHODS: The literature exploration lasted up to 18 April 2020 and through PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library we have identified 10 pertinent publications. To paraphrase the outcomes of autonomous researches, we have performed a random-effect meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 2272 patients' information was extracted from the selected literature. We have found sex (male) (Risk ratio [RR] =1.29 [1.07; 1.54]), hypertension (RR=1.79 [1.57; 2.04]), diabetes (RR=1.57 [1.25; 1.98]), fatigue or myalgia (RR=1.17 [1.02; 1.35]), and smoking history (RR=1.71 [1.25; 2.35]) are potential risk factors for the severity of COVID-19. We found fever (RR=1.21 [0.66 to 2.22]), cough ([1.13,[0.98 to 1.30]), and diarrhea (RR=1.14 [0.93 to 1.40]) as insignificant risk factors for COVID-19 severity.

with COVID-19 have demonstrated markedly dysregulated coagulation and a high risk of morbid arterial and venous thrombotic events. While elevated levels of blood neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been described in patients with COVID-19, their potential role in COVID-19-associated thrombosis remains unknown. Objectives: To elucidate the potential role of hyperactive neutrophils and NET release in COVID-19-associated thrombosis. Patients\/Methods: This is a retrospective, case-control study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who developed thrombosis (n=11), as compared with gender- and age-matched COVID-19 patients without clinical thrombosis (n=33). In addition to capturing clinical data, we measured remnants of NETs (cell-free DNA, myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes, and citrullinated histone H3) and neutrophil-derived S100A8\/A9 (calprotectin) in patient sera. Results: The majority of patients (9\/11) were receiving at least prophylactic doses of heparinoids at the time thrombosis was diagnosed. As compared with controls, patients with COVID-19-associated thrombosis had significantly higher blood levels of markers of NETs (cell-free DNA, myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes, citrullinated histone H3) and neutrophil activation (calprotectin). The thrombosis group also had higher levels of D-dimer, CRP, ferritin, and platelets, but not troponin or neutrophils. Finally, there were strong associations between markers of hyperactive neutrophils (calprotectin and cell-free DNA) and D-dimer. Conclusion: Elevated levels of neutrophil activation and NET formation in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 are associated with higher risk of morbid thrombotic complications. These observations underscore the need for urgent investigation into the potential relationship between NETs and unrelenting thrombosis in COVID-19.","rel_num_authors":11,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Yu Zuo","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Melanie Zuo","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Srilakshmi Yalavarthi","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Kelsey Gockman","author_inst":"University of Michigan"},{"author_name":"Jacqueline A.

The objective of this study was to compare concerns about COVID-19 among individuals undergoing cancer treatment to those with a history of cancer not currently receiving therapy and to those without a cancer history. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional anonymous online survey study of adults currently residing in the United States. Participants were recruited over a one-week period (April 3-11, 2020) using promoted advertisements on Facebook and Twitter. Groups were compared using chi-squared tests, Fisher's exact tests, and t-tests. Results 543 respondents from 47 states provided information on their cancer history and were included in analyses. Participants receiving active treatment reported greater concern about coronavirus infection (p<0.0001), higher levels of family distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic (p=0.004), and greater concern that the general public does not adequately understand the seriousness of COVID-19 (p=0.04). Those with metastatic disease were more likely to indicate that COVID-19 had negatively affected their cancer care compared to patients with non-metastatic cancer (50.8% vs. 31.0%; p=0.02). The most commonly reported treatment modifications included chemotherapy delays. Conclusions Patients undergoing active treatment for cancer were most concerned about the short-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the logistics as well as potential efficacy of ongoing cancer treatment, longer term effects, and overarching societal concerns that the population at large is not as concerned about the public health implications of the coronavirus.","rel_num_authors":12,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Emil Lou","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Deanna Teoh","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Katherine Brown","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Anne Blaes","author_inst":"University of Minnesota"},{"author_name":"Shernan G.

Worldwide, more than 130 countries have imposed severe restrictions, which form part of a set of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI)s. We aimed to quantify the country-specific effects of these NPIs and compare them using the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) stringency index, p, as a measure of NPI stringency. Methods We developed a dual latent\/observable Susceptible Infected Recovered Deaths (SIRD) model and applied it on each of 22 countries and 25 states in the US using publicly available data. The observable model parameters were extracted using kernel functions. The regression of the transmission rate, {beta}, as a function of p in each locale was modeled through the intervention leverage, s, an initial transmission rate, {beta}0 and a typical adjustment time, br-1. Results The world average for the intervention leverage, s=0.01 (95% CI 0.0102 - 0.0112) had an ensemble standard deviation of 0.0017 (95% C.I. 0.0014 - 0.0021), strongly indicating a universal behavior. Discussion Our study indicates that removing NPIs too swiftly will result in the resurgence of the spread within one to two months, in alignment with the current WHO recommendations. Moreover, we have quantified and are able to predict the effect of various combinations of NPIs. There is a minimum NPI level, below which leads to resurgence of the outbreak (in the absence of pharmaceutical and clinical advances). For the epidemic to remain sub-critical, the rate with which the intervention leverage s increases should outpace that of the relaxation of NPIs.","rel_num_authors":13,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Jacques Naude","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Bruce Mellado","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Joshua Choma","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Fabio Correa","author_inst":"Rhodes University"},{"author_name":"Salah Dahbi","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Barry Dwolatzky","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Leslie Dwolatzky","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Kentaro Hayasi","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Benjamin Lieberman","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Caroline Maslo","author_inst":"Netcare"},{"author_name":"Kgomotso Monnakgotla","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Xifeng Ruan","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Finn Stevenson","author_inst":"University of the Witwatersrand"},{"author_name":"Manikkam Suthanthiran","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Darshana Dadhania","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Miriam Almirall","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Juan Jose De Agustin","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jordi Llados","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Antonio Julia","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sara Marsal","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","category":"epidemiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.04.30.20086199","rel_title":"A non-parametric mathematical model to investigate the dynamic of a pandemic","rel_date":"2020-05-05","rel_site":"medRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/medrxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.04.30.20086199","rel_abs":"Populations are diverse in size, capacity response, and measures to contain a pandemic such covid19.

Controlling for population size, we found more viral infections in those areas afflicted by high PM 2.5 and Nitrogen Dioxide values. Higher mortality was also correlated with relatively poor air quality. In Italy, the correspondence between the Po valley pollution and SARS-CoV-2 infections and induced mortality was the starkest, originating right in the most polluted European area.

Mortality depends on two factors: the case fatality rate and the case incidence. We combine a cohort-based model that determines case fatality rates along with a modified logistic model that evaluates the case incidence to determine the number of deaths in all the US states over time; the model is also able to include the impact of interventions. Both models yield exceptional goodness-of-fit. The model predicted a range of death outcomes (79k to 246k) all of which are considerably greater than the figures presented in mainstream media.

Moreover, whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of isolated strains was performed. Raw wastewater samples resulted positive to PCR amplification, while treated water samples were always negative (four and two samples, respectively, sampled in two dates). Moreover, the rate of positivity in raw wastewater samples decreased after eight days, in congruence with the epidemiological trend estimated for the interested provinces. Virus infectiveness was always not significant, indicating the effectiveness of wastewater treatments, or the natural decay of viral vitality, which implied the absence of significant risk of infection from wastewaters. Samples from receiving rivers (two sites, sampled in the same dates as wastewaters) showed in some cases a positivity to PCR amplification, probably due to non-treated discharges, or the combined sewage overflows. Nevertheless, also for rivers vitality was negligible, indicating the absence of sanitary risks.

The diversity, distribution, and host associations of bat CoVs were investigated to assess their potential for zoonotic transmission. Phylogenetic, network, and principal coordinate analysis confirmed the classification of betacoronaviruses (BetaCoVs) into five groups (2A to 2E) and a potentially novel group, with further division of 2D into five subgroups. The genetic co-clustering of BetaCoVs among closely related bats reflects host taxon-specificity with each bat family as the host for a specific BetaCoV group, potentially a natural barrier against random transmission. The divergent pathway of BetaCoV and host evolution suggests that the viruses were introduced just prior to bat dispersal and speciation. As such, deviant patterns were observed such as for 2D-IV, wherein cross-taxon transmission due to overlap in bat habitats and geographic range among genetically divergent African bat hosts could have played a strong role on their shared CoV lineages. In fact, a few bat taxa especially the subfamily Pteropodinae were shown to host diverse groups of BetaCoVs. Therefore, ecological imbalances that disturb bat distribution may lead to loss of host specificity through cross-taxon transmission and multi-CoV infection. Hence, initiatives that minimize the destruction of wildlife habitats and limit wildlife-livestock-human interfaces are encouraged to help maintain the natural state of bat BetaCoVs in the wild.\n\nImportanceBat Betacoronaviruses (BetaCoVs) pose a significant threat to global public health and have been implicated in several epidemics such as the recent pandemic by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Here, we show that bat BetaCoVs are predominantly host-specific, which could be a natural barrier against infection of other host types. However, a strong overlap in bat habitat and geographic range may facilitate viral transmission to unrelated hosts, and a few bat families have already been shown to host multi-CoV variants. We predict that continued disturbances on the ecological balance may eventually lead to loss of host specificity. When combined with enhanced wildlife-livestock-human interfaces, spillover to humans may be further facilitated. We should therefore start to define the ecological mechanisms surrounding zoonotic events. Global surveillance should be expanded and strengthened to assess the complete picture of bat coronavirus diversity and distribution and their potential to cause spillover infections.","rel_num_authors":9,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Lyre Espada Murao","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Mindanao"},{"author_name":"Michael G Bacus","author_inst":"Philippine Genome Center Mindanao"},{"author_name":"Stephen Adrian H Dayap","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Mindanao"},{"author_name":"Nikki Vanesa T Tampon","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Mindanao"},{"author_name":"Marielle M Udarbe","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Mindanao"},{"author_name":"Roberto P Puentespina Jr.","author_inst":"Animal Solutions Veterinary Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sharon Yvette Angelina M Villanueva","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Manila"},{"author_name":"Aleyla E de Cadiz","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Mindanao"},{"author_name":"Marion John Michael M Achondo","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Mindanao"},{"author_name":"Francesca Romeri","author_inst":"Laboratorio di Microbiologia Clinica, Virologia e Diagnostica delle Bioemergenze, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Cristina Pagani","author_inst":"Laboratorio di Microbiologia Clinica, Virologia e Diagnostica delle Bioemergenze, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Moja","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences for Health, University of Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Maria Rita Gismondo","author_inst":"Laboratorio di Microbiologia Clinica, Virologia e Diagnostica delle Bioemergenze, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Franco Salerno","author_inst":"Water Research Institute-National Research Council (IRSA-CNR), Brugherio (MB), Italy"},{"author_name":"Darshana Dadhania","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Miriam Almirall","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Juan Jose De Agustin","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jordi Llados","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Antonio Julia","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sara Marsal","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_no","type":"confirmatory results","category":"evolutionary biology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.04.077826","rel_title":"Alpha 1 Antitrypsin is an Inhibitor of the SARS-CoV2-Priming Protease TMPRSS2","rel_date":"2020-05-05","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.04.077826","rel_abs":"Host proteases have been suggested to be crucial for dissemination of MERS, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses, but the relative contribution of membrane versus intracellular proteases remains controversial. Transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is regarded as one of the main proteases implicated in the coronavirus S protein priming, an important step for binding of the S protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor before cell entry. The main cellular location where the SARS-CoV-2 S protein priming occurs remains debatable, therefore hampering the development of targeted treatments. Herein, we identified the human extracellular serine protease inhibitor (serpin) alpha 1 antitrypsin (A1AT) as a novel TMPRSS2 inhibitor. Structural modeling revealed that A1AT docked to an extracellular domain of TMPRSS2 in a conformation that is suitable for catalysis, resembling similar serine protease-inhibitor complexes. Inhibitory activity of A1AT was established in a SARS-CoV-2 viral load system. Notably, plasma A1AT levels were associated with COVID-19 disease severity. Our data support the key role of extracellular serine proteases in SARS-CoV-2 infections and indicate that treatment with serpins, particularly the FDA-approved drug A1AT, may be effective in limiting SARS-CoV-2 dissemination by affecting the surface of the host cells.\n\nSummaryDelivery of extracellular serine protease inhibitors (serpins) such as A1AT has the capacity to reduce SARS-CoV-2 dissemination by binding and inhibiting extracellular proteases on the host cells, thus, inhibiting the first step in SARS-CoV-2 cell cycle (i.e. cell entry).","rel_num_authors":7,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Victoria Callahan","author_inst":"National Center for Biodefense and Infectious Diseases, School of Systems Biology, George Mason University, Manassas, Virginia, United States of America"},{"author_name":"Ivan V Akhrymuk","author_inst":"National Center for Biodefense and Infectious Diseases, School of Systems Biology, George Mason University, Manassas, Virginia, United States of America"},{"author_name":"Katarina Elez","author_inst":"Freie Universitat Berlin, Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Lluis Raich","author_inst":"Freie Universitat Berlin, Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Justin L Benoit","author_inst":"Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA"},{"author_name":"Frank Noe","author_inst":"Freie Universitat Berlin, Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Berlin, Germany"},{"author_name":"Kylene Kehn-Hall","author_inst":"National Center for Biodefense and Infectious Diseases, School of Systems Biology, George Mason University, Manassas, Virginia, United States of America"},{"author_name":"Aleyla E de Cadiz","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Mindanao"},{"author_name":"Marion John Michael M Achondo","author_inst":"University of the Philippines Mindanao"},{"author_name":"Francesca Romeri","author_inst":"Laboratorio di Microbiologia Clinica, Virologia e Diagnostica delle Bioemergenze, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Cristina Pagani","author_inst":"Laboratorio di Microbiologia Clinica, Virologia e Diagnostica delle Bioemergenze, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Lorenzo Moja","author_inst":"Department of Biomedical Sciences for Health, University of Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Maria Rita Gismondo","author_inst":"Laboratorio di Microbiologia Clinica, Virologia e Diagnostica delle Bioemergenze, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy"},{"author_name":"Franco Salerno","author_inst":"Water Research Institute-National Research Council (IRSA-CNR), Brugherio (MB), Italy"},{"author_name":"Darshana Dadhania","author_inst":"New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell"},{"author_name":"Miriam Almirall","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Juan Jose De Agustin","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Jordi Llados","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Antonio Julia","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"},{"author_name":"Sara Marsal","author_inst":"Rheumatology Research Group, Vall Hebron Research Institute, Vall Hebron University Hospital"}],"version":"1","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","type":"new results","category":"microbiology"},{"rel_doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.04.075291","rel_title":"Baseline pulmonary levels of CD8+ T cells and NK cells inversely correlate with expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2","rel_date":"2020-05-05","rel_site":"bioRxiv","rel_link":"https:\/\/biorxiv.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/2020.05.04.075291","rel_abs":"COVID-19 is caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and currently has detrimental human health, community and economic impacts around the world. It is unclear why some SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals remain asymptomatic, while others develop severe symptoms. Baseline pulmonary levels of anti-viral leukocytes, already residing in the lung prior to infection, may orchestrate an effective early immune response and prevent severe symptoms. Using \"in silico flow cytometry\", we deconvoluted the levels of all seven types of anti-viral leukocytes in 1,927 human lung tissues. Baseline levels of CD8+ T cells, resting NK cells and activated NK cells, as well as cytokines that recruit these, are significantly lower in lung tissues with high expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2. We observe this in univariate analyses, in multivariate analyses, and in two independent datasets. Relevantly, ACE2 mRNA and protein levels very strongly correlate in human cells and tissues. Above findings also largely apply to the SARS-CoV-2 entry protease TMPRSS2. Both SARS-CoV-2-infected lung cells and COVID-19 lung tissues show upregulation of CD8+ T cell- and NK cell-recruiting cytokines. Moreover, tissue-resident CD8+ T cells and inflammatory NK cells are significantly more abundant in bronchoalveolar lavages from mildly affected COVID-19 patients, compared to severe cases. This suggests that these lymphocytes are important for preventing severe symptoms. Elevated ACE2 expression increases sensitivity to coronavirus infection. Thus, our results suggest that some individuals may be exceedingly susceptible to develop severe COVID-19 due to concomitant high pre-existing ACE2 and TMPRSS expression and low baseline cytotoxic lymphocyte levels in the lung.","rel_num_authors":1,"rel_authors":[{"author_name":"Pascal H.
